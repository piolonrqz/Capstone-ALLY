{"contents": [{"role": "user", "parts": [{"text": "What is the irrevocability rule in tax overpayment options?"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "The irrevocability rule applies only to the carry-over option. Once the option to carry-over and apply excess quarterly income taxes paid against income tax due for taxable quarters of succeeding taxable years has been made, such option shall be considered irrevocable for that taxable period and no application for cash refund or issuance of tax credit certificate shall be allowed. However, a taxpayer who originally opted for refund or tax credit certificate may shift to carry-over, but once shifted, may no longer revert to the original choice."}]}]}
