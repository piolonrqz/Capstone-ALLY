"G.R. No. 266310, July 31, 2024","PHILIPPINE INSTITUTE OF PETROLEUM, INC., ISLA LPG CORPORATION, PTT PHILIPPINES CORPORATION AND TOTAL (PHILIPPINES) CORPORATION, PETITIONERS, VS. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY, RESPONDENT.","On February 10, 1998, Republic Act No. 8479, or the Downstream Oil Industry Deregulation Act of 1998, was approved to ""liberalize and deregulate the downstream oil industry in order to ensure a truly competitive market under a regime of fair prices, adequate and continuous supply of environmentally-clean and high quality petroleum products.""[9] Republic Act No. 8479, particularly Section 14 thereof, granted the DOE the power to monitor and publish daily international crude oil prices, and to follow the movement of domestic oil prices. Further, the DOE Secretary was given additional powers under Sec. 15 in connection with the enforcement of Republic Act No. 8479.

Pursuant to Republic Act No. 8479, the DOE issued Department Circular No. DC2019-05-0008, or the Revised Guidelines for the Monitoring of Prices in the Sale of Petroleum Products by the Downstream Oil Industry in the Philippines (DC2019-05-0008), which requires, among others, oil companies to submit a report to the Oil Industry Management Bureau (OIMB), containing the detailed computation with corresponding explanation and supporting documents on unbundled items comprising the Oil Company Price, as provided in the prescribed format therein.[10]

On June 21, 2019, PIP, an association of businesses operating in the downstream oil industry, together with Isla, PTT, and TPC, companies which are engaged in the business of petroleum products, then filed a Petition for Declaratory Relief with Application for Temporary Restraining Order and Writ of Preliminary Injunction before the RTC of Makati City, Branch 58.[11]

PIP et al. alleged that DC2019-05-0008 violated their rights and is contrary to Republic Act No. 8479 because: (1) Articles II, IV, and V thereof are forms of price control, and contrary to the policy of full deregulation of the downstream oil industry; (2) Articles II, IV, and V impose impossible requirements on oil companies and other related parties; (3) Articles II, IV, and V do not find support in Republic Act No. 8479, particularly with respect to its anti-trust provisions, with the passage of Republic Act No. 10667; and, (4) DC2019-05-0008 affects PIP et al. and other entities' right to a truly competitive market, and their right against disclosure of their trade secrets and/or privileged or confidential information. Essentially, PIP et al. claimed that DC2019-05-0008 is an ultra vires act of the DOE and prayed that it be declared invalid in its entirety. Moreover, they also prayed for the issuance of a temporary restraining order (TRO) and a writ of preliminary injunction against the DOE.[12]

On June 27, 2019, the RTC conducted the hearing on the application for TRO.[13] In its Order dated June 28, 2019, the RTC granted PIP et al.'s application and ordered the DOE not to enforce DC2019-05-0008 for a period of 20 days from the date of the issuance of the said Order.[14]

Subsequently, on July 12, 2019, PIP et al. filed an Amended Petition for Declaratory Relief with Application for TRO and Writ of Preliminary Injunction.[15] On July 15, 2019, the RTC proceeded to hear the application for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction.[16]","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] assailing the Decision[2] and the Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 164764, which partly granted the Petition for Certiorari[4] filed by the Department of Energy (DOE). In so ruling, the CA reversed and set aside the Resolution[5] dated August 14, 2019 and the Order[6] dated December 3, 2019 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Makati City, Branch 58, insofar as the same granted the application for the issuance of a writ of preliminary junction of Philippine Institute of Petroleum, Inc. (PIP), Isla LPG Corporation (Isla), PTT Philippines Corporation (PTT), and Total Philippines Corporation (TPC) (collectively, PIP et al.).[7] Further, the CA affirmed the RTC's order for the non-dismissal of the main case for the DOE's failure to establish forum shopping and litis pendentia.[8]","The Petition is unmeritorious.

A writ of preliminary injunction is a preservative remedy for the protection of substantial rights and interests. It is not a cause of action itself, but a mere provisional remedy adjunct to a main suit. The purpose of injunction is to prevent threatened or continuous irremediable injury to the parties before their claims can be thoroughly studied, and its sole aim is to preserve the status quo until the merits of the case are fully heard.[33]

The Rules of Court, Rule 58, Sec. 1 provides that a preliminary injunction may be granted by the court at any stage of an action or proceeding prior to the judgment or final order requiring a party or a court, agency. or a person to refrain from a particular act or acts; it may also require the performance of a particular act or acts, in which case it shall be known as a preliminary mandatory injunction. It may be issued when any of the following grounds are established:

(a) That the applicant is entitled to the relief demanded, and the whole or part of such relief consists in restraining the commission or continuance of the act or acts complained of, or in requiring the performance of an act or acts either for a limited period or perpetually;

(b) That the commission, continuance or non-performance of the act or acts complained of during the litigation would probably work injustice to the applicant; or

(c) That a party, court, agency or a person is doing, threatening, or is attempting to do, or is procuring or suffering to be done some act or acts probably in violation of the rights of the applicant respecting the subject of the action or proceeding, and tending to render the judgment ineffectual.[34]

To be entitled to the issuance of an injunctive writ, the following requisites must be present: (a) the applicant must have a clear and unmistakable right to be protected, that is a right in esse; (b) there is a material and substantial invasion of such right; (c) there is an urgent need for the writ to prevent irreparable injury to the applicant; and, (d) no other ordinary, speedy, and adequate remedy exist to prevent the infliction of irreparable injury.[35]

As will be discussed below, the Court finds that the said requisites were not met in the present case.

PIP et al. have no clear and unmistakable right
In Sumifru (Philippines) Corp. v. Spouses Cereño,[36] the Court had the opportunity to discuss the concept of a clear and unmistakable right that may protected by a writ of preliminary injunction, to wit:

A writ of preliminary injunction, being an extraordinary event, one deemed as a strong arm of equity or a transcendent remedy, must be granted only in the face of injury to actual and existing substantial rights. A right to be protected by injunction means a right clearly founded on or granted by law or is enforceable as a matter of law. An injunction is not a remedy to protect or enforce contingent, abstract, or future rights; it will not issue to protect a right not in esse, and which may never arise, or to restrain an act which does not give rise to a cause of action. When the complainant's right is doubtful or disputed, he does not have a clear legal right and, therefore, injunction is not proper. While it is not required that the right claimed by the applicant, as basis for seeking injunctive relief, be conclusively established, it is still necessary to show, at least tentatively, that the right exists and is not vitiated by any substantial challenge or contradiction.[37] (Citations omitted)

Here, PIP et al. primarily anchor their claim of a right in esse based on Republic Act No. 8479, Sec. 2, which provides for the full deregulation of the downstream oil industry:[38]","ACCORDINGLY, the instant Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED. The Decision dated October 3, 2022, and the Resolution dated March 3, 2023, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 164764 are AFFIRMED."
"G.R. No. 242296, July 31, 2024","PHILIPPINE CONTRACTORS ACCREDITATION BOARD, PETITIONER, VS. CENTRAL MINDANAO CONSTRUCTION MULTI-PURPOSE COOPERATIVE REP. BY ITS CHAIRMAN NOEL O. GASCON AND HARRY M. LUSTERIO, RESPONDENTS.","In a Complaint[5] dated November 24, 2012 filed before the RTC, respondent Central Mindanao Construction Multi-Purpose Cooperative (CMCM Cooperative), alleged as follows:
1. That Plaintiffs [sic] is a duly organized service cooperative duly registered with the Cooperative Development Authority under Certificate of Registration/Confirmation No. RN-2608-KEO dated November 11, 1996[,] has complied with all the requirements of the authority for issuance of Certificate of Registration under Article 144 of R.A. 9520[,] otherwise known as the ""Philippine Cooperative Code of 2008""[,] and is represented in this action by its Chairman of the Board, Noel P. Gascon and Authorized Managing Officer, Dr. Harry M. Lusterio...;

2. That Respondent Philippine Contractors Accreditation Board (PCAB) is an agency of the Department of Trade and Industries [sic] under the Construction [Industry] Authority of the Philippines...;

3. That plaintiff[,] which is a service multi-purpose cooperative with Good Standing. . .[,] was organized characterized [sic] by mason[s], carpenters, small contractors and entrepreneur[s], who can not compete nor intent to compete with the big construction companies such as those owned, operated and managed by officers connected with respondent PCAB...;

4. That[,] having complied with all the requirements for licensure and in accordance with R.A. 4566, as amended[,] and its Implementing Rules and Regulations, plaintiff was issued a Contractor's License from October 21, 1997 up to the present to engage in the construction of low cost housing and other projects...;

5. That[,] unfortunately, the newly constituted PCAB Board adopted and approved Board Resolution No. 915, Series of 2011 mandating the setting up of deadline for cooperatives such as herein plaintiff to reorganize and incorporate into a business corporation as a condition sine qua non for the continuous grant of the Contractor's License[,] thereby directing service cooperatives and herein plaintiff/petitioner to convert itself into a purely business corporation as a requirement for renewal of contractor's license for CY 2013-2014 and[,] likewise, giving all service cooperatives and the herein plaintiff a mandatory period to renew their respective licenses until CY 2012-2013 with the condition that plaintiff should be converted into a purely business corporation as a requirement for the renewal of license for CY 2013-2014...[P]er letter dated 13 January 2012 of OIC Rene E. Fajardo ... respondent reiterated its [directive] for herein service cooperative to convert itself into a purely business corporation in clear defiance of the state policy on the promotion and protection of cooperative[s] enunciated in the Philippine Constitution and articulated in the Cooperative Code of the Philippines under pain of denial of their application for the issuance of Contractor's License;[6]
PCAB, through the Office of the Solicitor General, responded in an Answer[7] dated March 21, 2013, as follows:
11. ..RA 9520, otherwise known as the Philippine Cooperative Code of 2008, has no specific provision authorizing a cooperative to undertake construction contracting per se.

12. While Article 23 of said law, which enumerates different types of cooperatives, provides three (3) activities that obliquely refer to construction, the same is limited by the condition that the activity must be intended to serve only the household members or regular members of the specific cooperative[.]

13. A further reading of RA 9520 would reveal that only agrarian reform cooperatives are given the privilege to undertake construction activities, but with a very limited scope[.]

14. RA 9520 also provides for the requirements for an agrarian reform cooperative to be organized and registered[.]

15. Clearly, the above-stated provisions of RA 9520 warrant only the grant of a special license for specific purposes.

16. Since plaintiff does not claim to be an agrarian reform cooperative, or an electric, housing or water service cooperative[,] and does not possess any of the qualifications in order to be organized and registered as such, then it cannot validly continue undertaking construction contracting under the Philippine Cooperative Code of 2008.

17. Interestingly, RA No. 4566 defines those who may qualify to apply for a contractor's license[.]

18. [P]laintiff... being a cooperative, must also comply with the existing law governing such.

19. Unfortunately, as discussed above, RA 9520 does not provide for a ""construction cooperative""; nor there was [sic] any showing that the Cooperative Development Authority (CDA), the government agency in charge of the registration and regulation of cooperatives, has already determined such type of cooperative.

20. More importantly, it must be pointed out that plaintiff's Contractor's License is a mere privilege. Well-settled is the rule that a license authorizing a person to enjoy a certain privilege is neither a property nor property right[.][8] (Citations omitted)","This Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] seeks to reverse and set aside the Decision[2] of the Court of Appeals (CA). The CA denied the appeal filed by petitioner Philippine Contractors Accreditation Board (PCAB), assailing the Decision[3] and Resolution[4] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) which enjoined the implementation of PCAB's Board Resolution No. 915, series of 2011 (Resolution No. 915) for lack of approval by the President of the Philippines.","The Petition must be dismissed.

PCAB claims that the CA erred in dismissing the appeal based on technicality as the application of the Rules of Court may be relaxed as the instant case involves a matter of paramount public interest.[21] PCAB likewise insists that Resolution No. 915 does not require approval from the President and/or confirmation from the CIAP to be implemented. It underlines that Section 5 of Republic Act No. 4566 and Rule 2 of the Rules and Regulations Governing Licensing and Accreditation of Constructors in the Philippines only refer to the issuance of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of Republic Act No. 4566 and not to any other issuances of PCAB.[22]

We ultimately rule for CMCM Cooperative. The findings of this Court shall be discussed in seriatim.
 
The CA was correct in dismissing PCAB's appeal pursuant to Rule 50, Section 2 of the Rules of Court
 

At the outset, the CA's finding that PCAB solely anchored its appeal on a purely legal question deserves respect from this Court. The primordial issue of the case involves the validity and application of Resolution No. 915. This ascertainment involves a purely legal question, and thus, the dismissal of PCAB's appeal before the CA is the unavoidable outcome.[23] As further held in Republic v. Caraig:[24]
[B]asic is the rule that a question of law arises when there is doubt as to what the law is on a certain state of facts, while there is a question of fact when the doubt arises as to the truth or falsity of the alleged facts. For a question to be one of law, the same must not involve an examination of the probative value of the evidence presented by the litigants or any of them. The resolution of the issue must rest solely on what the law provides on the given set of circumstances.[25]
Under Rule 41, Section 2 of the Rules of Court, there are two modes of appeal from a decision or final order of the trial court in the exercise of its original jurisdiction: (1) by writ of error under Rule 41, Section 2(a) if questions of fact or questions of fact and law are raised or involved; or (2) appeal by certiorari under Rule 41, Section 2(c), in relation to Rule 45, where only questions of law are raised or involved, viz.:[26]
Sec. 2. Modes of appeal. 

(a) Ordinary appeal.  The appeal to the Court of Appeals in cases decided by the Regional Trial Court in the exercise of its original jurisdiction shall be taken by filing a notice of appeal with the court which rendered the judgment or final order appealed from and serving a copy thereof upon the adverse party. No record on appeal shall be required except in special proceedings and other cases of multiple or separate appeals where the law or these Rules so require. In such cases, the record on appeal shall be filed and served in like manner.

....

(c) Appeal by certiorari.  In all cases where only questions of law are raised or involved, the appeal shall be to the Supreme Court by petition for review on certiorari in accordance with Rule 45.
Thus, this Court finds that the CA did not err in dismissing PCAB's appeal. Since what PCAB raised in its appeal was a pure question of law, its proper recourse was to file before this Court a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. In fact, Rule 50, Section 2 of the Rules of Court clearly mandates the outright dismissal of appeals made under Rule 41 thereof, if they only raise pure questions of law,[27] as in this case. Rule 50, Section 2 of the Rules of Court provides:
Sec. 2. Dismissal of improper appeal to the Court of Appeals.  An appeal under Rule 41 taken from the Regional Trial Court to the Court of Appeals raising only questions of law shall be dismissed, issues purely of law not being reviewable by said court. Similarly, an appeal by notice of appeal instead of by petition for review from the appellate judgment of a Regional Trial Court shall be dismissed.
 
An appeal erroneously taken to the Court of Appeals shall not be transferred to the appropriate court but shall be dismissed outright. (Emphasis supplied)
Given that the appeal filed by PCAB before the court a quo raised only questions of law, the CA committed no error in dismissing the Petition in fealty to Rule 50, Section 2 of the Rules of Court. To be sure, the CA's dismissal of PCAB's appeal was the only proper and unavoidable outcome.[28]

The above disquisition provides enough reason to end our discussion. Nevertheless, the Court deems it wise, in the interest of substantial justice, to take another look at this case.
 
Resolution No. 915 is null and void
 ","ACCORDINGLY, the instant Petition is DENIED and the Decision dated June 21, 2018 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 04454-MIN, and effectively, the Decision dated November 7, 2014 and Resolution dated May 2, 2016 of Branch 17, Regional Trial Court of Kidapawan City enjoining the implementation of Philippine Contractors Accreditation Board's Board Resolution No. 915, series of 2011 for lack of approval by the President of the Philippines, are AFFIRMED."
"G.R. No. 221043, July 31, 2024","NOZOMI FORTUNE SERVICES, INC., PETITIONER, VS. CELESTINO A. NAREDO, RESPONDENT.","The instant case stems from a complaint for illegal dismissal filed by respondent Celestino A. Naredo (Naredo) and several others (collectively, complainants) against Nozomi and its branch manager, Ludy Lasiog (Lasiog), as well as Samsung Electro-Mechanics Phils. (Samsung); its president, Jung Soo Lee; and human resources manager, Anna Roselle Dayday.[5] As a manpower business, Nozomi hired complainants and assigned them to Samsung on various dates between 2003 and 2005.[6] They were detailed as production operators for the various electronic components manufactured by Samsung.[7] Sometime in May 2010, Lasiog told complainants that Samsung would absorb them as regular employees if they passed its examination. Unfortunately, they failed to hurdle the tests and Samsung informed them that their services were no longer needed.[8] On July 15, 2010, complainants all tendered their voluntary resignation by submitting handwritten letters citing various personal reasons.[9] A month later, they instituted a complaint for illegal dismissal and regularization before the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC).[10] Complainants averred that they were actually regular employees of Samsung because they had been working for it for more than a year and the nature of their job was necessary and desirable to its usual business. Moreover, Nozomi was a mere labor-only contractor as it did not have substantial capital or investment and that the machines and equipment they used to perform their functions belonged to Samsung. Furthermore, it was Samsung which controlled and supervised them; Nozomi was merely a conduit for the payment of their wages.[11]

Nozomi countered that it was duly registered with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) as an independent job contractor, operating its own medical laboratory and diagnostic services center for its employees. Moreover, it owned various training facilities, had several service agreements with various companies, including Samsung, and had substantial capital to finance its operations.[12]

For its part, Samsung denied liability over complainants, insisting that they were Nozomi's employees who were only assigned to it pursuant to a service contract with Nozomi whenever it was short of regular employees.[13]

In due course, the Labor Arbiter dismissed the complaint for lack of merit. In his Decision,[14] he held that Nozomi carried on an independent business as a contractor. Having been duly registered with the DOLE, it thus enjoys the presumption of being a legitimate independent job contractor. Moreover, Nozomi adduced proof of having substantial capital, and of even having a 2009 net income of PHP 991,413,266.00.[15] Its several facilities, as evidenced by its registration with both the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and the Department of Health (DOH), cater to the medical needs of its employees. While Nozomi has several training facilities and audio-visual centers, finance and EDP centers nationwide, and fully computerized payroll and software development centers, it likewise maintains a separate office in every company which it has a service contract with in order to monitor and supervise its detailed employees.[16] As to the issue on who the complainants' actual employer was, it is clear that Nozomi hired them, paid their wages, exercised the power to discipline and terminate them, and controlled the means and methods in the performance of their work.[17] Hence, it cannot be gainsaid that complainants were Nozomi's regular employees, and not of Samsung. In resolving the argument on illegal dismissal, the LA declared complainants to have voluntarily resigned from their posts. It was incumbent upon them to prove the fact of dismissal before the burden shifted to their employer to prove that it was done for just cause. However, they failed to discharge this burden.[18] Their other monetary claims were also found to be baseless.[19]

On appeal, the NLRC affirmed the judgment[20] of the Labor Arbiter, finding that the conclusions reached upon were supported by the evidence on record. It was abundantly clear that Nozomi was complainants' employer after applying the fourfold test. Moreover, Nozomi was able to prove its status as a legitimate job contractor in this case and in nine other decided cases.[21] The NLRC likewise concurred with the finding that complainants failed to prove their illegal dismissal and entitlement to monetary claims.[22]

Complainants' motion for reconsideration having been rebuffed by the NLRC,[23] Naredo sought recourse before the CA via a Petition for Certiorari.[24]

In the impugned Decision, the CA upheld the finding that Naredo was not illegally dismissed. Nevertheless, it declared that Nozomi is a labor-only contractor and Samsung is respondent's true employer. The CA found the service contract between Nozomi and Samsung as defective since it only provided for deployment of manpower and not for performance of specific work.[25] The CA also declared that Nozomi failed to show other factors or conditions to qualify as an independent contractor aside from possessing substantial capital,[26] and rejected the contention that the DOLE Certificate of Registration confirmed the status of Nozomi as a legitimate independent contractor.[27] As a labor-only contractor, it follows that Samsung is Naredo's true employer and Nozomi merely acted as its agent.[28] Still, there was no proof that Naredo was illegally dismissed. Based on the records, the CA held that he voluntarily resigned.[29]

Nozomi's bid for partial reconsideration was denied in the oppugned Resolution, which led to the filing of the present Petition.

The main issue posited before the Court is whether or not the CA erred in finding grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in the rulings of the NLRC, and in declaring that Nozomi is a labor-only contractor.
","This Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] challenges the Decision[2] and the Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA), which declared that petitioner Nozomi Fortune Services, Inc. (Nozomi) is a labor-only contracting entity, and which denied the Partial Motion for Reconsideration[4] thereof, respectively, in CA-G.R. SP No. 125058.","The Petition is devoid of merit.

At the outset, it must be stressed that in deciding a Rule 45 petition inveighing against the CA's ruling on a Rule 65 petition, the Court is limited to determining whether the CA correctly determined the presence or absence of grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of the NLRC.[30] ""There is grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC when its findings and conclusions are not supported by substantial evidence, i.e., that amount of relevant evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion.""[31]

Additionally, while a Rule 45 petition is generally confined to questions of law, the Court may deviate from this rule when the findings of the labor tribunals on one hand, and the CA on the other, are in conflict,[32] as in the case at bench. In such instances, the Court is compelled to re-evaluate and re-­examine the attendant factual issues and findings.[33]

Guided by the foregoing principles, the Court finds that the CA correctly found grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC when it rendered its rulings.

Preliminarily, the Court takes this occasion to emphasize once more that a DOLE Certificate of Registration, by itself, is not a conclusive proof of legitimacy for a manpower provider. It only prevents the presumption of labor-only contracting from arising.[34] In Caballero v. Vikings Commissary,[35] this Court held that ""[t]o determine whether the contractor was engaged by the principal as a legitimate job contractor or a labor-only contractor, the totality of the facts and the surrounding circumstances are to be considered."" All the features of the relationship are assessed.[36]

Tested against the totality of circumstances established by the evidence presented, the Court finds that the CA correctly held that Nozomi is engaged in labor-only contracting.

The distinction between permissible job contracting and prohibited labor-only contracting is well-established. Caballero explains
Permissible job contracting ""refers to an arrangement whereby a principal agrees to put out or farm out with a contractor or subcontractor the performance or completion of a specific job, work or service within a definite or predetermined period, regardless of whether such job, work or service is to be performed or completed within or outside the premises of the principal.""[37]
Simply put, permissible job contracting involves contracting out of work, job or service, while prohibited labor-only contracting involves the contracting out of only labor.[38]

This demarcation between the two types of contracting is provided by no less than the Labor Code itself:
ARTICLE 106. Contractor or Subcontractor.  Whenever an employer enters into a contract with another person for the performance of the former's work, the employees of the contractor and of the latter's subcontractor, if any, shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of this Code.

In the event that the contractor or subcontractor fails to pay the wages of his employees in accordance with this Code, the employer shall be jointly and severally liable with his contractor or subcontractor to such employees to the extent of the work performed under the contract, in the same manner and extent that he is liable to employees directly employed by him.

The Secretary of Labor and Employment may, by appropriate regulations, restrict or prohibit the contracting-out of labor to protect the rights of workers established under this Code. In so prohibiting or restricting, he may make appropriate distinctions between labor-only contracting and job contracting as well as differentiations within these types of contracting and determine who among the parties involved shall be considered the employer for purposes of this Code, to prevent any violation or circumvention of any provision of this Code.

There is ""labor-only"" contracting where the person supplying workers to an employer does not have substantial capital or investment in the form of tools, equipment, machineries, work premises, among others, and the workers recruited and placed by such person are performing activities which are directly related to the principal business of such employer. In such cases, the person or intermediary shall be considered merely as an agent of the employer who shall be responsible to the workers in the same manner and extent as if the latter were directly employed by him. (Emphasis supplied)
Based on the above-quoted provision of the Labor Code and pertinent jurisprudence, an entity is engaged in prohibited labor-only contracting when the following are present: ""(1) a person who supplies workers to an employer does not possess substantial capital or investment in the form of tools, pieces of equipment or machinery, work premises, among others; and (2) the workers are made to perform tasks which are directly related to the employer's principal business.""[39]","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED for lack of merit. The December 10, 2014 Decision and the September 3, 2015 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 125058 are AFFIRMED.

"G.R. No. 265651, July 31, 2024","TJ LENDING INVESTORS, INC., REPRESENTED BY TED JOSEPH B. PUNZALAN, PETITIONER, VS. SPOUSES ARTHUR YLADE AND LITA YLADE AND THE REGISTER OF DEEDS OF MANILA, RESPONDENTS.","The present Petition stemmed from a Complaint for sum of money filed by TJ Lending entitled, ""TJ Lending Investors, Inc., represented by its Collection Manager Eduardo M. Punzalan v. Sps. Nenita Generosa­-Cubing and Egmedio Cubing, Sps. Roberto Bueno and Elimar Generosa-Bueno, and Sps. Lita Generosa-Ylade and Arthur Ylade"", which was docketed as Civil Case No. 11-125134 (Collection Case) and raffled to Branch 173, RTC, Manila (RTC Branch 173).[7]

As may be gleaned from the Decision[8] dated June 22, 2012 of the RTC Branch 173 in the Collection Case, the Spouses Nenita Generosa­-Cubing and Egmedio Cubing (collectively, the Spouses Cubing) obtained a loan from TJ Lending in the amount of PHP 940,190.94, evidenced by a promissory note that they executed in favor of TJ Lending. In support of the loan, Lita, the sister of Nenita Generosa-Cubing,[9] executed and signed a co-maker statement, which made her solidarily liable with the Spouses Cubing for the payment of the loan obligation to TJ Lending. The Spouses Cubing defaulted in their payment that prompted TJ Lending to institute the Collection Case.

In its Decision,[10] the RTC Branch 173 held that the obligations of the Spouses Cubing, as principal debtors under the promissory note, and Lita, as co-maker and solidary debtor under the co-maker statement, must be complied with pursuant to Articles 1157[11] and 1159[12] of the Civil Code. However, the RTC Branch 173 dismissed the action against Arthur and the Spouses Roberto Bueno and Elimer Bueno because they were not signatories to the promissory note or the co-maker statement, viz.:
WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered ordering defendants Spouses Nenita Generosa-Cubing and Egmedio Cubing (jointly) and Lita Generosa-Ylade (solidarily) to pay TJ Lending Investors, Inc. the following sums, to wit:

1) [PHP] 940,190.94 with legal interest of twelve percent (12%) per annum from the filing of the complaint on February 7, 2011 up to its full satisfaction;

2) [PHP] 20,000.00 as attorney's fees; and

3) [PHP] 35,284.74 as cost of suit.

The actions against Spouses Roberto Bueno and Elimar Bueno and Arthur Ylade are hereby DISMISSED for lack of evidence.

SO ORDERED.[13] (Emphasis in the original)
The Decision of the RTC Branch 173 became final and executory.[14] To satisfy the judgment debt, the Sheriff attached and levied upon a real property located in Tondo, Manila and covered by TCT No. 170488 (subject property).[15] In the TCT, it is stated that the subject property ""is registered in accordance with the provisions of section 103 of the Property Registration Decree in the name of ARTHUR C. YLADE, married to Lita Ylade, both of legal age, Filipino citizens[.]""[16]

During the execution sale of the subject property, TJ Lending won as the highest bidder. The Sheriff then issued a Certificate of Sale[17] to TJ Lending.[18]

The subject property was not redeemed within the one-year redemption period.[19] Thus, the RTC Branch 173 issued a Final Deed of Sale[20] to TJ Lending.[21]

Arthur filed with the RTC Branch 173 a Motion to Nullify Levy and Execution Sale and to Cancel the Certificate of Sale and the Final Deed of Sale[22] (Motion to Annul Execution Sale). He averred that the judgment debt cannot be satisfied with the subject property that he exclusively owns considering that the Collection Case was dismissed as to him and he was not among the judgment debtors found liable by the RTC Branch 173; hence, the execution sale was null and void.[23]

However, the RTC Branch 173 denied Arthur's motion. It emphasized that Arthur was declared in default in the Collection Case; thus, he has lost his standing in court and cannot question the execution sale of the subject property. It also determined that Arthur has waived any objection to the execution sale due to his failure to redeem the subject property within the one-year redemption period.[24]

TJ Lending then sent a demand letter[25] to the Spouses Ylade and demanded the surrender of the Owner's Duplicate of TCT No. 170488.[26] However, the demand was unheeded. Thus, TJ Lending filed its Petition for the Surrender of Title against respondents which was docketed as Case No. P-16-0214 and raffled to RTC Branch 4.[27] It argued that respondents must be directed to surrender the Owner's Duplicate of TCT No. 170488 because the RTC Branch 173 already issued a Final Deed of Sale to TJ Lending.

In his Answer and Opposition to the Petition for Surrender of Title, Arthur insisted that the subject property is his exclusive property because he acquired it from the National Housing Authority (NHA) before he married Lita on December 28, 1985, although TCT No. 170488 was issued later, on August 7, 1986. Given that the Collection Case was dismissed against him and he was not found liable as a judgment debtor in that case, the execution sale of the subject property to satisfy the money judgment in the Collection Case was improper.[28]

Arthur further averred that, even assuming that the subject property is a conjugal property, a debt separately incurred by Lita cannot be automatically charged against the conjugal properties, unless it is established that the debt redounded to the benefit of the family. He argued that the judgment debt in the Collection Case has not been shown to have redounded to the benefit of his family considering that Lita was merely a co-maker for the principal debtors, the Spouses Cubing.[29]","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] (Petition) under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assailing the Decision[2] dated July 5, 2022, and the Resolution[3] dated February 14, 2023, of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 112633. The CA reversed and set aside the Decision[4] dated August 20, 2018, and the Resolution[5] dated October 22, 2018, of Branch 4, Regional Trial Court (RTC Branch 4), Manila, in Case No. P-16-0214 which granted the Petition for the surrender of Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 170488 filed by petitioner TJ Lending Investors, Inc. (TJ Lending) against respondents Spouses Arthur Ylade (Arthur) and Lita Ylade (Lita) (collectively, Spouses Ylade).[6]","The Petition is denied for lack of merit. The CA Decision and Resolution are affirmed with modification in that, the execution sale of the subject property is also declared null and void. 
 
TJ Lending failed to adduce preponderant evidence proving that the subject property is presumed conjugal under Article 160 of the Civil Code
 

The marriage between the Spouses Ylade was celebrated on December 28, 1985,[44] before the Family Code took effect in 1988.[45] As such, the property regime of the Spouses Ylade is that of conjugal partnership of gains under the Civil Code.[46]

Under Article 160 of the Civil Code, ""[a]ll property of the marriage is presumed to belong to the conjugal partnership, unless it be proved that it pertains exclusively to the husband or to the wife."" For the presumption to apply, TJ Lending should have presented a preponderance of evidence proving that the subject property was acquired during the marriage of the Spouses Ylade.[47] ""Proof of acquisition during the coverture is a condition sine qua non to the operation of the presumption in favor of the conjugal partnership.""[48] Otherwise said, the presumption cannot operate absent sufficient evidence proving that the property was acquired during the marriage.[49]

The Court finds that TJ Lending failed to present a preponderance of evidence proving that the subject property was acquired during the marriage of the Spouses Ylade which would, in turn, give rise to the presumption that the property belongs to the conjugal partnership.

To support its claim, TJ Lending relies on TCT No. 170488 which states that the subject property ""is registered in accordance with the provisions of section 103 of the Property Registration Decree in the name of ARTHUR C. YLADE, married to Lita Ylade, both of legal age, Filipino citizens[.]""[50] It also emphasizes that TCT No. 170488 was issued on August 7, 1986, during the subsistence of the marriage of the Spouses Ylade. Supposedly, the foregoing are sufficient proof that the property was acquired during the marriage of the Spouses Ylade.

The Court disagrees.","WHEREFORE, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED for lack of merit. The Decision dated July 5, 2022 and the Resolution dated February 14, 2023 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 112633 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION, in that:

" G.R. No. 239983, July 31, 2024","REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, REPRESENTED BY MAJOR GENERAL DIONISIO R. SANTIAGO, COMMANDING GENERAL OF THE ARMED FORCES OF THE PHILIPPINES (AFP) VISAYAS COMMAND, PETITIONER, VS. SPOUSES JOHNNY AND CHONA YU, RESPONDENTS.","The present case stemmed from a Complaint[5] filed by petitioner, praying for the RTC to enjoin Spouses Yu from constructing their residential house on the subject 252-square meter (sqm.) portion of Lot No. 933 (Lot 933), situated in Lahug, Cebu City, and direct the Register of Deeds (RD) to cancel Transfer Certificate of Title No. (TCT) 150040[6] issued in the latter's name and, in lieu thereof, issue a new title in the name of the Republic.[7]

Petitioner alleged that it, through the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) Visayas Command, is the absolute owner of Lot 933, consisting of 37,126 square meters, which was originally registered in the names of Francisco Racaza, Pantaleon Cabrera, and Josefina R. Martinez.[8] Additionally, it claimed that the said lot is part and parcel of the Camp Lapu-Lapu military reservation and is valued at more than PHP 100,000,000.00.[9]

Petitioner narrated that on October 19, 1938, the then-Commonwealth of the Philippines (Commonwealth) initiated expropriation proceedings and took possession of several parcels of land forming part of the Banilad Friar Lands Estate and included therein is Lot 933 situated in Lahug, Cebu City. The expropriation case was titled Commonwealth of the Philippines v. Borromeo, et. al., docketed as Civil Case No. 781 before then Court of First Instance, Cebu City, 8th Judicial District, Branch II (CFI).[10]

On May 14, 1940, the CFI rendered a Decision condemning the subject parcels of land in favor of the Commonwealth. The CFI Decision became final and executory and an entry of judgment was made on April 5, 1948.[11] Despite the CFI Decision, however, the original registered owners sold Lot 933 to another person/s and subsequently, sold and resold, and thereafter, new certificates of title/s were issued. Among these new certificates of title is TCT 150040 issued in the names of Spouses Yu covering the 252-sqm. portion of Lot 933, known as Lot 1, Psd-07-00133 (being a portion of the consolidation-­subdivision of Lot Nos. 933-C-1, 933-C-2, 933-C-3, and 933-C-4 LRC PSD-138296 Record No. 5988). Petitioner averred that since it already acquired Lot 933 through expropriation, TCT 150040 issued in Spouses Yu's name is null and void.[12]

For their part,[13] the Spouses Yu claimed that they validly purchased the 252-sqm. portion of Lot 933, which they have been in peaceful possession of and for which they have been paying taxes[14] thereon since their acquisition from the previous owner. Additionally, they averred that before they constructed their residential house on the subject lot, they first secured the necessary clearances and permits[15] from the Office of the Building Official, Cebu City, and no opposition whatsoever was interposed by the AFP Visayas Command, Camp Lapu-Lapu. It was only after they began the construction of the fence and residential house on the premises that personnel of Camp Lapu­-Lapu, under the command of one Lt. Col. Francisco G. Ventus, and upon his orders, threatened the workers at the construction site and confiscated their tools and other implements.[16]

In this regard, Spouses Yu asserted that Lot 933 has never been part of Camp Lapu-Lapu; and that the construction of their residential house thereon cannot in any way constitute a security hazard to the operations of the Camp or cause irreparable damage and injury to the government. Additionally, they argued that assuming Lot 933 was included in the expropriation in favor of the government, there was no showing that the owners of the property had been paid their just compensation. Finally, assuming that payment was made, the execution of the judgment for expropriation has already prescribed.[17]

In support of their claim of ownership over the subject portion, Spouses Yu submitted in evidence, among others: (i) copy of the various titles covering Lot 933 beginning with the title issued in the original registered owners' names up to their title over the subject portion;[18] and (ii) the Tax Declaration and Realty Tax Payment Receipt.[19]","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court filed by the Republic of the Philippines, represented by Major General Dionisio R. Santiago, Commanding General of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (petitioner), assailing the Decision[2] dated July 19, 2017 and the Resolution[3] dated May 24, 2018 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 03770. The assailed CA rulings reversed and set aside the Decision[4] dated October 6, 2005 of Branch 5, Regional Trial Court of Cebu City (RTC) in Civil Case No. CEB-26924, and accordingly, dismissed petitioner's Complaint against respondents Spouses Johnny and Chona Yu (Spouses Yu).","The Petition is without merit.

Injunction is defined as ""judicial writ, process or proceeding whereby a party is ordered to do or refrain from doing a certain act.""[52] Injunctive relief is only available when there is a pressing necessity to avoid injurious consequences which cannot be remedied under any standard of compensation.[53] It must be proven that the violation sought to be prevented would result in an irremediable injustice.[54]

Accordingly, case law settles that injunction is a preservative remedy aimed at protecting substantive rights and interests. The very foundation of the jurisdiction to issue a writ of injunction rests on the existence of a cause of action and on the probability of irreparable injury, inadequacy of pecuniary compensation, and the prevention of multiplicity of suits. Where facts are not shown to bring the case within these conditions, the relief of injunction should be refused. Thus, to be entitled to injunctive relief, the party seeking the same must establish the following requisites: (1) the right of complainant is clear and unmistakable; and (2) the invasion of a right sought to be protected is material and substantial.[55]

In this case, in asserting its right to the issuance of an injunctive relief against Spouses Yu over the subject portion of Lot 933, petitioner heavily relies on (i) the Court's ruling in Valdehueza which upheld the validity of the expropriation of the lots comprising the Banilad Friar Lands Estate in Civil Case No. 781, and (ii) the alleged presence of government or military structures on Lot 933 which, it claimed, should have put Spouses Yu on notice that the subject portion is owned by the government.

A judicious review of the records and circumstances surrounding the case convinces the Court that no reversible error attended the rulings of the CA in dismissing petitioner's Complaint. As the succeeding discussions will show, petitioner failed to (i) establish a clear and unmistakable right to the portion of Lot 933 subject of its Complaint and (ii) show that the invasion of a right sought to be protected is material and substantial.

Firstly, petitioner failed to prove that it had paid the full amount of the just compensation for the lots expropriated by virtue of the CFI Decision in Civil Case No. 781. Moreover, notwithstanding the CFI Decision in Civil Case No. 781 and despite the lapse of 61 long years from the issuance thereof, petitioner never had the title over Lot 933 transferred in its name, or at the very least, had the CFI Decision annotated on the title covering Lot 933.

Notably, the issue of ownership and possession of the lots comprising the Banilad Friar Lands Estate, which includes Lot 933, that were subject of the expropriation proceedings in Civil Case No. 781 had been in fact the subject of earlier proceedings which the Court had the occasion to rule upon and settle.

Primarily, after Valdehueza, the Court, in Republic v. Lim,[56] held that petitioner's ownership over the Banilad Friar Lands Estate, which were expropriated pursuant to the CFI Decision in Civil Case No. 781, is conditioned upon full payment of just compensation within a reasonable time. Since petitioner failed to prove that it had paid the full amount of the just compensation due for the expropriated lots, there was no transfer of title from the landowner to the expropriator, herein petitioner, and precluded the perfection of its title over the expropriated properties. Indeed, as the Court observed therein, despite the opportunities accorded to petitioner upon the issuance of the CFI Decision in Civil Case No. 781 and 57 years thereafter, it still failed to pay the just compensation due to the original registered owners, thus:
It bears stressing that the Republic was ordered to pay just compensation twice, the first was in the expropriation proceedings and the second, in Valdehueza. Fifty-seven (57) years have passed since then. We cannot but construe the Republic's failure to pay just compensation as a deliberate refusal on its part. Under such circumstance, recovery of possession is in order.[57] (Emphasis supplied)
On this score, it bears highlighting that despite the CFI Decision in Civil Case No. 781, the lapse of more than 61 years since then up to the filing of the injunctive Complaint subject of the present Petition in 2001, and the ruling in Lim, there still appears to have been no payment made by petitioner of the just compensation due to the original registered owners. Verily, the exceptional circumstances that attended the Court's ruling in Lim are likewise present in this case that squarely makes Lim applicable.

More recently in San Roque Realty and Development, the Court settled that there was no valid and complete expropriation of the said lots comprising the Banilad Friar Lands Estate for failure of petitioner to prove payment of the just compensation due, and that, as regards Lot 933, the CFI Decision in Civil Case No. 781 had not become final and executory as to be binding on the original registered owners thereof, including its subsequent transferees. The Court held:
At the outset, we note that issues of ownership and possession of several lots included in the 18 parcels of land covering the Banilad Friar Lands Estate had been the subject of earlier controversies which we already had occasion to rule upon. Lot Nos. 932 and 939 were the subject of Valdehueza v. Republic which is ubiquitously invoked by the Republic in this case. Republic v. Lim dealt with the special circumstances surrounding the incomplete and ineffectual expropriation of Lot No. 932. On the other hand, Federated Realty Corporation v. Court of Appeals preliminarily determined the state of ownership and possession of a portion of Lot No. 933, particularly Lot 3, covered by TCT No. 119929.

In Valdehueza, we held that the registered lot owners were not entitled to recover possession of the expropriated lots considering that the titles contained annotations of the right of the National Airports Corporation (now CAA) to pay for and acquire said lots.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED.

Acting on the PDs, the Philippine Army's Bids, Negotiations and Acceptance Committee (BNAC) convened and instructed the ASCOM to conduct a canvass on the CCIE items sought to be procured. The BNAC was composed of Colonel Cesar Santos (COL Santos), as BNAC Chairman; Captain Ferdinand Fevidal (CAPT Fedival), L/C Cabreros, and L/C Zumel, as BAC Members; and L/C Dosado, as BNAC Secretariat. Since the events were drawing near, the BNAC issued a resolution to procure the CCIE items through ""shopping"" due to its supposed urgency.[7]

Acting on the resolution, L/C Dosado, as BNAC Secretary, issued the Certificates of Purchase through Shopping containing the names of three suppliers and manufacturers, as well as the price quotations for the items. Out of three interested suppliers, the BNAC selected Dantes Executive Menswear since it purportedly offered the ""lowest, fairest, and best-complying offer."" Thereafter, COL Santos, L/C Zumel, and L/C Cabreros issued and signed the Abstract of Canvass and Recommendation of Award, Certificate of Reasonableness of Price dated February 25, 2003, and Notice to Proceed dated June 18, 2003.[8]

Subsequently, six separate Purchase Orders (POs) in favor of Dantes Executive Menswear were prepared and signed by Lieutenant General Gregorio Camiling, Jr. (LTG Camiling, Jr.), Commanding General of the Philippine Army; Colonel Custodio Salosagcol, Acting Commanding Officer of ASCOM; and Rolando Minel, Chief Accountant of the Philippine Army, who all certified that funds were available for the purpose.[9]

On June 19, 2003, the POs were forwarded to and received by Conrad Cuenca of Dantes Executive Menswear.[10]

On June 30, 2003, Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) on the POs were issued and signed by Brigadier General Severino P. Estrello (BG Estrello), Commanding General of the ASCOM. He certified that the expenses were necessary, lawful, and incurred under his supervision. It was LTG Camiling, Jr., who approved the payment while Atty. Editha Santos, Head of the Accounting Unit of the AFP, certified that the supporting documents were complete and proper.[11]

On October 7, 2003, the Memorandum dated August 20, 2003 of State Auditor Manuel Baes was referred to the Office of the Ombudsman for fact­-finding investigation in light of the following alleged irregularities in the procurement of the CCIE items, viz.: (1) the items procured were issued directly to the end-users without first recording them on the stock ledger card, hence, the physical existence of the delivery could not be ascertained; (2) the procurement was through shopping; and (3) the POs were prepared on the same date for the purchase of similar items, indicating that there was splitting of contracts which violated COA Circular No. 76-41 dated July 30, 1976.[12]

The Office of the Ombudsman nonetheless endorsed the case back to the COA on February 27, 2004 for fraud audit.[13]","These consolidated Petitions for Certiorari[1] under Rule 64 in relation to Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, assail the following dispositions of respondent Commission on Audit (COA), viz.:

The Petition before the COA Proper was filed out of time but the Court relaxes the rule on immutability of judgment in the higher interest of substantial justice

The procedure for filing an appeal before the COA is governed by the 2009 RRPC, thus:
RULE V
PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE DIRECTOR
. . . .

Section 4. When Appeal Taken.  An Appeal must be filed within six (6) months after receipt of the decision appealed from.

Section 5. Interruption of Time to Appeal.  The receipt by the Director of the Appeal Memorandum shall stop the running of the period to appeal which shall resume to run upon receipt by the appellant of the Director's decision.

. . . .

RULE VII
PETITION FOR REVIEW TO THE COMMISSION PROPER

. . . .

Section 3. Period of Appeal.  The appeal shall be taken within the time remaining of the six (6) months period under Section 4, Rule V, taking into account the suspension of the running thereof under Section 5 of the same Rule in case of appeals from the Director's decision, . . .

. . . .

Section 5. Contents of Petition.  The petition for review shall contain a concise statement of the facts and issues involved and the grounds relied upon for the review, and shall be accompanied by a certified true copy of the decision appealed from, together with certified true copies of such relevant portions of the record as are referred to therein and other supporting papers. The petition shall state the specific dates to show that it was filed within the reglementary period.
As ordained, an appeal to the COA Regional Director must be filed within six months or 180 days after receipt of the ND, and the appeal before the COA Proper shall be taken within the remaining period of six months under the proceedings before the Director.[49]

Here, L/C Cabreros et al. filed their Appeal Memorandum with the COA Regional DirectorNGS Cluster B only on April 11, 2011 or after the lapse of 163 days from their receipt of the ND No. 10-001-101-(03) on October 29, 2010. Thus, since the appeal to the COA Proper should be filed within 180 days from October 29, 2010, they only had 17 days left. Records show, however, that they filed their appeal before the COA Proper only on October 4, 2013, or after 583 days reckoned from February 29, 2012 when they received the February 6, 2012 Decision of the COA Regional Director­NGS Cluster B.

Thus, as correctly ruled by the COA Proper, L/C Cabreros et al.'s appeal before it was filed out of time. It therefore rendered the February 6, 2012 Decision of the COANGS final and immutable.

True, the Court emphasized in many cases that procedural rules should be treated with utmost respect and due regard since they are designed precisely to facilitate the adjudication of cases to remedy the worsening problem of delay in the resolution of rival claims and in the administration of justice.[50] Nonetheless, the principle of immutability of judgment admits of several exceptions,[51] such as:
(1) the correction of clerical errors;
(2) the so-called nunc pro tunc entries which cause no prejudice to any party;
(3) void judgments; and
(4) whenever circumstances transpire after the finality of the decision rendering its execution unjust and inequitable.[52]
The Court has further allowed the relaxation of the rule on finality of judgments in order to serve substantial justice,[53] taking into account:
(1) matters of life, liberty, honor, or property;
(2) the existence of special or compelling circumstances;
(3) the merits of the case;
(4) a cause not entirely attributable to the fault or negligence of the party favored by the suspension of the rules;
(5) a lack of any showing that the review sought is merely frivolous and dilatory; and
(6) the other party will not be unjustly prejudiced thereby.[54]
In De Castro v. Commission on Audit,[55] the Court resolved the case on the merits despite the fact that the petition before the Supreme Court was filed 10 days late since it involved disallowances amounting to more than PHP 30,000,000.00.

In Razalan v. Commission on Audit,[56] the Court also took cognizance of the petition and resolved it on the merits despite its late filing by eight days considering the hefty amount involved, and the fact that the municipality of Mayantoc, Tarlac and its constituents have actually benefited and continuously benefit from the construction of the Mayantoc Memorial Park Project.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petitions are GRANTED IN PART. The Resolutions dated August 18, 2017 in Decision No. 2017-243 and January 24, 2022 in Decision No. 2022-382 of the Commission on Audit are AFFIRMED WITH MODIFICATION.

Insular Government which recognizes the ownership of land occupied and possessed since time immemorial.""[9]

The dispositive portion of the Decision reads:
ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review is GRANTED. The Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals dated January 30, 2013 and September 10, 2013 respectively in CA-G.R. SP No. 118259 are SET ASIDE.

Respondents National Commission on Indigenous Peoples[11], Heirs of Lauro Carantes and Joan L. Gorio,[12] and Other Heirs of Lauro Carantes[13] have since filed their respective Motions for Reconsideration which raised substantially the same arguments.","Baguio City is exempted from the coverage of the Indigenous Peoples' Rights Act[1] (IPRA) except for native title to land, that is, ownership since time immemorial where the indigenous peoples are still in actual possession of the land.

This resolves the Motions for Reconsideration[2] of this Court's July 11, 2023 Decision[3] granting the Petition for Review on Certiorari and setting aside the Decision[4] and Resolution[5] of the Court of Appeals. In granting the petition, this Court ruled that Certificates of Ancestral Land Titles cannot be issued in favor of the heirs of Lauro Carantes (heirs of Carantes).","The Court finds no compelling reason to overturn its July 11, 2023 Decision. The issues raised by respondents have already been duly considered and passed upon by the Court in its assailed Decision.

Nevertheless, it bears stressing that Baguio City is exempted from the coverage of IPRA except for native title, that is, ownership since time immemorial where the indigenous peoples are in open, continuous, and actual possession of the land up to the present.

Native title as defined in IPRA refers to ""pre-conquest rights to lands and domains which, as far back as memory reaches, have been held under a claim of private ownership by [indigenous cultural communities/indigenous peoples], have never been public lands[,] and are thus indisputably presumed to have been held that way since before the Spanish Conquest.""[18]

In Federation of Coron, Busuanga, Palawan Farmer's Association, Inc. v. Secretary of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources,[19] this Court clarified that the concept of native title is an exception to the Regalian Doctrine:
Pursuant to the Regalian Doctrine (Jura Regalia), a legal concept first introduced into the country from the West by Spain through the Laws of the Indies and the Royal Cedulas, all lands of the public domain belong to the State. This means that the State is the source of any asserted right to ownership of land, and is charged with the conservation of such patrimony. All lands not appearing to be clearly under private ownership are presumed to belong to the State. Also, public lands remain part of the inalienable land of the public domain unless the Stale is shown to have reclassified or alienated them to private persons.
","ACCORDINGLY, the Motions for Reconsideration are DENIED with FINALITY. The Decision of the Court dated July 11, 2023 is AFFIRMED.

The Anonymous Letter further enumerates the following IBP-Central Luzon Officers who were identified from several Facebook publications to be present in Bali, Indonesia, together with Atty. Divina, namely: ""Winston Ginez,"" ""Buko dela Cruz,"" ""Peng dela Rama,"" and ""Jade Molo.""[4]

The Anonymous Letter likewise attached a copy of a Letter titled ""My Story,"" allegedly written by Atty. Jocelyn Z. Martinez-Clemente (Atty. Clemente), wherein, among others, it detailed a meeting she had with Atty. Adenn Sigua (Atty. Sigua), Atty. Peter Paul S. Maglalang (Atty. Maglalang), Atty. Myla Matic,[5] and Atty. Divina, at the latter's office in Makati. During the said meeting, Atty. Clemente was allegedly asked what position she would want if Atty. Divina became IBP-Central Luzon Governor. Thereafter, they were allegedly given Sodexo gift certificates in the amount of PHP 50,000.00.[6]

In Our Resolution[7] dated April 11, 2023, We directed the following individuals identified in the Anonymous Letter to file their respective Comments thereto: ""(1) Atty. Nilo Divina; (2) Winston Ginez; (3) Peng dela Rama; (4) Buko dela Cruz; (5) Jade Molo; (6) Atty. Jo Clemente; and (7) Atty. Peter Paul S. Maglalang.""[8] Moreover, this Court likewise directed the IBP National Officers and IBP-Central Luzon Officers to inform the Court of the identities of every person appearing in the photos attached to the Anonymous Letter.[9]","The instant case arose from an Anonymous Letter[1] dated March 24, 2023 (Anonymous Letter) filed against Atty. Nilo T. Divina (Atty. Divina) for alleged illegal campaigning activities relative to the election of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP)-Central Luzon Region.","This Court cannot sustain its ruling merely on inferences and unconfirmed theories alone.

Second, the acts adverted to in the Anonymous Letter committed by Atty. Divina was done during the Summer of 2022, December of 2022 and last February 2023, months prior to the scheduled May 5, 2023 IBP-Central Luzon elections. During this time, the members of the House of Delegates  who may nominate and elect the Governor for each Region, have yet to be elected by the local chapters.

Under Section 39 of the Revised IBP By-Laws, the Delegates from each Region shall elect the Governor for their Region. Relatedly, Section 31 states that the membership of the House of Delegates shall consist of all the Chapter Presidents, and in the case of Chapters entitled to more than one Delegate each, the Vice-Presidents of the Chapters and such additional Delegates as the Chapters are entitled to.

Hence with respect to the members of the House of Delegates who may nominate and elect Atty. Divina as Governor for the term 2023-2025, they have yet to be elected during the time that Atty. Divina performed the acts complained of.

Third, the Court finds it tenuous to draw parallelisms with the 1989 IBP National Elections and the present controversy.

In Re: 1989 Elections of the IBP, the candidates for IBP President had announced their candidacies when they perpetrated the prohibited activities. On the other hand, there is no indication that Atty. Divina has or had intention to run for Governor of IBP-Central Luzon when he sponsored the trips of the Regional officers. In fact, the lack of intention to run for the said position was re-affirmed in his Compliance filed before the Court.

Moreover, in Re: 1989 Elections of the IBP, the acts committed by the candidates were found to clearly influence the members of the House of Delegates relative to the election of IBP President. In the present case, according to the participants of the trips sponsored by Atty. Divina, they were team-building activities designed to strengthen the IBP-Central Luzon office.

This was even echoed by Atty. Clemente, that the trip to Balesin Island Club was a ""regional team-building activity"" and that ""to say now that such trip was meant to build patronage for Dean Divina is to undermine the team-building purpose of the activity.""

Given the foregoing, We find that the acts complained of against Atty. Divina in sponsoring the trips of the IBP-Central Luzon officers do not amount to a violation of Section 14 of the Revised IBP By-Laws.

Nevertheless, We find Atty. Divina Guilty of Simple Misconduct in Violation of Canon II, Sections 1 and 2 of the CPRA
Although We find that Atty. Divina did not commit any prohibited acts and practices relative to elections in the IBP, We nevertheless find him guilty of violating Canon II, Sections 1 and 2 of the CPRA.","ACCORDINGLY, the Court finds Atty. Nilo T. Divina GUILTY of Simple Misconduct in violation of Canon II, Section 1 and Section 2 of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability and is hereby FINED PHP 100,000.00 with a STERN WARNING that a repetition of the same or similar offense will be dealt with more severely.

The Court likewise finds Attys. Peter Paul S. Maglalang, Winston M. Ginez, Jocelyn ""Jo"" M. Clemente, Jade Paulo T. Molo, Enrique V. Dela Cruz, Jr., and Jose I. Dela Rama, Jr., GUILTY of simple misconduct in violation of Canon II, Section 1 and Section 2 of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability and are hereby FINED PHP 100,000.00 each with a STERN WARNING that a repetition of the same or similar offense will be dealt with more severely.

The Court's Resolution dated April 25, 2023 holding in abeyance the election of officers for the Integrated Bar of the Philippine - Central Luzon is hereby lifted. Accordingly, the Integrated Bar of the Philippine-Central Luzon is hereby ORDERED to proceed with the election of its Governor for the 2023-2025 term."

COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, RESPONDENT.","COMELEC, through its Executive Director, received on May 27, 2022 a document entitled ""APELA PARA SA MANO-MANONG PAGBILANG MULI NG MGA BOTO SA PROBINSYA NG PANGASINAN"" (APELA). Said document was forwarded to respondent's Executive Director from COMELEC's Provincial Election Supervisor in Pangasinan, who in turn received the same from a certain Albert O. Quintinita (Quintinita), a supposed signatory to the document, but who appears not to be a party to the instant petition.

The APELA is a signature campaign petition with the following intent as embodied on its first page, viz.:
Kami, bilang mamamayan at botante ng Pangasinan, ay humihiling na muling bilangin ang aming mga boto nitong nakaraang eleksyon (May 9, 2022), sa lalawigan ng Pangasinan dahil sa malawakang dayaan na nangyari. Bilang mga mamamayan at botante na nabigyan ng kapangyarihan na malayang pumili ng mga taong namumuno sa aming bayan, alinsunod sa Saligang-Batas, naniniwala kami na nilabag ang aming karapatan sapagkat ang lumabas na resulta sa eleksyon ay taliwas sa binoto ng karamihan sa amin.

Kami ngayon ay umaapela na muling bilangin ang mga ito ng wasto, tapat, malinis at alinsunod sa batas upang lumabas ang katotohanan at mahalal ang mga karapat-dapat na maupo sa pwesto. Nakalakip dito ang mga pangalan at lagda na sumusuporta sa pananawagang ito. Ang lahat ng ito ay nagmumula sa karapatang bumoto na isa sa mga pinakasagrado at pinakamahalagang saligan ng demokrasya.[2]
As stated in the instant petition, petitioner Atty. Laudemer I. Fabia (Atty. Fabia) was responsible for preparing and circulating the said APELA.[3] Only the first page containing the foregoing paragraphs of intent is attached to the instant petition; the critical signature pages that support the same are notably absent from the record.

COMELEC's Law Department replied to Quintinita in a Letter[4] dated May 31, 2022, which contains the following guidance:
Dear Mr. Quintinita,

This is in response to the APELA PARA SA MANO-MANONG PAGBILANG MULI NG MGA BOTO SA PROBINSYA NG PANGASINAN which you signed together with other persons who were questioning the results of the 2022 National and Local Elections. The aforesaid document was received by the Office of the Executive Director on May 27, 2022, and was transmitted to this Department on even date.

A perusal of the instant document shows that, although it was signed by several persons from different barangays and municipalities of the Province of Pangasinan, it did not specifically state the position involved and other details required for an election protest. Please be reminded that if you are contesting the elections or returns of an elective regional, provincial or city official, the petition should be filed directly with the Commission, through the Electoral Contests and Adjudication Department (ECAD), by any candidate who was voted for in the same office and who received the second or third highest number of votes, among others, as reflected in the Statement of Votes.
. . . .
On the other hand, if the instant election contest involves municipal officials, the verified petition should be directly filed before the proper Regional Trial Court also by a candidate who was voted for the same office and who received the second or third highest number of votes. In which case, the procedure provided in A.M. No. 10-4-1-SC shall be observed.","Before this Court is a Petition for Certiorari and Mandamus[1] filed as a class suit in representation of all voters of the Province of Pangasinan who were allegedly denied their rights of suffrage, to petition the government for redress of grievances, and to have access to information on matters of public concern. Petitioners Clarylyn A. Legaspi et al. (Legaspi et al.) assert that said rights of theirs were affected by the supposed inaction of respondent vis-à-vis their requests for a manual recount (at their expense) of the provincial results for all positions contested in the May 9, 2022 National and Local Elections, and said inaction is argued to have effectively amounted to grave abuse of discretion and denial of due process on the part of respondent Commission on Elections (COMELEC).","The instant petition must be dismissed.

In dealing with the six identified issues in seriatim, the Court now first discusses the sufficiency (or lack thereof) of the verifications made by Legaspi, et al.

Verification under the extant 2019 Rules of Court is defined under Rule 7, Section 4, viz.:
Section 4. Verification. Except when otherwise specifically required by law or rule, pleadings need not be under oath or verified.

A pleading is verified by an affidavit of an affiant duly authorized to sign said verification. The authorization of the affiant to act on behalf of a party, whether in the form of a secretary's certificate or a special power of attorney, should be attached to the pleading, and shall allege the following attestations:

(a) The allegations in the pleading are true and correct based on [their] personal knowledge, or based on authentic documents;

(b) The pleading is not filed to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation; and

(c) The factual allegations therein have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likewise have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for discovery.

The signature of the affiant shall further serve as a certification of the truthfulness of the allegations in the pleading.
A pleading required to be verified that contains a verification based on ""information and belief,"" or upon ""knowledge, information and belief,"" or lacks a proper verification, shall be treated as an unsigned pleading.
Indeed, petitions for certiorari and mandamus are required to be properly verified under Rule 65, Sections 1[24] and 3.[25] Poring over the verifications done and accomplished by Legaspi, et al., they all indeed contain phrases basically stating under oath that they individually attest that the instant petition contains true and correct statements based on their personal knowledge and existing authentic documents. However, the Court is at pains to determine how they were able to have personal knowledge of the following facts:
1) The alleged unusual speed of the transmission of the electoral results from the VCMs to COMELEC's transparency server on May 9, 2022, since they evidently were not present during the VCMs' transmission and had only monitored the election results on social media, on television, and on COMELEC's website (i.e., they were not present nearby any VCM or at respondent's headquarters housing the transparency server during the said transmission of results);

2) The observations of technical experts and international observers vis-à-vis the May 9, 2022 National and Local Elections, which they only came to know of via social media or sources online that are unauthenticated for evidentiary purposes; and

3) Their actual participation in the signing of the APELA, since again, the signature pages were not submitted as part of the records of the instant petition.
Florenz D. Regalado (Regalado), an eminent commentator and former member of the Court, wrote the following with regard to the rule on verification (i.e., Rule 7, Section 4):
The second paragraph of this section has been further amended so that the pleader's affirmation of the truth and correctness of the allegations in his pleading shall be based not only on his ""knowledge and belief' but specifically on his ""personal knowledge or based on authentic records."" In the 1964 Rules of Court, Sec. 6 of Rule 7 required personal knowledge of the facts averred, which was considered too strict since a person can reasonably affirm a fact based on his belief in its truth when there is or has been no other fact or reason contrary thereto.

However, that liberalized version is better regulated by the present amended provisions that facts should be attested to on the basis of one's personal knowledge or, especially with regard to old or vintage facts or events, by the recitals thereof in authentic records. Verification is intended to forestall allegations which are perjured or hearsay, and this purpose is reasonably subserved by the requirement for authentic documents such as official records which are exceptions to the hearsay evidence rule. For the same reason, a verification cannot be made on facts obtaining or arising in whole or in part from mere information and belief.[26] (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)
Regalado also emphasized that ""[v]erification may be made by the party, his representative, lawyer or any person who personally knows the truth of the facts alleged in the pleading.""[27] The crux of the instant petition's first issue, however, is if Legaspi, et al. did in fact have personal knowledge sufficient to establish their capacity to verify the instant petition in the first place, or failing that, if the instant petition is based on authenticated documents in conformity with Rule 7, Section 4. Put differently, the Court must resolve the question of what happens to a seemingly valid and compliant verification portion that is based on a pleading containing no reasonable indication that the party pleading his or her case has any personal knowledge of the facts, or has attached any authentic documents in support of the said pleading.

In this regard, the Court finds that Legaspi, et al. did not have sufficient personal knowledge that capacitated them to verify the instant petition. The third guideline on verification and certification against non-forum shopping, as laid down by the Court in Altres v. Empleo,[28] is instructive:
3) Verification is deemed substantially complied with when one who has ample knowledge to swear to the truth of the allegations in the complaint or petition signs the verification, and when matters alleged in the petition have been made in good faith or are true and correct.[29]
The Court cited its reasoning in Rombe Eximtrade (Phils.), Inc. v. Asiatrust Dev't., Bank[30] for the aforementioned guideline, viz.:
On the matter of verification, the purpose of the verification requirement is to assure that the allegations in a petition were made in good faith or are true and correct, not merely speculative. The verification requirement is deemed substantially complied with when one who has ample knowledge to swear to the truth of the allegations in the petition signed the verification attached to it, and when matters alleged in the petition have been made in good faith or are true and correct. In this case, we find that the position, knowledge, and experience of Ferrer as Manager and head of the Acquired Assets Unit of Asiatrust, and his good faith, are sufficient compliance with the verification and certification requirements. This is in line with our ruling in Iglesia ni Cristo v. Ponferrada, where we said that it is deemed substantial compliance when one with sufficient knowledge swears to the truth of the allegations in the complaint.[31] (Citations omitted)
Here, Legaspi, et al. clearly do not have personal knowledge of the circumstances that prompted their fears and speculations regarding the results on the May 9, 2022 National and Local Elections. There is no indication that any of them were intimately connected or concerned with the actual transmission of the tallies of the VCMs in their respective polling precincts all the way to COMELEC's servers, and it is clear from the records that their knowledge comes from mere information and belief based on news, social media, and opinionated sources found on the Internet that are unauthenticated in accordance with the Revised Rules on Evidence. Jurisprudence and the rules commonly state that mere information and belief as basis of a pleader's knowledge is clearly insufficient for purposes of verification. Thus, even if the verification portion of a pleading, just like Legaspi, et al. here, is compliant word-for-word with the requirements of Rule 7, Section 4, said compliance will not save the fact that a pleader's personal knowledge is actually not based on personal knowledge or even on any authenticated documents.","ACCORDINGLY, the instant Petition for Certiorari and Mandamus is hereby DISMISSED."
"A.M. No. P-15-3342 (Formerly OCA IPI No. 09-3074-P), July 30, 2024 ","JUDGE TOMAS D. LASAM, COMPLAINANT, VS. RONALD L. MAMAUAG, CLERK OF COURT II, MUNICIPAL TRIAL COURT, RIZAL, CAGAYAN, RESPONDENT.","This administrative case stemmed from Mamauag's failure to submit his daily time records (DTRs) for the months of February to October 2008, which resulted to his salaries and other benefits for the said months being withheld. To remedy the situation, Mamauag submitted to the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) his DTRs for the months of February to October 2008, albeit without the required certification by complainant Judge Tomas D. Lasam (Judge Lasam), then Presiding Judge of the MTC. Subsequently, in a 1st Indorsement dated November 11, 2008, then Deputy Court Administrator Reuben P. Dela Cruz (DCA Dela Cruz) referred the said DTRs to Judge Lasam for signature.[1]

In a letter[2] dated December 11, 2008, Judge Lasam informed DCA Dela Cruz that he will not certify the DTRs based on the following observations:
Several entries in the log book on ""time in"" and ""time out"" do not tally with the entries in the subject Daily Time Records. Particular entries on February 5, 6, 13, 15, 19, 20, 22, 26, 27 and 28, 2008; March 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 24, 25 and 26, 2008; April 1, 3, 9, 10, 15, 16, 21, 22, 25 and 29, 2008; May 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 16, 19, 22, 23, 27, 28 and 29, 2008 show the apparent discrepancy.

There are entries in the log book which are not reflected in the Daily Time Records and vice-versa. Reference is made on March 31, 2008; May 9, 2008; June 3, 2008; July 9, 15 and 16, 2008; and September 5, 2008.

In his Daily Time Record for July 2, 2008, he indicated that it was a holiday but in the log book, he reported for work.

. . . .

The entries in the log book for the months of February 2008 to October 2008 do not appear to have been filled up in the handwriting and signature of Ronald Mamauag. The initials ""RLM"" is not the initial or the usual signature of said Ronald Mamauag. A random sampling of the handwriting, initial and signature as appearing in the entries in the log book on March 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11, 2006 ... clearly shows that the handwriting, initials and signature in the log book entries are entirely different from the handwriting, initial and signature as appearing in the log book entries from February 2008 to October 2008.
Further examination of the handwriting of Ronald Mamauag in the official documents on file in your office would show that entries in the attached copies of the log book are not of Ronald Mamauag's handwriting or signature. There is therefore a very strong probability that somebody other than Ronald Mamauag filled up the log book.[3]
The OCA then treated Judge Lasam's letter as a complaint and ordered Mamauag to file his Comment.[4]

In his Comment,[5] Mamauag denied the allegations and explained that it was never his intention to falsify the logbook, which became the subject of the present matter. He claimed that he honestly believed that as Clerk of Court, he should only submit a Certificate of Service instead of a DTR under the 2002 Revised Manual for Clerks of Court. He asserted that he has been punctual in attending to his duties as Clerk of Court and was even recognized in Resolution No. 53[6] of the Sangguniang Bayan of the Municipality of Rizal, Province of Cagayan entitled A Resolution Attesting the Punctuality of Mr. Ronald L. Mamauag as a Public Servant Who Is Presently the Municipal Clerk of Court in the Municipality of Rizal, Province of Cagayan passed by the Sangguniang Members of Rizal, Cagayan.[7] He averred that he used to have many strokes in writing and inadvertently deviated from his usual or customary handwriting that was on file.[8] Mamauag asked the OCA for mercy and compassion, to look upon the situation as purely human miscalculation, and promised not to repeat the same mistake again.[9] In support of his claims, he submitted a copy of Resolution No. 53, and affidavits of Marygrace Guzman, Municipal Assessor of Rizal, Cagayan, and Margarita Datul, an employee of the Municipality of Rizal attesting to the honesty and competence of Mamauag.[10]

Judge Lasam submitted a Reply[11] stating that Mamauag failed to refute the specific charges and that the latter's irregularities, if admitted as purely human miscalculation, would set a dangerous precedent in disposing cases against an erring judicial employee as such defense would easily enable an employee to escape the serious effects of their wrongdoing.[12]

In a Resolution[13] dated August 12, 2009, the Court resolved to refer the administrative case to the Executive Judge of the Regional Trial Court of Tuao, Cagayan for investigation, report, and recommendation.[14] The case records were then forwarded to Judge Rolando R. Velasco (Judge Velasco), who proceeded with the investigation. In a letter[15] dated April 4, 2011, Judge Velasco informed the Court that he retired from the service and requested that the investigation be transferred to the Honorable Judge Edmar P. Castillo, Sr. Thus, in a Resolution[16] dated October 12, 2011, the Court resolved to direct Judge Edmar P. Castillo, Sr. (the Investigating Judge), to continue with the investigation of the instant administrative matter and to submit his report and recommendation within 60 days.

During the investigation, the MTC's Interpreter Jesus Mamba (Mamba) and Court Stenographer Priscilla Mangiduyos corroborated Judge Lasam. They both testified that they are familiar with Mamauag's handwriting and signature as the latter was the signatory of their DTRs. They attested that upon scrutiny of the logbook, the entries for February to October 2008 were not made under the usual signature and penmanship of Mamauag. In particular, Mamba stated that it was his first time to see the time in and time out of Mamauag written as ""RL Mamauag"" and initialed with ""RLM,"" which appeared during the questioned period.[17] He added that for the questioned period, he did not see Mamauag make any entry in the logbook.[18]
","Before the Court is an administrative case filed against respondent Ronald L. Mamauag (Mamauag), Clerk of Court II of the Municipal Trial Court of Rizal, Cagayan (MTC) charging him with serious dishonesty and falsification of official documents.","The Court adopts the findings and recommendation of the JIB Proper, which essentially upholds the findings of the J1B-OED and the Investigating Judge.

At the outset, it is important to note that on February 22,2022, the Court En Banc unanimously approved A.M. No. 21-08-09-SC, entitled Further Amendments to Rule 140 of the Rules of Court, which was published on April 3, 2022. Hence, Rule 140, as further amended (the Rules), is already effective. In this relation, Section 24 of the Rules explicitly provides that it will apply to all pending and future administrative disciplinary cases involving Members, officials, employees, and personnel of the Judiciary, to wit:
SECTION 24. Retroactive Effect.  All the foregoing provisions shall be applied to all pending and future administrative cases involving the discipline of Members, officials, employees, and personnel of the Judiciary, without prejudice to the internal rules of the Committee on Ethics and Ethical Standards of the Supreme Court insofar as complaints against Members of the Supreme Court are concerned.
In view of the foregoing, the Court shall resolve this case under the framework of the Rules.

The Court's own annotations to the Rules state that ""[d]ishonesty has been defined as the concealment or distortion of truth, which shows lack of integrity or a disposition to defraud, cheat, deceive, or betray and an intent to violate the truth.""[33] ""To be punishable by dismissal, the dishonesty must be serious as determined by the Court under the circumstances of the case.""[34] In Re: Alleged Dishonesty and Grave Misconduct Committed by Bulaong,[35] the Court En Banc reiterated:
Jurisprudence has defined dishonesty as ""'intentionally making a false statement in any material fact, or practicing or attempting to practice any deception or fraud in securing his examination, registration, appointment or promotion.'"" It implies a ""disposition to lie, cheat, deceive, or defraud; unworthiness; lack of integrity; lack of honesty, probity or integrity in principle; lack of fairness and straightforwardness; disposition to defraud, deceive or betray.""

Hence, ""like bad faith, [dishonesty] is not simply bad judgment or negligence... [it] is a question of intention. In ascertaining the intention of a person accused of dishonesty, consideration must be taken not only of the facts and circumstances which gave rise to the act committed by the respondent, but also of his state of mind at the time the offense was committed, the time he might have had at his disposal for the purpose of meditating on the consequences of his act, and the degree of reasoning he could have had at that moment."" In other words, dishonesty is a willful and voluntary act which cannot be justified under the guise of negligence or ignorance.[36]
Here, Mamauag is accused of falsifying the entries in the logbook relative to his attendance for the period of February to October 2008. To recall, Judge Lasam refused to certify Mamauag's DTRs for the questioned period because of the discrepancies in the details indicated in the logbook as against the submitted DTRs. In addition, the entries in the logbook supporting the DTRs for the questioned period appear to be not written by Mamauag. In his defense, Mamauag claimed that he used many strokes in writing and thus inadvertently deviated from his customary handwriting on file.

The Investigating Judge, the JIB-OED, and the JIB Proper uniformly found that the entries in the logbook in the questioned period were not written by Mamauag. The Court agrees.

A perusal of the records easily confirms that the entries in the logbook before and after the questioned period and Mamauag's signatures in his DTRs for the questioned period (Exhibits E to E-10) were evidently written in his usual penmanship, signatures, and initials. On the other hand, Mamauag's names and signatures appearing on the questioned period were clearly differently written. For comparison, some of the entries in the logbook are reproduced below:

August 1, 2006

(Image supposed to be here)

June 1, 2007

(Image supposed to be here)

February 2, 2009

(Image supposed to be here)

The three entries in logbook as shown above are in his usual handwriting and signature. While in his DTRs for the months of February,[37] March,[38] and April 2008,[39] he has these as his signatures:

(Image supposed to be here)

While some of Mamauag's entries for the questioned period are below:

April 11, 2008

(Image supposed to be here)

June 2, 2008

(Image supposed to be here)

October 2, 2008

(Image supposed to be here)

Noticeably, Mamauag's signatures in his DTRs were similar to the strokes written in the logbook on August 1, 2006, June 1, 2007, and February 2, 2009, and he consistently used a cursive short signature in the logbook. While on the questioned period, the signatures are only with capital letters ""RLM."" Moreover, the letter proportions as written in the questioned periods appear to be extended as against Mamauag's normal handwriting.","ACCORDINGLY, respondent Ronald L. Mamauag, Clerk of Court II of the Municipal Trial Court of Rizal, Cagayan, is found GUILTY of serious dishonesty and falsification of public documents. He is hereby DISMISSED from the service, with FORFEITURE of all the retirement and other benefits due him, except accrued leave credits, and DISQUALIFICATION from reinstatement or appointment to any public office, including government-owned or -controlled corporations.

"G.R. No. 258449, July 30, 2024","JUAN JUAN OLILA OLLESCA, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, RESPONDENT.","For this Court's resolution is a Petition for Certiorari[2] (with Extremely Urgent Application for Temporary Restraining Order and/or Preliminary Injunction) under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court filed by Juan Juan Olila Ollesca (Ollesca), assailing the December 13, 2021 Resolution[3] and January 3, 2022 Order[4] issued by the Commission on Elections (COMELEC). The Resolution ruled on the COMELEC Law Department's petition to cancel and/or deny due course of Ollesca's Certificate of Candidacy on the ground that Ollesca is a nuisance candidate, whereas the Order denied Ollesca's Motion for Reconsideration of the said Resolution.

On October 7, 2021, Ollesca filed his Certificate of Candidacy with the COMELEC for the position of president of the Philippines in the May 9, 2022 National and Local Elections.[5] In his Certificate of Candidacy, Ollesca stated that he is running as an independent candidate and indicated that he is an entrepreneur.[6]

On October 21, 2021, the COMELEC Law Department filed, on its own initiative, a Petition[7] to declare Ollesca as a nuisance candidate and asked that the COMELEC deny due course to or cancel Ollesca's Certificate of Candidacy. It asserted that considering that Ollesca filed his Certificate of Candidacy to run for president, he should be publicly known by numerous voters.[8] However, he is running as an independent candidate and is ""virtually unknown except possibly in the locality where he resides.""[9] As such, he has no capability to launch a nationwide campaign to enable him to be known nationally within the campaign period and to persuade a substantial number of voters from different parts of the country.[10] Viewed in this light, he does not appear to have any bona fide intention to run and ""put[s] the election process in mockery or disrepute.""[11]

On October 21, 2021, Ollesca was directed by the COMELEC Second Division to file an answer to the Petition.[12] Thus, on November 2, 2021, Ollesca complied and filed his Answer cum Memorandum.[13]

Ollesca asserted that the COMELEC Law Department's allegations are baseless conclusions of law,[14] being mere speculations[15] that lack factual basis to demonstrate Ollesca's lack of bona fide intent to run or any other circumstance or act intended to cause confusion among the voters.[16] He argued that the COMELEC's petition was based on his alleged lack of financial capacity to wage a nationwide campaign, which effectively imposed a property qualification that is inconsistent with the Constitution[17] and lacked legal basis.[18]

In its December 13, 2021 Resolution,[19] the COMELEC Second Division granted the nuisance petition against Ollesca. It found that Ollesca, who was an independent with no political party, was unknown outside of the community he belonged to and failed to show that he had the financial capacity to ""sustain a decent and viable nationwide campaign on his own.""[20] Thus, Ollesca allegedly filed his Certificate of Candidacy ""to put the election process in mockery or disrepute and, by the said act or circumstance, he has no bona fide intention to run for President.""[21] The dispositive portion of the Second Division's Resolution reads:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Petition is hereby GRANTED.

Respondent JUAN JUAN OLILA OLLESCA is DECLARED a NUISANCE CANDIDATE.

Accordingly, his Certificate of Candidacy for President in the 09 May 2022 National and Local Elections is hereby DENIED DUE COURSE and/or CANCELLED.
","Financial capacity to sustain the rigors of waging a nationwide campaign, membership in a political party, being known nationwide, and the probability of success do not by themselves determine the existence of a bona fide intention to run for public office under Section 69 of the Omnibus Election Code, the lack of which may characterize an electoral candidate as a nuisance candidate.[1]","This Court granted Marquez's petition and found that the COMELEC ""committed grave abuse of discretion when it declared Marquez a nuisance candidate on the ground of lack of proof of his financial capacity to wage a nationwide campaign. By so doing, the COMELEC has effectively imposed a 'property qualifications are inconsistent with the nature and essence of the Republican system ordained in our Constitution and the principle of social justice underlying the same.'""[73] We stated:
The COMELEC cannot conflate the bona fide intention to run with a financial capacity requirement.

A candidate's financial capacity to sustain the rigors of waging a nationwide campaign does not necessarily equate to a bona fide intention to run for public office. The COMELEC's burden is thus to show a reasonable correlation between proof of a bona fide intention to run, on the one hand, and proof of financial capacity to wage a nationwide campaign on the other.[74]
Similarly, in De Alban v. COMELEC,[75] Angelo Castro De Alban (De Alban) filed his Certificate of Candidacy for senator in the 2019 National Elections as an independent candidate and indicated that he was a lawyer and teacher by profession. The COMELEC Law Department motu proprio filed a petition to declare De Alban a nuisance candidate, arguing that he had no bona fide intent to run for public office and that he will not be able to sustain the financial rigors of waging a nationwide campaign without clear proof of financial capacity. The COMELEC First Division declared him a nuisance candidate for the same reasons as it declared Marquez a nuisance candidate. Thereafter, De Alban filed a Petition for Certiorari before this Court, ascribing grave abuse of discretion on the COMELEC in declaring him a nuisance candidate.

In De Alban, this Court stated that it was incumbent upon the COMELEC Law Department to identify the factual bases that would clearly show De Alban's lack of bona fide intention to run for senator.[76] The COMELEC Law Department failed to adduce any evidence and heavily relied on a general allegation and conclusion""anchored on flawed inferences""that De Alban has no clear proof of financial capability to sustain the financial rigors of waging a nationwide campaign.[77] It further stated that ""financial capacity to sustain the financial rigors of waging a nationwide campaign,"" ""non-membership in a political party"" or ""being unknown nationwide,"" and ""the low probability of success"" do not by themselves equate to the absence of bona fide intention to run for public office under Section 69 of the Omnibus Election Code.[78]

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in Marquez v. COMELEC (2022),[79] when Marquez ran as an independent candidate in the 2022 senatorial elections, the COMELEC Law Department again filed a petition to declare Marquez a nuisance candidate. It argued that Marquez, who was not nominated by a political party, was ""virtually unknown"" and ""[did] not appear to have a genuine intention to run for public office"" as he ""does not have a nationwide network or organization of supporters to assist him during the campaign so that he may be known nationally within the short campaign period.""[80] Ruling on the petition, the COMELEC First Division declared Marguez a nuisance candidate and cancelled his Certificate of Candidacy. Thus, Marguez filed a petition for certiorari before this Court and argued that the COMELEC acted with grave abuse of discretion for declaring him a nuisance candidate.[81]
","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Certiorari is GRANTED. The December 13, 2021 Resolution of the Commission on Elections Second Division and January 3, 2022 Order of the Commission on Elections En Banc in SPA No. 21-140 (DC)(MP) are ANNULLED and SET ASIDE.

Accordingly, the Petition to Deny Due Course to or Cancel Certificate of Candidacy dated October 11, 2021, filed by the Commission on Elections Law Department against petitioner Juan Juan Olila Ollesca, docketed as SPA No. 21-140 (DC)(MP), is DISMISSED."
"A.M. No. P-24-150 (Formerly OCA IPI No. 13-4030-P), July 30, 2024","FROILAN E. IGNACIO, COMPLAINANT, VS. PAUL CHRISTOPHER T. BALADING, SHERIFF III, BRANCH 33, METROPOLITAN TRIAL COURT, QUEZON CITY, RESPONDENT.","This Court resolves the administrative Complaint[1] for grave abuse of authority filed by Froilan E. Ignacio (Ignacio) against former Deputy Sheriff Paul Christopher Balading (Balading) of Branch 33, Metropolitan Trial Court, Quezon City.

In 2011, the Metropolitan Trial Court decided People v. Reyes, a Bouncing Checks Law[2] case.[3] In the case, accused Carolina Reyes (Reyes) was acquitted of the charge but was nevertheless adjudged civilly liable to the private complainant, Romeo Aznar (Aznar), in the amount of PHP 128,500.00.[4] The Writ of Execution was issued on October 25, 2012.[5]

On January 4, 2013, to implement the Writ of Execution, Balading, then trial court sheriff, went to Megabuilt Enterprises, a hardware store located in Batasan, Quezon City.[6] He was accompanied by Aznar,[7] and some unidentified men he called ""hatak boys.""[8] Balading levied hardware materials, which he carted off and loaded into a van.[9]

On January 10, 2013, Ignacio filed the administrative Complaint[10] against Sheriff Balading. Ignacio alleged that he is the registered owner of Megabuilt Enterprises. Ignacio claimed that on the day Balading went to Megabuilt, the latter was armed and did not properly identify himself as a sheriff to Megabuilt's employees. Balading and his companions allegedly just barged their way into the hardware store despite physical resistance from Ignacio's four employees. According to Ignacio, Balading carted off hardware materials in the total value of not less than PHP 500,000.00.[11]

As evidence of the abusive manner Balading had used in implementing the writ, Ignacio appended sworn statements from his employees, as well as screenshots of CCTV footage of the incident. He also mentioned that he had filed a criminal complaint against Balading.[12]

After three directives[13] for him to respond to the Complaint, Balading finally filed his Comment[14] on June 2, 2016. Balading essentially admitted that before going to Megabuilt, he first went to Reyes's house, where he offered money to her helpers for them to surrender the keys to the vehicles parked in the house. When he failed to secure the keys, Balading then went to Kingplus Construction and Hardware Supply to levy the rights, interests, and participation of Reyes. However, when Atty. Alfredo Tan, Reyes's counsel, arrived, Balading ""backed off""[15] and returned to the trial court.[16]

Balading then conducted surveillance to determine Reyes's whereabouts. Finally, on January 4, 2013, he went to Megabuilt Enterprises to implement the Writ of Execution against Reyes. According to Balading, Ignacio was the husband of Reyes, and the latter was hiding in Megabuilt to evade her civil liability.[17]

Balading denied that a robbery took place, emphasizing that there was a police station near Megabuilt where Ignacio could have easily sought assistance. Balading admitted that he eventually sold the items he had levied at a public auction, the proceeds of which answered for Reyes's civil liability. He claimed that there were items listed in the Complaint that he did not levy.[18]

Lastly, Balading apologized for the belated filing of the Comment. He said that he had no intention of delaying the proceedings and thought that his non-filing would simply be considered a waiver of his right to file a comment considering that the allegations against him, in and of themselves, ""will not substantially stand.""[19]

In a July 11, 2016 Resolution,[20] this Court referred the Complaint and the Comment to the Office of the Court Administrator for evaluation, report, and recommendation.","Sheriffs play a pivotal role as agents of the law. They are entrusted with the execution of court orders and writs and must adhere to stringent ethical and procedural standards. While expeditious enforcement of judgments is essential, due process and fairness must not be compromised.","For this reason, this Court instead forfeits all of respondent's benefits, which shall in no case include his accrued leave credits. Given the gravity of respondent's offense, we add the penalty of fine in the amount of PHP 200,000.00,[41] to be paid within 30 days from the finality of this Resolution. The fine shall be paid within the period given regardless of the filing of a Motion for Reconsideration.[42] If the fine remains unpaid within the given period, contempt proceedings shall be commenced against respondent for disobeying a lawful order of this Court.[43]

It is true that, under Rule 140, Section 22 of the Rules of Court, a fine, if unpaid within a period of not exceeding three months from the time the decision or resolution is promulgated, may be deducted from accrued leave credits. Section 22 explains that the deduction of unpaid fines from accrued leave credits is a form of compensation, thus:
SECTION 22. Payment of Fines.  When the penalty imposed is a fine, the respondent shall pay it within a period not exceeding three (3) months from the time the decision or resolution is promulgated. If unpaid, such amount may be deducted from the salaries and benefits, including accrued leave credits, due to the respondent. The deduction of unpaid fines from accrued leave credits, which is considered as a form of compensation, is not tantamount to the imposition of the accessory penalty of forfeiture covered under the provisions of this Rule. (Emphasis supplied)
However, under the Civil Code, a true compensation takes place ""when two persons, in their own right, are creditors and debtors of each other.""[44] This is not the case here, as respondent is not a debtor of this Court. Rather, respondent was a court personnel over whom this Court is constitutionally mandated to exercise administrative supervision,[45] and the fine was imposed as an administrative penalty, not a civil obligation.

More importantly, receiving the value of leave credits, when earned during the period of employment, is a vested right of an employee. Therefore, ""[a]s a matter of fairness and law, [employees] may not be deprived of such remuneration, which they have already earned prior to their dismissal.""[46]

Thus, the fine, if unpaid, cannot be deducted from accrued leave credits. Rule 140, Section 22 of the Rules of Court should therefore be amended in this wise:
SECTION 22. Payment of Fines.  When the penalty imposed is a fine, the respondent shall pay it within 30 days from the finality of the decision or resolution imposing the fine. Decisions and resolutions in administrative cases which are immediately executory shall be considered final, for purposes of the payment of fines, upon receipt of the decision and resolution, and the fine shall be paid within the period given regardless of the filing of a Motion for Reconsideration.

If unpaid within the period given, indirect contempt proceedings shall be commenced against the respondent pursuant to Rule 71, Section 3 of the Rules of Court.
ACCORDINGLY, respondent Paul Christopher T. Balading, former Sheriff III of Branch 33, Metropolitan Trial Court, Quezon City, is found GUILTY of grave abuse of authority. His offense merits the imposition of the penalty of dismissal from service. However, since he has been previously dropped from the rolls, dismissal from service may no longer be imposed.","ACCORDINGLY, respondent Paul Christopher T.

His offense merits the imposition of the penalty of dismissal from service. However, since he has been previously dropped from the rolls, dismissal from service may no longer be imposed.

In lieu of dismissal, respondent is meted the penalty of FORFEITURE of all his benefits, except his accrued leave credits, and is ordered to pay a FINE of PHP 200,000.00, to be paid within 30 days from the finality of this Resolution. If unpaid, contempt proceedings shall be commenced against him pursuant to Rule 71, Section 3 of the Rules of Court for disobeying a lawful order of this Court.

Furthermore, he is DISQUALIFIED from reinstatement or appointment to any public office, including government-owned or government-controlled corporations.

"A.M. No. P-24-140 (Formerly JIB FPI No. 22-110-P), July 30, 2024","ANTOLYN D. GONZALES, COMPLAINANT, VS. DWIGHT ALDWIN S. GERONIMO, SHERIFF IV, BRANCH 121, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, IMUS, CAVITE, RESPONDENT.","In the Sinumpaang Salaysay, Gonzales averred that on April 22, 2022, he received a letter from the Tanza Post Office, Tanza, Cavite, with the Republic of the Philippines, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Fourth Judicial Region, Branch 121, Imus, Cavite, as the sender. The following words also appear on the upper right corner of the envelope, ""Private or Unauthorized Use on Non-Payment of Postage is Penalized by Fine or Imprisonment or Both.""[3]

Gonzales, thinking that the letter was an official communication from the RTC, opened the envelope. As it turned out, however, the envelope contains Geronimo's Verified Comment on the administrative complaint previously filed by him against Geronimo, which was docketed as JIB FPI No. 21-071-P.[4]

Gonzales, thereafter, realized that Geronimo used the franking privilege, i.e., sending mail without paying postage stamps, reserved for the official transactions of Branch 121, RTC, Imus City, Cavite. Gonzales then went to the local post office to verify Geronimo's action. The local post office confirmed that it granted Geronimo franking privilege after the latter guaranteed that the letter contained an official transaction from the RTC.[5]

Gonzales, thus, averred that Geronimo committed a violation of Canon I (Fidelity to Duty), Section 1[6] of the CCCP. He explained that Geronimo used his official position to obtain unwarranted benefits and privileges for himself.[7]

On May 18, 2022, Atty. James D.V. Navarette (Atty. Navarette), Deputy Clerk of Court at-Large, Office of the Court Administrator and Acting Executive Director of the JIB issued an Indorsement[8] requiring Geronimo to file a Verified Comment to the Sinumpaang Salaysay which charged him with gross misconduct constituting violations of the CCCP.

On July 4, 2022, Geronimo complied therewith and filed his Verified Comment.[9] In his Verified Comment, Geronimo claimed that he filed his Comment in JIB FPI No. 21-071-P pursuant to the directive of the JIB, contained in the Indorsement dated December 11, 2021; and in the said indorsement, there is nothing that prohibits him from using the franking privilege. Geronimo also alleged that the administrative complaint pertained to his official function, and he submitted his Comment as a public servant, not as a private individual. Therefore, the filing of the Verified Comment can be considered as an official transaction.[10]

Finally, Geronimo argued that Gonzales was wasting the Court's time and resources by filing a baseless complaint. He claimed that the filing of the complaint was a mere fishing expedition and Gonzales was trying to play the victim's card to pin him.[11]","For the Court's consideration is a Sinumpaang Salaysay ng Paghahabla (Sinumpaang Salaysay)[1] dated April 25, 2022, filed before the Judicial Integrity Board (JIB) by complainant Antolyn D. Gonzales (Gonzales) against respondent Dwight Aldwin S. Geronimo (Geronimo) for an alleged violation of Canon I, Section 1 of Administrative Matter No. 03-06-13-SC, also known as the Code of Conduct for Court Personnel (CCCP).[2]","The Court agrees with the recommendation of the JIB that Geronimo's liability should only be confined to simple misconduct, and not for violation of Presidential Decree No. 26.

It is settled that administrative cases are independent from criminal actions for the same act or omission.[24] They are separate and distinct from each other. In Paredes v. Court of Appeals,[25] the Court had the opportunity to exhaustively distinguish these two cases, thus:
First, the quantum of evidence required in an administrative case is less than that required in a criminal case. Criminal and administrative proceedings may involve similar operative facts; but each requires a different quantum of evidence. Administrative cases require only substantial evidence, or such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. In contrast, in Criminal Case Nos. 99-525 to 99-531, respondents are required to proffer proof beyond reasonable doubt to secure petitioner's conviction. Rule 133 of the Revised Rules on Evidence provides:

. . . .

Thus, considering the difference in the quantum of evidence, as well as the procedure followed and the sanctions imposed in criminal and administrative proceedings, the findings and conclusions in one should not necessarily be binding on the other. Notably, the evidence presented in the administrative case may not necessarily be the same evidence to be presented in the criminal cases. The prosecution is certainly not precluded from adducing additional evidence to discharge the burden of proof required in the criminal cases. Significantly, the prosecution had manifested that it would present testimonial evidence which was not presented in the administrative case.

Second, it is well settled that a single act may offend against two or more distinct and related provisions of law, or that the same act may give rise to criminal as well as administrative liability. As such, they may be prosecuted simultaneously or one after another, so long as they do not place the accused in double jeopardy of being punished for the same offense.[26]
Accordingly, an administrative and a criminal case arising from a single act must be disposed of separately, either simultaneously or one after the other. They must be disposed of according to the facts and laws respectively applicable to them.[27]

In the instant case, the act committed by Geronimo constitutes simple misconduct and a violation of the Franking Privilege Law. The latter, however, is penal in nature. But what exactly is penal law? In the case of Inmates of the New Bilibid Prison v. De Lima,[28] the Court clarified that:
A penal provision defines a crime or provides a punishment for one.

Penal laws and laws which, while not penal in nature, have provisions defining offenses and prescribing penalties for their violation.
","ACCORDINGLY, the Court finds respondent Dwight Aldwin S. Geronimo, Sheriff IV, Branch 121, Regional Trial Court, Imus, Cavite, GUILTY of simple misconduct for which he is FINED PHP 18,000.00, with a stern warning that a repetition of the same offense will be dealt with more severely."
"A.M. No. P-24-121 (Formerly OCA IPI No. 18-4890-P), July 30, 2024","RICKY HAO MONION, COMPLAINANT, VS. VICENTE S. SICAT, JR., SHERIFF IV, OFFICE OF THE CLERK OF COURT, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, ANGELES CITY, PAMPANGA, RESPONDENT.","Before this Court is an administrative case filed by Ricky Hao Monion (Monion) against Vicente S. Sicat, Jr. (Sicat), Sheriff IV stationed at the Office of the Clerk of Court, Regional Trial Court, Angeles City, Pampanga for abuse of authority and violation of Republic Act No. 3019.[1]

Monion is the private complainant in Criminal Case Nos. 15-241 and 15-244 against Bernadette Mullet Potts (Potts) for violation of Batas Pambansa Blg. 22 pending before the Municipal Circuit Trial Court of Mabalacat-Magalang, Pampanga.[2]

The Municipal Circuit Trial Court rendered a Decision based on a Compromise Agreement, which prompted the issuance of a Writ of Execution dated May 5, 2016.[3]

The Writ of Execution was addressed to the Sheriff and/or Deputy Sheriff of the Office of the Clerk of Court of the Regional Trial Court of Angeles City, Pampanga, ordering the latter to cause the execution of the judgment to levy the goods and chattels of Potts, and to make their sale in accordance with the procedure laid down in Rule 39 of the Rules of Court.[4]

Monion filed his Complaint Affidavit before the Office of the Court Administrator. He alleged that on January 4, 2018, Sicat willfully and purposely submitted to the Register of Deeds of Angeles City, Pampanga a Notice to Lift the Levy on the property of Potts without the necessary court order.[5] The property consists of a parcel of land covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 045-2015007354.

Monion claimed that Sicat deceived the Registry of Deeds when the latter provided misleading statements in the Notice stating that ""Bernadette Potts has made several payments to Mr. Ricky Monion that would extinguish the levy of the property.""[6]

The Notice sent by Sicat to the Registry of Deeds caused the cancellation of the levy and enabled the buyer, Glenn Facuri Garcia (Garcia), to transfer the said parcel of land to his name. Because of this, Transfer Certificate of Title No. 045-2015007354 was cancelled, and a new Transfer Certificate of Title No. 045-2018002601 under Garcia's name was issued.[7]

Monion also alleged that Sicat was always hesitant to act on his follow-ups regarding the levy of Potts's other personal properties, and that he was only given alibis about the status of the execution.[8]

Finally, Monion believed that Sicat solicited an undisclosed significant amount of money to enable Potts to release her property from levy and transfer it to Garcia's name.[9]

In Sicat's Comment/Explanation, he stated that he has been in the Judiciary for almost 40 years, or since April 1980, carrying and upholding the vision of a good and dedicated public servant. He also stated that he would be retiring by 2020.[10]

Sicat vehemently denied the imputations against him for being supposedly false, malicious, and baseless. He claimed that his actions were purely based on procedural law, customs, and practice in effecting execution.[11]

Regarding the Notice of Lifting of Levy on Execution without court order, Sicat explained that Potts went to his office and informed him that he deviated from the established procedure in the execution of judgments when he levied, on a second lien, her real property to satisfy the ruling in favor of Monion. After finding basis in Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, which provides that personal property of the judgment debtor must first be exhausted before going after real property, Sicat made the necessary release of the levy on execution.[12]

Sicat also explained that every time Monion visited him to check on the execution, he would constantly go to the subject premises. Unfortunately, no person or resident was present every time he went since the property was always padlocked.[13]

Further, Sicat insisted that he was not aware of any subsequent sale and that he did not receive any amount in relation to or in consideration of his actions.[14]

Sicat also stated that Monion has filed several dubious complaints against other co-sheriffs and court employees allegedly without any point of satisfaction, always complaining and insisting why it cannot be done his way.[15]

On September 18, 2020, the Office of the Court Administrator submitted its report with the following recommendations:
this administrative complaint be RE-DOCKETED as a regular administrative matter;

respondent Vicente S. Sicat, Jr., Sheriff IV, Office of the Clerk of Court, RTC, Angeles City, Pampanga, be found GUILTY of simple neglect of duty; and

considering that respondent Vicente S. Sicat, Jr. has been previously found guilty of simple neglect of duty and suspended for six (6) months with a stern warning that a repetition of the same shall be dealt with more severely and considering further that he has been adjudged guilty of various offenses, that he be DISMISSED from the service with forfeiture of all benefits and privileges, except accrued leave credits, with prejudice to re-employment in any branch or instrumentality of the government, including government-owned or controlled corporations.[16]
The Office of the Court Administrator found that Sicat cannot be held administratively liable for abuse of authority and violation of Republic Act No. 3019 due to Monion's failure to provide any substantial proof.[17]
","Court employees, as public servants, are bound to live up to the strictest standards in the performance of their duties. A recurring conduct of a court employee marked by numerous administrative violations, deserves nothing but the gravest penalty of dismissal from service.","This Court has previously held that a sheriff's deviation from the procedure laid down by the Rules warrants disciplinary action.[30] Thus, the Court finds respondent guilty of simple neglect of duty.

Time and again, the Court has emphasized that sheriffs play an important role in the administration of justice. As agents of the law, high standards are expected of them. Sheriffs must discharge their duties with utmost care and diligence because in serving the court's writs and processes and in implementing its orders, they cannot afford to make a mistake without affecting the administration of justice.[31]

At this juncture, it is timely to discuss respondent's 40-year service in the Judiciary as summarized by the Office of the Court Administrator:
On October 16, 1998, respondent was fined in the amount of PHP 1,000.00 for neglect of duty and incompetence in the performance of his official duties.[32]

On September 19, 2002, respondent was fined in the amount of PHP 10,000.00 for abuse of authority, gross ignorance of the law, and manifest partiality, with a stern warning that a repetition of a similar infraction will be dealt with more severely.[33]

On March 6, 2003, respondent was found guilty of simple misconduct and inefficiency and incompetence in the performance of official duties, which was meted with a penalty of suspension from the service for one month, without pay and other fringe benefits including leave credits. He was also fined in the amount of PHP 10,000.00, with a stern warning that a repetition of the same offense shall be dealt with more severely.[34]

On November 14, 2007, respondent was again found guilty of simple misconduct, which was meted with a penalty of suspension from the service for six months, without pay and other fringe benefits including leave credits, with a severe warning that a repetition of the same offense shall be dealt with more severely.[35]

On January 17, 2011, respondent was found liable for simple neglect of duty, which was meted with a penalty of suspension from the service for six months, without pay, with a stern warning that a repetition of the same act shall be dealt with more severely.[36]

On July 27, 2016, respondent was meted with a penalty of reprimand, with stern warning for his habitual tardiness.[37]
In sum, respondent has been liable for six administrative complaints prior to this present Complaint.

The Office of the Court Administrator, in its report, turned to the 2017 Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service as basis for the imposition of the penalty of dismissal. We disagree.","ACCORDINGLY, this Court finds respondent Vicente S. Sicat, Jr., Sheriff IV of the Regional Trial Court, Office of the Clerk of Court, Angeles City, Pampanga, GUILTY of simple neglect of duty and is hereby DISMISSED FROM SERVICE, with forfeiture of all retirement benefits, except accrued leave credits, and perpetual disqualification from employment in any branch of the government or any of its agencies or instrumentalities, including government-owned and -controlled corporations."

ILECO I, ILECO II, and ILECO III's certificate of franchise will expire on August 22, 2053, December 12, 2029, and August 10, 2039, respectively.[3]

On March 9, 2019, Republic Act No. 11212 took effect, which granted MORE Electric and Power Corporation (MORE) a franchise to establish, operate, and maintain an electric power distribution system in Iloilo City. However, on August 30, 2022, Republic Act No. 11918 amended and expanded MORE's franchise area to include 15 municipalities and one city that were previously within the exclusive franchise area of petitioners. This prompted petitioners to challenge Section 1 of Republic Act No. 11918, which reads:
SEC. 1. Nature and Scope of Franchise.  Subject to the provisions of the Constitution and applicable laws, rules, and regulations, there is hereby granted to MORE Electric and Power Corporation, hereunder referred to as the Grantee, its successors or assignees, a franchise to establish, operate, and maintain for commercial purposes and in the public interest, a distribution system for the conveyance of electric power to end users in the cities of Iloilo and Passi and the municipalities of Alimodian, Leganes, Leon, New Lucena, Pavia, San Miguel, Santa Barbara, Zarraga, Anilao, Banate, Barotac Nuevo, Dingle, Dueñas, Dumangas, and San Enrique, in the Province of Iloilo.

As used in thus Act, distribution system refers to the system of the wires and associated facilities including subtransmission lines belonging to or used by a franchised distribution utility extending between the delivery point on the national transmission system or generating facility and the metering point or facility of the end-user.[4]
Petitioners assert that MORE's expanded areas overlapped with their franchise areas. Specifically, for ILECO I, the overlapping areas are the municipalities of Alimodian, Leganes, Leon, Pavia, San Miguel, and Santa Barbara; for ILECO II, these are the city of Passi and municipalities of Barotac Nuevo, Dingle, Dueñas, Dumangas, New Lucena, San Enrique, and Zarraga; and for ILECO III, these are the municipalities of Anilao and Banate.[5]","Under the Constitution, the crucial role of determining the existence of common good that would warrant the amendment, alteration, or repeal of a franchise lies with the legislature. Pursuant to this mandate, our legislature breathed flesh and blood through the enactment of a law that would promote competition in the electricity sector. Thus, the Court must tread with deliberate care in striking down this law since any misstep may unravel the people's will through their elected representatives. In the same vein, to undo an act of legislature, there needs to be a compelling reason, which is lacking in this case.

The Case

This is a Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition with Prayer for the Issuance of Temporary Restraining Order and Writ of Preliminary Injunction[1] under Rule 65 that seeks to assail the constitutionality of Section 1 of Republic Act No. 11918[2] for violation of exclusive franchises, non-impairment of contracts, due process, and equal protection.","The petition is DISMISSED and PHILRECA's motion to intervene is DENIED.

Preliminarily, it bears pointing out that the instant petition falls under the exceptions to the doctrine of hierarchy of courts. Under this doctrine, a direct invocation of the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction to issue extraordinary writs should be allowed only when there are special and important reasons therefor, clearly and specifically set out in the petition. This is an established policy that is necessary to prevent inordinate demands upon the Court's time and attention which are better devoted to those matters within its exclusive jurisdiction, and to prevent further over-crowding of the Court's docket.[21]

Here, petitioners deemed the following exceptions as applicable to their case, namely: (a) when there are genuine issues of constitutionality that must be addressed at the most immediate time, such as assailing the constitutionality of actions of both legislative and executive branches of the government; (b) when the issues involved are of transcendental importance; (c) cases of first impression; (d) the constitutional issues raised are better decided by this Court; (e) the time element; and (f) the petition includes questions that are dictated by public welfare and the advancement of public policy, or demanded by the broader interest of justice.[22]

We agree with petitioners that this Court may take cognizance of the case at the first instance, considering that the foregoing reasons were clearly laid down in the petition, as well as the presence of genuine issues of constitutionality and involvement of questions on public welfare, advancement of public policy, and broader interest of justice. Nonetheless, as will be discussed at length below, the petition must be dismissed.

I.
Petitioners do not enjoy any Constitutional right to exclusive franchise over its coverage areas


We deem it necessary to state at the outset that exclusive franchises are not sanctioned by the Constitution. Moreover, franchises are subject to amendment, alteration, or repeal by the Congress when the common good so requires. Section 11, Article XII of the 1987 Constitution provides:
Section 11. No franchise, certificate, or any other form of authorization for the operation of a public utility shall be granted except to citizens of the Philippines or to corporations or associations organized under the laws of the Philippines, at least sixty per centum of whose capital is owned by such citizens; nor shall such franchise, certificate, or authorization be exclusive in character or for a longer period than fifty years. Neither shall any such franchise or right be granted except under the condition that it shall be subject to amendment, alteration, or repeal by the Congress when the common good so requires. The State shall encourage equity participation in public utilities by the general public. The participation of foreign investors in the governing body of any public utility enterprise shall be limited to their proportionate share in its capital, and all the executive and managing officers of such corporation or association must be citizens of the Philippines.
The language of the Constitution is clear. Franchises granted by the government cannot be exclusive in character. In the Court's En Banc ruling in Tawang Multi-Purpose Cooperative v. La Trinidad Water District,[23] We had occasion to exhaustively explain said provision of the Constitution. The 1935, 1973 and 1987 Constitutions all expressly prohibit exclusivity of franchise, viz:
The President, Congress and the Court cannot create directly franchises for the operation of a public utility that are exclusive in character. The 1935, 1973 and 1987 Constitutions expressly and clearly prohibit the creation of franchises that are exclusive in character. Section 8, Article XIII of the 1935 Constitution states that:

No franchise, certificate, or any other form of authorization for the operation of a public utility shall be granted except to citizens of the Philippines or to corporations or other entities organized under the laws of the Philippines, sixty per centum of the capital of which is owned by citizens of the Philippines, nor shall such franchise, certificate or authorization be exclusive in character or for a longer period than fifty years. (Emphasis supplied)
Section 5, Article XIV of the 1973 Constitution states that:
No franchise, certificate, or any other form of authorization for the operation of a public utility shall be granted except to citizens of the Philippines or to corporations or associations organized under the laws of the Philippines at least sixty per centum of the capital of which is owned by such citizens, nor shall such franchise, certificate or authorization be exclusive in character or for a longer period than fifty years. (Emphasis supplied)
Section 11, Article XII of the 1987 Constitution states that:
No franchise, certificate, or any other form of authorization for the operation of a public utility shall be granted except to citizens of the Philippines or to corporations or associations organized under the laws of the Philippines, at least sixty per centum of whose capital is owned by such citizens, nor shall such franchise, certificate or authorization be exclusive in character or for a longer period than fifty years. (Emphasis supplied)

Plain words do not require explanation. The 1935, 1973 and 1987 Constitutions are clear  franchises for the operation of a public utility cannot be exclusive in character. The 1935, 1973 and 1987 Constitutions expressly and clearly state that, ""nor shall such franchise[. . .] be exclusive in character."" There is no exception.

When the law is clear, there is nothing for the courts to do but to apply it. The duty of the Court is to apply the law the way it is worded. In Security Bank and Trust Company v. Regional Trial Court of Makati, Branch 61, the Court held that:","ACCORDINGLY, in view of the foregoing, the instant Petition is hereby DISMISSED."
"G.R. No. 266636, July 29, 2024 ","PHILHARBOR FERRIES AND PORT SERVICES, INC., PETITIONER, VS. FRANCIS C. CARLOS, RESPONDENT.","Philharbor is a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the Republic of the Philippines.[5] It is engaged in the business of commercial shipping, shipping management, and other maritime activities.[6]

In its Complaint,[7] Philharbor alleged that on December 1, 2002, Carlos was appointed as chief operating officer of its Port and Ferry Operations, which appointment was renewable annually by its Board of Directors. The scope of his responsibility included, among others, ""maintain[ing] the ship in class and in efficient and seaworthy condition with manager's power to negotiate and approve repair and maintenance contracts.""[8] In an Appointment Letter,[9] Carlos, as the chief operating officer of the Archipelago Groupa group of subsidiary corporations, including Philharborwas charged with the following responsibilities:
Shall plan, organize, and control all the day-to-day activities of the Company;
Shall collaborate with the President/ Chief Executive Officer in the overall administration of the Company;
Shall be responsible for the management of the Company's activities to ensure maximum profits commensurate with the best interest of shareholders, customers, employees and the public;
Shall develop and implement space-planning strategies to accommodate current and future organizational needs;
Shall provide a high level of customer relations and service, and shall ensure compliance with Company policies and procedure;
Shall assist in attaining established Company's operational and financial goals;
Shall perform management review/ operations review of all business units and support units;
Shall initiate fiscal policies to strengthen financial monitoring and management among companies within the group; [and]
Shall act as Designated Person Ashore of the Company and is responsible for the implementation of the Safety Management System for owned, operated, shipmanaged[,] and chartered vessels[.][10]
In line with his responsibilities, Carlos was authorized to approve the capital expenditure for the repair and maintenance of the vessels owned and operated by Philharbor. Before any disbursement for such purpose, an application of authority for capital projects expenditure must first be approved by Carlos.[11]

Philharbor further alleged that its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Christopher Pastrana (Christopher), even appointed Carlos as trustee for his Philharbor shares of stock because of his apparent probity.[12]

After Carlos's departure from the corporation on August 10, 2009,[13] a routine audit was conducted by the Accounting Department of Philharbor. It was discovered that Carlos, during his tenure as chief operating officer, acted fraudulently and negligently in approving authorities for capital projects expenditure to the damage and prejudice of Philharbor.[14]

The audit found that in the mandatory dry docking of M/V Maharlika Dos, the approved authority for capital projects expenditure was PHP 2,995,283.50.[15] However, the total actual expenditure was PHP 15,599,593.64. As a result, Philharbor incurred losses in the amount of PHP 12,604,310.14.[16]

In a similar manner, in the mandatory dry docking of M/V Maharlika Siete, the approved authority for capital projects expenditure was PHP 10,753,730.50.[17] The total actual expenditure was PHP 15,284,697.66, resulting to a financial loss in the amount of PHP 4,530,967.16.[18]

Thus, on August 17, 2009, the Archipelago Group, which includes Philharbor, through counsel, sent a Demand Letter[19] to Carlos, demanding the payment of PHP 30,000,000.00 as loss incurred.[20]","This Court resolves a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] assailing the Decision[2] and Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA), which affirmed with modification the Decision[4] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) that dismissed the Amended Complaint for damages filed by Philharbor Ferries and Port Services, Inc. (Philharbor) against its former Chief Operating Officer Francis C. Carlos (Carlos) and ordered the payment of moral damages, exemplary damages, and attorney's fees in favor of Carlos.","The Petition is devoid of merit.

To begin, it bears underscoring that this Court's jurisdiction in a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court is limited to the review of questions of law.[67] To invoke the discretionary power of review of this Court, procedural standards require, among others, that ""the questions raised in it are of such substance as to warrant consideration.""[68] We explained thus:
[Q]uestions raised in a Rule 45 Petition must be of such substance as to warrant consideration is to say that judicial review shall proceed ""only when there are special and important reasons."" The use of the conjunctive ""and"" vis-à-vis the adjectives ""special"" and ""important"" means that the reasons invoked for review must be of distinctly significant consequence and value. Rule 45, Section 6 (a) and (b) illustrate the gravity of reasons which would move this Court to act:
 
(a)
When the court a quo has decided a question of substance, not theretofore determined by the Supreme Court, or has decided it in a way probably not in accord with law or with the applicable decisions of the Supreme Court; or


(b)
When the court a quo has so far departed from the accepted and usual course of judicial proceedings, or so far sanctioned such departure by a lower court, as to call for an exercise of the power of supervision.[69] (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)
When the issue raised pertains to the truth or falsity of the alleged facts, requiring a re-evaluation and recalibration of the evidence on record,[70] it is a question of fact beyond the ambit of a Rule 45 Petition. In such case, this Court has the discretionary authority under Rule 45, Section 5 to deny outright or in due course the petition.[71]

However, in exceptional instances, this Court reviews factual issues:
(1) When the conclusion is a finding grounded entirely on speculation, surmises or conjectures; (2) When the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible; (3) Where there is a grave abuse of discretion; (4) When the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts; (5) When the findings of fact are conflicting; (6) When the Court of Appeals, in making its findings, went beyond the issues of the case and the same is contrary to the admissions of both appellant and appellee; (7) The findings of the Court of Appeals are contrary to those of the trial court; (8) When the findings of fact are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based; (9) When the facts set forth in the petition as well as in the petitioner's main and reply briefs are not disputed by the respondents; and (10) The finding of fact of the Court of Appeals is premised on the supposed absence of evidence and is contradicted by the evidence on record.[72] (Citations omitted)
In this case, Philharbor asks this Court to review anew its allegations of gross negligence and bad faith against Carlos in failing to monitor and manage the dry-docking expenses that resulted in serious losses to the corporation.

It is settled that the existence of bad faith and the entitlement to damages[73] are factual in nature and would necessarily entail a review of the evidence presented during the trial. Contrary to Philharbor's allegations,[74] none of the well-recognized exceptions exist in the instant case.

We underscore that this Court is not a trier of facts.[75] It will not entertain questions of facts as the factual findings of the appellate courts are final, binding, and conclusive on the parties and upon this Court when supported by substantial evidence on record. It is not duty-bound to analyze, review, and weigh the evidence all over again in the absence of any showing of any arbitrariness, capriciousness, or palpable error.[76]

Even if this Court would proceed to discuss the issues raised, the Petition still fails.

We now delve into the issue on whether the CA erred in not declaring that Carlos was negligent or in bad faith in the performance of his duties as chief operating officer.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DENIED. The December 19, 2022 Decision and March 30, 2023 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 112692 are AFFIRMED.

Petitioner Philharbor Ferries and Port Services, Inc. is ORDERED to pay the respondent Francis C. Carlos the following amounts: PHP 300,000.00 as moral damages; PHP 200,000.00 as exemplary damages; and PHP 100,000.00 as attorney's fees.

All damages awarded shall earn a 6% interest per annum from the finality of this Decision until full payment."

"G.R. No. 265123, July 29, 2024","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PETITIONER, VS. RONNEL BUENAFE BERCADEZ, RESPONDENT.","On or about 18th day of March 2019, in the City of Makati, the Philippines, accused, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously carry outside of his residence, a bladed weapon (knife) not being used as a necessary tool or implement to earn a livelihood, nor used in connection therewith.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[8]

Bercadez moved to quash[9] the Information and raised the following arguments: (1) the Information against him failed to allege that his alleged crime was in furtherance of, or to abet, or in connection with subversion, rebellion, insurrection, lawless violation, criminality, chaos, or public disorder; and (2) Presidential Decree No. 9 (P.D. No. 9), as amended by B.P. Blg. 6, already ceased to have any legal force given that the spirit behind the said lawsthat is, to strengthen and give teeth to the declaration of martial law by former President Ferdinand E. Marcoshas also ceased.[10]

In its April 25, 2019 Resolution,[11] the MeTC emphasized that B.P. Blg. 6 is meant to be read in conjunction with P.D. No. 9, the law it amends. Since B.P. Blg. 6 merely amended the penalty and provided for exceptions to the offense of possession of weapons, the information for violation of the said law must still allege two essential elements as provided in P.D. No. 9. These elements are: (1) that the carrying outside of one's residence of any bladed, blunt, or pointed weapon is not used as a necessary tool or implement for a livelihood or in pursuit of a lawful activity; and (2) that the act of carrying the weapon was either in furtherance of, or to abet, or in connection with subversion, rebellion, insurrection, lawless violence, criminality, chaos, or public disorder. Since the Information failed to allege that the possession of the knife was being used in furtherance of, or to abet, or in connection with subversion, rebellion, insurrection, lawless violence, criminality, chaos, or public disorder, the second element is lacking. Thus, the MeTC disposed the case as follows:","This Court resolves the Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] assailing the Decision[2] and the Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA), which reversed the Decision[4] and Order[5] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC). The RTC set aside the April 25, 2019 and May 2, 2019 Resolutions[6] of the Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC), which granted Ronnel Buenafe Bercadez's (Bercadez) Motion to Quash the Information filed against him on the ground that the facts charged do not constitute an offense. As such, the assailed CA rulings found that the MeTC correctly quashed the information filed against Bercadez and consequently reinstated the MeTC Resolutions.
Before the MeTC, the arresting officers testified that they arrested Bercadez after they were approached by some people who informed them of an alleged attempted robbery by Bercadez. During the arrest, one of the officers felt and then saw a knife tucked in Bercadez's waist. Bercadez was eventually charged of violation of Batas Pambansa Blg. 6 (B.P. Blg. 6) in an Information,[7] the accusatory portion of which reads:","The Petition is bereft of merit.

To reiterate, the Information against petitioner charged him with ""unlawfully and feloniously carry[ing] outside of his residence, a bladed weapon (knife) not being used as a necessary tool or implement to earn a livelihood, nor used in connection therewith.""[35] This allegation constitutes the crime of violation of Section 1 of B.P. Blg. 6, which reads:

SECTION 1. Paragraph three of Presidential Decree Numbered Nine is hereby amended to read as follows:

3. It is unlawful to carry outside of one's residence any bladed, pointed or blunt weapon such as 'knife', 'spear', 'pana', 'dagger', 'bolo', 'barong', 'kris', or 'chako', except where such articles are being used as necessary tools or implements to earn a livelihood or in pursuit of a lawful activity. Any person found guilty thereof shall suffer the penalty of imprisonment of not less than one month nor more than one year or a fine of not less than Two Hundred Pesos nor more than Two Thousand Pesos, or both such imprisonment and fine as the Court may direct.

A review of Section 1 of B.P. Blg. 6 shows that the same is merely an amendatory provision to Paragraph 3 of P.D. No. 9. Prior to the amendment, the relevant portions of P.D. No. 9 read:

WHEREAS, pursuant to Proclamation No. 1081 dated September 21, 1972, the Philippines has been placed under a state of martial law;

WHEREAS, by virtue of said Proclamation No. 1081, General Order No. 6 dated September 22, 1972 and General Order No. 7 dated September 23, 1972, have been promulgated by me;

WHEREAS, subversion, rebellion, insurrection, lawless violence, criminally, chaos and public disorder mentioned in the aforesaid Proclamation No. 1081 are committed and abetted by the use of firearms, explosives and other deadly weapons;","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED. The August 31, 2022 Decision and January 5, 2023 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 166195 are AFFIRMED. The Information against Ronnel Buenafe Bercadez for violation of Batas Pambansa Blg. 6 is quashed without prejudice to the filing of an Information charging the proper offense and subject to the rules on prescription."
