"G.R. No. 260434, January 31, 2024","NOW TELECOM COMPANY, INC., PETITIONER, VS. NATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION, RESPONDENT.","On January 8, 2018, the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) issued Memorandum Order (M.O.) No. 001, series of 2018, entitled, ""Policy Guidelines for the Entry of a New Major Player in the Public Telecommunications Market,"" in compliance with the directive of then President Rodrigo R. Duterte (President Duterte) to fast-track the entry of a new major player (NMP) to compete in the Philippine telecommunications market.

The said memorandum order provides that the NMP applicant must (1) possess a valid congressional telecommunications franchise, and the NTC shall issue the appropriate licenses/authorities to the winner after the bid; (2) not be a subsidiary, affiliate, or have any corporate or financial interest with the Globe Group or PLDT Group of Companies; and (3) have a written and binding commitment from a foreign joint venture company, if applicable.[5] It also provides that the applicant must have the highest committed investment for the first five years, and such commitment must be secured with a performance bond.[6] The NMP shall be assigned radio frequency bands that are available for assignment.[7] The NTC was directed to promulgate the memorandum circular containing the Terms of Reference (TOR) for the selection and assignment of radio frequencies for the purpose.[8]

On April 6, 2018, former President Duterte issued Administrative Order (A.O.) No. 11, series of 2018, creating an Oversight Committee to assist the NTC in formulating the TOR, oversee its compliance, ensure timely implementation, and exercise such incidental powers as may be necessary.[9]

After the conduct of public hearing, and pursuant to the foregoing, the NTC promulgated the subject Circular on September 20, 2018.[10] The Oversight Committee and the NTC decided that the best way to select the NMP was through a public, open, and competitive selection process.[11]

Thereafter, the DICT and the NTC published the timeline for the implementation of the subject Circular.[12] The timeline stated that the said Circular shall take effect on October 6, 2018; the Invitation to Bid shall be published on October 7, 2018; the issuance of the selection documents shall be on October 8, 2018; and the submission and opening of bids shall be on November 7, 2018.[13]

On October 8, 2018, NOW Telecom filed before the RTC a Complaint for Injunction[14] with application for an ex-parte temporary restraining order (TRO), 20-day TRO, and/or WPI against the NTC.[15]
","This case involves the Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] (Petition) filed by petitioner NOW Telecom Company, Inc. (NOW Telecom) assailing the Decision[2] (assailed Decision) and the Resolution[3] (assailed Resolution) of the Court of Appeals (CA), which affirmed the Order[4] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC).

In the said Order, the RTC denied NOW Telecom 's application for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction (WPI) against respondent National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) to restrain the implementation of certain provisions of NTC Memorandum Circular (M.C.) No. 09-09-2018 entitled, ""Rules and Regulations on the Selection Process for a New Major Player in the Philippine Telecommunications Market"" (subject Circular).","The Petition is denied.

NOW Telecom's application for
injunctive relief has been rendered
moot and academic

At the outset, it is worth noting that, during the pendency of this case, Mindanao Islamic Telephone Company, Inc. (MISLATEL) was selected as the NMP by virtue of the subject Circular, and was accordingly issued a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN).[35]

It is an established rule that injunction will not issue to restrain the performance of an act already done, or to prevent events that have already happened.[36] When the act sought to be prevented by injunction has already been performed or completed, ""nothing more can be enjoined or restrained; a writ of injunction then becomes moot and academic, and the court, by mere issuance of the writ, can no longer stop or undo the act. To do so would violate the sole purpose of a prohibitive injunction, that is, to preserve the status quo.[37]

In this case, the act sought to be restrained by NOW Telecom has already been done. The actual implementation of the selection process of the NMP pursuant to the subject Circular, and the resulting assignment of the allocated radio frequencies for the NMP to MISLATEL have rendered NOW Telecom's prayer for injunctive relief moot and academic. Accordingly, NOW Telecom's application for WPI should be denied.
","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari filed by petitioner NOW Telecom Company, Inc., is hereby DENIED. The Decision dated May 24, 2021 and the Resolution dated April 12, 2022 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 158237 are AFFIRMED."

PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","The case stemmed from an Information[5] dated July 30, 2007, that charged petitioner with the crime of Estafa, defined and penalized under Article 315 (2) (a) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).

The CA found Conrado Fernando, Jr. (petitioner) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Estafa, but it deleted the award of actual damages in the amount of PHP 37,400.00.","At the outset, the Court notes that Atty.

However, considering that petitioner's liberty is at stake, the Court resolves to brush aside the procedural infirmities of the petition and give due course to the petition in the higher interest of substantial justice.

The Court shall now delve into the merits of the present petition. Petitioner filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.

"G.R. No. 256194, January 31, 2024","REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, PETITIONER, VS. HEIRS OF ROGELIO P. LAUDES, NAMELY, VICTORIA ORDIZ VDA. DE LAUDES, ROVI ROVILLE LAUDES-CORNELIO, ROVIN LAUDES, ROVIROSE LAUDES AND ROVICOR LAUDES, REPRESENTED BY VICTORIA ORDIZ VDA. DE LAUDES, RESPONDENTS.","On September 19, 1984, Rogelio P. Laudes (Rogelio) died when the Chevrolet Truck owned by Jesus E. Enova (Jesus) and driven by Elias Pilo (Pilo) hit him. As a result of Rogelio's death, his heirs filed both civil and criminal cases against Jesus and Pilo. Both Civil Case No. 5175 and Criminal Case No. 4040 were consolidated before the RTC, Branch 40 (RTC Branch 40). In its Joint Decision, dated January 6, 1989, RTC Branch 40 found Pilo guilty for reckless imprudence resulting to homicide, slight physical injuries, and damage to property, while Jesus was ordered to pay civil liability in the total amount of PHP 205,000.00.[5]

Thereafter, a Writ of Execution was issued, followed by the issuance of a Notice of Levy against the properties of Jesus, including those covered by TD No. 006-0168 and TD No. 006-0279. The sheriff then issued a Notice of Sheriff's Sale, setting the levied properties of Jesus for public auction on September 25, 1990, in satisfaction of the civil liability adjudged by RTC Branch 40.[6]

During the said public auction, Victoria emerged as the highest bidder and was awarded the properties levied, giving Jesus and his heirs, assigns, administrator or executor one (1) year from the date of the auction sale to redeem the said properties. However, the subject properties were not redeemed. Thus, the Sheriff's Final Deed, dated October 16, 1991, was issued. Thereafter, a Writ of Possession was issued by RTC Branch 40.[7]

In the Sheriff's Return, dated January 3, 1992, the sheriff was able to place the Heirs of Laudes in possession of some of the properties including the property with TD No. 006-0279. However, the sheriff failed to do the same for the other properties, including the property with TD No. 006-0168.[8]

Upon issuance of an Alias Writ of Possession, the sheriff, in his Partial Return, dated January 11, 1993, reported that the Heirs of Laudes were again dispossessed of the property with TD No. 006-0168 after placing them in possession on January 8, 1993, and that the property with TD No. 006-0279 has not yet been placed in their possession.[9]

Meanwhile, records reveal that Gregorio Zantua, Jr. (Zantua), Jose Enova (Jose), Leopoldo Enova (Leopoldo), and Ricardo Lotik (Lotik) filed a complaint before RTC Branch 40, docketed as Civil Case No. 6118, against the Heirs of Laudes for recovery of real properties and annulment of sale. They alleged that the properties subject of the public auction were sold to them prior to the levy made by the sheriff. Zantua, Jose, and Lotik eventually withdrew as party-plaintiffs in Civil Case No. 6118, but filed separate civil cases for the same cause of action against Victoria.[10]","This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari (Petition),[1] filed under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the Decision,[2] dated June 30, 2020, and the Resolution,[3] dated March 9, 2021, of the Court of Appeals (CA), in CA-G.R. CV No. 111651. The CA affirmed the Joint Decision,[4] dated June 21, 2018, of the Regional Trial Court of Daet, Camarines Norte (RTC), Branch 39 (RTC Branch 39), which ruled that Victoria Ordiz Vda. de Laudes (Victoria), Rovi Rovile Laudes-Cornelio (Rovi), Rovin Laudes (Rovin), Rovirose Laudes (Rovirose), and Rovicor Laudes (Rovicor), all represented by Victoria (collectively, the Heirs of Laudes), were able to prove that the properties covered by Tax Declaration (TD) No. 006-0168 and TD No. 006-0279 (collectively, the subject properties), that they sought to be registered, were alienable and disposable lands, and that their predecessors-in-interest have been in open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession and occupation under a bona fide claim of ownership over the subject properties.","The Petition is meritorious.

Classification of lands

Pursuant to the Regalian Doctrine (Jura Regalia), all lands of the public domain belong to the State. This means that the State is the source of any asserted right to ownership of land, and is charged with the conservation of such patrimony.[39] As elucidated in Federation of Coron, Busuanga, Palawan Farmer's Association, Inc. v. The Secretary of Department of Environment and Natural Resources:[40]
The Regalian Doctrine was embodied as early as in the Philippine Bill of 1902. Under Section 12 thereof, it was stated that all properties of the Philippine Islands that were acquired by the United States through the treaty with Spain shall be under the control of the Government of the Philippine Islands, to wit:
SECTION 12. That all the property and rights which may have been acquired in the Philippine Islands by the United States under the treaty of peace with Spain, signed December tenth, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, except such land or other property as shall be designated by the President of the United States for military and other reservations of the Government of the United States, are hereby placed under the control of the Government of said Islands, to be administered for the benefit of the inhabitants thereof, except as provided in this Act.
The only exception in the Regalian Doctrine is native title to land, or ownership of land by Filipinos by virtue of a claim of ownership since time immemorial and independent of any grant from the Spanish Crown. In Cariño v. Insular Government, the United States Supreme Court at that time held that:
It might, perhaps, be proper and sufficient to say that when, as far back as testimony or memory goes, the land has been held by individuals under a claim of private ownership, it will be presumed to have been held in the same way from before the Spanish conquest, and never to have been public land.[41] (Citations omitted)
Lands may either be of (1) public dominion or (2) of private ownership.[42] Lands under public dominion are either (1) those intended for public use, such as roads, canals, rivers, torrents, ports and bridges constructed by the State, banks, shores, roadsteads, and others of similar character; or (2) those which belong to the State, without being for public use, and are intended for some public service or for the development of the national wealth.[43]

Hence, based on Article 420 of the Civil Code, there are three kinds of property of public dominion: (1) those for public use, which may be used by anybody, such as roads and canals; (2) those for public service, which may be used only by certain duly authorized persons, although used for the benefit of the public; and (3) those used for the development of national wealth, such as our natural resources. Lands of public dominion remain part of the inalienable land of the public domain unless the State is shown to have reclassified or alienated them to private persons.[44]","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari filed by the Republic of the Philippines is PARTLY GRANTED.

The case is REMANDED to the Court of Appeals for reception of evidence on the subject properties' land classification status based on the parameters set forth in Section 7 of Republic Act No. 11573. The Court of Appeals is directed to resolve the case with utmost dispatch."
"G.R. No. 264158, January 31, 2024","MELBA ALCANTARA DENUSTA, PETITIONER, VS. MIGRANT WORKERS MANPOWER AGENCY, INC., THERESITA M. CERALDE, AND K&G MANPOWER SERVICES, LTD., RESPONDENTS.","Petitioner filed a complaint for illegal dismissal, underpayment of salaries, damages, payment of wages for the unexpired portion of the contract, and attorney's fees against Migrant Workers Manpower Agency, Inc. (Migrant), a placement and recruitment agency, K&G Manpower Services, Ltd. (K&G), Migrant's foreign principal, and Theresita M. Ceralde (Ceralde), in her capacity as Migrant's president (collectively, respondents).[4]

In the complaint, petitioner averred that she was hired as a Kitchen Hand for The Lunch Box Ltd. (Lunch Box) in Rarotonga, Cook Islands under a two-year employment contract executed with Migrant and K&G. Based on her contract, she would receive a weekly salary of NZ$400.00 or NZ$1,600.00 per month. On May 22, 2019, she arrived in the Cook Islands and started her employment. She was repatriated to the Philippines on November 17, 2019.[5]

During her employment, petitioner alleged that her employer, Charlene Tairea (Tairea) committed several violations of her contract of employment. She was paid less than the agreed rate and was not provided with accommodation, transportation, or food allowances. She was considered a part-time employee and was not paid her salary during holidays. Petitioner likewise averred that she was maltreated by her foreign employer's family members. Due to her predicaments in the hands of her foreign employer, she claimed that respondents were guilty of illegal dismissal.[6]

Worse, when petitioner informed Migrant of her situation, Migrant did not act on it. Furthermore, before she was permitted to return home, respondents forced her to sign a Quitclaim, but she refused. Instead, she executed a Letter of Dispute narrating her ordeal.[7]","This Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assails the Resolutions dated June 14, 2022[2] and October 19, 2022[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 171524, which dismissed the Petition for Certiorari filed by Melba Alcantara Denusta (petitioner) for being filed beyond the reglementary period.","The instant petition is meritorious.

The CA erred in denying the motion for extension of time to file Petition for Certiorari and dismissing the same for being filed beyond the reglementary period
In the instant petition, petitioner begs this Court to relax the procedures and rule on the substantive issues raised in the petition. She claims that motions for extension to file a petition for certiorari are allowed and that the extension thereof is subject to the sound discretion of the court. Petitioner added that the COVID-19 pandemic and the deadly surge of cases are exceptional circumstances and compelling reasons to allow the extension of time to file a petition for certiorari.[31]

We are persuaded.

Under the Rules of Court, a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 shall be filed not later than 60 days from notice of the judgment, order, or resolution.[32] With the issuance of A.M. No. 00-2-03-SC,[33] motions for extension of time to file petitions for certiorari were allowed for compelling reasons only. The rules, therefore, admit an exception and the filing of petitions for certiorari is now extendible, albeit only for compelling reasons.","ACCORDINGLY, in view of the foregoing premises, the instant petition is GRANTED. The Court of Appeals Resolutions dated June 14, 2022, and the October 19, 2022, in CA-G.R. SP No. 171524 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

The January 27, 2021 Decision of the Labor Arbiter is REINSTATED in so far as it ruled that petitioner Melba Alcantara Denusta was illegally dismissed and that respondents Migrant Workers Manpower Agency, Inc., K&G Manpower Services Ltd., and Theresita M. Ceralde are ordered to pay, jointly and severally, her salary for the unexpired portion of her contract, as well as for salary differentials, and attorney's fees, with MODIFICATIONS that petitioner be entitled to an increased amount of moral damages, and exemplary damages, as well as reimbursement of placement fee. Accordingly, respondents are further ORDERED to pay petitioner Melba Alcantara Denusta the following:

1.
Moral and exemplary damages in the amount of PHP 50,000.00 and PHP 25,000.00, respectively.


2.
PHP 90,000.00, as reimbursement for the placement fee which petitioner paid to Migrant Workers Manpower Agency, Inc.
An interest of six percent (6%) per annum of the total monetary awards shall be imposed, computed from the time the complaint was filed until its full satisfaction.

The Labor Arbiter is ORDERED to compute the total monetary benefits awarded and due the petitioner in accordance with this Resolution."

","The moral ascendancy of the common law father of a minor substitutes force and intimidation in rape.[1] When the offender has moral ascendancy over the victim, physical resistance no longer needs to be proven.

This Court resolves an appeal[2] from the Court of Appeals Decision[3] finding AAA guilty beyond reasonable doubt of rape under Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code, as amended. The Court of Appeals modified the Judgment[4] of the trial court, finding AAA guilty of six counts of rape instead of seven.

AAA was charged with rape in 24 similarly-worded Informations, all filed on January 12, 2016.[5] The accusatory portions of the Informations read:","SO ORDERED.[26]
In its ruling, the trial court explained:
What appears in the information is that the accused is the stepfather of the victim. For accused to be the stepfather of [BBB], he must be legally married to [AAA]'s mother. However, accused and the victim's mother were not legally married but merely lived together under common[]law relationship. Accused being the common law husband of [AAA]'s mother at the time of the commission of the rape, even if established during the trial, could not be appreciated because the information did not specifically allege it as a qualifying circumstance. Otherwise, he would be deprived of his right to be informed of the charge lodged against him.[27]
Aggrieved, AAA appealed to the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the conviction but only for six counts of rape, acquitting him in one count.[28]","ACCORDINGLY, the March 22, 2022 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR HC No. 14261 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. Accused-appellant AAA is GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of six counts of rape in Criminal Case Nos. 265-M-2016 to 268-M-2016 and 270-M-2016 to 271-M-2016. He is sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua for each of the six counts.

He is ORDERED to pay BBB PHP 75,000.00 as civil liability, PHP 75,000.00 as moral damages, and PHP 75,000.00 as exemplary damages for each of the six counts of rape. All damages awarded shall earn interest at the legal rate of 6% per annum from the finality of this Decision until fully paid.[69]"
"B.M. No. 4720, January 30, 2024","IN RE: PETITION TO RETAIN/REACQUIRE THE PRIVILEGE TO RESUME THE PRACTICE OF LAW IN THE PHILIPPINES, REGINA STELLA P. JACINTO, PETITIONER.","Jacinto alleged that she was admitted as a member of the Philippine Bar on April 11, 1996 with Roll of Attorneys No. 40547. However, on May 29, 2023, she received her Maltese citizenship. She alleged that according to the Maltese Citizenship Act, it is lawful for any person to be a citizen of Malta and at the same time a citizen of another country. Thus, she alleged that she was not required to renounce her Philippine citizenship under the said law. She likewise posits that pursuant to Republic Act (RA) 9225, otherwise known as the ""Citizenship Retention and Re-acquisition Act of 2003,"" she is deemed not to have lost her Philippine citizenship, considering that she became a Maltese citizen after the effectivity of the law.[2]

Thus, on June 29, 2023, Jacinto filed a Petition for Retention/Re­-Acquisition of Philippine Citizenship under RA 9225[3] with the Bureau of Immigration (BI) to formalize the retention of her Philippine citizenship. Accordingly, the BI granted her Petition in an Order[4] dated July 14, 2023 leading to the issuance of a Certificate of Re-acquisition/Retention of Philippine Citizenship/Identification Certificate[5] similarly dated July 14, 2023. Thereafter, Jacinto, on August 7, 2023, took her Oath of Allegiance[6] to the Republic of the Philippines before a solemnizing officer of the BI in the City of Manila, Philippines.[7]","Before the Court is a Petition[1] dated September 8, 2023 to formalize the Privilege to Practice Law in the Philippines filed by petitioner Regina Stella P. Jacinto* (Jacinto) before the Office of the Bar Confidant (OBC) praying that she be allowed to formalize her privilege to practice law in the Philippines.","The Court adopts the Report and Recommendation of the OBC with modification.

Time and time again, this Court has emphasized that any person who is privileged to practice law in the Philippines is required to strictly adhere to certain conditions:
The practice of law is a privilege burdened with conditions. It is so delicately affected with public interest that it is both the power and duty of the State (through this Court) to control and regulate it in order to protect and promote the public welfare.

Adherence to rigid standards of mental fitness, maintenance of the highest degree of morality, faithful observance of the legal profession, compliance with the mandatory continuing legal education requirement and payment of membership fees to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) are the conditions required for membership in good standing in the bar and for enjoying the privilege to practice law. Any breach by a lawyer of any of these conditions makes him unworthy of the trust and confidence which the courts and clients repose in him for the continued exercise of his professional privilege.[25]","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition of Attorney Regina Stella P. Jacinto is GRANTED, subject to the condition that she shall re-take the Lawyer's Oath, sign the Roll of Attorneys, and subject to the payment of appropriate fees.

"A.M. No. P-23-082 (Formerly OCA IPI No. 19-4991-P), January 30, 2024","RODALYN GUINTO-HANIF, COMPLAINANT, VS. CHRISTOPHER T. PEREZ, SHERIFF IV, BRANCH 74, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, OLONGAPO CITY, ZAMBALES, RESPONDENT.","On October 14, 2009, the Subic Bay Development and Management Corporation, Inc. entered into an Industrial Lease Agreement with M. Waseem International Trading Corporation (M. Waseem) over a 5,000-square meter parcel of land located on Innovative Street, Subic Bay Gateway Park, Subic Bay Freeport Zone, for a period of 38 years.[2] Rodalyn averred that she and her husband, Muhammad Hanif (Muhammad), were the biggest shareholders of M. Waseem, while Muhammad was also the president of the company.[3]

On December 20, 2016, Rodalyn and Muhammad executed separate Deeds of Assignment transferring 380 shares of stock to Zeeshan Ashraf (Zeeshan) and 367 shares of stock to Hamza Shabbir (Hamza) for a consideration of PHP 1,000.00 per share. On January 10, 2017, a new set of Board of Directors and Officers were elected in M. Waseem.[4]

On December 17, 2017, at around 4:30 a.m., Rodalyn, along with 20 other individuals armed with high caliber firearms and other dangerous weapons, forcibly entered the leased warehouse/office compound of M. Waseem and ordered the employees and caretakers to vacate the yard under threat of being fired upon.[5]

This led to the filing by Hamza and Zeeshan, as authorized representatives of M. Waseem, of a complaint for Forcible Entry with Prayer for the Immediate Issuance of Writ of Preliminary Injunction and/or Temporary Restraining Order with the Municipal Trial Court in Cities (MTCC), Olongapo City against Rodalyn and Muhammad and the other individuals who acted under their supervision. The case was docketed as Civil Case No. 7733 and raffled to Branch 3 of the MTCC, Olongapo City, Zambales.[6]

In their Answer, Rodalyn and Muhammad averred that the Deeds of Assignment executed with Hamza and Zeeshan were null and void for lack of valuable consideration as the assignees failed to pay for the shares. Thus, Rodalyn and Muhammad argued that they did not forcibly enter the leased property considering that they were still the majority owners of M. Waseem.[7]","The instant administrative proceeding arose out of the Reklamong Sinumpaang Salaysay[1] filed by Rodalyn Guinto Hanif (Rodalyn) against Sheriff IV Christopher T. Perez (Sheriff Perez) of Branch 74, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Olongapo City, Zambales for grave misconduct and conduct unbecoming a public officer.","The Court adopts the factual findings of the JIB, but finds it necessary to modify the administrative liability of Sheriff Perez.

At the outset, the Court notes that Sheriff Perez has repeatedly failed to submit his comment despite the numerous opportunities given to him by the OCA.

After the complaint against Sheriff Perez was filed on November 26, 2020, the OCA, on January 10, 2020, referred the complaint to Sheriff Perez via the 1st Indorsement wherein he was given 10 days from receipt thereof to submit his comment.[36]

On March 2, 2020, Sheriff Perez submitted a Motion for Extension of Time to File Comment,[37] which the OCA granted but despite the extension, Sheriff Perez failed to submit his comment.

On October 20, 2020, the OCA sent a 1st Tracer[38] to Sheriff Perez, reiterating the previous directive for him to submit his comment, this time within five days from receipt of the tracer, otherwise the matter would be submitted to the Court. However, despite the repeated directives, Sheriff Perez still failed to submit his comment.[39]

Based on the records, Sheriff Perez has been given several opportunities to submit his comment and address the allegations against him. There was also no question that Sheriff Perez knows of the existence of the complaint, as evidenced by his filing of a motion for extension of time to file his comment. Yet, despite the numerous opportunities given him, and notwithstanding the consideration given by the OCA in granting his motion for extension, Sheriff Perez continued to display a clear dispassion towards the complaint filed against him.

On this score, the Court echoes with approbation the finding of the JIB that Sheriff Perez's continued disregard of the directives to file his comment constitutes a waiver of his right to defend himself. In Mendoza v. Tablizo,[40] the Court discussed:

The failure of Tablizo to appear and answer the charges against him despite all the opportunities he was given constitutes a waiver of his right to defend himself. As correctly observed in the Memorandum of the Office of the Court Administrator, in the natural order of things, a man would resist an unfounded claim or imputation and defend himself. It is totally against human nature to remain silent and say nothing in the face of false accusations. In the case at bar, Tablizo's silence may be construed as an implied admission and acknowledgment of the veracity of the allegations stated in the sworn Letter-Complaint filed by Mendoza – the veracity of which he could have easily debunked had he come to the fore to assail them. By his silence, he admitted, albeit tacitly, the allegations subscribed and sworn to by Mendoza that he cancelled the auction sale without the knowledge of the Executive Judge and without notice to Mendoza . . .[41] (Citation omitted)","ACCORDINGLY, the Court rules that:

1.
Christopher T. Perez be found GUILTY of Grave Abuse of Authority and be DISMISSED FROM THE SERVICE with forfeiture of all benefits, and disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office, including government-owned or -controlled corporations. Provided, however, that the forfeiture of benefits shall in no case include accrued leave credits; and


2.
Christopher T. Perez be found GUILTY of Gross Insubordination and be meted with a penalty of a FINE in the amount of PHP 110,000.00. He shall pay the fine within a period not exceeding three (3) months from the time this decision is promulgated. If unpaid, such amount may be deducted from the accrued leave credits due to him.

"A.C. No. 13955 (Formerly CBD Case No. 19-6114), January 30, 2024","DRIAN M. KELLEY, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. CIPRIANO D. ROBIELOS III, RESPONDENT.","According to Kelley, sometime in February 2016, Atty. Robielos borrowed from him PHP 240,000.00, for which Atty. Robielos issued as payment Bank of Commerce Check No. 0000008[2] dated June 30, 2016. When he presented the check for payment, however, the same was dishonored for being ""drawn against insufficient funds."" He consequently sent Atty. Robielos a demand letter[3] dated July 30, 2016.[4]

He and Atty. Robielos subsequently entered into an Agreement[5] (""Kasunduan ng Pag-Aayos"") dated September 13, 2016 before the Office of the Barangay Chairman, Barangay 33, Caloocan City, whereby Atty. Robielos committed to pay in installments of PHP 20,000.00 every 15 days for a period of six months. Atty. Robielos, however, only paid three installments or a total of PHP 60,000.00, leaving a balance of PHP 180,000.00.[6]

He was, therefore, constrained to file a small claims complaint[7] against Atty. Robielos before the Branch 51, Metropolitan Trial Court, Caloocan City, (MeTC-Branch 51) docketed as Small Claims Case No. 17-2040. Despite receipt of summons, Atty. Robielos failed to file an answer and did not appear during the hearing.[8]

By Decision[9] dated February 23, 2017, MeTC-Branch 51 ordered Atty. Robielos to pay the amount of PHP 180,000.00 with 5% interest per annum. Kelley then filed a Motion for Execution,[10] which Atty. Robielos opposed,[11] claiming he had suffered a mild stroke. During the hearing on the motion for execution, Atty. Robielos appeared and was directed by the court to file his answer, which he did. Atty. Robielos countered that the check was issued merely to ""return a favor"" and was not intended to be encashed as payment for a debt.[12]

By Order[13] dated April 3, 2017, MeTC-Branch 51 found the aforesaid defense to be devoid of merit, hence, it granted the motion for execution. The same was affirmed by the Branch 129, Regional Trial Court, Caloocan City per its Order[14] dated June 14, 2017. An alias writ of execution was eventually served on Atty. Robielos who still refused to pay the judgment award.[15]

Consequently, this time, Kelley was compelled to file the instant administrative complaint against Atty. Robielos.[16]","Complainant Adrian M. Kelley (Kelley) charged respondent Atty. Cipriano D. Robielos III (Atty. Robielos) before the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) with grave misconduct, averring that the latter issued a worthless check and failed to pay his debt in violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR) and the Lawyer's Oath.[1]","At the outset, the Court emphasizes that the provisions of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability (CPRA), which took effect on May 30, 2023, apply to the present case by virtue of Section 1, of the General Provisions of the CPRA, viz.:

Section 1. Transitory Provision. — The CPRA shall be applied to all pending and future cases, except to the extent that in the opinion of the Supreme Court, its retroactive application would not be feasible or would work injustice, in which case the procedure under which the cases were filed shall govern.

Membership in the Bar is a privilege burdened with conditions. Time and again, the Court has imposed the penalty of suspension or disbarment for any gross misconduct that a lawyer may have committed, whether it is in his or her professional or private capacity. Good character is an essential qualification for the admission to and continued practice of law. Hence, any wrongdoing, whether professional or non-professional, indicating unfitness for the profession justifies disciplinary action,[27] as here.

Indeed, the Court has repeatedly ordained that -

Law is a noble profession, and the privilege to practice it is bestowed only upon individuals who are competent intellectually, academically and, equally important, morally. Because they are vanguards of the law and the legal system, lawyers must at all times conduct themselves, especially in their dealings with their clients and the public at large, with honesty and integrity in a manner beyond reproach.[28]

Unfortunately, Atty. Robielos failed to live up to these standards.","ACCORDINGLY, respondent Atty. Cipriano D. Robielos III is found GUILTY of violation of Canons II and III of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability. He is DISBARRED from the practice of law and his name is ORDERED stricken off from the Roll of Attorneys, effective immediately. He is also meted a FINE in the amount of PHP 35,000.00 for his repeated disobedience to the orders of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines. Finally, he is directed to PAY his debt to complainant Adrian M. Kelley and comply with the Writ of Execution dated April 3, 2017 issued by the Branch 51, Metropolitan Trial Court, Caloocan City.

Let a copy of this Decision be attached to his personal record in the Office of the Bar Confidant.

Too, furnish a copy of this Decision to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines for its information and guidance; and the Office of the Court Administrator for dissemination to all courts of the Philippines."
"G.R. No. 261107, January 30, 2024","ANA LIZA ARRIOLA PERALTA, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, REPRESENTED BY THE CAMPAIGN FINANCE UNIT, RESPONDENT.
","Petitioner ran for the position of Mayor in the Municipality of San Marcelino, Zambales, during the May 10, 2010, National and Local Elections (2010 NLE).[7] At the time, there were 20,301 registered voters in the municipality.[8]

In a Letter[9] to petitioner dated October 1, 2014, Atty. Ferdinand T. Rafanan (Atty. Rafanan), Head of the Campaign Finance Unit of the COMELEC, stated that petitioner spent the amount of PHP 285,500.00 during the 2010 NLE per the Statement of Contributions & Expenditures (SOCE) which she submitted to the COMELEC on June 7, 2010. Under Section 100 of the OEC, as amended by Section 13 of Republic Act No. 7166, the maximum allowable expenditure for petitioner was PHP 3.00 per registered voter or a total of PHP 60,903.00. Thus, as petitioner appeared to have exceeded the limit set by law, Atty. Rafanan directed her to submit her written explanation as to why no charges should be filed against her for the election offense of overspending under Section 262 in relation to the OEC, Section 100, as amended by Republic Act No. 7166, Section 13.

In her letter-response[10] dated March 2, 2015, petitioner attached the respective affidavits of her contributors, along with their corresponding explanations or clarifications on the declarations made in the Schedule of Contributions Received and Reports of Contributors,[11] as follows:
Lance Stefan L. Flamiano – the amount of his tarpaulin contributions was mistakenly written as PHP 30,000.00 instead of PHP 3,000.00;[12]

Noel P. Cacho – his contribution amounting to PHP 7,000.00 partook of the nature of copying and classifying the list of voters, investigating the registered voters on the list, and printing of sample ballots; however, it was erroneously indicated as meals and snacks in the report of his contribution;[13]

Maria Christina P. Penaflor – her contribution amounting to PHP 18,000.00 partook of the nature of copying and classifying the list of voters, investigating the registered voters on the list, and printing of sample ballots; however, it was erroneously indicated as meals and snacks in the report of her contribution;[14]

Rolando A. Flamiano – he contributed PHP 10,000.00 worth of home-made sample ballots; however, in his report of contribution, he caused the word ""leaflets"" to be written in conformity with the report's suggested description and as understood by him as being the nearest description of his contribution;[15]

Daniel A. Villanueva – his contribution of PHP 12,000.00 was not for meals and snacks as reflected in his report of contribution; upon careful recollection, he contributed PHP 8,000.00 for home-made printing of sample ballots and PHP 4,000.00 for copying and classifying the lists of voters;[16]

Heidi P. Villanueva – her report of contribution erroneously reflected meals and snacks in the amount of PHP 84,000.00; however, she only contributed PHP 2,000.00 for meals and snacks while the remaining PHP 82,000.00 was for copying and classifying the lists of voters, investigating the registered voters on the list, and printing of home-made sample ballots;[17]

Isabelita Peralta – she contributed the amount of PHP 5,000.00 for copying and classifying the lists of voters; however, the description in the schedule of contributions reflected ""papers/pens"";[18]

Jonathan S. Peralta – he contributed the amount of PHP 11,000.00 for copying and classifying the lists of voters, investigating the registered voters on the list, and printing of home-made sample ballots; he denied giving PHP 3,000.00 for vehicle and PHP 8,000.00 for meals and snacks, as reflected in the schedule of contributions;[19] and

Apolinario Abelon – he contributed home-made sample ballots amounting to PHP 3,000.00 only and corrected the figure of PHP 30,000.00 for meals and snacks appearing on the schedule of contributions.[20]
Petitioner further indicated in her letter that she underwent hip stress fracture surgery on December 10, 2014, after suffering serious injuries from a vehicular accident in Cancun, Mexico, on November 10, 2014. Thus, her mobility was very restricted and limited from such date. In addition, petitioner maintained that the distance between her and her contributors restricted her from easily conducting verification considering that she was based in Makati City, while almost all of her contributors were based in the Province of Zambales. She then requested that she be allowed to submit relevant documents as soon as they become available.[21]","Before the Court is a Petition for Certiorari[1] assailing Resolution No. 18-0656[2] dated August 8, 2018, and Resolution No. 21-0472-57[3] dated July 14, 2021, issued by the respondent Commission on Elections (COMELEC) En Banc in E.O. Case No. 15-954. In the assailed issuances, the COMELEC found probable cause to hold Ana Liza A. Peralta (petitioner) for trial and directed the filing of an Information against her for election overspending under Section 100[4] in relation to Section 262[5] of Batas Pambansa No. (BP) 881, otherwise known as the Omnibus Election Code (OEC), as amended by Republic Act No. 7166.[6]","The Court grants the petition.

There was inordinate delay in the conduct of the preliminary investigation before the COMELEC which violated petitioner's right to speedy disposition of cases. Hence, the dismissal of the complaint against her is warranted.

The 1987 Constitution, Article III, Section 16,[50] guarantees the right of all persons to a speedy disposition of their cases before all judicial, quasi-judicial, or administrative bodies. This constitutional right is available not only to the accused in criminal proceedings but also to all parties in all cases, whether civil or administrative in nature, as well as all proceedings, either judicial or quasi-judicial. Pursuant thereto, any party to a case may demand expeditious action from all officials who are tasked with the administration of justice.[51]

In resolving whether petitioner's right to the speedy disposition of her case was violated, the guidelines set forth by the Court in Cagang v. Sandiganbayan,[52] find relevance:
First, the right to speedy disposition of cases is different from the right to speedy trial. While the rationale for both rights is the same, the right to speedy trial may only be invoked in criminal prosecutions against courts of law. The right to speedy disposition of cases, however, may be invoked before any tribunal, whether judicial or quasi-judicial. What is important is that the accused may already be prejudiced by the proceeding for the right to speedy disposition of cases to be invoked.

Second, a case is deemed initiated upon the filing of a formal complaint prior to a conduct of a preliminary investigation. This Court acknowledges, however, that the Ombudsman should set reasonable periods for preliminary investigation, with due regard to the complexities and nuances of each case. Delays beyond this period will be taken against the prosecution. The period taken for fact-finding investigations prior to the filing of the formal complaint shall not be included in the determination of whether there has been inordinate delay.

Third, courts must first determine which party carries the burden of proof. If the right is invoked within the given time periods contained in current Supreme Court resolutions and circulars, and the time periods that will be promulgated by the Office of the Ombudsman, the defense has the burden of proving that the right was justifiably invoked. If the delay occurs beyond the given time period and the right is invoked, the prosecution has the burden of justifying the delay.","ACCORDINGLY, the petition is GRANTED. Resolution No. 18-0656 dated August 8, 2018, and Resolution No. 21-0472-57 dated July 14, 2021, of the Commission on Elections En Banc in E.O. Case No. 15-954, are NULLIFIED for having been issued with grave abuse of discretion. The complaint against petitioner Ana Liza Arriola Peralta for alleged election overspending is DISMISSED.

Reference to this Court's recently promulgated Further Amendments to Rule 140[41] of the Rules of Court (Rule 140) is appropriate as it now also governs the discipline of officials, employees, and personnel of the Judiciary. Although the alleged acts were perpetrated prior to the effectivity of the amendments, the amendments nonetheless govern, pursuant to Section 24[42] thereof.

Section 1(2) of Rule 140 requires that the allegations against Almanoche must be supported by affidavits of persons who have personal knowledge of the facts alleged therein or by authentic documents which may substantiate its allegations.

In the instant case, despite the accounts of several individuals that were implicated, it bears noting that only Baguio had personal knowledge of the April 27, 2018 incident involving Almanoche. Indeed, Judge Camannong and Veluz separately issued Manifestations[43] expressly stating that they had no personal knowledge of the incident involving Almanoche. In any event, we lend full credence to Baguio's testimony since, as astutely raised by Justice Amy C. Lazaro-Javier, it would be inconceivable for anyone to go so far, spreading such elaborate lies on different occasions to different people.

Moreover, while Judge Camannong, Pros. Panganiban, and Atty. Ibañez did not have personal knowledge of the incident involving Almanoche, it bears emphasis that Baguio, not long after the incident, narrated the event to one or all of them on separate occasions. The consistency in Baguio's details, as recalled by Judge Camannong, Pros. Panganiban, and Atty. Ibañez, strongly corroborates Baguio's account.

As adeptly underscored by Chief Justice Alexander G. Gesmundo, we are quick to clarify that, despite the lack of personal knowledge of Judge Camannong, Pros. Panganiban, and Atty. Ibañez on the incident of April 27, 2018, their accounts may nonetheless be admitted and given credence in view of Baguio's affidavit. Re: Verified Complaint dated July 13, 2015 of Alfonso Umali, Jr. v. Justice Hernandez[44] elucidates:","ACCORDINGLY, Nemia Alma Y. Almanoche is found GUILTY of serious dishonesty. She is ordered DISMISSED from service with forfeiture of all retirement benefits, except accrued leave credits. She is also disqualified from being re-employed in the government, including government-owned and controlled corporations."
