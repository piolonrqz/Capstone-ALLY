"G.R. No. 260434, January 31, 2024","NOW TELECOM COMPANY, INC., PETITIONER, VS. NATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION, RESPONDENT.","On January 8, 2018, the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) issued Memorandum Order (M.O.) No. 001, series of 2018, entitled, ""Policy Guidelines for the Entry of a New Major Player in the Public Telecommunications Market,"" in compliance with the directive of then President Rodrigo R. Duterte (President Duterte) to fast-track the entry of a new major player (NMP) to compete in the Philippine telecommunications market.

The said memorandum order provides that the NMP applicant must (1) possess a valid congressional telecommunications franchise, and the NTC shall issue the appropriate licenses/authorities to the winner after the bid; (2) not be a subsidiary, affiliate, or have any corporate or financial interest with the Globe Group or PLDT Group of Companies; and (3) have a written and binding commitment from a foreign joint venture company, if applicable.[5] It also provides that the applicant must have the highest committed investment for the first five years, and such commitment must be secured with a performance bond.[6] The NMP shall be assigned radio frequency bands that are available for assignment.[7] The NTC was directed to promulgate the memorandum circular containing the Terms of Reference (TOR) for the selection and assignment of radio frequencies for the purpose.[8]

On April 6, 2018, former President Duterte issued Administrative Order (A.O.) No. 11, series of 2018, creating an Oversight Committee to assist the NTC in formulating the TOR, oversee its compliance, ensure timely implementation, and exercise such incidental powers as may be necessary.[9]

After the conduct of public hearing, and pursuant to the foregoing, the NTC promulgated the subject Circular on September 20, 2018.[10] The Oversight Committee and the NTC decided that the best way to select the NMP was through a public, open, and competitive selection process.[11]

Thereafter, the DICT and the NTC published the timeline for the implementation of the subject Circular.[12] The timeline stated that the said Circular shall take effect on October 6, 2018; the Invitation to Bid shall be published on October 7, 2018; the issuance of the selection documents shall be on October 8, 2018; and the submission and opening of bids shall be on November 7, 2018.[13]

On October 8, 2018, NOW Telecom filed before the RTC a Complaint for Injunction[14] with application for an ex-parte temporary restraining order (TRO), 20-day TRO, and/or WPI against the NTC.[15]

In the said Complaint, NOW Telecom challenged the following provisions of the subject Circular as void for being excessive, confiscatory, and violative of due process:
(1)	
Section 6.2(j), which requires bidders to post a Participation Security with a face value of PHP 700,000,000.00 equivalent to 0.5% of the minimum Capital and Operational Expenditure at the end of the Commitment Period;
(2)	
Section 11, which requires the NMP to post a Performance Security in the amount of 10% of the remaining Capital and Operational Expenditure; and
(3)	
Section 8, which provides for a non-refundable filing fee of PHP 10,000,000.00 for appeal to the NTC En Banc against the decisions of the Selection Committee.[16]
NOW Telecom likewise challenged Section 10.1 of the subject Circular, which requires the submission of the Business and Roll-out plans after the NMP is determined, as circumventing the prohibition on substantial variation in bids and contracts.[17] It also assailed Section 3, which provides for the covered and contingent radio frequencies to be assigned to the NMP, for violating its alleged vested right to be allocated radio frequencies as holder of a legislative and administrative franchise to operate a telecommunications facility.[18]

Hence, NOW Telecom prayed that the NTC be enjoined from enforcing the aforementioned provisions of the subject Circular. It further prayed for the issuance of TRO and WPI pending the resolution of the Complaint.[19]

In support of its prayer for TRO and WPI, NOW Telecom argued that (1) it has a clear legal right considering its legislative and administrative franchise; (2) it is entitled to the relief sought, i.e., enjoining the NTC from enforcing the vague, oppressive, and confiscatory provisions of the Subject Circular; and (3) it has established the extreme urgency on account of the timeline provided by the NTC. NOW Telecom further argued that the selection process for the NMP is not an infrastructure project that is covered by the prohibition against injunctions under Republic Act No. 8975.[20]

The NTC opposed NOW Telecom 's prayer for injunctive writs. Thereafter, the RTC conducted summary hearing on the application for TRO.[21]

In its Order[22] dated October 12, 2018, the RTC denied NOW Telecom's prayer for TRO. The RTC then directed the parties to submit their respective memoranda on the propriety of the issuance of a WPI.[23]","This case involves the Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] (Petition) filed by petitioner NOW Telecom Company, Inc. (NOW Telecom) assailing the Decision[2] (assailed Decision) and the Resolution[3] (assailed Resolution) of the Court of Appeals (CA), which affirmed the Order[4] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC).

In the said Order, the RTC denied NOW Telecom 's application for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction (WPI) against respondent National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) to restrain the implementation of certain provisions of NTC Memorandum Circular (M.C.) No. 09-09-2018 entitled, ""Rules and Regulations on the Selection Process for a New Major Player in the Philippine Telecommunications Market"" (subject Circular).","The Petition is denied.

NOW Telecom's application for
injunctive relief has been rendered
moot and academic

At the outset, it is worth noting that, during the pendency of this case, Mindanao Islamic Telephone Company, Inc. (MISLATEL) was selected as the NMP by virtue of the subject Circular, and was accordingly issued a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN).[35]

It is an established rule that injunction will not issue to restrain the performance of an act already done, or to prevent events that have already happened.[36] When the act sought to be prevented by injunction has already been performed or completed, ""nothing more can be enjoined or restrained; a writ of injunction then becomes moot and academic, and the court, by mere issuance of the writ, can no longer stop or undo the act. To do so would violate the sole purpose of a prohibitive injunction, that is, to preserve the status quo.[37]

In this case, the act sought to be restrained by NOW Telecom has already been done. The actual implementation of the selection process of the NMP pursuant to the subject Circular, and the resulting assignment of the allocated radio frequencies for the NMP to MISLATEL have rendered NOW Telecom's prayer for injunctive relief moot and academic. Accordingly, NOW Telecom's application for WPI should be denied.

Lower courts cannot issue an
injunctive writ against the selection of
NMP

Section 3 of Republic Act No. 8975 prohibits lower courts from issuing a TRO or WPI against the government for the conduct of the bidding or awarding of contract or project of the National Government, thus:
SEC. 3. Prohibition on the Issuance of Temporary Restraining Orders, Preliminary Injunctions and Preliminary Mandatory Injunctions. - No court, except the Supreme Court, shall issue any temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction or preliminary mandatory injunction against the government, or any of its subdivisions, officials or any person or entity, whether public or private, acting under the government's direction, to restrain, prohibit or compel the following acts:
(a) Acquisition, clearance and development of the right-of-way and/or site or location of any national government project;

(b) Bidding or awarding of contract/project of the national government as defined under Section 2 hereof;

(c) Commencement, prosecution, execution, implementation, operation of any such contract or project;

(d) Termination or rescission of any such contract/project; and

(e) The undertaking or authorization of any other lawful activity necessary for such contract/project.
This prohibition shall apply in all cases, disputes or controversies instituted by a private party, including but not limited to cases filed by bidders or those claiming to have rights through such bidders involving such contract/project. This prohibition shall not apply when the matter is of extreme urgency involving a constitutional issue, such that unless a temporary restraining order is issued, grave injustice and irreparable injury will arise. The applicant shall file a bond, in an amount to be fixed by the court, which bond shall accrue in favor of the government if the court should finally decide that the applicant was not entitled to the relief sought.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari filed by petitioner NOW Telecom Company, Inc., is hereby DENIED. The Decision dated May 24, 2021 and the Resolution dated April 12, 2022 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 158237 are AFFIRMED."
"G.R. No. 255180, January 31, 2024","CONRADO FERNANDO, JR. PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","The case stemmed from an Information[5] dated July 30, 2007, that charged petitioner with the crime of Estafa, defined and penalized under Article 315 (2) (a) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC). The accusatory portion of the Information reads:
That on or about the 1st day of August, 2006 in Quezon City, Philippines, the said accused, did, then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously defraud one DOROLIZA REYROSO DIN, in the following manner, to wit: the accused, by means of false manifestations and fraudulent representations which he made to the complainant, to the effect that he could facilitate the processing of the pertinent papers of the promo package which the accused offered to the complainant in a four (4) day tour in Hongkong Disneyland, for the amount of P37,400.00, Philippine Currency, induced and succeeded in inducing said complainant to give and deliver, as in fact Doroliza R. Din gave and delivered to the accused the amount of P37,400.00, Philippine Currency, to meet the requirements thereof, said accused well knowing that the same were false and fraudulent but were made solely to obtain, as in fact the said accused did obtain the amount of P37,400.00, Philippine Currency, which amount once in possession thereof, with intent to defraud, misapplied, misappropriated and converted the same to his own personal use and benefit, despite demand made upon him, to the damage and prejudice of the said offended party in the amount aforementioned.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[6]
Upon arraignment, petitioner entered a plea of ""Not Guilty"" to the crime charged.[7]

Trial ensued.","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] assailing the Decision[2] dated January 7, 2021, of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-­G.R. CR No. 39899. The CA affirmed with modification the Decision[3] dated November 24, 2016, and the Omnibus Order[4] dated March 8, 2017, of Branch 216, Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Quezon City in Criminal Case No. Q-07-148522. The CA found Conrado Fernando, Jr. (petitioner) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Estafa, but it deleted the award of actual damages in the amount of PHP 37,400.00.","At the outset, the Court notes that Atty. Valentino K. Villaluz, counsel for petitioner, has failed to comply with the Resolution[39] dated August 31, 2022 which required him to submit within five days from notice the following:
(1) a soft copy of the petition in portable document format as required under the Rules in E-Filing (A.M. No. 10-3-7-SC) and the Efficient Use of Paper Rule (A.M. No. 11-9-4-SC); (2) a certification against forum shopping; (3) a valid verification of the petition with (a) the additional attestations in the verification of the petition as required under Section 4, Rule 7 of the 2019 Amended Rules of Court; and (b) a properly accomplished jurat with affiant's current identification document issued by an official agency bearing his photograph and signature; pursuant to Secs. 2, 6, and 12, Rule 11 of the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice, as amended by A.M.

However, considering that petitioner's liberty is at stake, the Court resolves to brush aside the procedural infirmities of the petition and give due course to the petition in the higher interest of substantial justice.

The Court shall now delve into the merits of the present petition. Petitioner filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. For the petition to prosper, Section 5 (2) of Rule 45 of the Rules of Court states that the questions raised in the petition should be of such substance as to warrant consideration. Also, Section 6 of the same Rules provides the reasons which will be considered by the Court —
SEC. 6. Review discretionary.... 
 
(a)
When the court a quo has decided a question of substance, not theretofore determined by the Supreme Court, or has decided it in a way probably not in accord with law or with the applicable decisions of the Supreme Court; or


(b)
When the court a quo has so far departed from the accepted and usual course of judicial proceedings, or so far sanctioned such departure by a lower court, as to call for an exercise of the power of supervision.
In the present case, the Court finds that the RTC's factual findings, as affirmed by the CA, are not in accordance with law and recent jurisprudence.","WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated January 7, 2021 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 39899 is REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

" G.R. No. 256194, January 31, 2024","REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, PETITIONER, VS. HEIRS OF ROGELIO P. LAUDES, NAMELY, VICTORIA ORDIZ VDA. DE LAUDES, ROVI ROVILLE LAUDES-CORNELIO, ROVIN LAUDES, ROVIROSE LAUDES AND ROVICOR LAUDES, REPRESENTED BY VICTORIA ORDIZ VDA. DE LAUDES, RESPONDENTS.","On September 19, 1984, Rogelio P. Laudes (Rogelio) died when the Chevrolet Truck owned by Jesus E. Enova (Jesus) and driven by Elias Pilo (Pilo) hit him. As a result of Rogelio's death, his heirs filed both civil and criminal cases against Jesus and Pilo. Both Civil Case No. 5175 and Criminal Case No. 4040 were consolidated before the RTC, Branch 40 (RTC Branch 40). In its Joint Decision, dated January 6, 1989, RTC Branch 40 found Pilo guilty for reckless imprudence resulting to homicide, slight physical injuries, and damage to property, while Jesus was ordered to pay civil liability in the total amount of PHP 205,000.00.[5]

Thereafter, a Writ of Execution was issued, followed by the issuance of a Notice of Levy against the properties of Jesus, including those covered by TD No. 006-0168 and TD No. 006-0279. The sheriff then issued a Notice of Sheriff's Sale, setting the levied properties of Jesus for public auction on September 25, 1990, in satisfaction of the civil liability adjudged by RTC Branch 40.[6]

During the said public auction, Victoria emerged as the highest bidder and was awarded the properties levied, giving Jesus and his heirs, assigns, administrator or executor one (1) year from the date of the auction sale to redeem the said properties. However, the subject properties were not redeemed. Thus, the Sheriff's Final Deed, dated October 16, 1991, was issued. Thereafter, a Writ of Possession was issued by RTC Branch 40.[7]

In the Sheriff's Return, dated January 3, 1992, the sheriff was able to place the Heirs of Laudes in possession of some of the properties including the property with TD No. 006-0279. However, the sheriff failed to do the same for the other properties, including the property with TD No. 006-0168.[8]

Upon issuance of an Alias Writ of Possession, the sheriff, in his Partial Return, dated January 11, 1993, reported that the Heirs of Laudes were again dispossessed of the property with TD No. 006-0168 after placing them in possession on January 8, 1993, and that the property with TD No. 006-0279 has not yet been placed in their possession.[9]

Meanwhile, records reveal that Gregorio Zantua, Jr. (Zantua), Jose Enova (Jose), Leopoldo Enova (Leopoldo), and Ricardo Lotik (Lotik) filed a complaint before RTC Branch 40, docketed as Civil Case No. 6118, against the Heirs of Laudes for recovery of real properties and annulment of sale. They alleged that the properties subject of the public auction were sold to them prior to the levy made by the sheriff. Zantua, Jose, and Lotik eventually withdrew as party-plaintiffs in Civil Case No. 6118, but filed separate civil cases for the same cause of action against Victoria.[10]

In Civil Case No. 6118, the Heirs of Laudes moved that they be declared as the true, lawful, and absolute owner of the properties with TD No. 006-0168 (now TD No. 006-1347) and TD No. 006-0279 (now TD No. GR-2008-FF-06-006-00539). Thus, in its Order, dated January 5, 2000, the RTC Branch 40 declared the Heirs of Laudes as the true and lawful owner of the subject properties.[11]

By virtue of the said Order, the Heirs of Laudes filed the application for registration of the property covered by TD No. 006-0279, before the Municipal Trial Court of Paracale (MTC), on June 20, 2001. The MTC then issued an Order, dated June 25, 2001, directing the Bureau of Lands and the National Land Title and Deeds Registration Administration to submit a report before the scheduled initial hearing.[12]

In compliance with the said Order, the Land Registration Authority (LRA) submitted its Report, and the Notice of Initial Hearing, with instructions that the said notice must be posted and published. Junior Process Server Loreto C. Banal (Banal) then executed a Certificate of Posting. Subsequently, the LRA submitted its Certificate of Publication, with the attached Certificate of Publication from the National Printing Office (NPO), and a Certificate of Notification.[13]

Meanwhile, an Urgent Opposition to Application for Registration was filed by Zantua, claiming ownership of the subject properties. Due to the said opposition, the MTC issued an Order, dated December 3, 2001, declaring that it has no jurisdiction to hear and decide the case, thereby directing that the records of the case be transmitted to the Executive Judge of the RTC. The case was raffled to RTC Branch 39.[14]

In the ensuing trial, the Heirs of Laudes manifested before RTC Branch 39 that a similar case was pending before it, and prayed that the cases be tried jointly, to which the trial court acceded. Thus, LRC Case No. N-873, involving a parcel of land covered by Plan Psu-214678, and LRC Case No. N-875, involving a parcel of land designated as Lot 9150, Pls-1047-D of Paracale Public Land Subdivision, were tried jointly.[15]

The Heirs of Laudes presented the following witnesses: Victoria herself, Pio T. Oco, Sr., Teofilo T. Oco (Teofilo), Ponciano M. Mabeza, Jr. (Mabeza, Jr.), Officer-In-Charge (OIC) of the Community Environment and Natural Resources Office (CENRO) of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), and Ramely Urbano (Urbano), Administrative Officer I of CENRO. In addition, the Heirs of Laudes attached Certification Nos. RS DCN-2015-40 and RS DCN-2015-41, both dated April 13, 2015, issued by the Secretary of the DENR, delegating the authority to reclassify the land to the CENRO. The Office of the Prosecutor, on behalf of the State, did not present any evidence.[16]","This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari (Petition),[1] filed under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the Decision,[2] dated June 30, 2020, and the Resolution,[3] dated March 9, 2021, of the Court of Appeals (CA), in CA-G.R. CV No. 111651. The CA affirmed the Joint Decision,[4] dated June 21, 2018, of the Regional Trial Court of Daet, Camarines Norte (RTC), Branch 39 (RTC Branch 39), which ruled that Victoria Ordiz Vda. de Laudes (Victoria), Rovi Rovile Laudes-Cornelio (Rovi), Rovin Laudes (Rovin), Rovirose Laudes (Rovirose), and Rovicor Laudes (Rovicor), all represented by Victoria (collectively, the Heirs of Laudes), were able to prove that the properties covered by Tax Declaration (TD) No. 006-0168 and TD No. 006-0279 (collectively, the subject properties), that they sought to be registered, were alienable and disposable lands, and that their predecessors-in-interest have been in open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession and occupation under a bona fide claim of ownership over the subject properties.","The Petition is meritorious.

Classification of lands

Pursuant to the Regalian Doctrine (Jura Regalia), all lands of the public domain belong to the State. This means that the State is the source of any asserted right to ownership of land, and is charged with the conservation of such patrimony.[39] As elucidated in Federation of Coron, Busuanga, Palawan Farmer's Association, Inc. v. The Secretary of Department of Environment and Natural Resources:[40]
The Regalian Doctrine was embodied as early as in the Philippine Bill of 1902. Under Section 12 thereof, it was stated that all properties of the Philippine Islands that were acquired by the United States through the treaty with Spain shall be under the control of the Government of the Philippine Islands, to wit:
SECTION 12. That all the property and rights which may have been acquired in the Philippine Islands by the United States under the treaty of peace with Spain, signed December tenth, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, except such land or other property as shall be designated by the President of the United States for military and other reservations of the Government of the United States, are hereby placed under the control of the Government of said Islands, to be administered for the benefit of the inhabitants thereof, except as provided in this Act.
The only exception in the Regalian Doctrine is native title to land, or ownership of land by Filipinos by virtue of a claim of ownership since time immemorial and independent of any grant from the Spanish Crown. In Cariño v. Insular Government, the United States Supreme Court at that time held that:
It might, perhaps, be proper and sufficient to say that when, as far back as testimony or memory goes, the land has been held by individuals under a claim of private ownership, it will be presumed to have been held in the same way from before the Spanish conquest, and never to have been public land.[41] (Citations omitted)
Lands may either be of (1) public dominion or (2) of private ownership.[42] Lands under public dominion are either (1) those intended for public use, such as roads, canals, rivers, torrents, ports and bridges constructed by the State, banks, shores, roadsteads, and others of similar character; or (2) those which belong to the State, without being for public use, and are intended for some public service or for the development of the national wealth.[43]

Hence, based on Article 420 of the Civil Code, there are three kinds of property of public dominion: (1) those for public use, which may be used by anybody, such as roads and canals; (2) those for public service, which may be used only by certain duly authorized persons, although used for the benefit of the public; and (3) those used for the development of national wealth, such as our natural resources. Lands of public dominion remain part of the inalienable land of the public domain unless the State is shown to have reclassified or alienated them to private persons.[44]","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari filed by the Republic of the Philippines is PARTLY GRANTED.

The case is REMANDED to the Court of Appeals for reception of evidence on the subject properties' land classification status based on the parameters set forth in Section 7 of Republic Act No. 11573. The Court of Appeals is directed to resolve the case with utmost dispatch."
"G.R. No. 264158, January 31, 2024","MELBA ALCANTARA DENUSTA, PETITIONER, VS. MIGRANT WORKERS MANPOWER AGENCY, INC., THERESITA M. CERALDE, AND K&G MANPOWER SERVICES, LTD., RESPONDENTS.","Petitioner filed a complaint for illegal dismissal, underpayment of salaries, damages, payment of wages for the unexpired portion of the contract, and attorney's fees against Migrant Workers Manpower Agency, Inc. (Migrant), a placement and recruitment agency, K&G Manpower Services, Ltd. (K&G), Migrant's foreign principal, and Theresita M. Ceralde (Ceralde), in her capacity as Migrant's president (collectively, respondents).[4]

In the complaint, petitioner averred that she was hired as a Kitchen Hand for The Lunch Box Ltd. (Lunch Box) in Rarotonga, Cook Islands under a two-year employment contract executed with Migrant and K&G. Based on her contract, she would receive a weekly salary of NZ$400.00 or NZ$1,600.00 per month. On May 22, 2019, she arrived in the Cook Islands and started her employment. She was repatriated to the Philippines on November 17, 2019.[5]

During her employment, petitioner alleged that her employer, Charlene Tairea (Tairea) committed several violations of her contract of employment. She was paid less than the agreed rate and was not provided with accommodation, transportation, or food allowances. She was considered a part-time employee and was not paid her salary during holidays. Petitioner likewise averred that she was maltreated by her foreign employer's family members. Due to her predicaments in the hands of her foreign employer, she claimed that respondents were guilty of illegal dismissal.[6]

Worse, when petitioner informed Migrant of her situation, Migrant did not act on it. Furthermore, before she was permitted to return home, respondents forced her to sign a Quitclaim, but she refused. Instead, she executed a Letter of Dispute narrating her ordeal.[7]

Petitioner, thus, prayed in her complaint that she be reimbursed for her accommodation and transportation expenses while in the Cook Islands, as well as for the amount she paid for the return ticket, agency fee, and work permit fee.[8] She likewise claimed that she was entitled to her salaries and benefits for the unexpired portion of her contract, as well as her salary differentials in the total amount of PHP 1,379,170.00 based on the prevailing conversion rate.[9]

Respondents denied the allegations in the complaint. They countered that petitioner was not illegally dismissed and, therefore, not entitled to her monetary claims.[10]

Respondents claimed that petitioner was a ""name-hire"" worker and that she was not an agency-recruited worker of Migrant. She was engaged but through the referral of her friend, who sought the help of another friend in securing her employment with Tairea. It was only Migrant who processed her travel documents.[11]

Furthermore, respondents contended that petitioner lied in her application as she claimed that she could speak basic English and drive a motorcycle, which were among the main conditions of her employment. However, when asked to drive a motorcycle by her employer, she refused and said that she did not know how to drive. Further, during her employment in the Cook Islands, petitioner demonstrated an arrogant attitude towards Tairea's mother, Vaine Parau Tairea (Vaine).[12]

After Tairea left with her daughter to New Zealand for the latter's surgery, Vaine took over the management of the restaurant and it was this time when petitioner's attitude changed. She no longer wanted to work until Tairea's return. She falsely accused another employee of stealing, which disrupted the workplace.[13]

When Tairea returned from New Zealand, she asked petitioner to return to work but the latter refused. Instead, petitioner asked that she be released from her employment contract. She then requested to be repatriated because of her disagreement with Vaine. Tairea was then constrained to release her from her employment contract and repatriate her to the Philippines.[14]

Respondents concluded that petitioner was not illegally dismissed as it was petitioner who asked for her release from her employment and declined to finish her two-year contract. Furthermore, petitioner is not entitled to her money claims for failure to present sufficient evidence to support the same.[15]","This Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assails the Resolutions dated June 14, 2022[2] and October 19, 2022[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 171524, which dismissed the Petition for Certiorari filed by Melba Alcantara Denusta (petitioner) for being filed beyond the reglementary period.","The instant petition is meritorious.

The CA erred in denying the motion for extension of time to file Petition for Certiorari and dismissing the same for being filed beyond the reglementary period
In the instant petition, petitioner begs this Court to relax the procedures and rule on the substantive issues raised in the petition. She claims that motions for extension to file a petition for certiorari are allowed and that the extension thereof is subject to the sound discretion of the court. Petitioner added that the COVID-19 pandemic and the deadly surge of cases are exceptional circumstances and compelling reasons to allow the extension of time to file a petition for certiorari.[31]

We are persuaded.

Under the Rules of Court, a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 shall be filed not later than 60 days from notice of the judgment, order, or resolution.[32] With the issuance of A.M. No. 00-2-03-SC,[33] motions for extension of time to file petitions for certiorari were allowed for compelling reasons only. The rules, therefore, admit an exception and the filing of petitions for certiorari is now extendible, albeit only for compelling reasons.

In the case of Fluor Daniel, Inc.-Philippines v. Fil-Estate Properties, Inc.,[34] We enumerated several instances where the Court allowed an extension for filing a petition for certiorari, thus:

. . . when the assailed decision was contradictory to the evidence presented; in a motion for consolidation of several criminal cases, when the relief sought would be more in keeping with law and equity, and to facilitate a speedy trial, considering that there was substantial identity in the informations filed and the witnesses to be presented; where paramount public interest necessitated that the dispute involving the operation of a major power plant be resolved on the merits; where the case involved the expropriation of private property to build a major highway and no undue prejudice or delay will be caused to either party in admitting the petition; and when the appellate court had already granted an extension but later reversed itself. Furthermore, in Castells, et al. v. Saudi Arabian Airlines, the Court enumerated the following instances when the period to file a petition for certiorari may be extended:

Contrary to law.[6]
AA pleaded not guilty to the charges. Trial on the merits ensued.[7]

The prosecution presented BBB and Dr. Editha Martinez (Dr. Martinez), the medico-legal officer of xxxxxxxxxxx Crime Laboratory.[8] Meanwhile, the defense presented AAA and his sister, CCC, as its witnesses.[9]

BBB, then 15 years old, recalled that on December 1, 2015, at around 4:00 a.m., while she was sleeping in her room, she was sexually abused by AAA, her stepfather. She said that her mother, ODD, was not home as she leaves early to sell vegetables in the market. When AAA got into her room, he took off her jogging pants and his shorts. He then climbed on top of her and inserted his penis in her vagina.[10]

BB alleged that AAA threatened to kill her family if she resisted his lewd advances. When he was done, he wore his shorts back and told BBB to keep silent. She wanted to shout and push the accused away but he threatened to kill her, her mother, or her family.[11]

From December 1 to 24, 2015, AAA would go to her room at around 4:00 a.m. to sexually assault BBB whenever her mother was not around. Repeated sexual assaults on BBB happened in similar ways and under similar conditions.[12] AAA would remove her shorts and underwear, remove his shorts and underwear, mount her, insert his penis into her vagina and start pumping.[13] Unfortunately, her room's door lock was broken and had not been fixed because her mother and brother were always busy with work.[14]

When she could no longer take the pain of being sexually abused over and over again, BBB told her sister EEE about what happened.[15]

Her sister then brought her to the barangay to file a Complaint.[16]

Upon medico-legal examination on BBB, Dr. Martinez found the ""presence of deep healed laceration at the 6 o'clock position of the hymen.""[17] The examination showed ""clear evidence of blunt penetrating trauma to the hymen caused by any blunt hard object that penetrated the hymen which could be an erected penis, finger or any blunt hard object.""[18]

For his defense, AAA denied the accusations.[19] He testified that from December 1, 2015 to December 24, 2015 at 4:00 a.m., the period that BBB was allegedly raped, he slept in a different room. Their house had three separate rooms, and thus it was physically impossible for him to be in her room.[20] Most of the time, he woke up at around 6:00 or 7:00 a.m. and went with BBB's mother to Novaliches market at around 10:00 a.m.[21] Further, AAA asserted that he did not have the physical strength to commit the crime and overpower BBB into submission as he lost his left hand in a firecracker accident in 1990.[22]

In its January 30, 2020 Judgment,[23] the Regional Trial Court convicted AAA of seven counts of rape.[24] The trial court found that the alleged rape committed on December 8 to 24, 2015 had not been established by the required quantum of evidence as BBB ""merely made a general statement that the rape was committed in.the same manner as in the previous dates already testified on.""[25]","The moral ascendancy of the common law father of a minor substitutes force and intimidation in rape.[1] When the offender has moral ascendancy over the victim, physical resistance no longer needs to be proven.

This Court resolves an appeal[2] from the Court of Appeals Decision[3] finding AAA guilty beyond reasonable doubt of rape under Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code, as amended. The Court of Appeals modified the Judgment[4] of the trial court, finding AAA guilty of six counts of rape instead of seven.","This Court does not find accused-appellant's alibis to be credible.

First, he claimed that it was physically impossible for him to be in BBB's room when the rape happened as he was sleeping in another room. Second, he insisted that the charges were baseless, claiming that the cases were filed against him because BBB's mother and her two sisters had a misunderstanding, which led them to leave their house. He even claimed that he had a good relationship with BBB as he supported her studies and everyday needs.[59] Third, accused-appellant pointed out that he could not overpower BBB if she resisted as he only had one hand. Lastly, he asserted that she had the chance to report the incident to the authorities or even tell her mother, but she decided not to.[60]

This Court has consistently ruled that for alibi to prosper, it is not enough for the accused to prove that they have been elsewhere when the crime was committed. They must also show that it was physically impossible for them to be at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission.[61]

Accused-appellant's alibi fails to persuade this Court.

BBB's positive identification of the accused and her testimony pointed to accused-appellant as the offender. By saying that he was in the next room, accused-appellant in effect admitted that it was not physically impossible for him to have been at the crime scene during the times when BBB was raped.[62]

In addition, the delay in reporting the incidents to the proper authorities did not taint BBB's credibility. Jurisprudence provides that ""long silence and delay in reporting the crime of rape have not always been construed as an indication of false accusation.""[63] A rape barge becomes doubtful only when the delay in revealing its commission is unreasonable and cannot be explained.[64] In this case, accused-appellant threatened BBB that he would kill her family if she discloses to anyone what happened. We find this explanation for the delay reasonable.

The claim of the accused-appellant that the charges filed against him were baseless as these were filed due to the misunderstanding between BBB's mother and her is unsubstantiated. Further, accused-appellant's claim that BBB could have defended herself against his advances emphasizing that he would not have been able to overpower her if she resisted, given that he only had the use of one hand is unjustified.

In People v. Senieres,[65] this Court held that there is ""no standard form of behavior [that] can be anticipated of a rape victim following her defilement, particularly by a child who could not be expected to fully comprehend the ways of an adult. People react differently to emotional stress and rape victims are no different from them.""[66]

Further, the Court held that ""physical resistance need not be established in rape when threats and intimidation are employed and the victim submits herself to the embrace of her rapist because of fear.""[67]

With this, we affirm accused-appellant's conviction and dismiss the appeal. In People v. Jugueta,[68] this Court held that ""when the circumstances of the crime call for the imposition of reclusion perpetua only, the civil indemnity and moral damages should be .[PHP] 75,000.00 each, as well as exemplary damages in the amount of [PHP] 75,000.00.""","ACCORDINGLY, the March 22, 2022 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR HC No. 14261 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. Accused-appellant AAA is GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of six counts of rape in Criminal Case Nos. 265-M-2016 to 268-M-2016 and 270-M-2016 to 271-M-2016. He is sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua for each of the six counts.

He is ORDERED to pay BBB PHP 75,000.00 as civil liability, PHP 75,000.00 as moral damages, and PHP 75,000.00 as exemplary damages for each of the six counts of rape. All damages awarded shall earn interest at the legal rate of 6% per annum from the finality of this Decision until fully paid.[69]"
"B.M. No. 4720, January 30, 2024","IN RE: PETITION TO RETAIN/REACQUIRE THE PRIVILEGE TO RESUME THE PRACTICE OF LAW IN THE PHILIPPINES, REGINA STELLA P. JACINTO, PETITIONER.","Jacinto alleged that she was admitted as a member of the Philippine Bar on April 11, 1996 with Roll of Attorneys No. 40547. However, on May 29, 2023, she received her Maltese citizenship. She alleged that according to the Maltese Citizenship Act, it is lawful for any person to be a citizen of Malta and at the same time a citizen of another country. Thus, she alleged that she was not required to renounce her Philippine citizenship under the said law. She likewise posits that pursuant to Republic Act (RA) 9225, otherwise known as the ""Citizenship Retention and Re-acquisition Act of 2003,"" she is deemed not to have lost her Philippine citizenship, considering that she became a Maltese citizen after the effectivity of the law.[2]

Thus, on June 29, 2023, Jacinto filed a Petition for Retention/Re­-Acquisition of Philippine Citizenship under RA 9225[3] with the Bureau of Immigration (BI) to formalize the retention of her Philippine citizenship. Accordingly, the BI granted her Petition in an Order[4] dated July 14, 2023 leading to the issuance of a Certificate of Re-acquisition/Retention of Philippine Citizenship/Identification Certificate[5] similarly dated July 14, 2023. Thereafter, Jacinto, on August 7, 2023, took her Oath of Allegiance[6] to the Republic of the Philippines before a solemnizing officer of the BI in the City of Manila, Philippines.[7]

Considering the foregoing, Jacinto filed the present Petition with the OBC. Following the documents previously required by the OBC as indicated in In Re: Muneses,[8] she submitted the following documents:

(a)
A copy of her Certificate of Naturalization[9] dated May 29, 2023;

(e)
A certified true copy of the Oath of Allegiance[13] to the Republic of the Philippines dated August 7, 2023;

(m)
A photocopy of the Official Receipt[21] dated January 4, 2023 as proof of payment of her professional tax for year 2023;


(n)
A copy of her Certificate of Compliance[22] dated February 2, 2023 issued by the Mandatory Continuing Legal Education Office stating that she has complied with the required units for the 7th Compliance Period under Bar Matter No. 850.","Before the Court is a Petition[1] dated September 8, 2023 to formalize the Privilege to Practice Law in the Philippines filed by petitioner Regina Stella P. Jacinto* (Jacinto) before the Office of the Bar Confidant (OBC) praying that she be allowed to formalize her privilege to practice law in the Philippines.","The Court adopts the Report and Recommendation of the OBC with modification.

Time and time again, this Court has emphasized that any person who is privileged to practice law in the Philippines is required to strictly adhere to certain conditions:
The practice of law is a privilege burdened with conditions. It is so delicately affected with public interest that it is both the power and duty of the State (through this Court) to control and regulate it in order to protect and promote the public welfare.

Adherence to rigid standards of mental fitness, maintenance of the highest degree of morality, faithful observance of the legal profession, compliance with the mandatory continuing legal education requirement and payment of membership fees to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) are the conditions required for membership in good standing in the bar and for enjoying the privilege to practice law. Any breach by a lawyer of any of these conditions makes him unworthy of the trust and confidence which the courts and clients repose in him for the continued exercise of his professional privilege.[25]
In this relation, Rule 138, Section 2 of the Rules of Court dictates that one of the requirements for admission to the Philippine Bar is a Philippine citizenship:
Section 2. Requirements for all applicants for admission to the bar. - Every applicant for admission as a member of the bar must be a citizen of the Philippines, at least twenty-one years of age, of good moral character, and a resident of the Philippines; and must produce before the Supreme Court satisfactory evidence of good moral character, and that no charges against him, involving moral turpitude, have been filed or are pending in any court in the Philippines. (Emphasis supplied)
In In Re: Muneses, the Court En Banc categorically held that one's Philippine citizenship is a continuing requirement for the practice of law in the Philippines.[26] Thus, the loss of one's Philippine citizenship results in the termination of their membership in the Philippine Bar; ergo, one loses the privilege to engage in the practice of law in the Philippines. [27]

Nonetheless, in the cases of In Re: Dacanay[28] and In Re: Muneses,[29] the Court has consistently held that a Filipino who loses their citizenship by reason of naturalization is considered to have reacquired the same by taking an oath of allegiance to the Republic. The reacquisition of Philippine citizenship thereby allows a person to again be qualified for membership of the Philippine Bar since the reacquisition of Philippine citizenship is not an automatic grant to resume the practice of law. Thus, a person who has reacquired one's citizenship still needs to apply with the proper authority for the license or permit to engage in the practice of a profession pursuant to Section 5 of RA No. 9225.[30]","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition of Attorney Regina Stella P. Jacinto is GRANTED, subject to the condition that she shall re-take the Lawyer's Oath, sign the Roll of Attorneys, and subject to the payment of appropriate fees."
" A.M. No. P-23-082 (Formerly OCA IPI No. 19-4991-P), January 30, 2024","RODALYN GUINTO-HANIF, COMPLAINANT, VS. CHRISTOPHER T. PEREZ, SHERIFF IV, BRANCH 74, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, OLONGAPO CITY, ZAMBALES, RESPONDENT.","On October 14, 2009, the Subic Bay Development and Management Corporation, Inc. entered into an Industrial Lease Agreement with M. Waseem International Trading Corporation (M. Waseem) over a 5,000-square meter parcel of land located on Innovative Street, Subic Bay Gateway Park, Subic Bay Freeport Zone, for a period of 38 years.[2] Rodalyn averred that she and her husband, Muhammad Hanif (Muhammad), were the biggest shareholders of M. Waseem, while Muhammad was also the president of the company.[3]

On December 20, 2016, Rodalyn and Muhammad executed separate Deeds of Assignment transferring 380 shares of stock to Zeeshan Ashraf (Zeeshan) and 367 shares of stock to Hamza Shabbir (Hamza) for a consideration of PHP 1,000.00 per share. On January 10, 2017, a new set of Board of Directors and Officers were elected in M. Waseem.[4]

On December 17, 2017, at around 4:30 a.m., Rodalyn, along with 20 other individuals armed with high caliber firearms and other dangerous weapons, forcibly entered the leased warehouse/office compound of M. Waseem and ordered the employees and caretakers to vacate the yard under threat of being fired upon.[5]

This led to the filing by Hamza and Zeeshan, as authorized representatives of M. Waseem, of a complaint for Forcible Entry with Prayer for the Immediate Issuance of Writ of Preliminary Injunction and/or Temporary Restraining Order with the Municipal Trial Court in Cities (MTCC), Olongapo City against Rodalyn and Muhammad and the other individuals who acted under their supervision. The case was docketed as Civil Case No. 7733 and raffled to Branch 3 of the MTCC, Olongapo City, Zambales.[6]

In their Answer, Rodalyn and Muhammad averred that the Deeds of Assignment executed with Hamza and Zeeshan were null and void for lack of valuable consideration as the assignees failed to pay for the shares. Thus, Rodalyn and Muhammad argued that they did not forcibly enter the leased property considering that they were still the majority owners of M. Waseem.[7]

The MTCC decided in favor of Hamza and Zeeshan in its Decision[8] dated August 24, 2018, the dispositive portion of which reads:

WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiffs as follows:

Ordering the defendants and all persons claiming right[s] under them to vacate the premises situated at 35 Lot 70-A Innovative Street, Subic Bay Gateway Park, SBFZ, Olongapo City and peacefully return possession thereof to the plaintiffs;

Ordering the defendants to pay the plaintiffs the amount of One Hundred Thousand Pesos [[PHP] 100,000.00] per month for the use of the premises from the time of filing of the Complaint until the premises shall have been vacated and turned over to the plaintiffs;

Costs against the defendants.

Perez (Sheriff Perez) of Branch 74, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Olongapo City, Zambales for grave misconduct and conduct unbecoming a public officer.","The Court adopts the factual findings of the JIB, but finds it necessary to modify the administrative liability of Sheriff Perez.

At the outset, the Court notes that Sheriff Perez has repeatedly failed to submit his comment despite the numerous opportunities given to him by the OCA.

After the complaint against Sheriff Perez was filed on November 26, 2020, the OCA, on January 10, 2020, referred the complaint to Sheriff Perez via the 1st Indorsement wherein he was given 10 days from receipt thereof to submit his comment.[36]

On March 2, 2020, Sheriff Perez submitted a Motion for Extension of Time to File Comment,[37] which the OCA granted but despite the extension, Sheriff Perez failed to submit his comment.

On October 20, 2020, the OCA sent a 1st Tracer[38] to Sheriff Perez, reiterating the previous directive for him to submit his comment, this time within five days from receipt of the tracer, otherwise the matter would be submitted to the Court. However, despite the repeated directives, Sheriff Perez still failed to submit his comment.[39]

Based on the records, Sheriff Perez has been given several opportunities to submit his comment and address the allegations against him. There was also no question that Sheriff Perez knows of the existence of the complaint, as evidenced by his filing of a motion for extension of time to file his comment. Yet, despite the numerous opportunities given him, and notwithstanding the consideration given by the OCA in granting his motion for extension, Sheriff Perez continued to display a clear dispassion towards the complaint filed against him.","ACCORDINGLY, the Court rules that:

1.
Christopher T. Perez be found GUILTY of Grave Abuse of Authority and be DISMISSED FROM THE SERVICE with forfeiture of all benefits, and disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office, including government-owned or -controlled corporations. Provided, however, that the forfeiture of benefits shall in no case include accrued leave credits; and


2.
Christopher T. Perez be found GUILTY of Gross Insubordination and be meted with a penalty of a FINE in the amount of PHP 110,000.00. He shall pay the fine within a period not exceeding three (3) months from the time this decision is promulgated. If unpaid, such amount may be deducted from the accrued leave credits due to him."
"A.C. No. 13955 (Formerly CBD Case No. 19-6114), January 30, 2024","ADRIAN M. KELLEY, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. CIPRIANO D. ROBIELOS III, RESPONDENT.","According to Kelley, sometime in February 2016, Atty. Robielos borrowed from him PHP 240,000.00, for which Atty. Robielos issued as payment Bank of Commerce Check No. 0000008[2] dated June 30, 2016. When he presented the check for payment, however, the same was dishonored for being ""drawn against insufficient funds."" He consequently sent Atty. Robielos a demand letter[3] dated July 30, 2016.[4]

He and Atty. Robielos subsequently entered into an Agreement[5] (""Kasunduan ng Pag-Aayos"") dated September 13, 2016 before the Office of the Barangay Chairman, Barangay 33, Caloocan City, whereby Atty. Robielos committed to pay in installments of PHP 20,000.00 every 15 days for a period of six months. Atty. Robielos, however, only paid three installments or a total of PHP 60,000.00, leaving a balance of PHP 180,000.00.[6]

He was, therefore, constrained to file a small claims complaint[7] against Atty. Robielos before the Branch 51, Metropolitan Trial Court, Caloocan City, (MeTC-Branch 51) docketed as Small Claims Case No. 17-2040. Despite receipt of summons, Atty. Robielos failed to file an answer and did not appear during the hearing.[8]

By Decision[9] dated February 23, 2017, MeTC-Branch 51 ordered Atty. Robielos to pay the amount of PHP 180,000.00 with 5% interest per annum. Kelley then filed a Motion for Execution,[10] which Atty. Robielos opposed,[11] claiming he had suffered a mild stroke. During the hearing on the motion for execution, Atty. Robielos appeared and was directed by the court to file his answer, which he did. Atty. Robielos countered that the check was issued merely to ""return a favor"" and was not intended to be encashed as payment for a debt.[12]

By Order[13] dated April 3, 2017, MeTC-Branch 51 found the aforesaid defense to be devoid of merit, hence, it granted the motion for execution. The same was affirmed by the Branch 129, Regional Trial Court, Caloocan City per its Order[14] dated June 14, 2017. An alias writ of execution was eventually served on Atty. Robielos who still refused to pay the judgment award.[15]

Consequently, this time, Kelley was compelled to file the instant administrative complaint against Atty. Robielos.[16]","Complainant Adrian M. Kelley (Kelley) charged respondent Atty. Cipriano D. Robielos III (Atty. Robielos) before the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) with grave misconduct, averring that the latter issued a worthless check and failed to pay his debt in violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR) and the Lawyer's Oath.[1]","At the outset, the Court emphasizes that the provisions of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability (CPRA), which took effect on May 30, 2023, apply to the present case by virtue of Section 1, of the General Provisions of the CPRA, viz.:

Section 1. Transitory Provision. — The CPRA shall be applied to all pending and future cases, except to the extent that in the opinion of the Supreme Court, its retroactive application would not be feasible or would work injustice, in which case the procedure under which the cases were filed shall govern.

Membership in the Bar is a privilege burdened with conditions. Time and again, the Court has imposed the penalty of suspension or disbarment for any gross misconduct that a lawyer may have committed, whether it is in his or her professional or private capacity. Good character is an essential qualification for the admission to and continued practice of law. Hence, any wrongdoing, whether professional or non-professional, indicating unfitness for the profession justifies disciplinary action,[27] as here.

Indeed, the Court has repeatedly ordained that -

Law is a noble profession, and the privilege to practice it is bestowed only upon individuals who are competent intellectually, academically and, equally important, morally. Because they are vanguards of the law and the legal system, lawyers must at all times conduct themselves, especially in their dealings with their clients and the public at large, with honesty and integrity in a manner beyond reproach.[28]

Unfortunately, Atty. Robielos failed to live up to these standards.

Atty. Robielos is guilty of violation of
Canon II of the CPRA","ACCORDINGLY, respondent Atty. Cipriano D. Robielos III is found GUILTY of violation of Canons II and III of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability. He is DISBARRED from the practice of law and his name is ORDERED stricken off from the Roll of Attorneys, effective immediately. He is also meted a FINE in the amount of PHP 35,000.00 for his repeated disobedience to the orders of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines. Finally, he is directed to PAY his debt to complainant Adrian M. Kelley and comply with the Writ of Execution dated April 3, 2017 issued by the Branch 51, Metropolitan Trial Court, Caloocan City.

Let a copy of this Decision be attached to his personal record in the Office of the Bar Confidant.

Too, furnish a copy of this Decision to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines for its information and guidance; and the Office of the Court Administrator for dissemination to all courts of the Philippines."
"G.R. No. 261107, January 30, 2024","ANA LIZA ARRIOLA PERALTA, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, REPRESENTED BY THE CAMPAIGN FINANCE UNIT, RESPONDENT.","Petitioner ran for the position of Mayor in the Municipality of San Marcelino, Zambales, during the May 10, 2010, National and Local Elections (2010 NLE).[7] At the time, there were 20,301 registered voters in the municipality.[8]

In a Letter[9] to petitioner dated October 1, 2014, Atty. Ferdinand T. Rafanan (Atty. Rafanan), Head of the Campaign Finance Unit of the COMELEC, stated that petitioner spent the amount of PHP 285,500.00 during the 2010 NLE per the Statement of Contributions & Expenditures (SOCE) which she submitted to the COMELEC on June 7, 2010. Under Section 100 of the OEC, as amended by Section 13 of Republic Act No. 7166, the maximum allowable expenditure for petitioner was PHP 3.00 per registered voter or a total of PHP 60,903.00. Thus, as petitioner appeared to have exceeded the limit set by law, Atty. Rafanan directed her to submit her written explanation as to why no charges should be filed against her for the election offense of overspending under Section 262 in relation to the OEC, Section 100, as amended by Republic Act No. 7166, Section 13.

In her letter-response[10] dated March 2, 2015, petitioner attached the respective affidavits of her contributors, along with their corresponding explanations or clarifications on the declarations made in the Schedule of Contributions Received and Reports of Contributors,[11] as follows:
Lance Stefan L. Flamiano – the amount of his tarpaulin contributions was mistakenly written as PHP 30,000.00 instead of PHP 3,000.00;[12]

Noel P. Cacho – his contribution amounting to PHP 7,000.00 partook of the nature of copying and classifying the list of voters, investigating the registered voters on the list, and printing of sample ballots; however, it was erroneously indicated as meals and snacks in the report of his contribution;[13]

Maria Christina P. Penaflor – her contribution amounting to PHP 18,000.00 partook of the nature of copying and classifying the list of voters, investigating the registered voters on the list, and printing of sample ballots; however, it was erroneously indicated as meals and snacks in the report of her contribution;[14]

Rolando A. Flamiano – he contributed PHP 10,000.00 worth of home-made sample ballots; however, in his report of contribution, he caused the word ""leaflets"" to be written in conformity with the report's suggested description and as understood by him as being the nearest description of his contribution;[15]

Daniel A. Villanueva – his contribution of PHP 12,000.00 was not for meals and snacks as reflected in his report of contribution; upon careful recollection, he contributed PHP 8,000.00 for home-made printing of sample ballots and PHP 4,000.00 for copying and classifying the lists of voters;[16]

Heidi P. Villanueva – her report of contribution erroneously reflected meals and snacks in the amount of PHP 84,000.00; however, she only contributed PHP 2,000.00 for meals and snacks while the remaining PHP 82,000.00 was for copying and classifying the lists of voters, investigating the registered voters on the list, and printing of home-made sample ballots;[17]

Isabelita Peralta – she contributed the amount of PHP 5,000.00 for copying and classifying the lists of voters; however, the description in the schedule of contributions reflected ""papers/pens"";[18]

Jonathan S. Peralta – he contributed the amount of PHP 11,000.00 for copying and classifying the lists of voters, investigating the registered voters on the list, and printing of home-made sample ballots; he denied giving PHP 3,000.00 for vehicle and PHP 8,000.00 for meals and snacks, as reflected in the schedule of contributions;[19] and

Apolinario Abelon – he contributed home-made sample ballots amounting to PHP 3,000.00 only and corrected the figure of PHP 30,000.00 for meals and snacks appearing on the schedule of contributions.[20]
Petitioner further indicated in her letter that she underwent hip stress fracture surgery on December 10, 2014, after suffering serious injuries from a vehicular accident in Cancun, Mexico, on November 10, 2014. Thus, her mobility was very restricted and limited from such date. In addition, petitioner maintained that the distance between her and her contributors restricted her from easily conducting verification considering that she was based in Makati City, while almost all of her contributors were based in the Province of Zambales. She then requested that she be allowed to submit relevant documents as soon as they become available.[21]","Before the Court is a Petition for Certiorari[1] assailing Resolution No. 18-0656[2] dated August 8, 2018, and Resolution No. 21-0472-57[3] dated July 14, 2021, issued by the respondent Commission on Elections (COMELEC) En Banc in E.O. Case No. 15-954. In the assailed issuances, the COMELEC found probable cause to hold Ana Liza A. Peralta (petitioner) for trial and directed the filing of an Information against her for election overspending under Section 100[4] in relation to Section 262[5] of Batas Pambansa No. (BP) 881, otherwise known as the Omnibus Election Code (OEC), as amended by Republic Act No. 7166.[6]","The Court grants the petition.

There was inordinate delay in the conduct of the preliminary investigation before the COMELEC which violated petitioner's right to speedy disposition of cases. Hence, the dismissal of the complaint against her is warranted.

The 1987 Constitution, Article III, Section 16,[50] guarantees the right of all persons to a speedy disposition of their cases before all judicial, quasi-judicial, or administrative bodies. This constitutional right is available not only to the accused in criminal proceedings but also to all parties in all cases, whether civil or administrative in nature, as well as all proceedings, either judicial or quasi-judicial. Pursuant thereto, any party to a case may demand expeditious action from all officials who are tasked with the administration of justice.[51]

In resolving whether petitioner's right to the speedy disposition of her case was violated, the guidelines set forth by the Court in Cagang v. Sandiganbayan,[52] find relevance:
First, the right to speedy disposition of cases is different from the right to speedy trial. While the rationale for both rights is the same, the right to speedy trial may only be invoked in criminal prosecutions against courts of law. The right to speedy disposition of cases, however, may be invoked before any tribunal, whether judicial or quasi-judicial. What is important is that the accused may already be prejudiced by the proceeding for the right to speedy disposition of cases to be invoked.

Second, a case is deemed initiated upon the filing of a formal complaint prior to a conduct of a preliminary investigation. This Court acknowledges, however, that the Ombudsman should set reasonable periods for preliminary investigation, with due regard to the complexities and nuances of each case. Delays beyond this period will be taken against the prosecution. The period taken for fact-finding investigations prior to the filing of the formal complaint shall not be included in the determination of whether there has been inordinate delay.

Third, courts must first determine which party carries the burden of proof. If the right is invoked within the given time periods contained in current Supreme Court resolutions and circulars, and the time periods that will be promulgated by the Office of the Ombudsman, the defense has the burden of proving that the right was justifiably invoked. If the delay occurs beyond the given time period and the right is invoked, the prosecution has the burden of justifying the delay.

If the defense has the burden of proof, it must prove first, whether the case is motivated by malice or clearly only politically motivated and is attended by utter lack of evidence, and second, that the defense did not contribute to the delay.

Once the burden of proof shifts to the prosecution, the prosecution must prove first, that it followed the prescribed procedure in the conduct of preliminary investigation and in the prosecution of the case; second, that the complexity of the issues and the volume of evidence made the delay inevitable; and third, that no prejudice was suffered by the accused as a result of the delay.

Fourth, determination of the length of d lay is never mechanical. Courts must consider the entire context of the case, from the amount of evidence to be weighed to the simplicity or complexity of the issues raised.

An exception to this rule is if there is an allegation that the prosecution of the case was solely motivated by malice, such as when the case is politically motivated or when there is continued prosecution despite utter lack of evidence. Malicious intent may be gauged from the behavior of the prosecution throughout the proceedings. If malicious prosecution is properly alleged and substantially proven, the case would automatically be dismissed without need of further analysis of the delay.

Another exception would be the waiver of the accused to the right to speedy disposition of cases or the right to speedy trial. If it can be proven that the accused acquiesced to the delay the constitutional right can no longer be invoked.","ACCORDINGLY, the petition is GRANTED. Resolution No. 18-0656 dated August 8, 2018, and Resolution No. 21-0472-57 dated July 14, 2021, of the Commission on Elections En Banc in E.O. Case No. 15-954, are NULLIFIED for having been issued with grave abuse of discretion. The complaint against petitioner Ana Liza Arriola Peralta for alleged election overspending is DISMISSED."
"A.M. No. P-23-077 (Formerly OCA IPI No. 20-5026-P), January 30, 2024","DANILO D. DIVINAGRACIA, COMPLAINANT, VS. MICHAEL VINCENT L. OZON, CLERK III, BRANCH 1, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, BUTUAN CITY, AGUSAN DEL NORTE, RESPONDENT.","In his Letter-Complaint dated December 27, 2019, complainant alleged that he requested from Branch 1, RTC, Butuan City, Agusan del Norte, a certificate of finality of the decision it rendered in his case for declaration of nullity of marriage. He averred that respondent, who is a son-in-law of a judge, asked him to pay PHP 25,000.00 for the release of the certificate of finality of his case. Later, he encountered and spoke with other people who shared with him the same predicament he experienced with respondent.[3]

Complainant further alleged that respondent previously worked at the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) where ""under-the-table"" and ""S.O.P."" arrangements were apparently a common practice.[4]

In the 1st Indorsement[5] dated February 7, 2020, the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) referred the matter to Executive Judge Augustus L. Calo (Executive Judge Calo), RTC, Butuan City, Agusan del Norte, for a discreet investigation and report.

In relation to the aforementioned Letter-Complaint, respondent, on June 1, 2020, received a Notice to Explain[6] dated May 28, 2020, from Executive Judge Calo directing him to submit a written explanation within five calendar days from receipt of notice.[7]

In his handwritten explanation Letter[8] dated June 5, 2020, respondent denied the accusations against him. He countered that he merely prepared the trial court's certificates of finality, and it was the Branch Clerk of Court who was in charge of releasing them.[9] He also denied complainant's allegations of his ""under-the-table"" and ""S.O.P."" dealings during his employment with the DPWH. Anent complainant's allegation of nepotism, respondent clarified that Judge Eduardo S. Casals (Judge Casals) was his relative within the 5th degree of consanguinity, and thus, the rule on nepotism does not apply to him.[10] Lastly, he challenged his accusers to appear personally to settle the issue once and for all.[11]

Thereafter, Executive Judge Calo requested Atty. Joan B. Alabat-Torralba (Atty. Alabat-Torralba), the Branch Clerk of Court of Branch 1, RTC, Butuan City, to comment on the complaint.[12]

In her Comment[13] dated June 19, 2020, Atty. Alabat-Torralba stated the following: she had heard of respondent's alleged illegal involvement in the service of decisions in cases for declaration of nullity of marriage. Sometime in 2019, Judge Casals directed her to remove the duty of releasing certificates of finality from respondent after learning that he delayed the release of the certificate of finality to a lawyer who refused to give him money. At one time, a litigant, who gave respondent PHP 500.00, came to her crying because she had been visiting the trial court repeatedly, but the requested certificate of finality had not yet been issued. She reprimanded respondent, ordered him to return the PHP 500.00, and reported the matter to Judge Casals. She found out from their legal researcher that the client of the latter's lawyer-friend was cajoled by respondent into paying PHP 5,000.00 in order that the copy of the decision for the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) could be sent via a private courier service instead of registered mail. To prevent the occurrence of similar events, Acting Presiding Judge Emmanuel E. Escatron, in a Memorandum[14] dated June 15, 2020, directed respondent to refrain and desist from having a hand in the service of decisions to parties in civil cases.[15]

Anent respondent's performance at work, Atty. Alabat-Torralba declared the following: (1) respondent was often tardy or absent and would go out of the office at any time without asking for permission; (2) respondent did not update the docket books and logbooks of cases; and (3) respondent incurred delay in the transmittal of case records to the Court of Appeals.[16]

Relative to his investigation, Executive Judge Calo obtained sworn statements from two private individuals (Affiant 1 and Affiant 2) who requested that their identities be kept confidential.[17] Atty. Alabat-Torralba's allegation that respondent offered facilitation services to litigants in exchange for PHP 5,000.00 per decision was bolstered by the sworn affidavits of Affiant 1 and Affiant 2.

In an Affidavit[18] dated June 17, 2020, Affiant 1 introduced herself as the secretary of a law practitioner in Butuan City. She narrated that: (1) respondent, at one time, called her attention and told her that he had a friend working at the OSG; (2) respondent assured her that the return card of notices of decision sent to the parties can make it back as fast as three days by mailing them through private courier, together with PHP 5,000.00; (3) she told respondent that she will discuss the latter's offer to their clients; (4) respondent further informed her that he had helped some of their clients in serving decisions to the OSG; and (5) from 2017 to February 2020, she personally gave respondent PHP 5,000.00 for each of the 10 cases he handled. Affiant 1 provided the case titles and docket numbers of these cases in her Affidavit.[19]

Atty. Brainard J. Morales, Clerk of Court V, certified that the decisions rendered in the cases enumerated by Affiant 1 involved petitions for declaration of nullity of marriage which were granted by the RTC.[20]

Meanwhile, in her Affidavit[21] dated June 19, 2020, Affiant 2 alleged that she was the petitioner in a case for declaration of nullity of marriage before the RTC. Sometime in January 2020, she went to the trial court to follow up her case and met respondent, who gave his cellphone number. In February 2020, she asked respondent, through a text message, for an update of her case. Respondent told her that if she was in a hurry, he can have the certificate of finality expedited by sending a copy of the decision of the case to the OSG through a private courier upon payment of the amount of PHP 5,000.00. Affiant 2's lawyer, however, advised her to ""refrain from doing anything that is stupid."" She asked respondent for an update of her case on May 16, 2020, but respondent merely told her that he will prioritize her case and explained that the delay was due to the mailing of the decision through the Post Office.[22]

In an Investigation Report[23] dated June 26, 2020, Executive Judge Calo found substantial evidence to hold respondent guilty of gross misconduct.","Before the Court is a Letter-Complaint[1] dated December 27, 2019, from a person under the nom de plume ""Danilo D. Divinagracia"" (complainant) charging respondent Michael Vincent L. Ozon (respondent), Clerk III, Branch 1, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Butuan City, Agusan del Norte, with Gross Misconduct and violation of Republic Act No. 6713.[2]","After a careful review of the case records, the Court affirms the findings of Executive Judge Calo and the JIB and finds respondent administratively liable for gross misconduct for (1) demanding money from litigants for the release of certificates of finality and (2) sending copies of the decision in annulment cases pending before the RTC to the OSG via a private courier in exchange for money. Accordingly, respondent should be meted out the penalty of dismissal from service.

Respondent is guilty of the serious charge of Gross Misconduct.
""Misconduct is a transgression of some established and definite rule of action, more particularly, unlawful behavior or gross negligence by the public officer.""[46] The offense becomes gross misconduct when any of the elements of corruption, clear intent to violate the law, and flagrant disregard of established rule is present.[47]

Here, the elements of corruption and clear intent to violate the law are present.

Although respondent denied ever demanding money for the release of certificates of finality, his superior, Atty. Alabat-Torralba, corroborated complainant's allegation when she attested that one litigant came crying to her after not receiving the certificate of finality from her case despite having paid PHP 500.00 to respondent for its release.

Respondent's act of demanding money from litigants for the release of certificates of finality alone constitutes gross misconduct and warrants the ultimate penalty of dismissal. His bare denial is self-serving and a weak defense vis-à-vis Atty. Alabat-Torralba's positive testimony.

Worse, Atty. Alabat-Torralba also revealed during Judge Calo's investigation that respondent offered facilitation services to litigants in order to expedite the service of and receipt of the copy of the decision by the OSG. This allegation was supported by the sworn affidavits of Affiant 1 and Affiant 2 and corroborated by the findings of the JIB that respondent mailed copies of the decisions to the OSG via a private courier and had the signed return reverted to the RTC in the same manner.

A decision granting a petition for declaration of nullity of void marriages and annulment of void marriages becomes final upon the expiration of 15 days from notice to the parties, including the OSG, and no motion for reconsideration or new trial, or appeal is filed. Pertinent is Section 19 of A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC[48] which provides:

SECTION 19. Decision. — (1) If the court renders a decision granting the petition, it shall declare therein that the decree of absolute nullity or decree of annulment shall be issued by the court only after compliance with Articles 50 and 51 of the Family Code as implemented under the Rule on Liquidation, Partition and Distribution of Properties.

(2) The parties, including the Solicitor General and the public prosecutor, shall be served with copies of the decision personally or by registered mail. If the respondent summoned by publication failed to appear in the action, the dispositive part of the decision shall be published once in a newspaper of general circulation.

(3) The decision becomes final upon the expiration of fifteen days from notice to the parties. Entry of judgment shall be made if no motion for reconsideration or new trial, or appeal is filed by any of the parties, the public prosecutor, or the Solicitor General.

(4) Upon the finality of the decision, the court shall forthwith issue the corresponding decree if the parties have no properties.

If the parties have properties, the court shall observe the procedure prescribed in Section 21 of this Rule.","WHEREFORE, the Court finds respondent Michael Vincent L. Ozon, Clerk III of Branch 1, Regional Trial Court, Butuan City, Agusan del Norte, GUILTY of the serious charge of gross misconduct and DISMISSES him from the service with forfeiture of all benefits, except accrued leave credits, and disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office including government-owned or controlled corporation."

NEMIA ALMA Y. ALMANOCHE, COURT STENOGRAPHER III, BRANCH 10, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, MALAYBALAY CITY, BUKIDNON], PETITIONER, VS. NEMIA ALMA Y. ALMANOCHE, COURT STENOGRAPHER III, BRANCH 10, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, MALAYBALAY CITY, BUKIDNON, RESPONDENT.","Judge Camannong reported that on May 3, 2018, she learned from Louie Veluz (Veluz), a legal researcher in Branch 9, that the latter had received information from a certain Dianne Balansag (Balansag), a job order worker also in Branch 9, that Almanoche had solicited PHP 20,000.00 from a certain Jean Baguio (Baguio), allegedly in exchange for the dismissal of the criminal case against Baguio's two sons pending before Judge Camannong's sala. Almanoche allegedly told Baguio that the amount was for ""the judge, the fiscal, and the PAO.""[3]

Enraged by the information, Judge Camannong called up the prosecutor handling said criminal case, Prosecutor Iris T. Panganiban (Pros. Panganiban). Pros. Panganiban told Judge Camannong that Balansag and Baguio had already told her about the matter.[4]

Judge Camannong then relayed that on May 7, 2018, Pros. Panganiban brought Baguio to Judge Camannong's chambers where Baguio narrated the entire incident involving Almanoche. The Public Attorney's Office (PAO) lawyer handling the criminal case, Atty. Thania Marie Ibañez (Atty. Ibañez), was also present. When asked by Judge Camannong if she was willing to execute an affidavit detailing the matter, Baguio acceded,[5] and her affidavit was attached to Judge Camannong's letter to Judge Cole.[6]

In Baguio's Affidavit[7] dated May 8, 2018, she stated that she is the mother of the two accused in a frustrated murder case docketed as Criminal Case No. 32244-18 pending in Branch 9. She came to know of Almanoche through Loreta ""Auring"" O. Rico (Rico), who is the aunt of another co-accused in the same criminal case as Baguio's sons. On April 27, 2018, Baguio, a certain Fe Baguio, and Rico approached Almanoche, where the latter proposed to be given PHP 15,000.00 so that Almanoche could ""take care of the Prosecutor, the Judge, and the PAO.""[8] As Baguio did not have the full amount, and believing that Almanoche could help her, she gave Almanoche PHP 1,000.00 and promised to pay the balance on April 30, 2018. On April 28, 2018, she met with Rico, who showed her a text message from Almanoche that they should add PHP 5,000.00 because the case involves three accused. On April 29, 2018, she met with Kagawad Ricky James Balansag (Kagawad Balansag) to ask for financial help, who, in turn, suggested that the amount be given to the private complainant in the criminal case instead, a certain Mr. Remelito Binalo (Binalo). Nonetheless, Kagawad Balansag gave Baguio another PHP 5,000.00 to ""make [their] money PHP 20,000.00."" Thereafter on April 30, 2018, Baguio went to the Hall of Justice with Binalo and appeared before Pros. Panganiban so that Binalo could execute an Affidavit of Desistance) during which meeting she was ""able to mention"" the agreement she had with Almanoche.[9]

Acting on the letter of Judge Camannong, Judge Cole endorsed[10] the matter to Executive Judge Isobel G. Barroso (Judge Barroso) of the RTC in Malaybalay City, who then forwarded the same to the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) for appropriate action.[11]

In its Resolution,[12] this Court treated the Letter of Judge Camannong as a regular administrative matter against Almanoche for grave misconduct and corrupt practices and directed Almanoche to submit a comment.

In her Comment,[13] Almanoche vehemently denied the allegation against her. While she admitted that Rico, together with the other mothers of those accused in the criminal case, approached her for assistance, [14] she neither proposed any arrangement to settle the case,[15] nor has she accepted a single centavo from Baguio, or anyone for the settlement of any case in any court. She accommodated them because she and Rico are both Baes[16] of the Tagoloanen tribe, an indigenous cultural community.[17] She alleged that she merely advised them to go back to the Punong Barangay of Poblacion, Lantapan, Bukidnon so that Binalo, the private complainant in the criminal case, would be compelled to execute an Affidavit of Desistance and that her advice was based on Baguio's narration that they had already paid Binalo PHP 20,000.00 before the Office of the Punong Barangay. However, when they later inquired on the status of the case with the court, they discovered that the case had not yet been dismissed, and Binalo asked for an additional PHP 20,000.00 to execute an Affidavit of Desistance.[18] After the meeting, she no longer communicated with them. Almanoche claimed that she was not notified by either Judge Cole or Judge Barroso to explain herself at ""their level;"" and that it was unlikely for her to influence a judge, a prosecutor, and a PAO lawyer, especially when they are working in a different branch, while she is a mere stenographer.[19] To corroborate the material allegations in her Comment, Almanoche attached Rico's Affidavit.[20]","This Court resolves an administrative matter involving Nemia Alma Y. Almanoche (Almanoche), a Court Stenographer III of Branch 10, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Malaybalay City, Bukidnon.
This case arose from the Letter[1] of Presiding Judge Ma. Theresa A. Camannong (Judge Camannong) of Branch 9, RTC of Malaybalay City, Bukidnon (Branch 9), to Acting Presiding Judge Eldred D. Cole (Judge Cole) of Branch 10, RTC, Malaybalay City, Bukidnon (Branch 10). In her Letter, Judge Camannong informed Judge Cole of the alleged corrupt practices involving Almanoche.[2]","Upon a review of the established facts, this Court adopts the JIB's findings and recommended imposable penalty.

Reference to this Court's recently promulgated Further Amendments to Rule 140[41] of the Rules of Court (Rule 140) is appropriate as it now also governs the discipline of officials, employees, and personnel of the Judiciary. Although the alleged acts were perpetrated prior to the effectivity of the amendments, the amendments nonetheless govern, pursuant to Section 24[42] thereof.

Section 1(2) of Rule 140 requires that the allegations against Almanoche must be supported by affidavits of persons who have personal knowledge of the facts alleged therein or by authentic documents which may substantiate its allegations.

In the instant case, despite the accounts of several individuals that were implicated, it bears noting that only Baguio had personal knowledge of the April 27, 2018 incident involving Almanoche. Indeed, Judge Camannong and Veluz separately issued Manifestations[43] expressly stating that they had no personal knowledge of the incident involving Almanoche. In any event, we lend full credence to Baguio's testimony since, as astutely raised by Justice Amy C. Lazaro-Javier, it would be inconceivable for anyone to go so far, spreading such elaborate lies on different occasions to different people.

Moreover, while Judge Camannong, Pros. Panganiban, and Atty. Ibañez did not have personal knowledge of the incident involving Almanoche, it bears emphasis that Baguio, not long after the incident, narrated the event to one or all of them on separate occasions. The consistency in Baguio's details, as recalled by Judge Camannong, Pros. Panganiban, and Atty. Ibañez, strongly corroborates Baguio's account.

As adeptly underscored by Chief Justice Alexander G. Gesmundo, we are quick to clarify that, despite the lack of personal knowledge of Judge Camannong, Pros. Panganiban, and Atty. Ibañez on the incident of April 27, 2018, their accounts may nonetheless be admitted and given credence in view of Baguio's affidavit. Re: Verified Complaint dated July 13, 2015 of Alfonso Umali, Jr. v. Justice Hernandez[44] elucidates:

The relaxation of the hearsay rule in disciplinary administrative proceedings against judges and justices where bribery proceedings are involved is not a novel thought in this Court; it has been advocated in the Separate Concurring Opinion of Justice Arturo D. Brion in the administrative case of Justice Ong before this Court. The Opinion essentially maintained that the Court could make a conclusion that bribery had taken place when the circumstances—including those derived from hearsay evidence—sufficiently prove its occurrence. It was emphasized that [t]o satisfy the substantial evidence requirement for administrative cases, hearsay evidence should necessarily be supplemented and corroborated by other evidence that are not hearsay.

In the present case, however, the hearsay allegations constituted the totality of Umali’s evidence. The records did not contain any other piece of evidence to supplement the hearsay evidence. As earlier stated, Umali did not even attach any affidavit to the complaint relating to or tending to support the alleged attempted extortion. Umali relied mainly on surmises and conjectures, and on the mere fact that the Sandiganbayan rulings penned by Justice Hernandez were adverse to him.[45] (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)

From the foregoing and because the instant case is an administrative proceeding, the hearsay rule may be relaxed as the accounts of Judge Camannong, Pros. Panganiban, and Atty. Ibañez were supplemented and corroborated by Baguio's affidavit.","ACCORDINGLY, Nemia Alma Y. Almanoche is found GUILTY of serious dishonesty. She is ordered DISMISSED from service with forfeiture of all retirement benefits, except accrued leave credits. She is also disqualified from being re-employed in the government, including government-owned and controlled corporations."
"A.M. No. CA-23-001-P [Formerly JIB FPI No. 22-013-CA-P], January 30, 2024","COURT OF APPEALS, COMPLAINANT, VS. GARRY U. CALIWAN, MESSENGER, OFFICE OF THE DIVISION CLERK OF COURT, EDMUNDO T. MALIT, RECORDS OFFICER I, ARCHIVES SECTION, JUDICIAL RECORDS DIVISION, AND FREDERICK C. MAURICIO, UTILITY WORKER II, CIVIL CASES SECTION, JUDICIAL RECORDS DIVISION, ALL OF THE COURT OF APPEALS, MANILA RESPONDENTS.","On June 28, 2022, the CA conducted a random drug test in which Garry U. Caliwan (Caliwan), Edmundo T. Malit (Malit), and Frederick C. Mauricio (Mauricio) (collectively, respondents), all tested positive for methamphetamine [hydrochloride], also known as shabu, as confirmed by Labtox Analytical Laboratory, Inc., an accredited laboratory facility by the Department of Health – Dangerous Drugs Board.[2]

Consequently, the CA Committee on Ethics and Special Concerns recommended that respondents be held administratively liable for Grave Misconduct and accordingly dismissed from the service. For Mauricio, who opted for early retirement, the CA opined that he should be sanctioned instead with the forfeiture of the retirement benefits due to him as well as his perpetual disqualification from public service.[3]

The CA, through the Letter dated October 7, 2022, of Presiding Justice Salazar-Fernando, transmitted the case records to the Judicial Integrity Board (JIB) for appropriate action. Thereafter, the Office of the Executive Director (OED), JIB, required respondents to comment on the charges against them.[4]

In their separate Comments, Caliwan and Mauricio admitted to having used prohibited drugs, but they each prayed for the Court's leniency and benevolence in the disposition of their cases.[5] For Caliwan, he cited his exemplary record as evidenced by his performance ratings and the fact that this is his first offense in order to temper the disciplinary sanction against him.[6] As for Mauricio, he pointed to his 22-year government service in the CA as a mitigating circumstance in his favor.[7]

Malit, however, did not comply with the OED's directive to file a comment despite having sought several extensions of time to do so. Thus, the OED deemed the matter submitted for resolution based on the records at hand.[8]","This administrative matter pertains to the Letter[1] dated October 7, 2022, of Presiding Justice Remedios A. Salazar-Fernando (Presiding Justice Salazar-Fernando), Court of Appeals (CA), Manila regarding the administrative cases that the CA initiated against three of its personnel for the use of prohibited drugs.","The Court concurs with the findings and recommendations of the JIB.

It is settled that the use of prohibited drugs is tantamount to Grave Misconduct as the very act itself is a flagrant violation of Republic Act No. (RA) 9165, as amended by RA 10640, or the ""Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002.""[15] Thus, in the 2021 case of Re: Louie Mark U. De Guzman,[16] the Court imposed the penalty of dismissal from the service against the erring court employee for his proven use of marijuana, a dangerous drug.

It is significant to note, however, that Rule 140 of the Rules of Court, as further amended by A.M. No. 21-08-09-SC,[17] specifically classifies the Possession and/or Use of Illegal Drugs or Substances as a serious charge under Section 14(0) thereof. In other words, while past jurisp1udence has sanctioned the use of prohibited drugs under the umbrella of Grave Misconduct, the offense now squarely falls under the Possession and/or Use of Illegal Drugs or Substances when it is committed by those under the coverage of Rule 140.

This is in consonance with Section 6(A)(i) of A.M. No. 23-02-11-SC,[18] or the ""Guidelines for the Implementation of a Drug-Free Policy in the Philippine Judiciary"" (Guidelines), which states that a positive confirmatory or challenge test result for drug use, with the exception of test results arising from a court employee's voluntary submission to drug testing under Section 7 of the Guidelines, shall constitute as a sufficient basis for an administrative charge for Possession and/or Use of Illegal Drugs or Substances under Rule 140, as further amended.

The Guidelines also provide a voluntary submission mechanism through which a court employee may willingly submit himself or herself to drug testing before the conduct of a random drug test. As mentioned above, an initial positive drug test arising from this mechanism shall not be a ground for any administrative liability, but only for the first time. This means that if a court employee, who has already undergone and completed the treatment and/or drug rehabilitation program once, is found positive for drug use a second time after voluntarily submitting to a subsequent drug test, he or she shall be charged with the Possession and/or Use of Illegal Drugs or Substances accordingly.[19]

Thus, pursuant to the Guidelines, a court employee shall be held administratively liable for Possession and/or Use of Illegal Drugs or Substances under two scenarios: first, when he or she tests positive for drug use through a random drug test; and second, when he or she voluntarily submits himself or herself to drug testing and tests positive for drug use for a second time, despite having completed the treatment and/or drug rehabilitation program prior thereto.

In this connection, Section 17(1) of Rule 140, as further amended, provides the penalty to be imposed for a serious charge as follows:","WHEREFORE, the Court:
1)
Finds Garry U. Cali wan, Messenger, Office of the Division Clerk of Court, Court of Appeals, Manila, GUILTY of the Use of Prohibited Drugs or Substances and imposes against him the penalty of DISMISSAL FROM THE SERVICE, with forfeiture of all retirement benefits, except accrued leave credits, if any, and perpetual disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office, including government-owned and/or -controlled corporations;

Malit, Records Officer I, Archives Section, Judicial Records Division, Court of Appeals, Manila, GUILTY of the Use of Prohibited Drugs or Substances and imposes against him the penalty of DISMISSAL FROM THE SERVICE, with forfeiture of all retirement benefits, except accrued leave credits, if any, and perpetual disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office, including government-owned and/or -controlled corporations; and

"G.R. No. 198425, January 30, 2024","SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, PETITIONER, VS. HON. RODOLFO R. BONIFACIO, IN HIS CAPACITY AS THE PRESIDING JUDGE OF THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, BRANCH 159, PASIG CITY, PHILIPPINE ASSOCIATION OF SECURITIES BROKERS AND DEALERS, INC. (PASBDI), MA. VIVIAN YUCHENGCO, ISMAEL G. CRUZ, NESTOR S. AGUILA, AND MARITA A. LIMLINGAN, PHILIPPINE STOCK EXCHANGE (PSE) PSE'S 2009 NOMINATIONS AND ELECTIONS COMMITTEE (NOMELEC), RESPONDENTS.","On December 23, 1992, the Makati Stock Exchange and Manila Stock Exchange merged to what is now the PSE. Pursuant to then Batas Pambansa Bilang 178 (Batas Pambansa Blg. 178), otherwise known as the Revised Securities Act,[11] only member-brokers of PSE were allowed to trade in the securities listed therein.[12]

On August 8, 2000, Republic Act No. 8799, also known as The Securities Regulation Code, was passed into law, repealing Batas Pambansa Blg. 178. Under Section 4, the SEC was mandated to administer Republic Act No. 8799 as a collegial body, ""composed of a chairperson and four (4) Commissioners[.]""[13] At the same time, Section 33.2(c) of Republic Act No. 8799 decreed that a stock exchange must be organized as a stock corporation and registered with the SEC. Consequently, the PSE was reorganized and transformed into a stock corporation and was publicly listed.[14] Section 33.2 of Republic Act No. 8799 pertinently provides:
SECTION 33. Registration of Exchanges. –

. . . .

33.2. Registration of an Exchange shall be granted upon compliance with the following provisions:

. . . .

(c) Where the Exchange is organized as a stock corporation, that no person may beneficially own or control, directly or indirectly, more than five percent (5%) of the voting rights of the Exchange and no industry or business group may beneficially own or control, directly or indirectly, more than twenty percent (20%) of the voting rights of the Exchange: Provided, however, That the Commission may adopt rules, regulations or issue an order, upon application, exempting an applicant from this prohibition where it finds that such ownership or control will not negatively impact on the exchange's ability to effectively operate in the public interest[.] (Emphasis in the original)
On September 23, 2005, the SEC issued a letter[15] to the PSE, instructing its compliance with the requirements of Section 33.2(c). According to the SEC, brokers are considered as a business industry. More, their records confirmed that at least 35.33% of the outstanding shares of the PSE were owned by such brokers. For exceeding the statutory limit of 20%, and for violating Republic Act No. 8799, the SEC required the PSE to submit an action plan for purposes of compliance with the industry ownership limit.","Cast against a similar factual backdrop are three consolidated Petitions filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) assailing the jurisdiction of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) with respect to the acts of the SEC in the exercise of its quasi-legislative powers as well as the propriety of the writ of preliminary injunction granted by it, which allowed the Philippine Association of Securities Brokers and Dealers, Inc. (PASBDI) to vote their entire shareholdings in the 2010 and 2011 Annual Stockholders' Meeting.

In particular, the Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court in G.R. No. 198425 filed by the SEC assailed the Decision[2] and the Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA), which dismissed the SEC's Petition for Certiorari of the Order[4] allowing all the brokers shareholders to vote with their entire shareholdings in the 2010 Annual Stockholders' Meeting of the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE).

Meanwhile, the Petition for Certiorari[5] under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court in G.R. No. 201174 filed by the SEC assailed the Order,[6] which granted the Urgent Motion for Issuance of a Writ of Preliminary Injunction[7] filed by the PASBDI, Ma. Vivian Yuchengco, Ismael G. Cruz, Nestor S. Aguila, and Marita A. Limlingan (PASBDI et al.) The writ similarly allowed all the brokers to vote to the extent of their entire shareholdings in the 2011 Annual Stockholders' Meeting of the PSE.

Finally, the Petition for Review on Certiorari[8] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court in G.R. No. 244462 filed by the SEC assailed the Decision[9] of the CA, which denied its appeal of the Decision[10] rendered by the RTC. The RTC Decision permanently enjoined the SEC and the PSE from imposing any limitation or restriction on the voting rights of PASBDI and the individual shareholders.","To begin with, this Court holds that pursuant to the parties' manifestations in their respective compliances; the issues arising from the consolidated petitions are moot and academic. It must be stressed, however, that PASBDI itself insists on the resolution of the case and maintains. the validity of the assailed injunction orders.

For argument's sake, while it is recognized that this Court usually stays its hand from resolving a case that has been rendered moot and academic by reason of supervening events, it nevertheless assumes jurisdiction over a case when it is capable of repetition, yet evading review.[72]

Records of the PSE show that while the voting rights of brokers and shareholders have been compliant with the 20% ownership limit for January to September 2023, such period of compliance was all too narrow, i.e., a mere nine months for the year 2023. Here, no evidence of compliance or explanation was given for the years 2012 to 2022. There was also no submission of the succeeding NOMELEC Rules to verify if the proper interpretation of Section 33.2(c) was reflected therein. Also, with the continuous exchanges in the PSE, there is no guarantee that the shareholdings of the brokers as stated in the parties' compliance would remain as it is.

Taken together, such pieces of evidence are by no means conclusive to ensure that the erroneous interpretation and implementation of Section 33.2(c) by the PSE would never again arise. Thus, there is much significance and practical value for this Court to resolve the issues invoked in this case, if only to prevent similar questions from re-emerging. Aside from laying down the proper interpretation and implementation of Section 33.2(c), this Court lays down a definitive delineation as to the jurisdiction of the RTC on questions regarding the quasi-legislative functions vis-à-vis the quasi-­judicial functions of administrative agencies.

After a circumspect study of the consolidated petitions and its records, this Court finds them partly meritorious. The issues shall be tackled in seriatim.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari in G.R. No. 198425 is PARTLY GRANTED. The assailed Court of Appeals April 11, 2011 Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 114413, insofar as it grants the petition for a writ of preliminary injunction against the Securities and Exchange Commission, is REVERSED and SET ASIDE. However, the grant of the writ of preliminary injunction as against the Philippine Stock Exchange and the Nominations and Elections Committee is AFFIRMED.

The Petition for Certiorari in G.R. No. 201174 is GRANTED. The May 5, 2011 Order issued in SEC Case No. 10-139 granting the Urgent Motion for Issuance of a Writ of Preliminary Injunction against the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Philippine Stock Exchange, and the Nominations and Elections Committee is REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

The Petition for Review on Certiorari in G.R. No. 244462 is PARTLY GRANTED. The assailed Court of Appeals January 23, 2019 Decision in CA-G.R.

However, the grant of the writ of preliminary injunction against the Philippine Stock Exchange and the Nominations and Elections Committee with regard to Rule 2 of the 2010 Nominations and Elections Committee Rules is AFFIRMED.

The Philippine Stock Exchange and its Nominations and Elections Committee are enjoined from limiting the voting rights of brokers to 20% of their total shareholdings so long as the voting rights of brokers as an industry group, do not exceed 20% of the total outstanding capital stock of the Philippine Stock Exchange. A shareholder seeking for exemption from the 20% limitation on the voting rights of brokers, as an industry group, must file the corresponding application with the Securities and Exchange Commission."
"G.R. No. 246787, January 30, 2024","SPOUSES ENRIQUE LLONILLO AND MARITES LLONILLO, PETITIONERS, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","Spouses Llonillo were charged with the crime of Estafa under Article 318 of the Revised Penal Code (Other Deceits) before the MeTC in an Information[6] dated December 17, 2012, which reads:

On the 30th day of March 2009, in the city of Makati, [] Philippines, accused[,] conspiring and confederating together and both of them mutually helping and aiding one another, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously defraud complainant Pedro Joel V. Caspillo in the following manner; accused by means of false manifestation and fraudulent representations they made to complainant to the effect that Unit H[,] at No. 236 Aguho St., was free from any encumbrances whatsoever and that by way of interest for loan extended, complainant is entitled to collect the rental directly from the occupants of the said unit, which representation they know for a fact to be false considering that the unit is already encumbered in violation of the Deed of Mortgage they executed, and that the rental cannot be collected as the occupant has previously entered into a similar agreement with accused and there appears to be no other reason but only to convince the complainant to part with his [PHP] 300,000.00 and in fact complainant delivered the amount to the accused, to his damage and prejudice.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[7]

Upon arraignment, spouses Llonillo pleaded not guilty to the crime charged.[8]

Pre-trial was conducted and thereafter, trial on the merits ensued.[9]

The facts, according to the prosecution,[10] are as follows:

Sometime in March 2009, spouses Llonillo approached private complainant Pedro Joel Caspillo (Caspillo) through Grace Pangan (Grace), their purported agent, and offered Caspillo a sangla-tira arrangement on several units of the two buildings they own located at 236 Aguho Street, Barangay Comembo, Makati City. Spouses Llonillo explained that they were looking for persons who could lend them money for a fixed period. They would enter into a written contract with the lender, and in consideration, the lender will be entitled to the rent of the apartment unit as interest, in the amount of PHP 10,000.00 per month. The loan will be paid in full at the end of the period agreed upon.[11]

Spouses Llonillo assured Caspillo that the buildings and lots where the apartment units were built had no prior liens or encumbrances and showed him the Transfer Certificates of Title (TCT) covering the said properties.[12]

Enticed with spouses Llonillo's offer and assured that the properties were unencumbered, Caspillo lent them PHP 300,000.00 on March 30, 2009. Caspillo chose apartment unit H, which was unoccupied at that time. Simultaneously, Caspillo and spouses Llonillo executed a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), where spouses Llonillo acknowledged receipt of the money, to be paid on or before March 20, 2010. The agreement as to the interest of PHP 10,000.00 per month was not indicated in the MOA since Caspillo himself occupied the unit.[13]

After 10 days, Caspillo put up unit H for rent and leased it to a friend, who only occupied it for a month. Caspillo then decided to use the unit by putting up a mini store, but it turned out to be unprofitable. Marites offered to find a lessee for unit H and assured Caspillo about the payment of the PHP 10,000.00 monthly rental.[14]

Unit H was thereafter occupied, but Caspillo failed to collect the monthly rentals thereon. Caspillo investigated the property and discovered that spouses Llonillo and the occupants of unit H, Germalyn Josol (Josol) and Rodrigo Arevalo, Jr. (Arevalo, Jr.), also entered into a sangla-tira arrangement over the same unit. Upon verification with the Registry of Deeds of Makati City, Caspillo also discovered that the properties involved in the sangla-tira arrangement were mortgaged to different banks, contrary to spouses Llonillo's representation during the negotiation.[15]

The period agreed upon in the MOA for the payment of the PHP 300,000.00 lapsed without any payment from the spouses Llonillo. Thus, Caspillo filed a complaint against spouses Llonillo for estafa under Article 318 of the Revised Penal Code.[16]

Spouses Llonillo denied the charges against them and interposed the following narrative[17] in their defense:","Before the Court is a Petition for Review[1] (Petition) on certiorari of the Decision[2] and Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA) which affirmed the Decision[4] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC). The RTC affirmed the Decision[5] of the Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC), which found petitioners, spouses Enrique Llonillo (Enrique) and Marites Llonillo (Marites; collectively, spouses Llonillo), guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Other Deceits defined and penalized under Article 318, first paragraph of the Revised Penal Code.","The Petition is meritorious. While the MeTC had jurisdiction to hear, try, and decide the case, spouses Llonillo cannot be convicted of the crime charged.

At the outset, spouses Llonillo's arguments require the Court to examine the facts anew, which is beyond the ambit of a petition for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. The determination of guilt is a question of fact, not entertained in a petition for review under Rule 45. Time and again, jurisprudence has established that the Court is not a trier of facts. Indeed, ordinarily, a petition for review on certiorari is limited only to questions of law.[43]

Nonetheless, under exceptional circumstances, this Court admits and reviews questions of fact under Rule 45, which exceptions include: (1) when the conclusion is a finding grounded entirely on speculation, surmises or conjectures; (2) when the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible; (3) where there is a grave abuse of discretion; (4) when the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts; (5) when the findings of fact are conflicting; (6) when the CA, in making its findings, went beyond the issues of the case and the same is contrary to the admissions of both appellant and appellee; (7) the findings of the CA are contrary to those of the trial court; (8) when the findings of fact are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based; (9) when the facts set forth in the petition, as well as in the petitioner's main and reply briefs are not disputed by the respondents; and (10) the finding of fact of the CA is premised on the supposed absence of evidence and is contradicted by the evidence on record.[44] The Court finds that the fourth exception applies to the case.

The Information herein sufficiently conferred upon the MeTC the authority to hear, try, and decide the case
Spouses Llonillo rely on Quisay in arguing that the criminal case against them should have been dismissed due to the lack of written authority of the chief prosecutor and/or deputy prosecutors in the Information.

Spouses Llonillo's argument is without merit. The doctrine in Quisay was abandoned by the Court in Gomez v. People,[45] as follows:

All told, the handling prosecutor's authority, particularly as it does not appear on the face of the Information, has no connection to the trial court's power to hear and decide a case. Hence, Sec. [3(d)], Rule 117, requiring a handling prosecutor to secure a prior written authority or approval from the provincial, city or chief state prosecutor before filing an Information with the courts, may be waived by the accused through silence, acquiescence, or failure to raise such ground during arraignment or before entering a plea. If, at all, such deficiency is merely formal and can be cured at any stage of the proceedings in a criminal case.

Moreover, both the State and the accused are entitled to the constitutional guarantee of due process — especially when the most contentious of issues involve jurisdictional matters. A denial of such guarantee against any of the parties of the case amounts to grave abuse of discretion. Consequently, a judgment of acquittal or order of dismissal amounting to an acquittal which is tainted with grave abuse of discretion becomes void and cannot amount to a first jeopardy.

Henceforth, all previous doctrines laid down by this Court, holding that the lack of signature and approval of the provincial, city or chief state prosecutor on the face of the Information shall divest the court of jurisdiction over the person of the accused and the subject matter in a criminal action, are hereby abandoned. It is sufficient for the validity of the Information or Complaint, as the case may be, that the Resolution of the investigating prosecutor recommending for the filing of the same in court bears the imprimatur of the provincial, city or chief state prosecutor whose approval is required by Sec. 1 of R.A. No. 5180 and is adopted under Sec. 4, Rule 112 of the Rules of Court.[46]

Accordingly, the MeTC had jurisdiction to hear, try, and decide the instant case.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is GRANTED. The July 30, 2018 Decision and the April 15, 2019 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR. No. 38855 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

Otherwise, the decision is incomplete and cannot be the subject of execution.","It is rather unfortunate that the present case reached this stage when the controversy could have been averted if only the courts a quo had properly applied Rules 68, Sections 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court. On account of this inadvertence, the Petition is partially impressed with merit.

A judgment on judicial foreclosure should render judgment for the sum due and order the same to be paid within a period of 90-120 days from entry of judgment
Rule 68, Section 2 of the Rules of Court provides for the manner of resolving an action for foreclosure and enumerates the contents of the judgment thereon. Section 2 reads as follows:

Section 2. Judgment on foreclosure for payment or sale. — If upon the trial in such action the court shall find the facts set forth in the complaint to be true, it shall ascertain the amount due to the plaintiff upon the mortgage debt or obligation, including interest and other charges as approved by the court, and costs, and shall render judgment for the sum so found due and order that the same be paid to the court or to the judgment obligee within a period of not less than ninety (90) days nor more than one hundred twenty (120) days from the entry of judgment, and that in default of such payment the property shall be sold at public auction to satisfy the judgment. (Emphasis supplied)

Section 2 expressly mandates the trial court (1) to render judgment on the amount due and thereafter (2) order the judgment debtor to pay the sum within 90 days, but no longer than 120 days from entry of judgment. It is only when the judgment debtor defaults from paying the amount that the trial court shall order the property sold at public auction following the guidelines under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court.

A plain reading of the fallo of the February 17, 2011 Decision shows that the RTC, Branch 153 merely declared the disputed property as foreclosed, and ordered spouses Tiglao to pay for attorney's fees in the amount of PHP 60,000.00. Evident therefrom that it failed to strictly adhere to the requirements laid down in Section 2 by indicating the amount as well as the period to pay the same. It bears emphasis that there was nothing erroneous with the decision, only that it was incomplete in view of the requirements laid down by Rule 68, Section 2 of the Rules of Court.

Interestingly, the RTC, Branch 153 had been sufficiently apprised of such omission when spouses Tiglao ironically moved for the execution of the February 17, 2011 Decision. Spouses Tiglao pointed out that the said Decision was silent as to how it can be executed pursuant to Rule 68, Section 2. Despite this information, the RTC, Branch 153 merely granted the Motion mainly because of spouses Tiglao's averments and spouses Lontoc's manifestation that they had no objection against the Motion. It was at this point that the RTC, Branch 153 committed the error of granting the Motion instead of merely amending its February 17, 2011 Decision.

The ruling in Rodriguez v. Caoibes,[49] which the Court reiterated in Philippine Trust Company v. Policarpio,[50] finds relevance in the case at bar. Rodriguez dealt with the incomplete disposition of the trial court in a foreclosure proceeding when it failed to indicate the period within which the judgment obligee should pay. In resolving the matter, the Court said that the trial court may still amend the incomplete decision despite having attained finality, in order to conform with the rules. The Court also clarified that instead of appealing the incomplete decision, the parties should have merely invited the attention of the court to the flaw in its judgment:

The case at hand is for the foreclosure of a mortgage. It was tried as such in the Court of First Instance of Batangas as well as in this court on appeal. In reversing the appealed decision, by an involuntary omission it was not ordered to deposit the amount of the judgment with the clerk of the court of origin, within a period of not less than three months, and, in default thereof, to sell the mortgaged properties to pay the mortgage indebtedness and the costs. This involuntary omission of an imperative mandate of section 256 of the Code of Civil Procedure, . . . cannot alter the nature of the action, and the amendment of the decision may be asked to correct the defect, inasmuch as said provision is a necessary part hereof.

On this point the American jurisprudence has laid down the following doctrine:","ACCORDINGLY, the Court GRANTS IN PART the Petition for Review on Certiorari; REVERSES and SETS ASIDE the September 10, 2014 Decision and the April 6, 2015 Resolution rendered by the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 125188; and AMENDS the February 17, 2011 Decision of Branch 153, Regional Trial Court of Pasig City in SCA Case No. 3340-TG, to read as follows:

"G.R. No. 246489, January 29, 2024","SPOUSES CHRISTOPHER AND CARMEN NUÑEZ, PETITIONERS, VS. DR. HENRY DAZ, RESPONDENT.","On June 27, 2006, 2-year old John Ray Nuñez (John Ray) underwent a craniectomy[6] to remove a cancerous tumor from his brain.[7] During the surgery, John Ray experienced hypothermia that necessitated his resuscitation. Petitioners alleged that Dr. Daz, the anesthesiologist, applied a hot water bag on John Ray's legs to address his decreased temperature.[8] However, the water bag burst, and the hot water spilled on John Ray ""causing him to suffer third-degree (sic) burns on his right thigh, supra-pubic area and hands.""[9]

After the surgery, Dr. Jesus Nigos (Dr. Nigos), one of the neurosurgeons, informed Christopher that the removal of his son's tumor was close to a success, were it not for the bursting of the hot water bag, which lead to the scalding of parts of John Ray's body.[10] Due to the burns, his right fifth digit and left thumb were amputated.[11] He also underwent skin grafting surgery for his third degree burns. These delayed the chemotherapy which was supposed to be conducted within 15 to 30 days after the surgery to remove whatever is left of the tumor.[12]

During the time when the burns were being treated, it was discovered that the brain tumor recurred. Hence, On October 3, 2006, John Ray underwent another operation. During the surgery, however, John Ray succumbed to death.[13]

His death certificate reads:

I.
Immediate cause:
a.
Cardiorespiratory Arrest

Antecedent [c]ause:
b.
Brain Herniation

Underlying cause:
c.
Intracranial teratoma S/P Craniectomy, Excision of Tumor




II.	Other significant conditions	 	 
 	Contributing to death:	 	Pneumonia



Tumor blood[14]
The petitioners filed before the Office of the City Prosecutor-Baguio City a case for Reckless Imprudence Resulting in Homicide, docketed as I.S. No. 07-1117, against Dr. Nigos, Dr. Joey Lucas, and the assisting nurses, which was, however, dismissed. Elsewhere in said charge, it was stated that Dr. Daz was the child's anesthesiologist. It was further narrated that the scaled burns were allegedly sustained by John Ray when the hot water bag used to resuscitate John Ray from hypothermia, allegedly under the administration of Dr. Daz, may have allegedly ruptured.[15]

Thus, an Information[16] for Reckless Imprudence Resulting in Homicide was filed on January 29, 2008, where Dr. Daz stood charged and was tried.","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court filed by spouses Christopher (Christopher) and Carmen Nuñez (collectively, the petitioners), assailing the Court of Appeals (CA) Decision,[2] dated July 13, 2018, and the Resolution,[3] dated March 19, 2019, in CA-G.R. CV No. 104749. The assailed Decision affirmed with modification the Decision,[4] dated September 17, 2014, and the Order,[5] dated October 27, 2014, of Branch 3, Regional Trial Court, Baguio City (RTC) in Criminal Case No. 27961-R, finding Dr. Henry Daz (Dr. Daz) not guilty of Reckless Imprudence Resulting in Homicide.","The Court denies the Petition for failing to show that the CA committed a reversible error.

Scope of a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45
It is settled that the Court is not a trier of facts. In a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, the function of the Court is limited to reviewing the errors of law which lower courts may have committed.[27] Where the issues are factual in nature, its determination should be left to the trial courts.[28] The factual findings of the trial court, especially when affirmed by the CA, are generally binding and conclusive on this Court.[29]

Here, the petitioners argue that this case is covered by the following exceptions to the general rule that this Court is not a trier of facts: (1) when the CA's findings are contrary to that of the trial court; and (2) when the CA manifestly overlooked certain relevant facts not disputed by the parties, which if properly considered, would justify a different conclusion.[30]

Dr. Daz, in his Comment,[31] counters that aside from the award of damages, both the RTC and the CA are unanimous in acquitting Dr. Daz.[32]

The petitioners' argument is erroneous.

As to the first exception, the CA did not disagree with the findings of fact by the RTC. What the CA disagreed with is the award of damages in favor of the petitioners. As to the second exception, all relevant facts were sufficiently passed upon by the CA.

For these reasons alone, the Petition for Review on Certiorari should be denied.

The rules on appeals from a judgment of acquittal
When an accused has been acquitted, or the case against her or him is dismissed by a court of competent jurisdiction, upon a valid complaint or information, and after the accused had pleaded to the charge, the acquittal of the accused or the dismissal of the case shall be a bar to another prosecution for the offense charged.[33] This principle is also known as double jeopardy. The existence of double jeopardy calls for the application of the ""finality-of-acquittal"" rule, which makes a judgment of acquittal unappealable and immediately executory upon its promulgation.[34]

Here, while the petitioners are questioning the deletion of the award of damages, they were essentially questioning the criminal aspect of the case, and corollarily Dr. Daz' acquittal. Although a Rule 65 petition for certiorari is allowed to question such a dismissal if committed with grave abuse of discretion, such action may only be filed by the Office of the Solicitor General on behalf of the People of the Philippines.[35]

The private complainant is only allowed to initiate the same if the question raised pertains solely to the civil aspect.[36]

Here, clearly, the petitioners were challenging the acquittal of Dr. Daz in their action before the CA. The Court agrees with Dr. Daz that a reading of the present Petition is actually an appeal of the judgment of acquittal since the Petition essentially prays for the Court to revisit the facts established by the RTC.[37] This is not allowed.

Dr. Daz was not found to be the author of the act or omission complained of
The Court has consistently held that there are two kinds of acquittal: (1) that the accused is not the author of the act or omission complained of; and (2) that the prosecutor failed to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. Although they have the same effect on the acquittal of the accused, their effects differ as to the accused' civil liability. The Court held in Manantan v. Court of Appeals:[38]

Our law recognizes two kinds of acquittal, with different effects on the civil liability of the accused. First is an acquittal on the ground that the accused is not the author of the act or omission complained of. This instance closes the door to civil liability, for a person who has been found to be not the perpetrator of any act or omission cannot and can never be held liable for such act or omission. There being no delict, civil liability ex delicto is out of the question, and the civil action, if any, which may be instituted must be based on grounds other than the delict complained of. This is the situation contemplated in Rule 111 of the Rules of Court. The second instance is an acquittal based on reasonable doubt on the guilt of the accused. In this case, even if the guilt of the accused has not been satisfactorily established, he is not exempt from civil liability which may be proved by preponderance of evidence only[.][39] (Citations omitted)

Moreover, in Daluraya v. Oliva[40] citing Dayap v. Sendiong:[41]

The acquittal of the accused does not automatically preclude a judgment against him on the civil aspect of the case. The extinction of the penal action does not carry with it the extinction of the civil liability where: (a) the acquittal is based on reasonable doubt as only preponderance of evidence is required; (b) the court declares that the liability of the accused is only civil; and (c) the civil liability of the accused does not arise from or is not based upon the crime of which the accused is acquitted. However, the civil action based on delict may be deemed extinguished if there is a finding on the final judgment in the criminal action that the act or omission from which the civil liability may arise did not exist or where the accused did not commit the acts or omission imputed to him.[42]

The present case falls under the first kind of acquittal, i.e., the accused is not the author of the act or omission complained of. In its Decision, the RTC clearly and categorically found that ""Dr. Daz could not be blamed on the mere fact that the hot water bag gave way or may have been ruptured."" Worse, the prosecution miserably failed to offer any evidence that a hot water bag broke:","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari filed by petitioners spouses Christopher and Carmen Nuñez is DENIED.

Adriatico, with the effect of restricting her movement or conduct, to her damage and prejudice.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[9]
Upon arraignment, petitioner pleaded ""Not Guilty"" to the charges.[10]

Trial on the merits ensued.[11]","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court filed by Rommel Z. Borja (petitioner) which assails the Decision[2] dated October 13, 2020, and the Resolution[3] dated November 22, 2021 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR No. 41059. The CA affirmed the Judgment[4] dated January 5, 2018, of Branch 93, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Balanga City, Bataan in Criminal Case No. 16965 that found petitioner guilty of violation of Section 5 (a) of Republic Act No. 9262 otherwise known as the ""Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act of 2004,""[5] committed against his live-in partner and herein private complainant Aileen Joy G. Adriatico (Aileen).[6]

Meanwhile, in Criminal Case No. 16966, the RTC acquitted petitioner of violating Section 5(e)(4)[7] of the same law for failure of the prosecution to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.","The Court denies the petition.

The Court finds no reason to deviate from the factual findings of the RTC and the CA. The RTC's findings, when adopted and confirmed by the CA, are binding and conclusive on the Court. In the case, the issue on which the petition is hinged is purely factual and not appropriate in a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45.[34]

In any case, Aileen's testimony was categorical and unequivocal. She narrated that on August 3, 2016, at about 1:30 a.m., she asked petitioner to face her as they were about to go to sleep. However, petitioner got furious; he took a gun from the cabinet at the right side of the bed and tucked it on his waist. He then went near Aileen, pulled her shirt, and squeezed her collar. At that point, he held Aileen's hands and punched her leg as he berated her and shouted: ""putang ina mo!""[35] The RTC's determination of the credibility of the witness is seldom disturbed on appeal unless significant matters were overlooked. Absent any indication that the RTC committed any error in the evaluation of the evidence, the Court sees no reason to deviate from the following factual findings:[36]
In Criminal Case No. 16965, the prosecution was able to establish that the accused caused physical harm upon Aileen on August 03, 2016 at around 1:30 in the morning. At that particular time, Aileen and the accused were inside the room of the accused in the latter's house located at Brgy. Lati, Orion, Bataan. They just arrived from Manila and they were about to sleep when the accused got angry when Aileen wanted him to face her. The accused suddenly got furious[,] took a gun from the cabinet and tucked the same in his waist. The accused held her hands and then punched her leg. On August 4, 2016, Aileen reported the incident to the police. At 3:56 in the afternoon on August 4, 2016, Aileen went to Bataan General Hospital where she was treated and was diagnosed to have suffered hematoma in her right and hematoma in the lateral side of her left leg which injuries required medical attention or incapacitated her for three to nine days. The accused's bare denial cannot prevail over the positive testimony of the accused.[37]

" G.R. No. 266754, January 29, 2024","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. MARIVIC SALDIVAR Y REGATCHO, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","The case stemmed from an Information[4] filed against Saldivar, the accusatory portion of which reads:
On or about and sometime during period from March 2016 through May 2017, in the xxxxxxxxxxx,* the [sic] Philippines, accused taking advantage of the vulnerability of complainant [AAA266754], a street child, 14 years of age, a minor, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously take custody of and shelter in, harbor and recruit said minor for the purpose of prostitution and sexual exploitation, by acting as procurer for different customers, for money, profit or any other consideration, in violation of the above-cited law.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[5]
Upon arraignment, Saldivar pleaded not guilty to the charge. Pre-trial followed, and trial on the merits subsequently ensued.[6]

The prosecution narrated that AAA266754, a 14-year-old minor, became a vagrant after running away from home. She and her friends ended up staying in xxxxxxxxxxx where they solicited money from passengers. Later, AAA266754 was introduced by her friend, Fordelyn Ayala (Ayala), to Saldivar whom AAA266754 started to live with. However, Saldivar would often pimp AAA266754 to the men who also bought drugs from her. AAA266754 even saw Saldivar receive money from these men before she was sexually abused. The abuses continued for a year until AAA266754 was rescued by the Emergency Welfare Section of the xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.[7]

During the investigation, Social Welfare Officer I Genesis M. Panganiban (SWO1 Panganiban) interviewed Saldivar[8] who claimed that it was AAA266754's own decision to subject herself to prostitution.[9] It was even AAA266754 who handed her money earned from sex work when she arrived home from these.[10] Saldivar nonetheless admitted that there were times that she would point men to AAA266754 if they asked her where they could find girls to have sex with. However, Saldivar insisted that it was still AAA266754's decision to accept or decline the offer.[11]

Upon examination, Dr. Voltaire P. Nulud (Dr. Nulud) issued an Initial Medico-Legal Report,[12] which found that AAA266754 sustained deep healed lacerations in the hymen. The report also indicated that there was clear evidence of blunt penetrating trauma to the hymen.[13]

On the part of the defense, Saldivar denied the allegations.[14] She claimed that AAA266754 voluntarily engaged in prostitution, and that when Saldivar's male friends would come to her looking for women they could pay for sexual acts, AAA266754 volunteered herself.[15] Saldivar also alleged that AAA266754 was angry at her for asking her to leave, as Saldivar and her family would often be affected when the police officers ask AAA266754 and her friends, who were allegedly rugby sniffers, to evacuate the area there Saldivar and her family lived.[16] Finally, Saldivar narrated that officers of the MSWD had a motive for fabricating a case against her. She pointed to Maria Luisa Mangili, the social welfare officer who assisted AAA266754 in filing her complaint, as the same person who previously filed a complaint for human trafficking against her before the Office of the City Prosecutor of xxxxxxxxxxx.[17] Saldivar also recalled another incident when SWO1 Panganiban told her that she was so hardheaded in going back to the streets that she needed to be taught a lesson.[18]

In its Decision,[19] the RTC found Saldivar guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 6(a) of Republic Act No. 9208, as amended by Republic Act No. 10364, the dispositive portion of which reads:
WHEREFORE, the Court renders judgment finding accused Marivic [Saldivar y Regatcho] GUILTY of the crime of violation of Section 6 paragraph (a) of Republic Act No. 9208, as amended.

The crime of qualified trafficking in persons is defined by Section 4(a) and Section 6 of Republic Act No. 9208, as amended by Republic Act No. 11862, as follows:
SECTION. 4. Acts of Trafficking in Persons. – It shall be unlawful for any person, natural or juridical, to commit any of the following acts:

(a) To recruit, obtain, hire, provide, offer, transport, transfer, maintain, harbor, or receive a person by any means, including those done under the pretext of domestic or overseas employment or training or apprenticeship, for the purpose of prostitution, pornography, sexual abuse or exploitation, production, creation, or distribution of CSAEM or CSAM, forced labor, slavery, involuntary servitude, or debt bondage;

. . . .

SECTION. 6. Qualified Trafficking in Persons. – Violations of Section 4 of this Act shall be considered as qualified trafficking:

(a) When the trafficked person is a child: Provided, That acts of online sexual abuse and exploitation of children shall be without prejudice to appropriate investigation and prosecution under other related laws[.] (Emphasis supplied)
In People v. Casio,[35] this Court enumerated the elements of trafficking in persons as follows:
The elements of trafficking in persons can be derived from its definition under Section 3(a) of Republic Act No. 9208, thus: 
 
(1)
The act of ""recruitment, transportation, transfer or harbouring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders[;]""


(2)
The means used which include ""threat or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the person, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another; [sic] and


(3)
The purpose of trafficking is exploitation which includes ""exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs.""[36] (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)
All the elements of qualified trafficking in persons are present in this case, as proven by the testimony of AAA266754, who clearly narrated how accused-appellant recruited her, taking advantage of her minority and financial need as a vagrant child, for the purpose of prostitution. AAA266754 categorically testified that accused-appellant gave her to male customers, thus:","ACCORDINGLY, the Appeal is DISMISSED. The July 16, 2021 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

That in May 2004 or sometime prior or subsequent thereto, in the Municipality of Barugo, Leyte and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, accused public officers, Juliana Acuin Villasin, Aluino Otibar Ala and Reynaldo Agner Bodo, being the Municipal Mayor, Municipal Accountant, and Municipal Agriculturist, respectively, of the Municipality of Barugo Leyte, while in the performance of their official functions and committing the offense in relation to office, taking advantage of their official position, acting with manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence, conspiring and confederating with one another, did then and there willfully, unlawfully, and criminally gave Bals Enterprises unwarranted benefits, privilege and advantage by causing and/or approving the procurement of 3,900 liters of Fil-Ocean liquid fertilizer from Bals Enterprises without the participation of Municipality's Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) and without public bidding, in violation of the provisions of [Republic Act No.] 9184 (The Government Procurement Act); making reference to the brand name Fil-Ocean liquid fertilizer in the invitation to bid, purchase request, and purchase order, in violation of Section 18 of [Republic Act No.] 9184; and causing the payment of [PHP ]500.00 per liter of Fil-Ocean liquid fertilizer or the total amount of [PHP ]1,950,000.00 or [PHP ]1,879,090.92 net of tax, and causing undue injury to the local government of Barugo, Leyte in the total amount of [PHP ]1,879,090.92 more or less.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[8]
On November 28, 2016, Villasin, Ala, and Bodo were arraigned and pleaded ""not guilty:""[9]","Before the Court is an ordinary appeal[1] by the accused-appellant, Juliana Acuin Villasin (Villasin), from the Decision[2] dated January 29, 2021 rendered by the Sandiganbayan Second Division (Sandiganbayan) in Crim.

The assailed Decision found Villasin guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Section 3(e) of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act or Republic Act No. 3019, as amended.","The appeal is meritorious.

In the En Banc case of Martel v. People[41] (Martel), it was categorically held that a violation of procurement laws does not ipso facto give rise to a violation of Republic Act No. 3019.[42] Martel likewise emphasized that any finding of a violation of Republic Act No. 3019 must be grounded on graft and corruption, or the acquisition of gain in dishonest ways.[43]

To convict an accused under Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019, the prosecution must sufficiently establish the following elements: (1) that the accused must be a public officer discharging administrative, judicial, or official functions; (2) that the accused must have acted with manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence; and (3) that the action of the accused caused undue injury to any party, including the government, or gave any private party unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of the functions of the accused.[44]

While Villasin, being Mayor of the Municipality at the time the alleged offense occurred, fulfills the first element, the second and third elements are wholly absent.","ACCORDINGLY, the appeal is GRANTED.

CONTRARY TO LAW.""[11]

Margaret pleaded not guilty in Criminal Case No. O-670. During her arraignment, Margaret's counsel de parte manifested that Cipriano already died and presented the certified true copy of his death certificate. The People, through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), confirmed Cipriano's name on the death certificate and interposed no objection to dismissing the case against him. As such, the case against Cipriano was ordered dismissed. Thereafter, Criminal Case No. O-671 was consolidated with Criminal Case No. O-670.[12]

Upon her arraignment in Criminal Case No. O-671, Margaret likewise pleaded not guilty. Meanwhile, the second case against Cipriano was also dismissed due to his death.[13] Trial then ensued.

After the presentation of all the prosecution's evidence, the accused filed a Demurrer to Evidence.[14] They claimed that first, the prosecution failed to prove that Margaret is a responsible officer of E & D; second, the tax assessments were void for being issued without a valid Letter of Authority (LOA); third, the prosecution failed to prove that E & D duly authorized the person who received the assessment notices; and lastly, the prosecution did not prove willful failure to pay the assessed deficiency taxes.[15]

The prosecution failed to file its comment on the Motion.[16]

On September 5, 2019, the CTA Division issued a Resolution[17] granting the accused's Demurrer to Evidence. The CTA ruled that the penal liability for violating Section 255 of the Tax Code devolved on the responsible officers of the corporation. In this case, the documentary evidence presented by the prosecution did not show that Margaret was one of E & D's responsible officers. Without any proof of Margaret’s role or position in E & D, she cannot be held criminally liable for the alleged acts of the corporation.[18] Accordingly, Criminal Case Nos. O-670 and O-671 were dismissed on the ground of insufficiency of evidence, thus:

In view of the foregoing, the Motion for Leave of Court to file Demurrer to Evidence and to Admit Attached Demurrer to Evidence filed on July 1, 2019 is hereby GRANTED.","The acquittal of the taxpayer-accused in the criminal case for tax laws violation will not necessarily result in the obliteration of the civil liability for deficiency taxes relative to the criminal case since the duty to pay the tax is imposed by law prior to and independently of any attempts of the taxpayer to evade payments.[1]
Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[2] assailing the Decision[3] dated July 5, 2021 and the Resolution[4] dated February 22, 2022 of the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) in CTA EB Crim. Case No. 075. The CTA En Banc affirmed the CTA Division[5] in ruling that E & D Parts Supply, Inc. (E & D) could not be civilly liable for deficiency taxes under Section 255[6] of the Tax Code because of its acquittal in the criminal action.","The petition lacks merit. The CTA properly dismissed the criminal cases against Margaret and E & D and aptly found that E & D is not liable to pay the assessed deficiency taxes. However, the Court clarifies that the exoneration of E & D from the liability to pay taxes is not due to its acquittal in the criminal cases.

Margaret's acquittal in the criminal case was proper.
To secure a conviction under Section 255 in relation to Sections 253(d) and 256 of the Tax Code, the following elements must be established: (1) the corporate taxpayer is required by law to pay the tax; (2) the corporate taxpayer failed to pay the tax at the time or times required by law or rules and regulations; and (3) the accused, as the employee responsible for the violation, willfully failed to pay such tax at the time or times required by law or rules and regulations.[32]

In Suarez v. People,[33] the Court explained the criminal liability of corporate officers for acts committed by the corporation:

A corporation is an artificial being created by fiction of law. By the corporation's nature as an abstract being, it cannot be arrested and imprisoned; hence, it cannot be penalized for a crime punishable by imprisonment. As early as 1930 in the case of People v. Tan Boon Kong, the Court already held that for crimes committed by a corporation, the responsible officers thereof would personally bear the criminal liability. This is because a corporation can act only through its officers and agents.

In Ching v. Secretary of Justice (Ching), the Court upheld the finding of probable cause and the filing of Informations for violation of Presidential Decree No. 115 or the Trust Receipts Law against petitioner Ching as the one who signed the trust receipts, on behalf of the corporation.

In Ching, the Court had the occasion to discuss the liability of corporate officers for acts committed by the corporation as follows:

A crime is the doing of that which the penal code forbids to be done, or omitting to do what it commands. A necessary part of the definition of every crime is the designation of the author of the crime upon whom the penalty is to be inflicted. When a criminal statute designates an act of a corporation or a crime and prescribes punishment therefor, it creates a criminal offense which, otherwise, would not exist and such can be committed only by the corporation. But when a penal statute does not expressly apply to corporations, it does not create an offense for which a corporation may be punished. On the other hand, if the State, by statute, defines a crime that may be committed by a corporation but prescribes the penalty therefor to be suffered by the officers, directors, or employees of such corporation or other persons responsible for the offense, only such individuals will suffer such penalty. Corporate officers or employees, through whose act, default or omission the corporation commits a crime, are themselves individually guilty of the crime.

The principle applies whether or not the crime requires the consciousness of wrongdoing. It applies to those corporate agents who themselves commit the crime and to those, who, by virtue of their managerial positions or other similar relation to the corporation, could be deemed responsible for its commission, if by virtue of their relationship to the corporation, they had the power to prevent the act. Moreover, all parties active in promoting a crime, whether agents or not, are principals. Whether such officers or employees are benefited by their delictual acts is not a touchstone of their criminal liability. Benefit is not an operative fact.

In ABS-CBN v. Gozon. . . the Court discussed that although corporate officers may be held liable for a crime committed under the Intellectual Property Code, their criminal liability stems from their active participation in the commission of the wrongful act. Hence, in ABS-CBN, the Court affirmed the finding of probable cause against two of GMA's executives for copyright infringement of ABS-CBN's news footage because of their positions as Head of News Operations and Program Manager. However, the Court excluded from the filing of Information other GMA corporate officers because:

Mere membership of the Board or being President per se does not mean knowledge, approval, and participation in the act alleged as criminal. There must be a showing of active participation, not simply a constructive one.

This same doctrine was reiterated in SEC v. Price Richardson Corporation where the Court stated that to be criminally liable for the acts of a corporation, there must be a showing that its officers, directors, and shareholders actively participated in or had the power to prevent the wrongful act.[34] (Citations omitted)

Here, the prosecution did not only fail to prove Margaret's active participation in the non-payment of E & D's alleged deficiency income tax and VAT for taxable year 2006. It also failed to prove Margaret's role in the corporation when the crime was supposedly committed. The CTA found that the prosecution did not present proof to identify any of the officers of E & D.[35] Absent any evidence that Margaret had any direct and active participation in the alleged criminal violation, the CTA correctly acquitted her of the crimes charged.

Likewise, the CTA aptly held that Margaret was not civilly liable for the deficiency taxes assessed by the BIR. It must be remembered that while it was Margaret who was indicted for criminal violation of the Tax Code as the alleged responsible officer of the corporation, the deficiency taxes pertained to the corporation E & D. Taxes are personal to the taxpayer. In the case of corporations, liability for deficiency taxes cannot generally be imposed on the corporate officers or its stockholders for this will violate the principle that a corporation has a personality separate and distinct from the persons constituting it.[36] Here, the prosecution failed to prove the existence of an exception to the general rule.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DENIED.

"G.R. No. 261666, January 24, 2024","ROMMEL GENIO Y SANTOS, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT","In the Information[7] dated June 21, 2016 filed with the RTC and docketed as Criminal Case No. 4355-G, Rommel was charged with the crime of Bigamy under Article 349 of the RPC, as follows:
That sometime on September 7, 2013 in Guimba, Nueva Ecija, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused, being legally married to MAGDALENA ESLER GENIO on May 20, 2006 at Canatuan [sic] City and without having said marriage legally dissolved pursuant to law, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously contract a second or subsequent marriage to one Maricar Santos Galapon, to the damage and prejudice of said Magdalena Esler Genio.

Contrary to law.[8]
Upon arraignment, Rommel entered a plea of ""Not Guilty.""[9]

Pre-Trial was thereafter conducted, where the defense stipulated on the existence and authenticity of the Marriage Certificate[10] between Rommel and Maricar Santos Galapon (Maricar).[11]

Trial on the merits followed.[12]

The prosecution presented the private complainant, Magdalena Esler Genio (Magdalena), as its witness.[13] Magdalena averred that she and Rommel were married on May 20, 2006, before the Mayor of Cabanatuan City, Nueva Ecija, and that they had three children, two of whom are alive.[14] She narrated that she had been living separately from Rommel since 2013 because he had been with another woman.[15] However, their marriage was still subsisting and was never dissolved.[16]

Later, Magdalena heard of rumors that Rommel contracted a second marriage with another woman.[17] She sought to verify this information by accessing Facebook, where she saw several photos of Rommel appearing to be a groom in a wedding with another woman, who turned out to be Maricar.[18] Through her cousin, Magdalena subsequently discovered that Rommel was residing at a house located in Guimba, Nueva Ecija.[19] When Magdalena visited the place, she saw Rommel sleeping inside the house with Maricar, who appeared to be pregnant.[20]

In addition, Magdalena secured from the Civil Registry of Cabanatuan City a copy of the Birth Certificate of the child of Rommel and Maricar.[21] She also obtained from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) a certified true copy of the Marriage Certificate[22] between Rommel and Maricar.[23] In the Marriage Certificate bearing the signatures of Rommel and Maricar, it was stated that the two were married on September 7, 2013, before the Mayor of Guimba, Nueva Ecija, at his office and in the presence of three witnesses.[24]

Magdalena then communicated with Rommel and asked him if he contracted a second marriage with Maricar, but Rommel denied it.[25] On cross-examination, Magdalena admitted that she was not present during the celebration of the marriage between Rommel and Maricar.[26]

No other witness was presented by the prosecution.[27] Upon termination of Magdalena's testimony, the prosecution proceeded with its Formal Offer of Evidence, wherein it offered in evidence the following: (1) the Complaint-Affidavit[28] of Magdalena; (2) the Marriage Certificate[29] between Magdalena and Rommel, as proof of the first marriage; (3) the Birth Certificates of the children of Magdalena and Rommel, also to prove the first marriage;[30] (4) a copy of the Birth Certificate of the child of Rommel and Maricar, to prove the second marriage;[31] and (5) the certified true copy of the Marriage Certificate[32] between Maricar and Rommel issued by the PSA, to prove the second marriage and the solemnities observed therefor,[33] all of which were admitted in evidence by the RTC.[34]",The constitutional right of the accused to be presumed innocent is not an empty platitude so quickly abrogated by a legal presumption seeking to establish guilt. An evidentiary presumption may be utilized by the State and appreciated by the courts as long as it does not result in the abatement of the prosecution's burden of proving guilt and each element of the crime charged with evidence beyond reasonable doubt.,"The Court grants the Petition in part and modifies the CA Decision and Resolution in that Rommel is not found guilty of Bigamy on the ground of reasonable doubt.

However, the Court finds that Rommel is guilty of violating Article 350[74] of the RPC for knowingly contracting a marriage with Maricar against the provisions of laws.

The accused in a criminal case for Bigamy
may raise the defense that the second
marriage is void ab initio.

At the outset, the Court reiterates its ruling in Pulido v. People,[75] that the ""accused in bigamy may validly raise [the defense of] a void ab initio second or subsequent marriage even without a judicial declaration of nullity.""[76] Certainly, if the second marriage was void ab initio on grounds other than being bigamous, then it is inexistent from the beginning; thus, the element of entering into a second or subsequent marriage would be lacking, warranting the acquittal of the accused for the felony of Bigamy.[77]

The essential and formal requisites of a valid marriage are enumerated in Articles 2[78] and 3 of the Family Code, respectively. Among the formal requisites of marriage are the authority of the solemnizing officer and a marriage ceremony, ""which takes place with the appearance of the contracting parties before the solemnizing officer and their personal declaration that they take each other as husband and wife in the presence of not less than two witnesses of legal age.""

In connection with the above, Article 4 of the Family Code provides that ""[t]he absence of any of the essential or formal requisites shall render the marriage void ab initio, except as stated in Article 35(2).""[79] Relevantly, in Morigo v. People,[80] the Court acquitted the accused therein of the crime of Bigamy because his purported first marriage did not, in fact, exist, given that it was not celebrated in a marriage ceremony before a duly authorized solemnizing officer, and therein accused and his supposed first wife merely signed a marriage contract by themselves, without any solemnizing officer present.[81]

Thus, in support of his acquittal for Bigamy, Rommel validly raised the defense that his second marriage to Maricar is void ab initio due to the absence of formal requisites required for its validity-the authority of the solemnizing officer and a marriage ceremony.

The prosecution may use evidentiary
presumptions to prove any element of the
crime charged.

The proceedings a quo readily reveal that the issues in the present case are founded on the prosecution's use of an evidentiary presumption against Rommel, i.e., that the Marriage Certificate, being a public record, is prima facie evidence of its contents, and may therefore serve as proof that the second marriage has all the essential requisites for its validity. Both the RTC and the CA relied on the Marriage Certificate in holding that the prosecution was able to prove, beyond reasonable doubt, that Rommel committed Bigamy.

The Court disagrees with the RTC and the CA. The prosecution's evidence is insufficient to warrant Rommel's conviction for Bigamy.","WHEREFORE, the Petition is GRANTED IN PART. The Decision dated July 16, 2021, and the Resolution dated June 7, 2022, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

"G.R. No. 253003, January 24, 2024","COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, PETITIONER, VS. MINDANAO II GEOTHERMAL PARTNERSHIP, RESPONDENT.","was engaged in the generation, collection, and distribution of electricity and registered with the BIR Regional District Office (RDO) of Kidapawan City, with Tax Identification No. 004-766-953.[6]

On March 11, 1997, M2GP entered into a Build-Operate-Transfer contract with the Philippine National Oil Company-Energy Development Corporation (PNOC-EDC) for the financing, engineering, supply, installation, testing, commissioning, operation, and maintenance of a 48.25-megawatt geothermal power plant. PNOC-EDC would supply and deliver steam to M2GP at no cost. In turn, M2GP would convert the steam into electric capacity and energy for the PNOC-EDC and deliver the same to the National Power Corporation (NPC) for and on behalf of the PNOC-EDC.[7]

Ensuingly, M2GP filed its respective quarterly VAT returns with the BIR on April 24, 2008, July 25, 2008, October 24, 2008, and January 26, 2009, for taxable year 2008.[8] On December 28, 2009, it lodged an administrative claim for refund or issuance of tax credit certificate of its unapplied and unutilized input taxes for taxable year 2008 in the amount of PHP 6,149,256.25 before the BIR RDO No. 108 of Kidapawan City. With this, the CIR issued a Letter of Authority for the examination of M2GP's books of account and other accounting records for VAT covering the period January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008.[9]

M2GP was dissolved on March 29, 2010.[10]

On April 15, 2010, M2GP filed a petition for review with the CTA, docketed as CTA Case No. 8082, appealing its administrative claim as regards the excess and unutilized creditable input tax covering the 1st quarter of taxable year 2008. It then filed another petition for review with the CTA on 27 May 2010, docketed as CTA Case No. 8106, entreating its administrative claim in relation to the excess and unutilized creditable input tax covering the 2nd, 3rd and 4th quarters of taxable year 2008. The CTA Second Division consolidated these two cases.[11]

The CTA Second Division, in its Resolution dated January 20, 2011, initially dismissed CTA Case No. 8082 for being filed prematurely. Thenceforth, M2GP moved for reconsideration but the CTA Second Division gave it short shrift in its March 15, 2011 Resolution.[12]

Nonplussed, M2GP elevated the matter to the CTA En Banc, which affirmed the ruling of the CTA Second Division through its Decision dated July 5, 2012. Again, M2GP sought reconsideration but was likewise rebuffed in the CTA En Banc's Resolution dated 29 November 2012.[13]

Disgruntled, M2GP filed a Petition for Review before the Court, docketed as G.R. No. 204745, praying for the reversal of the CTA En Banc's July 5, 2012 Decision and the November 29, 2012 Resolution, and that judgment be rendered reinstating its Petition for Review in CTA Case No. 8082.[14]","At the threshold of this Petition for Review[1] is the claim for tax refund or issuance of tax credit certificate of input value-added tax (VAT) for taxable year 2008 filed by respondent Mindanao II Geothermal Partnership (M2GP). Through this Petition, the petitioner Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) seeks to set aside the Decision[2] and the Resolution[3] of the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) En Banc in CTA EB Nos. 1777 and 1779, which affirmed the Decision and Resolution of the CTA Second Division, in CTA Case Nos. 8082 and 8106, granting the M2GP's claim in the amount of PHP 220,700.89 and the motions for reconsideration thereof, respectively.[4]

During the period of time material to this case, the CIR was the duly appointed Commissioner of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) empowered to perform the duties of its office, including the power to decide refunds of internal revenue taxes.[5]","This Court shall endeavor to put finis to this niggling controversy.

Petitioner CIR cashes in on the Court's pronouncements in Atlas Consolidated Mining and Development Corporation v. CIR[27] (2011 Atlas case) and Atlas Consolidated Mining and Development Corporation v. CIR[28] (2007 Atlas case). It postulates that direct attributability between input tax and zero-rated sales must be established in claims for refund or issuance of tax credit certificate. To be sure, the input tax must come from purchases of goods and services that form part of the finished product of the taxpayer and must be directly used in the production chain.[29] Here, M2GP failed to prove that the amount sought to be refunded is directly attributable to its zero-rated sales.[30]

On the other hand, respondent M2GP bemoans that the arguments raised by the CIR have already been considered and denied for lack of merit by CTA En Banc. In any case, M2GP has fully complied with the requisites to claim for tax refund or issuance of tax credit certificate for its unutilized input VAT attributable to its zero-rated sales based on Section 112(A)[31] of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended by Republic Act (R.A.) No. 8424.[32] Moreover, the 2007 and 2011 Atlas Cases do not apply in the case at bench as M2GP was able to establish direct attributability of its unutilized input VAT to its zero-rated sales, through the VAT-compliant official receipts and invoices it presented. At any rate, the doctrine of strictissimi juris should be relaxed in the present case as M2GP has sufficiently established its claim by competent preponderance of evidence. What is more, technicalities should not be misused to defeat its claim in light of competent evidence clearly establishing that there was a VAT and the VAT was indeed actually paid.[33]

Petitioner's contention holds no water.

Incipiently, the Court notes that while decisions of the CTA do not bind this Court, at most, they have a persuasive effect. Illumined by the ruling in San Roque Power Corp. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue,[34] only final decisions of the Court are considered binding precedents. The Court declared, thus—
""We further held in said case that Article 8 of the Civil Code enjoins adherence to judicial precedents. The law requires courts to follow a rule already established in a final decision of the Supreme Court. Contrary to the petitioner's view, the decisions of the CTA are not given the same level of recognition.""[35]
In a line of cases[36] involving claims for input tax refund or claims for issuance of tax credit certificate, the CTA is unwavering in its position that Section 112 of the Tax Code does not require direct attributability of input taxes to zero-rated sales.

To be sure, the grounds when input tax may be refunded or claimed as tax credit in cases of zero-rated sales are laid down in Section 112(A) of the Tax Code. To wit:
SEC. 112. Refunds of Input Tax. —

(A) Zero-rated or Effectively Zero-rated Sales. — Any VAT-­registered person, whose sales are zero-rated or effectively zero-rated may, within two (2) years after the close of the taxable quarter when the sales were made, apply for the issuance of a tax credit certificate or refund of creditable input tax due or paid attributable to such sales, except transitional input tax, to the extent that such input tax has not been applied against output tax: Provided, however, That in the case of zero-rated sales under Section 106(A)(2)(a)(1), (2) and (B) and Section 108(B)(1) and (2), the acceptable foreign currency exchange proceeds thereof had been duly accounted for in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP): Provided, further, That where the taxpayer is engaged in zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sale and also in taxable or exempt sale of goods of properties or services, and the amount of creditable input tax due or paid cannot be directly and entirely attributed to any one of the transactions, it shall be allocated proportionately on the basis of the volume of sales. Provided, finally, That for a person making sales that are zero-rated under Section 108(B) (6), the input taxes shall be allocated ratably between his zero-rated and non-zero-rated sales.
Plain as a pikestaff, there is nothing in the provision that requires input tax to be directly attributable or a factor in the chain of production to the zero-­rated sale for it to be creditable or refundable. The law even allows as tax credit an allocable portion of a taxpayer's input tax that is not directly and entirely attributable to the zero-rated sales. What the law requires is that creditable input VAT should be attributable to the zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sales. To attribute is to explain something by indicating a cause, or simply caused by. Thus, when the law states that the input VAT must be attributable to the zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sales, it simply means that the input VAT must be regarded as being caused by such sales.

What is more, Section 110, as amended, does not limit creditable input tax to purchases that form part of the finished product of the taxpayer. The provision enumerates the instances that give rise to creditable input taxes, to wit:

The rule on chain of custody in drugs cases
To sustain a conviction for the offense of illegal sale of dangerous drugs under Section 5, and illegal possession of dangerous drugs under Section 11, Article II of R.A. No. 9165, the prosecution must be able to establish with moral certainty the identity of the confiscated drug.[43] To remove any doubt or uncertainty as to the identity and integrity of the seized drug, it must be proven that the substance illegally sold by the accused is the same substance offered and identified in court.[44] This requirement is known as the chain of custody rule. Chain of custody has been defined as ""the duly recorded, authorized movements, and custody of the seized drugs at each stage, from the moment of confiscation to the receipt in the forensic laboratory for examination until it is presented to the court.""[45]

The chain of custody rule is provided for under Section 21, Article II of R.A. No. 9165, as amended by R.A. No. 10640,[46] which was passed on July 15, 2014. Considering that the illegal acts of selling and/or possessing dangerous drugs were allegedly committed by Edwin and Taladua on January 17, 2019, the revised chain of custody rule applies in this case. In this regard, Section 21, Article II of R.A. No. 9165, as amended by R.A. No. 10640, provides that:

SEC. 21. Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized, and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment. – The PDEA shall take charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment so confiscated, seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the following manner:","ACCORDINGLY, the appeal is GRANTED.

"G.R. No. 268399, January 24, 2024","FRANCHESKA ALEEN BALABA BUBAN, PETITIONER, VS. NILO DELA PEÑA,* RESPONDENT.","On November 11, 2014, Buban was hired as Customer Care Senior Specialist in Xerox Business. On March 22, 2015, between 6:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m., Buban arrived at the office and went directly to the workstation of Team Leader Kiko[10] to get her headset. However, the latter was on leave and left his pedestal locked. As a result, Buban was constrained to get a temporary headset in the storage room. She tried them on three computers, but was unsuccessful due to a system error. Buban promptly informed Dela Peña, the assigned team leader at the time, and asked for assistance in reporting the system issue to the Information Technology Department. Dela Peña told Buban that the error might be due to the headset and directed her to get a replacement headset from the storage room.[11]

While inside the storage room, Dela Peña suddenly appeared and told Buban, ""Baby tigas na tigas na ako, kelan mo ba talaga ako pagibigyan [sic]?"" Startled and feeling uneasy, Buban tried to make light of the situation by answering, ""TL ano kaba? Para kang tanga dyan."" Then, she grabbed the nearest headset and ran out of the room back to her station.[12]

Unfortunately, the headset that Buban took was similarly defective. Buban had to get another headset without an ""enabler."" Thinking that Dela Peña already left the storage area, Buban went back inside. To her surprise, Dela Peña approached her. Trying to avoid further contact, Buban hurriedly moved away, but Dela Peña grabbed her by the waist and tried to kiss her. She struggled to push him away, but Dela Peña was stronger. Dela Peña was able to hug her and he started groping her breasts. Mustering all her strength, Buban was able to break free from Dela Pena's hold and race out of the room.[13]

Buban's ordeal did not end here. While she was at her workstation, Dela Peña approached her and told her to reboot her tools and get a replacement headset, so she can start making calls instead of using system error as an excuse to slack off. Distressed at being put on the spot, Buban complied and went back to the storage room to get another headset. To her horror, Dela Peña followed her inside, closed the door, and blocked the exit. Again, Dela Peña made sexual advances on Buban, telling her, ""Sige na Baby, pagkahawak mo at itatago ko din agad."" Despite her vehement protestations and warnings that he would be caught by the closed-circuit television camera, Dela Peña still forced himself upon Buban. When she found an opportunity, she ran out of the room. Shocked at what she had just experienced, she was only able to tell her teammates about the incident during their break.[14]

From then on, she detested going to work for fear of running into Dela Peña. As a result, her health deteriorated. At work, she became anxious and paranoid, and would find herself uncontrollably crying whenever she saw Dela Peña. However, as a single parent, she could not afford to quit. Thus, she was left with no choice but to continue working.[15]

She reported the incident and filed a formal complaint with the Human Resources Department. However, her case was never heard, and no protective measure was afforded to her by the management. Dela Peña continued to work in the same area and same shift with her, magnifying her distress. To her consternation, Dela Peña acted condescendingly and even insinuated that it was Buban who wanted or asked for what happened between them. To make matters worse, Xerox Business withheld three days of Buban's salary earned in May 2015.[16]

On September 15, 2015, Buban filed a Complaint before the Labor Arbiter against Xerox Business, Rojan, and Dela Peña for sexual harassment, with prayer for payment of unpaid salary, moral damages, exemplary damages, and attorney's fees.[17]

In response, Xerox Business filed its Position Paper[18] admitting that Buban was its employee with the position of Customer Care Senior Specialist. However, Xerox Business denied Buban's allegations that the incident report was never investigated. It claimed that the security incident report was promptly referred to Megaforce Security Services, the security group handling the overall security concerns of the company. In addition, Xerox Business conducted an administrative investigation where a Show Cause Notice[19] was issued against Dela Peña, directing him to explain in writing the charges against him within five days. The administrative investigation, however, did not find convincing evidence to warrant the imposition of the penalty of termination against Dela Peña. Xerox Business further claimed that it was only upon such conclusion that Buban filed her Complaint before the Labor Arbiter.[20]

In its Decision,[21] Labor Arbiter ruled in favor of Buban. It held Xerox Business solidarity liable in the payment of damages for its failure to create a Committee on Decorum and Investigation and investigate the alleged sexual harassment incident. In so failing, Xerox Business perpetrated a hostile, offensive, and intimidating work environment that ultimately led to the constructive dismissal of Buban. The dispositive portion of the Labor Arbiter's Decision reads:","This Court resolves the Petition for Review[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court from the Decision[2] and Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA), which affirmed with modifications the Decision[4] and Resolution[5] of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC), that affirmed the Decision[6] of the Labor Arbiter finding Xerox Business Services Philippines Inc. (Xerox Business) and Nilo Dela Peña (Dela Peña) solidarily liable for payment of damages resulting from sexual harassment as defined and penalized under Republic Act No. 7877,[7] otherwise known as the Anti-Sexual Harassment Act of 1995.
This case stemmed from an Amended Complaint[8] filed by Francheska Aleen Balaba Buban (Buban) against Xerox Business, Human Resources Manager Rojan Gonzales (Gonzales), and Dela Peña for sexual harassment, non-payment of salary, payment of moral and exemplary damages, and attorney's fees, before the Labor Arbiter. To support her claim, Buban executed an Affidavit[9] narrating the incidents of sexual harassment.","The Petition is denied for lack of merit.

As a rule, this Court's jurisdiction in a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court is limited to the review of pure questions of law. In labor cases, when the CA decision is brought to the Court through a Petition for Review on Certiorari, as in this case, the question of law presented to this Court is whether the CA correctly found that the NLRC acted with grave abuse of discretion in rendering its judgment.[39] There is grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC when its findings of fact and conclusions of law are not supported by substantial evidence, that is, such amount of relevant evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion.[40]

On this note, the pronouncement of this Court in Traveloka Philippines, Inc. v. Ceballos, Jr.[41] is instructive:

Preliminarily, the Court stresses the distinct approach in reviewing a CA's ruling in a labor case. In a Rule 45 review, the Court examines the correctness of the CA's Decision in contrast with the review of jurisdictional errors under Rule 65. Furthermore, Rule 45 limits the review to questions of law. In ruling for legal correctness, the Court views the CA Decision in the same context that the petition for certiorari was presented to the CA. Hence, the Court has to examine the CA's Decision from the prism of whether the CA correctly determined the presence or absence of grave abuse of discretion in the NLRC decision.

Case law states that grave abuse of discretion connotes a capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment, done in a despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility, the character of which being so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined by or to act at all in contemplation of law.[42] (Citations omitted)

In the case at hand, Buban raises that Dela Peña has already waived his right to participate and intervene in the present labor complaint on account of: first, non-submission of position papers and non-participation in the proceedings before the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC; and second, filing a petition before a court of law without the assistance of a legal counsel. As a consequence, Dela Peña has lost his legal standing to seek any affirmative relief. Further, Dela Peña signed and filed his own pleading before the CA, without any legal representation. Buban argues that his Petition should have been considered a mere scrap of paper for failing to observe the formalities required by the Rules. Thus, the CA should have dismissed his Petition outright.[43]

We cannot countenance Buban's arguments. To do so would run contrary to the well-settled principle that the application of technical rules of procedure and evidence are not strictly observed in labor cases to serve the demands of substantial justice. It is the spirit and intention of the Labor Code that in the adjudication of labor disputes, every and all reasonable means shall be employed to ascertain the facts in each case speedily and objectively, without regard to technicalities of law or procedure, all in the interest of due process.[44]

Pertinently, the Labor Code provides that:

Article 227 [221]. Technical rules not binding and prior resort to amicable settlement.— In any proceeding before the Commission or any of the Labor Arbiters, the rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity shall not be controlling, and it is the spirit and intention of this Code that the Commission and its members and the Labor Arbiters shall use every and all reasonable means to ascertain the facts in each case speedily and objectively, without regard to technicalities of law or procedure, all in the interest of due process[.][45]","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review is DENIED. The Decision dated May 31, 2019 and the Resolution dated November 23, 2020 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 147443 are AFFIRMED. Petitioner Francheska Aleen B. Buban is found to have been constructively dismissed. She is entitled to the payment of her unpaid salary amounting to PHP 2,630.58. Respondent Nilo Dela Peña is solidarily liable with Xerox Business Services Philippines, Inc. to pay the unpaid salary of Francheska Aleen B. Buban, and to pay: (1) PHP 100,000.00 as moral damages; and (2) PHP 50,000.00 as exemplary damages. All monetary awards shall be subject to legal interest at the rate of 6% per annum, from the finality of this Decision until full payment.

The case is REMANDED to the Labor Arbiter for the determination of whether the total monetary award has already been fully or partially satisfied. Any unpaid amount should be further satisfied in accordance with this Decision."
"G.R. No. 246434, January 24, 2024","HERNALD BERMILLO Y DE VERA, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","Bermillo was indicted m an Information, the accusatory portion of which reads as follows:
That on or about March 21, 2015, at around 5:35 in the afternoon, in the Municipality of Camiling, Province of Tarlac, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused did then and there have in his possession and control one (1) piece heat-sealed transparent plastic sachet containing Methamphetamine Hydrochloride, known as Shabu, a dangerous drug, weighing 0.019 gram.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[4]
Upon arraignment, Bermillo pleaded ""not guilty"" to the crime charged. Pre-trial was conducted, and trial on the merits then ensued.[5]

The prosecution presented the testimonies of arresting police officers Mark Anthony Alviar (PO1 Alviar), Tirso Navero (PO3 Navero), and Barangay Chaiperson Renato de Mayo (Brgy. Chairperson de Mayo). Their combined testimonies show that at around 5:00 p.m. on March 21, 2015, a confidential agent arrived at the Municipal Anti-Illegal Drugs Special Operation Task Group of the Camiling Police Station to inform the deputy chief of police, Police Senior Inspector Manolito S. Jandoc (PSINSP Jandoc), that a certain Vilma Matias (Matias) was engaged in the illegal sale of dangerous drugs. Based on this information, PSINSP Jandoc summoned his team to a meeting for purposes of conducting an anti-illegal drugs operation. PO1 Alviar was designated as the poseur-buyer while PO3 Navero, Senior Police Officer 1 Librada Calma (SPO1 Calma), PO3 Nestor Agustin, PO2 Alexander Juan, and PO1 Abel Corpuz (PO1 Corpuz) were designated as back-up operatives. A 500-peso bill was also handed to PO1 Alviar for the buy-bust operation, which the latter marked with his initials ""MA"" and was then photographed by PO2 Alexander Juan.[6]

Together with the confidential informant, the buy-bust team proceeded to Barangay Caarosipan, Palimbo, Camiling, Tarlac to await the arrival of Matias. Not long after, Matias arrived with Bermillo on board a tricycle. After approaching Matias, the confidential agent introduced PO1 Alviar to the latter as the buyer of shabu. PO1 Alviar then gave the marked money to Matias and the latter responded by giving PO1 Alviar a transparent plastic sachet containing white crystalline substance. Upon assessing the contents to be shabu, PO1 Alviar gave the pre-arranged signal and the back-up team accosted Matias:[7]

As the arresting officers approached Bermillo, they saw him drawing something out of his pocket and apprehended him as he was about to throw it and board his tricycle. Later, they discovered that the plastic sachet he attempted to throw also contained white crystalline substance.[8] The drugs seized from Bermillo were then given to PO1 Alviar.[9]

Matias and Bermillo were brought to the police station where they were informed of their constitutional rights and the two sachets seized from them were marked by PO1 Alviar. The sachet confiscated from Matias was marked with the initials ""VM"" while the sachet seized from Bermillo was marked with his initials ""HB.""[10] The confiscated sachets were inventoried and photographed in the presence of Brgy. Chairperson de Mayo, Billy Nuqui, a media representative, and Juning Guiang, a representative from the Department of Justice (DOJ).[11]

PO1 Alviar and PO3 Edgar brought the sachets to the Philippine National Police (PNP) Crime Laboratory in Camp Makabulos, Tarlac City and handed them over to Police Forensic Chemist Angelito Angel (Forensic Chemist Angel), who conducted an examination. The contents of the seized sachets yielded positive results for the presence of methamphetamine hydrochloride or shabu, a dangerous drug,[12] as stated in Chemistry Report Nos. D-088-15 and D-089-15.[13]

On the part of the defense, Matias and Bermillo both testified that at 5:00 p.m. of March 21, 2015, they went to the house of a certain Sergeant Wawas at Barangay Caarosipan, Palimbo, Camiling, Tarlac to butcher a pig. Upon seeing, however, that there was no one inside Sargeant Wawas' house, they returned home on board a tricycle driven by Bermillo. On their way home along Romulo Highway, they noticed someone following them and so Matias instructed Bermillo to park the tricycle at the shoulder of the road. Upon reaching them, PO1 Corpuz ordered them to alight from the tricycle and proceeded to search the vehicle, while PO3 Esteban frisked them. Although PO3 Esteban did not discover anything illegal, PO1 Corpuz showed them a plastic sachet of shabu which he claimed was found in their tricycle. PO1 Corpuz then left them standing near the tricycle under the guard of SPO1 Calma. Thirty minutes later, PO1 Corpuz returned with PO1 Alviar and the two showed them a marked 500-peso bill and plastic sachets containing shabu. They testified that, out of fear of being harmed, they followed the instructions of the police officers to point at the items while being photographed. Matias and Bermillo were taken to the police station then to the PNP Crime Laboratory for drug test and examination of the items purportedly confiscated from them, and finally to the Office of the Provincial Prosecutor of Tarlac for investigation.[14]

On July 28, 2017, the Regional Trial Court (RTC) rendered its Decision[15] finding Bermillo guilty beyond reasonable doubt, the dispositive portion of which states:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, accused Hernald Bermillo y De Vera is hereby found guilty beyond reasonable doubt for violation of Section 11, Article [II] of [R.A. No.] 9165 and hereby sentences him to an indeterminate prison term of twelve (12) twelve years and eight (8) months, as minimum[,] to seventeen (17) years and eight (8) months[,] as maximum, and to pay a Fine of Php300,000.00.

The Clerk of Court of this Court is hereby ordered to forward the subject stuffs to the PDEA Regional Office, San Fernando Pampanga for proper disposal.","This Court resolves the Motion for Reconsideration[1] filed by petitioner Hernald Bermillo y de Vera (Bermillo) assailing this Court's Resolution,[2] the dispositive portion of which provides:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, the petition is DENIED. The assailed Decision dated October 31, 2018 and the Resolution dated April 2, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 40482, affirming the conviction of Hernald Bermillo y De Vera by the Regional Trial Court of Camiling, Tarlac, Branch 68, for violation of Section 11, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165, are AFFIRMED.

Petitioner is sentenced to an indeterminate prison term of twelve (12) years and eight (8) months, as minimum, to seventeen (17) years and eight (8) months, as maximum, and to pay a Fine of Three Hundred Thousand Pesos ([PHP] 300,000.00).","The instant Motion fails on the first issue. An in flagrante delicto arrest requires the existence of probable cause to effect such an arrest. For both the arrest and the confiscation of items, probable cause is explained in jurisprudence as follows:
The conventional view is that probable cause, while largely a relative term the determination of which must be resolved according to the facts of each case, is understood as having reference to such facts and circumstances which could lead a reasonable, discreet, and prudent man to believe and conclude as to the commission of an offense, and that the objects sought in connection with the offense are in the place sought to be searched.[26] (Citation omitted)
Here, the record states that petitioner was arrested almost immediately after the culmination of the buy-bust operation against Matias. The CA noted that Bermillo and Matias had arrived together at the buy-bust site, and that the police officers had seen Bermillo trying to draw and throw something from his clothes during Matias's arrest. We agree with the CA that, given the circumstances, it was not farfetched for the police officers to conclude that petitioner and Matias were selling illegal drugs together, or at the very least, that petitioner was likewise engaged in the drug trade.[27]

In any case, this Court gives credence to the narration of police officers in cases involving violations of the Dangerous Drugs Act, and police officers are presumed to have performed their duties in a regular manner, unless there is evidence to the contrary.[28] Without any allegation or proof by petitioner that the police officers had ill motive or an odious intent in arresting him, we affirm the findings of the RTC and CA that there was indeed probable cause to arrest petitioner and the subsequent seizure by the police officers of the illegal items were valid.

Apart from the validity of petitioner's arrest, however, the prosecution in drug cases must contend with Section 21 of Republic Act No. 9165, as amended by Republic Act No. 10640, which details the procedure for the observance of the chain of custody in seizures of illegal drugs:
SEC. 21. Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized, and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment. — The PDEA shall take charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment so confiscated, seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the following manner:

(1) The apprehending team having initial custody and control of the dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, conduct a physical inventory of the seized items and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, with an elected public official and a representative of the National Prosecution Service or the media who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof: Provided, That the physical inventory and photograph shall be conducted at the place where the search warrant is served; or at the nearest police station or at the nearest office of the apprehending officer/team, whichever is practicable, in case of warrantless seizures: Provided, finally, That noncompliance of these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizures and custody over said items.

(2) Within twenty-four (24) hours upon confiscation/seizure of dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment, the same shall be submitted to the PDEA Forensic Laboratory for a qualitative and quantitative examination;

(3) A certification of the forensic laboratory examination results, which shall be done by the forensic laboratory examiner, shall be issued immediately upon the receipt of the subject item/s: Provided, That when the volume of dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, and controlled precursors and essential chemicals does not allow the completion of testing within the time frame, a partial laboratory examination report shall be provisionally issued stating therein the quantities of dangerous drugs still to be examined by the forensic laboratory: Provided, however, That a final certification shall be issued immediately upon completion of the said examination and certification[.]
For crimes involving drugs, case law instructs that it is essential for the identity of the prohibited drug to be established with moral certainty, considering that the dangerous drug itself forms an integral part of the corpus delicti of the crime. Thus, to obviate any unnecessary doubt on the identity of the dangerous drugs, the prosecution must show an unbroken chain of custody over the same and account for each link in the chain of custody from the moment the drugs are seized up to their presentation in court as evidence of the crime.[29]

This Court has previously explained that the chain of custody is divided into four links:
[F]irst, the seizure and marking of the illegal drug recovered from the accused by the apprehending officer; second, the turnover of the illegal drug seized by the apprehending officer to the investigating officer; third, the turn over by the investigating officer of the illegal drug to the forensic chemist for laboratory examination; and fourth, the turn over and submission of the marked illegal drug seized by the forensic chemist to the court.[30]
Upon a review on the facts and circumstances surrounding the instant case, we find that the prosecution failed to comply with the fourth 1ink. For cases where the parties dispense with the attendance and testimony of the forensic chemist, jurisprudence dictates that these points must be included in the stipulation in order to ensure the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized item: (1) that the forensic chemist received the seized article as marked, properly sealed, and intact; (2) that he resealed it after examination of the content; and (3) that he placed his own marking on the same to ensure that it could not be tampered with pending trial.[31]","FOR THESE REASONS, the Motion for Reconsideration is GRANTED. The November 18, 2021 Resolution of this Court is REVERSED. Accordingly, petitioner Hernald Bermillo y de Vera is ACQUITTED of the charge of violation of Section 21 of Republic Act No. 9165 in Criminal Case No. 15-93. He is ORDERED IMMEDIATELY RELEASED from detention unless he is being held for some other legal ground.

Let a copy of this Resolution be furnished to the Director General of the Bureau of Corrections, Muntinlupa City for immediate implementation. The Director General of the Bureau of Corrections is DIRECTED to report to this Court, within five days from receipt of this Resolution, the action he has taken. Copies shall also be furnished to the Chief of the Philippine National Police and the Director General of the Philippine Drugs Enforcement Agency for their information.

Let entry of judgment be issued immediately."
"G.R. No. 257685, January 24, 2024","COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS, REP. BY COMMISSIONER KAREN S. GOMEZ-DUMPIT, PETITIONER, VS. OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSMAN, PSUPT ROBERT C. DOMINGO, PO2 DYLAN VERDAN, PO2 JONATHAN UBARRE, PO1 BERLY APOLONIO, AND OTHER JOHN DOES, RESPONDENTS.","This case stemmed from a Complaint[4] filed by the CHR before the Ombudsman charging respondents with violations of: (i) the Revised Penal Code, specifically arbitrary detention, delay in the delivery of detained persons, grave threats, grave coercion, and robbery/extortion; (ii) Republic Act No. 9745,[5] also known as the Anti-Torture Act of 2009, specifically Section 4(a)(1) to (4) and Section 4(b)(3) and (11); and (iii) the 2013 Revised Philippine National Police (PNP) Operational Procedures (2013 RPNPOP).[6]

The Complaint arose after the CHR visited the Raxabago Police Station 1 (Raxabago PS 1) located in Tondo, City of Manila, then under the command of PSUPT Domingo, in the early evening of April 27, 2017, after taking cognizance of an information about a secret detention cell in the station.

During their visit, the CHR found a room, which it called a ""secret detention cell,"" inside the Drug Enforcement Unit's (DEU) office measuring one meter by five meters with a wooden shelf covering its entrance. The CHR described the secret detention cell as cramped, dingy, fetid, and dark, with no lights and windows. Since it only had one male urinal, the CHR claimed that some detainees urinated and defecated in plastic bags.

Inside the secret detention cell were three women and nine men who were allegedly arrested for various violations of Republic Act No. 9165, otherwise known as the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002, namely:[7]","Assailed in this Petition for Certiorari[1] under Rule 65 is the criminal aspect of the Joint Resolution[2] dated July 28, 2020 and the Joint Order[3] dated May 18, 2021 rendered by the Office of the Ombudsman (Ombudsman) in OMB-P-C-17-0193 and OMB-P-A-17-0211 dismissing the criminal and administrative Complaint filed by petitioner Commission on Human Rights (CHR) against respondents Police Superintendent (PSUPT) Robert C. Domingo (PSUPT Domingo), Police Officer 2 (PO2) Dylan Verdan (PO2 Verdan), PO2 Jonathan Ubarre (PO2 Ubarre), Police Officer 1 (PO1) Berly Apolonio (PO1 Apolonio), and other John Does (collectively, respondents) for lack of probable cause.","The Petition is denied.

Preliminarily, the Court notes that the CHR failed to include in its Petition the attachments to the Counter-Affidavit of PSUPT Domingo, which are considered documents relevant and pertinent to this case. This failure is in violation of Rule 65, Section 1, second paragraph of the Rules of Court. It was PSUPT Domingo who provided the attachments on the Counter-Affidavit in his Supplemental Comment.

Nevertheless, it is well-settled that ""[t]he Ombudsman has the discretion to determine whether a criminal case, given its attendant facts and circumstances, should be filed or not. The Ombudsman may dismiss the complaint should the Ombudsman find the complaint insufficient in form or substance, or the Ombudsman may proceed with the investigation if, in the Ombudsman's view, the complaint is in due form and substance. Hence, the filing or non-filing of the information is primarily lodged within the 'full discretion' of the Ombudsman.""[32]

The Court has consistently adopted a policy of non-interference in the exercise of the Ombudsman's constitutionally mandated powers. The Ombudsman, which is ""beholden to no one, acts as the champion of the people and the preserver of the integrity of the public service.""[33]

In Arroyo v. Sandiganbayan,[34] the Court, through now Senior Associate Justice Marvic M.V.F. Leonen, held:

""The Ombudsman is endowed with a wide latitude of investigatory and prosecutory prerogatives in the exercise of its power to pass upon criminal complaints."" As a general rule, this Court does not interfere with the Office of the Ombudsman's exercise of its constitutional mandate. It is an executive function, which must be respected consistent with the principle of separation of powers[.][35]

While the Court is not precluded from reviewing the Ombudsman's action when it is tainted with grave abuse of discretion—which implies a capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment tantamount to lack of jurisdiction—the Court's certiorari jurisdiction pursuant to Article VIII, Section 1, paragraph 2 of the Constitution may be invoked. However, it must be shown that ""[t]he Ombudsman's exercise of its powers must have been done in an arbitrary or despotic manner which must be so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of a positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined or to act at all in contemplation of law.""[36]

In this case, it goes without saying that the CHR has the burden of proving that the Ombudsman gravely abused its discretion when it did not indict respondents of the crimes they were accused of committing. In this regard, the CHR argues that the Ombudsman committed grave abuse of discretion in using clear and convincing evidence instead of probable cause as quantum of evidence in the filing or non-filing of information. With probable cause as standard evidence, the CHR alleges that it has established its criminal complaint.

The Court disagrees.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DENIED. The Joint Resolution dated July 28, 2020 and the Joint Order dated May 18, 2021 of the Office of the Ombudsman in OMB-P-C-17-0193 are hereby AFFIRMED.

Let copies of this Decision be furnished to the Congress, the Office of the President, the Department of Interior and Local Government, the National Police Commission, and the Philippine National Police."

No. 260708, January 23, 2024","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. ABC260708,* ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","ABC260708 was charged with qualified rape and rape through sexual assault committed against his minor daughter, AAA260708,[1] in two separate Informations filed before the Regional Trial Court of xxxxxxxxxxx[2] Cagayan xxxxxxxxxxx (RTC) which were docketed as Criminal Case Nos. 17006 and 17007, respectively,[3] the accusatory portions of which read:
Criminal Case No. 17006

That on March 17, 2015, in the xxxxxxxxxxx, Province of Cagayan, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the accused [ABC260708], with lewd design, and by means of force, threat and intimidation, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously, have sexual intercourse with the private complainant [AAA260708], who is [his] daughter and a minor being only a 7-year[-]old minor, against her will.

That the acts of the accused was aggravated by the fact that the private complainant was only a 7[-]year[-]old minor when the offense was committed and the accused was [her] father.

That due to the incident, the accused was immediately apprehended and was placed under custody of the law.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[4] (Emphasis supplied)

Criminal Case No. 17007

That on March 17, 2015, in the xxxxxxxxxxx, Province of Cagayan, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the accused [ABC260708], with lewd design, and by means of force, threat and intimidation, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously, abuse sexually the private complainant [AAA260708], who is a 7-year[­-]old minor and his own daughter, by inserting his penis into the private complainant's mouth; that the acts of the accused were done against the will of the private complainant.

That the incident was aggravated by the fact that the private complainant was only a 7-year[-]old minor when the offense was committed and that the accused was [her] father.

That due to the incident[.] the accused was immediately apprehended and was placed under the custody of the law.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[5] (Emphasis supplied)
When arraigned, ABC260708 pleaded not guilty to the offenses charged. After pretrial was terminated, joint trial ensued. AAA260708 testified that on March 15, 2015[6] at around 5:00 p.m., ABC260708 called her to enter their room. ABC260708 removed AAA260708's underwear and directed her to tie on the bed. ABC260708 laid on top of AAA260708 and spread her legs. ABC260708 pulled out his penis and inserted it into AAA260708's vagina. Thereafter, while AAA260708 was already standing, ABC260708 inserted his penis into her mouth. ABC260708 threatened to kill AAA260708 if she would report the matter to the police. BBB260708, AAA260708's older sister, corroborated the incident. BBB260708 recalled that on March 17, 2015 at around 5:00 p.m., she just arrived home, but could not open the front door because it was locked. BBB260708 entered the house through an unfinished window in their kitchen. Thereat, BBB260708 saw AAA260708 with her shirt without undergarments and ABC260708 wearing a shirt and brief. BBB260708 told her aunt what happened. On even date, AAA260708 and her uncle reported the matter to the authorities and the incident was recorded in a police blotter. On March 18, 2015, AAA260708 was brought to the hospital for physical examination. The medical report revealed that AAA260708 had fresh hymenal laceration incurred within 24 hours from penetration.[7]

ABC260708 denied the accusations, and claimed that he usually bathed his daughter AAA260708 because his wife was abroad. On March 17, 2015, ABC260708 bathed AAA260708 who gathered dust after helping him harvest corn. ABC260708 then piled the corn in the living room while wearing a sando and underwear. BBB260708 arrived at that moment. Afterwards, BBB260708's aunt whipped ABC260708 based on the report that he molested AAA260708.[8]","The meticulous study of a crime begins with the understanding of its definition, nature, and penalty, and ends with an accurate nomenclature or designation of the offense. Here, the Court pedagogically embarks on a quest to settle the proper taxonomy of the crime when the elements of both statutory rape, i.e., the victim is below the statutory age or is suffering from mental retardation comparable to the intellectual capacity of a child below the statutory age, and qualified rape, i.e., twin circumstances of minority and relationship, or the accused's knowledge of the mental disability of the victim at the time of the commission of rape, or the age of the victim being below 7 years old, are present.","The appeal is unmeritorious.

The prosecution established that
ABC260708 had carnal knowledge of
his 8-year-old daughter, AAA260708,
against the latter's will in Criminal
Case No. 17006

ABC260708 assailed his conviction on the ground that AAA260708's testimony is unbelievable. On this point, we stress that the CA and the RTC's assessment on the credibility of the prosecution witness and the veracity of her testimony are given the highest degree of respect,[20] especially if there is no fact or circumstance of weight or substance that was overlooked, misunderstood, or misapplied, which could affect the result of the case.[21] The trial court had the best opportunity to determine the credibility of the prosecution witness, having evaluated her emotional state, reactions, and overall demeanor in open court.[22] Here, AAA260708 positively identified ABC260708 as her ravisher and vividly recounted how he had sexual intercourse with her and thereafter, inserted his penis into her mouth, thus:","ACCORDINGLY, the appeal is DENIED. The Decision dated October 14, 2020 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 13463 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATIONS as to the proper designation of the crimes and the amounts of civil indemnity and damages.

In Criminal Case No. 17006, ABC260708 is found GUILTY of qualified rape of a minor and is sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua without eligibility for parole. He is also DIRECTED to pay the victim the amounts of PHP 150,000.00 as civil indemnity, PHP 150,000.00 as moral damages, and PHP 150,000.00 as exemplary damages, all with legal interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the finality of this Decision until full payment.

In Criminal Case No. 17007, ABC260708 is found GUILTY of sexual assault under Article 266-A(2) of the RPC in relation to Section 5(b) of Republic Act No. 7610. He is sentenced to suffer an indeterminate penalty of 13 years, 9 months and 11 days of reclusion temporal, as minimum, to 16 years, five months, and 10 days of reclusion temporal, as maximum, and to pay a fine of PHP 15,000.00. Also, he is ordered to pay the victim PHP 50,000.00 civil indemnity, PHP 50,000.00 moral damages, and PHP 50,000.00 exemplary damages, which shall all earn interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of finality of this Decision until full payment."
"G.R. No. 266552, January 22, 2024","RICO B. ESCAURIAGA, CRISTINE DELA CRUZ, RENE B. SEVERINO, RALPH ERROL MERCADO, AND GERALDINE GUEVARRA, PETITIONERS, VS. FITNESS FIRST, PHIL., INC., AND LIBERTY CRUZ, RESPONDENTS.","In their Complaint[3] dated June 9, 2017, petitioners sued respondents Fitness First Phil., Inc. (Fitness First) and its Senior Human Resource Manager Liberty Cruz (Cruz) for illegal dismissal, regularization, and other monetary claims.[4] They alleged:[5]

On different dates, respondents engaged them as fitness trainers:[6]
i) Rico Escauriaga	-	May 1, 2008
ii) Junnie Ordoña	-	September 24, 2012
iii) Rene Severino	-	February 1, 2007
iv) Geraldine Guevarra	-	April 1, 2012
v) Cristine Dela Cruz	-	May 26, 2003
vi) Peter John Fullante	-	August 28, 2012
vii) Ralph Errol Mercado	-	September 1, 2006[7]
As fitness trainers, they sold and marketed respondents' physical health training programs and packages. With respondents' equipment, they also conducted actual training sessions for their clients and were paid fixed monthly salaries, 13th month pay, and commissions.[8] On different dates, however, they were reclassified as freelance trainers:
i) Rico Escauriaga	-	May 1, 2012
ii) Junnie Ordoña	-	October 1, 2013
iii) Rene Severino	-	January 1, 2008
iv) Geraldine Guevarra	-	December 1, 2013
v) Cristine Dela Cruz	-	May 1, 2012
vi) Peter John Fullante	-	July 1, 2013
vii) Ralph Errol Mercado	-	July 1, 2007[9]
As freelance fitness trainers, they were paid their salaries but the other labor benefits, i.e. 13th month pay, overtime pay, holiday pay, and rest day pay were discontinued. They were allowed to work at their own choice of time so long as they trained clients for a minimum of 90 hours per month and PHP 80,000.00 worth of physical training program or package. Hours in between trainings were excluded in the 90-hour cap and failure to meet quota translated to salary deduction, or worse, disciplinary action such that repeated failure to meet the quota may subject them to warning, suspension, and even termination of employment.[10]

On March 20, 2017, respondents required them to register their alleged freelance business as required by Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) Regulation No. 4-2014[11] re: Guidelines and Policies for the Monitoring of Service Fees of Professionals. They were assured a 3% increase in their commission upon compliance. Non compliance, on the other hand, was penalized with 20% deduction in their commission and termination or non­ renewal of their freelance agreement. Believing they were regular employees, they did not comply.[12]

Though they did not possess substantial capital or investment in the form of tools, machinery, and work premises, they were engaged to perform activities necessary and desirable in the usual business or trade of respondents—to conduct physical training for the clients of respondents.[13] Lastly, the agreement was a contract of adhesion, and they had no idea about the legal consequences thereof.[14]

Respondents[15] countered that petitioners, who were initially hired as instructors, were later on promoted as freelance personal trainers. As such, they were independent contractors who were not required to observe fixed hours of work. They were required, however, one, to guarantee a minimum fixed monthly sale and conduct 90 hours of training; and two, to observe relevant house rules in dealing with their clients. Petitioners since then renewed their contract until February 1, 2016. This type of employment arrangement is distinguished from fitness instructors who were required to render work nine hours a day, six days a week.[16]

All trainers start as full-time instructors. A progressive commission scheme allows instructors who have obtained a certain level of skill and training to get promoted as freelance personal trainers to take advantage of the higher commissions and flexible working hours. A freelance personal trainer though may revert to being an instructor by manifesting his or her decision to the human resource department.[17]

In compliance with BIR Revenue Regulation No. 4-2014,[18] it offered a 3% increase in commission for those who will register their freelance business with the BIR. Those who fail to register by October 30, 2017, shall suffer termination or non-renewal of their agreement. Only 62 of its freelance trainers complied. Hence, on March 20, 2017, it revoked its offer of higher commission. On June 29, 2017, they then offered petitioners to revert to being instructors. Petitioners, however, would want to enjoy the benefits of both an instructor and freelance trainer. They reiterated their offer on July 18, 2017 but to no avail.[19]","
Petitioners Rico B. Escauriaga (Escauriaga) Cristine Dela Cruz (Dela Cruz), Rene B. Severino (Severino), Ralph Errol Mercado (Mercado), and Geraldine Guevarra (Guevarra) assail the following dispositions of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 165342 titled Rico B. Escauriaga, Cristine Dela Cruz, Rene B. Severino, Ralph Errol Mercado, and Geraldine Guevarra v. The Honorable National Labor Relations Commission (Fourth Division), Fitness First, Phil., Inc.[,] and Liberty Cruz:
1) Decision[1] dated August 18, 2022 affirming the finding of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) that petitioners are independent contractors and the dismissal of petitioners' petition for relief from judgment; and

2) Resolution[2] dated March 24, 2023 denying petitioners' motion for reconsideration.","The Petition is meritorious.

Procedural considerations

Respondents move for the dismissal of the Petition on the following grounds: one, only petitioner Escauriaga signed the Petition sans proof that he was duly authorized to sign on behalf of his co-petitioners; two, not all the counsels of petitioners signed the pleading; three, petitioners erroneously impleaded the NLRC as respondent in violation of Rule 45, Section 4,[53] of the Rules of Court; and lastly, the assailed Decision and Resolution dated December 28, 2018 and February 28, 2019 of the NLRC long attained finality.

Generally, the verification and certification against forum shopping must be signed by all petitioners in a case; otherwise, those who did not sign will be dropped as parties to the case. Under reasonable or justifiable circumstances, however, as when all the plaintiffs or petitioners share a common interest and invoke a common cause of action or defense, the signature of only one of them in the certification against forum shopping substantially complies with the rule.[54] Here, Dela Cruz, Severino, Mercado, and Guevarra share the same cause with Escauriaga in advancing their right to regular employment against respondents.

As for the fact that not all the counsels of petitioners signed the pleading before the Court, the same deserves scant consideration since a genuine signature of one counsel suffices to consider a pleading signed.[55]

The NLRC, however, must be dropped as a party following Rule 45, Section 4[56] of the Rules of Court. A petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45, unlike a petition for certiorari under Rule 65, does not require that the court a quo be impleaded. This distinction proceeds from the nature of these proceedings: a Rule 45 petition involves an appeal from the ruling a quo; a Rule 65 petition is an original special civil action that must implead the lower tribunal alleged to have acted in excess of its jurisdiction.[57]

As for the alleged finality of the assailed NLRC Resolutions, the doctrine on immutability of judgment must yield to substantial justice. True, a final and executory judgment can no longer be attacked by any of the parties or be modified, directly or indirectly, even by the highest court of the land. This Court, however, has relaxed this rule to serve substantial justice considering (a) matters of life, liberty, honor, or property, (b) the existence of special or compelling circumstances, (c) the merits of the case, (d) a cause not entirely attributable to the fault or negligence of the party favored by the suspension of the rules, (e) a lack of any showing that the review sought is merely frivolous and dilatory, and (f) the other party will not be unjustly prejudiced thereby.[58]","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review is GRANTED. The Decision and Resolution dated August 18, 2022 and March 24, 2023, respectively, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 165342 are REVERSED.

"G.R. No. 214741, January 22, 2024 ","PRIVATIZATION AND MANAGEMENT OFFICE, PETITIONER, VS. FIRESTONE CERAMIC, INC.,• RESPONDENT.","Under Republic Act No. 1160[6] and Executive Order No. 60,[7] series of 1954, the Board of Liquidators (BOL) was created as a government agency tasked to liquidate the assets of the defunct Land Settlement and Development Corporation (LASEDECO). Among the assets of LASEDECO that were turned over to the BOL for administration and liquidation is a building designated as Bodega 2 (the subject property) with a floor area of 1,285 square meters (sq. m.) situated inside the compound of the National Development Company (NDC) in Pureza Street, Sta. Mesa, Manila. This property was the subject of a contract of lease between the BOL and respondent Firestone Ceramic, Inc. (FCI) and its predecessors-in-interest since 1965.[8]

On November 17, 2005, the President of the Philippines issued Executive Order No. 471[9] directing the merger of the BOL and PMO, with the latter being the surviving entity. Consequently, the administration over the subject property was turned over to PMO.[10]

On October 11, 2006, FCI and PMO renewed the Contract of Lease[11] over the subject property for the period of January 1, 2006 up to December 31, 2008. Under the Contract of Lease, FCI agreed to pay PMO Five Thousand Five Hundred Pesos (PHP 5,500.00) as monthly rental. The Contract of Lease also had a renewal clause, as follows:

TERM – This Contract of Lease shall be for a term of two years beginning January 1, 2006 up to December 31, 2008 renewable under such terms and conditions as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties, provided, that the LESSEE shall within sixty (60) days before the expiration of this Contract, give notice in writing to the LESSOR of its intention to renew this Contract otherwise the LESSOR shall have the right to enter into an agreement with third parties.[12]
On November 12, 2007, FCI notified PMO in writing of the former's intention to renew the Contract of Lease for another term of two years or from January 1, 2008 up to December 31, 2009. FCI later clarified its November 12, 2007 letter in another letter dated December 17, 2008 stating that the renewal term was for three years beginning January 1, 2009 up to December 31, 2011.[13]

On December 23, 2008, PMO replied to FCI's letter dated December 17, 2008 and informed the latter that PMO noted FCI's intention to renew the Contract of Lease but also informed FCI that PMO was still in the process of conducting a market survey on the lease rentals on bodegas/warehouses in the area to determine the prevailing rental rate and that PMO shall thereafter notify FCI regarding the new rental rates on the leased premises.[14] PMO further added that ""after December 31, 2008, the lease will be treated on a month[-]to[-]month basis until such time that the parties will enter into a new contract of lease under mutually agreed terms and conditions.""[15]

In the meantime, PMO issued a Memorandum[16] dated February 11, 2009 providing its in-house appraisal of the ""Fair Rental Value of the LASEDECO Bodega No. 2"" at ""Php 20/sq.m./mo. for the 1,285 sq. m. or Php 25,700.00 per month.""[17] In preparing the Memorandum, PMO ""searched the market for comparable properties in Manila"" and ""consulted with knowledgeable persons conversant with the fair rental rates in the vicinity such as bank appraisers and real estates [sic] brokers and listings from classified ads.""[18]

After reviewing its in-house appraisal of the subject property, in a letter dated April 27, 2009, PMO offered to renew the Contract of Lease with FCI at the rental of PHP 35/sq. m./month or PHP 44,975.00 per month because PHP 35/sq. m./month was ""the median of the range provided for in the appraisal report [(i.e., the Memorandum dated February 11, 2009)].""[19] PMO also required the conformity of FCI within 15 days upon receipt of this letter; otherwise, PMO would be compelled to offer the subject property to other interested parties.[20]","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] (Petition) under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court filed by petitioner Privatization and Management Office (PMO), assailing the Decision[2] dated March 20, 2014 (assailed Decision) and Resolution[3] dated September 25, 2014 (assailed Resolution) promulgated by the Court of Appeals[4] (CA) in CA-G.R.

I.
First-level courts are vested with provisional authority to decide questions concerning the interpretation of provisions in a contract to resolve the issue of possession in cases of unlawful detainer.
It is established that jurisdiction is conferred by law and determined by the material allegations of the complaint.[48] This principle applies in cases of unlawful detainer. In Spouses Santiago v. Northbay Knitting, Inc.,[49] the Court declared:

Settled is the rule that jurisdiction over the subject matter is conferred by law and is determined by the material allegations of the complaint. It cannot be acquired through, or waived by, any act or omission of the parties, neither can it be cured by their silence, acquiescence, or even express consent. In ejectment cases, the complaint should embody such statement of facts as to bring the party clearly within the class of cases for which the statutes provide a remedy, as these proceedings are summary in nature. The complaint must show enough on its face to give the court jurisdiction without resort to parol evidence.

A complaint sufficiently alleges a cause of action for unlawful detainer if it states the following:

1)
possession of property by the defendant was initially by contract with or by tolerance of the plaintiff;
 	 
2)
eventually, such possession became illegal upon notice by plaintiff to defendant of the termination of the latter's right of possession;
 	 
3)
thereafter, the defendant remained in possession of the property and deprived the plaintiff of the enjoyment of the same; and
 	 
4)
within one (1) year from the last demand on defendant to vacate the property, the plaintiff instituted the complaint for ejectment.[50] (Citations omitted)
Moreover, once jurisdiction is vested by the allegations in the complaint, jurisdiction remains vested in the trial court irrespective of whether or not the plaintiff is entitled to recover upon all or some of the claims asserted therein.[51]

In Vda. de Murga v. Chan[52] (Vda. de Murga), the Court ruled that where the controversy hinges on the correct interpretation of a clause of a contract of lease, that is, whether or not it contemplated an automatic renewal of the lease, the action was not for unlawful detainer but one not capable of pecuniary estimation and, therefore, beyond the competence of a municipal court.[53] Decided in 1968, the pronouncement by the Court in Vda. de Murga has evolved into more recent rulings in favor of having first-level courts resolve all issues related to possession even in a provisional manner. This is consistent with the summary nature of unlawful detainer cases and the amendments of the applicable provisions from Rules 72 and 70 of the 1940 and 1964 Rules of Court, respectively, by Rule 70, Section 16 of the present Rules of Court, as follows:","ACCORDINGLY, premises considered, the instant Petition is hereby GRANTED. The Decision dated March 20, 2014 and Resolution dated September 25, 2014 promulgated by the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 126940 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE and the Decision dated May 7, 2012 of Branch 26, Regional Trial Court of Manila, in Civil Case No. 10-124494 is AFFIRMED. Respondent Firestone Ceramic, Inc. is ordered to immediately vacate the subject property and to restore the peaceful possession thereof to petitioner Privatization and Management Office and to pay the latter the reasonable compensation for the use of the subject property from July 3, 2009 until it has fully vacated the same, as determined pursuant to the last paragraph below.

This case is ordered REMANDED to Branch 3, Metropolitan Trial Court of Manila, to determine the amount of reasonable compensation due to petitioner Privatization and Management Office for respondent Firestone Ceramic, Inc.'s use of the subject property."
"G.R. Nos. 258182 and 259950, January 22, 2024","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. ROMEO CHAN REALES, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","In 2001, then Governor Milagrosa T. Tan (Governor Tan) of the Province of Samar designated Reales as the Officer-in-Charge of the Office of the Provincial Administrator, in addition to his duties as Provincial Accountant.[11] His authority to sign or approve papers and documents as officer-in-charge was limited to the following:
Payroll for salaries and wages;
Disbursement vouchers for payments of light, water, telephone[,] and internet subscription; and
Personnel remittances to GSIS, PhilHealth, BIR, PAG-IBIG, Land Bank of the Philippines[,] and Philippine National Bank.
All other documents and pertinent papers for signature of the Governor shall be forwarded to this office for appropriate action.[12]
As it turned out, Reales created and enrolled fictitious job order workers in the payrolls and took possession of the public monies earmarked for their wages. He particularly facilitated the disbursement of public funds amounting to PHP 76,500.00 for 25 job order workers. He likewise approved the Summary of Payrolls,[13] the Daily Time Records,[14] and the Time Book and Payroll[15] of the job order workers in Catbalogan, Samar covering the periods October 1-31, 2005 and November 1-30, 2005, which gave the green light to Winifreda A. Estremera (Estremera), the Municipal Treasurer, who was also the Special Disbursing Officer/Paymaster, to release the wages of the said workers.[16]

Reales also affixed his signature above the names ""Milagrosa T. Tan, Governor"" and ""Romeo C. Reales, Provincial Accountant"" on the Summary of Payrolls as well as the names ""Milagrosa T. Tan, Foreman or Timekeeper"" and ""Milagrosa T. Tan, Superintendent or Foreman-in-Charge"" on the Time Book and Payroll. He signed each of the 25 Daily Time Records of the job order workers. By doing so, he certified as to the services rendered by the employees concerned and the correctness of the payroll, thus approving their wages. However, none of the 25 job order personnel named in the Daily Time Records and the Time Book and Payroll truly reported for work, and yet their wages were released. The foregoing caused pecuniary damage to the government, to the Province of Samar, in particular.[17]

Eventually, Aurelio A. Bardaje, Jr. (Bardaje) of the Provincial Health Office, instituted an Affidavit/Complaint[18] against Reales 's purported ""illegal transactions of disbursing public money in the guise of Contract of Services of employees.""[19]

After investigation, the Field Investigation Group of the Office of the Ombudsman-Visayas filed a complaint against him and Bienvenido Sabenecio, the Provincial Treasurer, in violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019 and malversation through falsification of public documents under Article 217, in relation to Articles 48 and 171 of the RPC. The investigation revealed the salary payment scam which was presumably perpetrated by the said provincial officials.[20]

Expostulating against the accusations hurled against him,[21] Reales averred that the subject wages were actually received by the respective employees according to the Summary of Payrolls, and that he relied in good faith that the Daily Time Records and payrolls underwent scrutiny by the officers concerned. He maintained his innocence, arguing that he was not charged with the responsibility of ascertaining the correctness of all the details in the approval of the payroll, and that there was no direct proof that he falsified public documents.[22]

With the finding of probable cause against him for the crimes of (1) malversation of public funds through falsification of public/officials documents, defined and penalized under Article 217, in relation to Articles 48 and 171 of the RPC, and (2) violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019,[23] the Office of the Ombudsman filed two separate Informations[24] before the Sandiganbayan, docketed as SB-17-CRM-197 and SB-17-CRM-198. The inculpatory averments thereof state:","Before this Court is an ordinary appeal filed by accused-appellant Romeo Chan Reales (Reales) pursuant to Section 1(a), Rule XI[1] of the 2018 Revised Internal Rules of the Sandiganbayan,[2] assailing the Decision[3] and the Resolution[4] of the Sandiganbayan, in SB-17-CRM-2197 to 2198.
 
In the impugned Decision, the Sandiganbayan convicted Reales of: (1) violation of Section 3(e),[5] Republic Act No. 3019[6] and (2) malversation through falsification of public documents under Article 217,[7] in relation to Articles 48[8] and 171[9] of the Revised Penal Code (RPC). The challenged Resolution, on the other hand, denied his motion for reconsideration[10] thereof.","The Appeal carries weight and conviction.

Criminal Case No.
SB-17-CRM-2197

At the outset, it is settled that in criminal cases, the burden is on the prosecution to prove an accused's guilt beyond reasonable doubt. This is demanded by the due process clause of the Constitution, which protects an accused from conviction except upon proof beyond reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he or she is charged. Unless the prosecution can discharge its burden, the accused need not even offer evidence on his or her behalf, and he or she would be entitled to an acquittal.[50]

An evaluation of the Information in Criminal Case No. SB-17-CRM-2197 readily shows that accused-appellant Reales was charged with violating Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019 for ""acting with evident bad faith, manifest partiality, and/or gross inexcusable negligence,""[51] with the undermentioned overt acts imputed against him:
Causing or approving the disbursement of Php76,500.00 supposedly intended for the wages of the job order employees of the province for the period October 1, 2005 to November 30, 2005, when in truth they had not rendered such services;

Making it appear that they had received the said wages, when in truth and in fact such amount was misappropriated by the accused himself, to the damage and prejudice of the government.[52]
Evidently, the charges against accused-appellant ultimately hinge on the existence of the purported ""ghost"" employees, and whether they had indeed failed to render services. Yet, a review of the evidence on record evinces that the Office of the Ombudsman failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the job order workers did not render work, or that it was accused-appellant who misappropriated the wages supposedly due them.

In convicting him, the Sandiganbayan concluded that the prosecution was successful in proving its claim that the 25 job order workers failed to render work, thus:
Clearly, the Information (SB-CRM-17-2197) shows that the Prosecution anchors its theory on the negative allegation that the job order personnel ""had not rendered"" any work. The Court must perforce begin with a determination of this issue as its resolution is decisive for both cases.

. . . .

By all accounts, the Prosecution had proven its negative allegation that twenty-five (25) job order workers never actually worked. A ""smoking gun"" was revealed in the form of documents formally offered by the Prosecution. The Summary of Payrolls, the Daily Time Records (DTRs) for the periods October 1-31, 2005, and November 1-30, 2005, as well as the Time Book and Payroll for job order workers (i.e., emergency laborers) at [sic] Catbalogan, Samar, for said periods, as certified by Wenifreda A. Estremera, the Special Disbursing Officer/ Paymaster, point to [accused-­appellant] as the fraudster who perpetrated the white-collar crime. Further, OIC-HRMO Juliet T. Dayap attested that [accused-appellant] was –

"". . . authorized to sign payrolls, purchase requests, daily time records of personnel and other vouchers for the operation of the Office of the Provincial Agriculturist."" (Emphasis and Underscoring Supplied.)

Notably, however, said authorization took effect on March 13, 2006, not in 2005. Curiously, Ms. Dayap cannot find, despite diligent search, Personal Data Sheets (PDS), Contracts of Services[,] or any document relative to the hiring of emergency workers for CY 2005.

Furthermore, Julius N. Oballo, the investigator is cocksure about [accused-appellant's] culpability. Oballo's certitude is manifest in his testimony, viz[.]: ","ACCORDINGLY, finding the evidence insufficient to establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt, the Court hereby GRANTS the Appeal. The Decision dated June 25, 2021 and the Resolution dated November 9, 2021 of the Sandiganbayan in SB-17-CRM-2197 to 2198 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE in that accused-appellant Romeo Chan Reales is ACQUITTED of the charges hurled against him.

"G.R. Nos. 242353 & 253530, January 22, 2024","CECILIA QUE YABUT, EUMIR CARLO QUE CAMARA, AND MA. CORAZON QUE GARCIA, PETITIONERS, VS. CAROLINA QUE VILLONGCO, ANA MARIA QUE TAN, ANGELICA QUE GONZALES (NOW DECEASED AND SUBSTITUTED BY HER HEIR ROSA MARIA QUE GONZALES), ELAINE VICTORIA QUE TAN, AND EDISON WILLIAMS QUE TAN, RESPONDENTS.","According to the CA, the Order dated January 26, 2016 of Branch 74 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Malabon City in SEC Case No. SEC-15-001-MN was void for its failure to clearly and distinctly state the facts and the law on which it was based, in violation of Section 1, Rule 36 of the Rules of Court.[4] Moreover, the CA declared as invalid, for lack of quorum, Phil-Ville's annual stockholders' meeting held by petitioners in 2015, as well as the election of the members of the board of Phil-Ville's directors and officers conducted during the said invalid meeting.[5]

On the other hand, this Court issued on January 20, 2021 a Resolution[6] in G.R. No. 253530 denying petitioners' Petition for Review on Certiorari[7] for their failure to show that the CA committed any reversible error when it issued its Decision[8] and Resolution[9] in CA-G.R. SP No. 154888.

In CA-G.R. SP No. 154888, the appellate court held that the Decision dated February 13, 2018 of Branch 74 of the RTC of Malabon City in SEC Case No. SEC-17-0001-MN was bereft of any factual or legal mooring, and thus, void.[10] All the same, instead of ruling on the validity of the annual stockholders' meeting conducted by petitioners in 2017, the CA ordered the remand of the case to the RTC for the commencement of the proceedings.[11]

Fulminating against this Court's January 20, 2021 Resolution, petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration.[12]

To avoid the possibility of conflicting rulings and in light of the similarity in the factual milieux of the aforementioned cases, as well as the grounds relied upon in the Petition for Review and Motion for Reconsideration, the Court deemed it procedurally expedient to consolidate the cases and jointly resolve the matters involved therein.[13]

The undisputed facts binding the consolidated cases follow.

Phil-Ville is a family corporation founded by Geronima Gallego Que (Geronima) for the purpose of engaging in the real estate business.[14] Its authorized capital stock is PHP 20,000,000.00 divided into 200,000 shares with a par value of PHP 100.00 each.[15]

During Geronima's lifetime, she owned 3,140 shares of stock while the remaining 196,860 shares were equally divided among her six children, namely: Carolina, Ana Maria, Angelica, Cecilia, Corazon, and Maria Luisa Que Camara (Luisa), each having 32,810 shares.[16]

Two years prior to Geronima's death on August 31, 2007, she purportedly executed a document captioned as ""Sale of Shares of Stocks"" and dated June 11, 2005,[17] wherein Cecilia acted as her attorney-in-fact. The instrument effected a distribution of her 3,140 shares in the following manner—

a)
Carolina's children were given a total of 523 shares, distributed as follows: Francis Villongco– 131 shares; Carlo Villongco– 131 shares; Michael Villongco– 131 shares; and Marcelia Villongco– 130 shares;
 	 
b)
Ana Maria's daughter, Elaine– 523 shares;
 	 
c)
Angelica– 523 shares;
 	 
d)
Cecilia's children were given a total of 524 shares distributed as follows: Geminiano Yabut– 131 shares; Carlos Yabut– 131 shares; Geronimo Yabut– 131 shares; and John Elston Yabut– 131 shares;
 	 
e)
Corazon's son, Anthony Garcia– 523 shares;
 	 
f)
Luisa's children were given a total of 524 shares distributed as follows: Eumir– 174 shares; Paolo Camara (Paolo) – 175 shares; and Abimar Camara (Abimar) – 175 shares.[18]
Based on the apportionment, Carolina, Ana Maria, and Angelica, by themselves or through their children (Villongco Group), individually received 523 shares from the distribution. Meanwhile, Cecilia, Corazon, and Luisa, through their children (Yabut Group) received either 523 or 524 shares each.","These consolidated cases are set in the context of a familial dispute apropos the validity of the transfer of certain shares of stock of Phil-Ville Development and Housing Corporation (Phil-Ville), which consequently spawned a seemingly endless cycle of litigation concerning its annual stockholders' meetings, as well as the ensuing election of its board of directors and officers.
In G.R. No. 242353, petitioners Cecilia Que Yabut (Cecilia), Eumir Carlo Que Camara (Eumir), and Ma. Corazon Que Garcia (Corazon) filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari,[1] impugning the Decision[2] and the Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA), which granted the petition of respondents Carolina Que Villongco (Carolina), Ana Maria Que Tan (Ana Maria), Angelica Que Gonzales (Angelica) (now deceased and substituted by her heir Rosa Maria Que Gonzales), Elaine Victoria Que Tan (Elaine), and Edison Williams Que Tan (Edison) and denied the motion for reconsideration thereof, respectively, in CA-G.R. SP No. 144363.","After ploughing through the diametrically opposed postulations of the parties, this Court resolves to partly grant the Petition for Review on Certiorari in G.R. No. 242353 and deny the Motion for Reconsideration in G.R. No. 253530.

The 2015 and 2017 Election Contest Orders are void for their abject failure to state the legal or factual bases for their disposition.
The matters raised before this Court are neither complex nor unfamiliar. Only recently, in the aforecited case of Villongco,[69] the Court had already untangled some of the issues which plagued the long-drawn-out dispute between the parties.

In Villongco, the Court explicated that the Decision[70] of the RTC in the 2014 election contest was void for precisely the same reason the 2015 and 2017 Election Contest Orders had been nullified by the CA, i.e., failure to state the factual and legal moorings for its disposition. Citing De Leon v. People,[71] the Court thus elucidated:

Under Section 14, Article VIII of the Constitution, no decision shall be rendered by any court without expressing therein clearly and distinctly the facts and the law on which it is based. Section l of Rule 36 of the Rules of Court provides that a judgment or final order determining the merits of the case shall be in writing personally and directly prepared by the judge, stating clearly and distinctly the facts and the law on which it is based, signed by him and filed with the clerk of the court.

Faithful adherence to the requirements of Section 14, Article VIII of the Constitution is indisputably a paramount component of due process and fair play. A decision that does not clearly and distinctly state the facts and the law on which it is based leaves the parties in the dark as to how it was reached and is precisely prejudicial to the losing party, who is unable to pinpoint the possible errors of the court for review by a higher tribunal. More than that, the requirement is an assurance to the parties that, in arriving at a judgment, the judge did so through the processes of legal reasoning. It is, thus, a safeguard against the impetuosity of the judge, preventing him from deciding ipse dixit.

The standard ""expected of the judiciary"" is that the decision rendered makes clear why either party prevailed under the applicable law to the facts as established. Nor is there any rigid formula as to the language to be employed to satisfy the requirement of clarity and distinctness. The discretion of the particular judge in this respect, while not unlimited, is necessarily broad. There is no sacramental form of words which he must use upon pain of being considered as having failed to abide by what the Constitution directs.[72]

While the RTC Decision in Villongco was nullified for merely adopting the allegations of the plaintiffs therein, the 2015 and 2017 Election Orders are in no better shape.

To recall, the 2015 and 2017 Election Contest Orders dismissed respondents' complaints by merely referencing the pendency of Civil Case No. CV-940-MN and holding that a resolution of the issues in the former would prejudge the latter. However, the discussion and substantiation of these findings are so perfunctory that they are presented as neither legitimate nor capable of withstanding judicial scrutiny. The entirety of the 2015 Election Contest Order[73] states as follows:

Submitted for resolution by this Court is the instant Election Contest filed by plaintiffs, praying inter alia that:

a) On the First Cause of Action, declaring as null and void and of no effect whatsoever the election of [petitioners] Cecilia Que Yabut, Ma. Corazon Que Garcia, and Eumir Que Camara as Directors of Phil-Ville considering the invalidity and illegality of the holding of the alleged annual meeting of the stockholders on 31 January 2015 at Max’s Restaurant, Gov. Pascual cor M.H. Del Pilar, Tugatog, Malabon City at 5:00 o’clock in the afternoon, the lack of quorum therein, the questionable manner by which it was conducted. including the invalid inclusion in the voting of the disputed 3,142 shares of stock of Phil-Ville, the questionable validation of proxies and the presentation and exercise of voting rights by any alleged proxy or proxies and the representation and exercise of voting rights by any alleged proxy of the stockholders who was/were not personally present at the said meeting and the invalidity of the proclamation of the winners in the said election;

. . . .

After perusing the arguments raised by parties vis-à-vis the judicial affidavits of their respective witnesses, the Court is of the considered view that the reliefs prayed for may not be granted without prejudging the factual and legal issues duly raised by the parties and are still pending before this Court in Civil Case No. CV-940-MN, more particularly, the validity of the 3,142 disputed shares of stock of corporation.","WHEREFORE, the Petition for Review on Certiorari in G.R. No. 242353 is hereby PARTLY GRANTED. Consequently, the Decision dated October 20, 2017 and the Resolution dated October 2, 2018 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 144363 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The case is ordered REMANDED to Branch 74 of the Regional Trial Court, Malabon City, for further proceedings in accordance with this Resolution.

The Motion for Reconsideration in G.R. No. 253530 is DENIED. The Resolution of this Court dated January 20, 2021 is AFFIRMED."
"G.R. No. 266921, January 22, 2024","NATIONAL TRANSMISSION CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. SPOUSES LOUIS MARCO S. MANALO AND ROWENA MARIE T. MANALO, REPRESENTED BY FREDDIE M. ARGUELLES, AND NONYLON D. PEDRAJA AND NONNA D. PEDRAJA, REPRESENTED BY JULIANITO B. MONCAYO, RESPONDENTS.","This case stemmed from a Complaint[6] for Inverse Condemnation under Rule 67 of the Rules of Court, as amended by Republic Act No. 8974[7] and later by Republic Act No. 10752 dated February 24, 2020 (Complaint), filed by respondents against TRANSCO before the RTC. In the said Complaint, respondents prayed, inter alia, that judgment be rendered determining and fixing the fair market value of the lots subject of this case pursuant to Republic Act No. 10752.

The records show that respondents are the owners of parcels of land located in Tanauan City, Batangas. Specifically, spouses Manalo and the Pedrajas own Lot No. 1374-B-2 in Barangay Banjo East and Lot No. 1465-J in Barangay Bagumbayan, respectively.[8] TRANSCO, on the other hand, is a government corporation organized to acquire all the transmission assets of the National Power Corporation (NAPOCOR), which shall assume the electrical transmission function of the NAPOCOR, and have the powers and functions granted by law. Corollary to this, TRANSCO is given the right to exercise the power of eminent domain subject to the requirements of the Constitution and existing laws.[9]

Pursuant to this power, NAPOCOR, the predecessor of TRANSCO, constructed 500-kilovolt (KV) transmission line traversing respondents' properties for the purpose of transmitting electric power from Batangas to Laguna and Metro Manila in 1998. As alleged by respondents, the areas affected by the power transmission facility are the 2,376 square meters of Lot No. 1374-B-2 and 10,534 square meters of Lot No. 1465-J (subject lots), respectively in favor of spouses Manalo and the Pedrajas. According to TRANSCO, no expropriation proceedings were initiated at the time of taking of the subject lots.[10]

On August 3, 2020, TRANSCO filed its Answer (with Special and Affirmative Defenses and Counterclaim), praying that the Complaint be dismissed for lack of merit.[11]

Subsequently, on September 15, 2020, respondents filed a Motion to Require Defendant to Comply with Republic Act No. 10752 (Motion).[12] In their Motion, respondents argued that while the procedural aspect of the inverse condemnation case is governed by Rule 67 of the Rules of Court, the determination of the amount of compensation should be sanctioned by Republic Act No. 10752. Concomitantly, Section 6 of Republic Act No. 10752 dictates that TRANSCO should be ordered to deposit to the RTC the amount equivalent to the Bureau of Internal Revenue's (BIR) current zonal valuation of the subject lots as provisional compensation.[13] Moreover, respondents averred that under Zoning Ordinance No. 2018-12 dated March 12, 2018, both the properties of spouses Manalo and the Pedrajas are classified as residential properties with zonal values at PHP 3,500.00 per square meter and PHP 3,750.00 per square meter, respectively. Hence, respondents prayed that an order be issued directing TRANSCO to deposit as provisional compensation the amounts of PHP 8,316,000.00 to spouses Manalo and PHP 39,502,500.00 to the Pedrajas.[14]

On November 25, 2020, TRANSCO submitted its Comment/Oppositions, where it countered that Republic Act No. 10752 and its provisions on provisional deposit apply only to new projects and not to old or existing transmission lines constructed long before the enactment of the said law. Thus, in the event that the payment of provisional deposit is granted, it should be based on the assessed value of the subject lots as provided under Rule 67 of the Rules of Court.[15]","Assailed in this Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court are the Decision[2] dated December 12, 2022 and the Resolution[3] dated April 4, 2023 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 171202, which affirmed the Order[4] dated January 14, 2021 of the Regional Trial Court of Tanauan City, Batangas, Branch 66 (RTC), which, in turn, granted the Motion to Require Defendant to Comply with Republic Act No. 10752[5] filed by respondents spouses Louis Marco S. Manalo and Rowena Marie T. Manalo, represented by Freddie M. Arguelles (spouses Manalo), and Nonylon D. Pedraja and Nonna D. Pedraja, represented by Julianito L. Moncayo (the Pedrajas; collectively, respondents) against petitioner National Transmission Corporation (TRANSCO).","The Petition lacks merit.

At the outset, it bears stressing that both Rule 67 of the Rules of Court and Republic Act No. 8974 govern expropriation proceedings for national infrastructure projects.[37] Notably, Republic Act No. 8974 was later repealed by Republic Act No. 10752, which was issued on March 7, 2016.

On this score, Rule 67, Section 2 of the Rules of Court allows the expropriating agency's entry into the real property upon deposit of an amount equivalent to the assessed value of the property for purposes of taxation, viz.:

SECTION 2. Entry of plaintiff upon depositing value with authorized government depositary. – Upon the filing of the complaint or at any time thereafter and after due notice to the defendant, the plaintiff shall have the right to take or enter upon the possession of the real property involved if he deposits with the authorized government depositary an amount equivalent to the assessed value of the property for purposes of taxation to be held by such bank subject to the orders of the court. Such deposit shall be in money, unless in lieu thereof the court authorizes the deposit of a certificate of deposit of a government bank of the Republic of the Philippines payable on demand to the authorized government depositary. (Emphasis supplied)

On the other hand, Republic Act No. 8974, enacted on November 7, 2000, requires a deposit of the amount equivalent to 100% of the value of the property based on the current relevant zonal valuation of the BIR before the implementing agency may be ordered to take possession of the property, to wit:

SECTION 4. Guidelines for Expropriation Proceedings. – Whenever it is necessary to acquire real property for the right-of-way, site or location for any national government infrastructure project through expropriation, the appropriate implementing agency shall initiate the expropriation proceedings before the proper court under the following guidelines:

(a) Upon the filing of the complaint, and after due notice to the defendant, the implementing agency shall immediately pay the owner of the property the amount equivalent to the sum of (1) one hundred percent (100%) of the value of the property based on the current relevant zonal valuation of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR); and (2) the value of the improvements and/or structures as determined under Section 7 hereof; (Emphasis supplied)

The guidelines for expropriation proceedings provided under Republic Act No. 8974 were, thereafter, substantially maintained by Republic Act No. 10752. Hence, Section 6(a)(1) of Republic Act No. 10752 reads:

SECTION 6. Guidelines for Expropriation Proceedings. – Whenever it is necessary to acquire real property for the right-of-way site or location for any national government infrastructure through expropriation, the appropriate implementing agency, through the Office of the Solicitor General the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel, or their deputized government or private legal counsel, shall immediately initiate the expropriation proceedings before the proper court under the following guidelines:

(a)
Upon the filing of the complaint or at any time thereafter, and after due notice to the defendant, the implementing agency shall immediately deposit to the court in favor of the owner the amount equivalent to the sum of:




(1)
One hundred percent (100%) of the value of the land based on the current relevant zonal valuation of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) issued not more than three (3) years prior to the filing of the expropriation complaint subject to subparagraph (c) of this section; (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)
Relatedly, Felisa made a comparison of the foregoing rules in this wise:

The general rule is that upon the filing of the expropriation complaint, the plaintiff has the right to take or enter into possession of the real property involved if he deposits with the authorized government depositary an amount equivalent to the assessed value of the property. An exception to this procedure is provided by [Republic Act No.] 8974 with respect to national government projects, which requires the payment of 100% of the zonal value of the property to be expropriated as the provisional value. ...

Section 2, Rule 67 of the Rules of Court requires the expropriator to deposit the amount equivalent to the assessed value of the property to be expropriated prior to entry. The assessed value of a real property constitutes a mere percentage of its fair market value based on the assessment levels fixed under the pertinent ordinance passed by the local government where the property is located. In contrast, [Republic Act No.] 8974 requires the payment of the amount equivalent to 100% of the current zonal value of the property which is usually a higher amount.[38]

It is worthy to note, at this point, that Felisa has a stark similarity with the facts of this case. There, Felisa Agricultural Corporation initiated inverse condemnation proceedings against TRANSCO which had long entered its property and constructed transmission towers and lines. At the time the said initiatory pleading was filed, Republic Act No. 8974 was already in effect; hence, the Court declared that said law should apply in the determination of the provisional value of the expropriated property.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DENIED. The Decision dated December 12, 2022 and the Resolution dated April 4, 2023 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 171202 are AFFIRMED."
" G.R. No. 253450, January 22, 2024","LANI NAYVE-PUA, PETITIONER, VS. UNION BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","Lani filed a Complaint for annulment of the REM, foreclosure mortgage, and certificate of sale before the RTC against International Exchange Bank (now Union Bank) and Spouses Cromwell and Catherine Uy (Spouses Uy).[6]

Lani alleged that she and Stephen Pua (Stephen) began living together as husband and wife in December 1975. During their cohabitation, all four of their children were born: (1) Steven Pua born in November 1976; (2) Brian Pua born in November 1978; (3) Mark Pua born in January 1981; and (4) Kristine Pua born in April 1982. In March 1978, Lani and Stephen bought a property inside a subdivision in Diliman, Quezon City covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. RT-117283 (275199).[7] Lani claimed that they acquired the property through their joint efforts. However, the title was registered under the name of Stephen Pua, ""of legal age, Filipino, single[.]""[8] In July 1983, Lani and Stephen got married. The house constructed on the property allegedly became their family home.[9]

In January 2004, Lani learned that the property was mortgaged to and foreclosed by Union Bank, which notified them that the period to redeem the property was set to expire by February 2004. Upon verification, Lani discovered that Spouses Uy mortgaged their family home in favor of Union Bank. Spouses Uy used it as collateral for their loan by way of credit accommodation.[10] This arrangement happened because Cromwell Uy is the son of Stephen's brother, George Pua.[11]

When Spouses Uy failed to pay their loan, Union Bank foreclosed the mortgage. The property was sold at a public auction. Later, Lani learned that in executing the loan agreement and mortgage, Spouses Uy submitted a Special Power of Attorney[12] (SPA) indicating that Lani and Stephen granted them the authority to mortgage the property. However, Lani denied affixing her name and signature on the SPA, claiming forgery. She maintained that she did not consent to the mortgage.[13]

On the other hand, Union Bank averred that since Lani and Stephen were married on July 20, 1983, their property regime under the Civil Code was conjugal partnership of gains. The property was Stephen's exclusive property because it was acquired before their marriage, and the title covering the property indicates that the registered owner is ""STEPHEN PUA, of legal age, Filipino, single[.]"" Consequently, Lani has no cause of action against it.[14]

Union Bank also stressed that the duly notarized SPA, which Spouses Uy presented, bore both signatures of Lani and Stephen. The REM and the SPA were annotated at the back of the title of the property, including Spouses Uy's outstanding loan of PHP 9,259,277.96. Since Spouses Uy reneged on their payments, Union Bank foreclosed the REM. Thereafter, the property was sold in a public auction. On February 10, 2003, a certificate of sale was issued to Union Bank as the highest bidder. Union Bank informed Stephen that he had until February 10, 2004 to redeem the property. But a day before the redemption period expired, Lani filed a complaint against Union Bank and Spouses Uy, seeking to annul the mortgage and the foreclosure proceedings.[15]

On August 30, 2016, the RTC dismissed the complaint. It ruled that Lani failed to prove that she was a co-owner.[16] The RTC reasoned that since Lani and Stephen were married in 1983 (or before the effectivity of the Family Code), their property regime, as governed by the Civil Code, is conjugal partnership of gains. Under this type of property relation, all properties acquired during the marriage shall be part of the conjugal fund and will be enjoyed by both spouses. They will, however, continue to enjoy their respective ownership rights over their separate properties. Since the property involved was acquired before their marriage, and the certificate of title indicates that it is owned by ""STEPHEN PUA, of legal age, Filipino, single,"" there is a strong presumption that Stephen is its exclusive owner. Thus, Lani's signature in the SPA is unnecessary for the validity of the mortgage contract.[17]

Lani disagreed and appealed to the CA. She invoked Article 147[18] of the Family Code. She insisted that she and Stephen are co-owners of the property because it was acquired during their cohabitation as husband and wife and through their joint efforts.[19] To support her claim, Lani presented their marriage contract[20] to prove that she and Stephen cohabited and were exempted from securing a marriage license. Lani further presented the birth certificates[21] of her children, who were all born before their marriage in 1983.

On December 20, 2019, the CA affirmed the findings of the RTC. It ruled that the presumption under Article 147 of the Family Code is only prima facie and cannot prevail over a valid title registered under the Torrens system. The CA also ruled that Lani failed to establish that she and Stephen lived exclusively as husband and wife, without the benefit of marriage. The CA found that Stephen's address in the Deed of Sale, and his children's birth certificates, all indicate that Stephen is a resident of Cauayan, Isabela, where he runs his business of operating a movie house. Lani did not show that she ""actually"" contributed to purchase the property,[22] thus:

Aside from the bare allegations of the appellant Lani, the appellant Lani did not present any evidence that: she (the appellant Lani) and Stephen lived exclusively as husband and wife, without the benefit of marriage, and that each one of them was not incapacitated to marry; and that the appellant Lani had made an actual contribution to purchase the Subject Property. Further, the appellant Lani's claim of having administered the Subject Property was unsubstantiated.

Clearly, the appellant Lani did not prove that she (the appellant Lani) was a co-owner of the Subject Property. Thus, the appellant Lani had no cause of action against the appellees.

We DISMISS the appeal.","If a couple's property regime is conjugal partnership of gains and, before getting married, they cohabited as husband and wife without any legal impediment to marry, a property bought with the exclusive money of one party before the marriage and brought into the marriage will belong only to that party, as long as there is no proof that the other party contributed in any manner to the property's acquisition.
We resolve this Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assailing the Decision[2] dated December 20, 2019 and the Resolution[3] dated September 2, 2020 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 108917.

The assailed issuances affirmed the findings of the Decision[4] dated August 30, 2016 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 216 (RTC) in Civil Case No. Q-04-51749, which dismissed Lani Nayve-Pua's (Lani) complaint and upheld the validity of the real estate mortgage[5] (REM) in favor of Union Bank of the Philippines (Union Bank).","We deny the Petition.

At the outset, we have consistently declared that factual findings of the trial court, when adopted and confirmed by the CA, are binding and conclusive upon this Court. We are not triers of facts. It is not this Court's function to analyze or weigh evidence all over again.[35] While these rules do admit exceptions, Lani failed to prove any of the established exceptions that would compel us to go over and rule on the factual evidence. As such, this Court will refrain from probing the factual conclusions, especially that the questioned findings are supported by sufficient evidence.[36]

Lani failed to prove that the mortgaged property is conjugal. Significantly, Stephen acquired the property before he married Lani
The mortgaged property was acquired in 1978, under the name of ""STEPHEN PUA, of legal age, Filipino, single,"" when Lani and Stephen were cohabiting without the benefit of marriage. When Lani and Stephen married on July 1983, the Civil Code[37] provides that their property relations shall be governed by the rules on conjugal partnership of gains, absent any proof showing that the spouses entered into a marriage settlement. Under this property arrangement, all property of the conjugal partnership of gains is owned in common by the husband and wife.[38]

In Malabanan v. Malabanan, Jr.,[39] we explained that property acquired during the marriage is presumed to be conjugal,[40] and it is unnecessary to prove that the money used to purchase a property came from the conjugal fund. What must be established is that the property was acquired during the marriage.[41] This presumption was reiterated in Alexander v. Escalona,[42] wherein we held that this presumption may only be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence. Notably, the presumption will still apply even if the property is under the name of only one spouse.[43] Hence, when the property is acquired during the marriage, the burden of proof is upon the spouse claiming the property's exclusivity to establish it.[44]

Here, however, Lani admitted that the property was acquired before her marriage to Stephen in 1983. Consequently, the presumption that the property is conjugal shall not apply, especially since the property is under Stephen's name alone. Lani bears a heavier onus to prove that the property is indeed conjugal.

Under the Civil Code, the following are considered as paraphernal or exclusive property of each spouse in a conjugal partnership of gains:

Article 148. The following shall be the exclusive property of each spouse:

(1)
That which is brought to the marriage as his or her own;
 	 
(2)
That which each acquires, during the marriage, by lucrative title;
 	 
(3)
That which is acquired by right of redemption or by exchange with other property belonging to only one of the spouses;
 	 
(4)
That which is purchased with exclusive money of the wife or of the husband. (Emphasis supplied)
This was echoed by the Family Code, which applies suppletorily to the provisions of the Civil Code concerning the conjugal partnership of gains, viz.:

Article 109. The following shall be the exclusive property of each spouse:

(1)
That which is brought to the marriage as his or her own;
 	 
(2)
That which each acquires during the marriage by gratuitous title;
 	 
(3)
That which is acquired by right of redemption, by barter or by exchange with property belonging to only one of the spouses; and
 	 
(4)
That which is purchased with exclusive money of the wife or of the husband.
Under the conjugal partnership of gains, the mortgaged property is Stephen's exclusive property, which was brought into their marriage as his own. Yet under Article 158 of the Civil Code, a paraphernal or separate property could turn into conjugal when it was brought into the marriage without awaiting reimbursement before or at the liquidation of the partnership, upon the construction of the building on it at the expense of the partnership, viz.:
","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DENIED. The Decision dated December 20, 2019 and the Resolution dated September 2, 2020 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 108917 are AFFIRMED."
"G.R. No. 253448, January 22, 2024","MARK FRANKLIN A. LIM II, PETITIONER, VS. FIELD INVESTIGATION BUREAU, OFFICE OF THE DEPUTY OMBUDSMAN FOR THE MILITARY AND OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICES [MOLEO], RESPONDENT.","At the time that the complaint was filed against him by the OMB-MOLEO's Field Investigation Bureau (FIB), Lim was Head of the Coast Guard Special Service Office (CGSSO) for the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG). According to the FIB, sometime in 2014, the PCG released several Special Cash Advances (SCA) to its 21 Special Disbursing Officers (SDO), including Lim. Of the total amount released, PHP 500,000.00 was released to Lim for the procurement of office supplies and information technology (IT) equipment.[6]

Subsequently, the Commission on Audit (COA) issued its Audit Observation Memorandum No. (AOM) PCG-2015-018[7] dated April 15, 2015. The COA noted that the cash advances lacked the following: (1) the requisite office orders duly designating the SDOs as such; (2) the addresses of some of the dealers and suppliers were not indicated in the sales invoices, cash invoices, and official receipts; (3) and that when contacted by the COA, some of these dealers and suppliers denied issuing the invoices and receipts.[8]

Based on AOM PCG-2015-018, the FIB criminally charged Lim and the other SDOs, as well as the Commandant, Deputy Chief for Comptrollership, Internal Auditor, and Accounting Head of the PCG with malversation of public funds through falsification under Article 217 of the Revised Penal Code and violation of Section 3(e)[9] of Republic Act No. 3019,[10] in relation with Republic Act No. 9184.[11] They were also administratively charged with serious dishonesty, grave misconduct, and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service. With regard to Lim, the FIB alleged that as with all the other SDOs, the disbursement of PHP 500,000.00 to him was not supported by any office order duly designating him as an SDO. Further, the procurement for which the amount was disbursed did not go through public bidding, with no justification for resorting to alternative methods of procurement.[12]

For his defense, Lim countered that he was duly designated as the SDO of the Special Service Office (SSO) through Special Order No. 48 dated March 18, 2013,[13] with an authorization to disburse a maximum amount of PHP 500,000.00. Of that amount, he claimed that only PHP 77,166.25 was found by the COA to be supported by ""questionable receipts,"" and that he has since settled that amount. He also justified the resort to emergency procurement by claiming that it was done amidst the relief operations after the onslaught of Typhoon Yolanda.[14] Further, the criminal cases filed against him and the other PCG officials in relation to these disbursements were dismissed through a Consolidated Resolution[15] issued by the Ombudsman.","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assailing the Decision[2] dated September 26, 2019 and the Resolution[3] dated September 14, 2020 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 153962, which affirmed the Consolidated Decision[4] dated July 19, 2017 and the Consolidated Order[5] dated November 6, 2017 of the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for the Military and Other Law Enforcement Offices (OMB-MOLEO) in OMB-P-A-16-0545. The OMB-MOLEO found petitioner Mark Franklin A. Lim II (Lim) guilty of serious dishonesty, grave misconduct, and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service, and accordingly, imposed upon him the penalty of dismissal from service.","The petition is partly meritorious.

As will be explained here, the Court affirms with modification the finding of administrative liability against Lim.

Generally, only questions of law are permitted in petitions for review on certiorari filed under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, as this Court is not a trier of facts.[31] Further, owing to the special knowledge and expertise of the Ombudsman of matters within their jurisdiction, their factual findings, when supported by substantial evidence, are accorded great respect, if not finality.[32]

Nevertheless, the rule preventing factual review admits numerous exceptions, such as when there is a misapprehension of the facts on the part of the Ombudsman or the CA.[33] Here, Lim is charged with two acts from which the offenses of serious dishonesty, grave misconduct, and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service are derived: first, that he acted as an SDO and disbursed the amount of PHP 500,000.00 without authority; and second, that he allowed the procurement of office supplies and IT equipment without public bidding as required by Republic Act No. 9184.

On the first act, the Court finds that the Ombudsman, as affirmed by the CA, incorrectly found that Lim was not authorized nor duly designated as the SDO. On the contrary, Special Order No. 48 is the written authority for Lim to act as SDO. The order states in part:","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is PARTLY GRANTED. The Decision dated September 26, 2019 and the Resolution dated September 14, 2020 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 153962 are hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. Petitioner Mark Franklin A. Lim II is found GUILTY of the administrative offense of simple misconduct. He is meted with the penalty of SUSPENSION for a period of one month and one day. In case suspension may no longer be enforced, he is meted a FINE in the amount equivalent to his salary for the aforesaid period."
"G.R. No. 228980, January 22, 2024","MARVIN VILLANUEVA Y IRODISTAN, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","This case stemmed from an Information[7] filed before the RTC, charging Villanueva with the said crime, the accusatory portion of which reads:
The undersigned Asst. State Prosecutor accuses MARVIN VILLANUEVA y IRODISTAN, of the crime of violation of Sec. 5 (b), RA 7610, committed as follows:

That on or about the 25th day of November, 2010, in the City of xxxxxxxxxxx, Philippines[,] within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with lewd design, did, then and there, willfully, unlawfully[,] and feloniously pull up the skirt and touch the buttocks of [AAA],[8] a lascivious conduct constituting sexual abuse.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[9] (Emphasis in the original)
Upon arraignment, Villanueva pleaded not guilty to the crime charged. Thereafter, trial on the merits ensued.[10]

The prosecution presented the following witnesses to establish the guilt of Villanueva: (a) the private complainant, AAA; (b) the private complainant's friend, BBB; (c) Traffic Enforcer Ronald Tolentino (Enforcer Tolentino); and (d) Police Officer III Wirrel P. Jualo (PO3 Jualo) and Police Officer I Anthony D. Antoyne (PO1 Antoyne).[11]

The prosecution alleged that at around 4:00 p.m. of November 25, 2010, AAA—who was then 15 years old, being born on December 31, 1994, as evidenced by her Certificate of Live Birth,[12] together with her friend, BBB, and BBB's 11-year-old sister, CCC, were on their way home from school. They were ascending the nonworking escalator of the overpass in xxxxxxxx, xxxxxxxxx, when suddenly, Villanueva stood behind AAA. BBB noticed Villanueva and told AAA to hurry. AAA then felt her skirt being lifted and her buttocks being touched by the person behind her. When AAA looked behind her, she saw Villanueva holding a mirror below her skirt. She confronted Villanueva, but the latter hurriedly left and ran towards the highway. AAA was shocked. BBB then shouted ""May manghihipo! Tulong, tulong! Magnanakaw!” BBB was of the notion that Villanueva took AAA's cellphone. The bystanders tried to chase Villanueva upon hearing BBB's call for help. Enforcer Tolentino heard the commotion and apprehended Villanueva. Later, Villanueva was turned over to PO3 Jualo and PO1 Antoyne, who brought him to the police station for further investigation.[13]

In defense, Villanueva denied the allegation against him and offered a different version of the events. He averred that on the date of the incident, his mother directed him to buy pancit. Villanueva boarded a tricycle and got off in xxxxxxxxxxx, xxxxxxxxxxx. At the foot of the nonworking escalator in xxxxxxxxxxx overpass, Villanueva saw a group of female students giving each other beso-beso (kiss on the cheeks). He climbed the escalator while holding his two cellular phones and when he was about two steps behind from AAA, he tried to overtake the latter from her left side. At this point, he heard someone shouting ""Snatcher, snatcher!"" Villanueva then put his two cellphones inside his pockets and hurriedly ran down the escalator for fear that the bystanders would mob him. He continued to run while the bystanders were chasing him. Villanueva asked Enforcer Tolentino for help, but the bystanders began to maul him. Enforcer Tolentino handcuffed him and requested for police assistance. Later, PO3 Jualo and PO1 Antoyne arrived and brought him to the police station.[14]","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the Decision[2] dated October 28, 2016 and the Resolution[3] dated January 4, 2017 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR No. 35988, which affirmed with modification the Decision[4] dated August 28, 2013 of xxxxxxxxxxx Regional Trial Court, xxxxxxxxxxx (RTC) in Crim. Case No. 10-0985, finding petitioner Marvin Villanueva y Irodistan (Villanueva) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Article III, Section 5(b)[5] of Republic Act (RA) No. 7610.[6","The Petition has no merit.

Article III, Section 5(b) of RA No. 7610, provides:
Section 5. Child Prostitution and Other Sexual Abuse. – Children, whether male or female, who for money, profit, or any other consideration or due to the coercion or influence of any adult, syndicate or group, indulge in sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct, are deemed to be children exploited in prostitution and other sexual abuse.

The penalty of reclusion temporal in its medium period to reclusion perpetua shall be imposed upon the following:

. . . .

(b) Those who commit the act of sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct with a child exploited in prostitution or subject to other sexual abuse; Provided, That when the victims is under twelve (12) years of age, the perpetrators shall be prosecuted under Article 335, paragraph 3, for rape and Article 336 of Act No. 3815, as amended, the Revised Penal Code, for rape or lascivious conduct, as the case may be: Provided, That the penalty for lascivious conduct when the victim is under twelve (12) years of age shall be reclusion temporal in its medium period;

. . . .
The elements of sexual abuse under the said provision are as follows: (a) the accused commits the act of sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct; (b) the said act is performed with a child exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse; and (c) the child, whether male or female, is below 18 years of age.[34]

Relatedly, lascivious conduct is defined in Section 2(h) of the Implementing Rules and Regulations[35] (IRR) of RA No. 7610 as ""the intentional touching, either directly or through clothing, of the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks, or the introduction of any object into the genitalia, anus or mouth, of any person, whether of the same or opposite sex, with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person, bestiality, masturbation, lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of a person.""

In People v. Tulagan,[36] the Court, through Associate Justice Diosdado M. Peralta, held that the term ""other sexual abuse"" is a broad term that includes all other acts of sexual abuse other than prostitution, to wit:
The term ""other sexual abuse,"" on the other hand, is construed in relation to the definitions of ""child abuse"" under Section 3, Article I of R.A. No. 7610 and ""sexual abuse"" under Section 2(g) of the Rules and Regulations on the Reporting and Investigation of Child Abuse Cases. In the former provision, ""child abuse"" refers to the maltreatment, whether habitual or not, of the child which includes sexual abuse, among other matters. In the latter provision, ""sexual abuse"" includes the employment, use, persuasion, inducement, enticement or coercion of a child to engage in, or assist another person to engage in, sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct or the molestation, prostitution, or incest with children. Thus, the term ""other sexual abuse"" is broad enough to include all other acts of sexual abuse other than prostitution. Accordingly, a single act of lascivious conduct is punished under Section 5(b), Article III, when the victim is 12 years old and below 18, or 18 or older under special circumstances.[37] (Emphasis supplied)
Given the foregoing legal parameters, the Court finds that the prosecution has duly proven all the elements of lascivious conduct punishable under Article III, Section 5(b) of RA No. 7610. Notably, AAA's minority was sufficiently established with the presentation of her Certificate of Live Birth. The RTC, as sustained by the CA, also found her testimony clear, candid, and categorical when she relayed that Villanueva lifted her skirt and touched her buttocks. Accordingly, the overt act of Villanueva is tantamount to a lascivious conduct.

Moreover, Villanueva's defense that it was impossible for him to commit the alleged act, considering that he was holding his two cellphones in both hands at a crowded place in broad daylight, was not only unsubstantiated, but was also successfully belied by AAA and the other witnesses. AAA testified that she felt her skirt being lifted and her buttocks being touched by the person behind her. Moreover, BBB testified that Villanueva in fact approached AAA from behind and even warned the latter to hurry. The Court has repeatedly held that when the offended parties are young and immature girls, as in this case, courts are inclined to lend credence to their version of what transpired, considering not only their relative vulnerability, but also the shame and embarrassment to which they would be exposed if the matter about which they testified were not true.[38]

Relevantly, denial is inherently a weak defense, which cannot outweigh positive testimony. A categorical statement that has the earmarks of truth prevails over a bare denial, which can easily be fabricated and is inherently unreliable.[39] Denial, if unsubstantiated by clear and convincing evidence, is a self-serving assertion that deserves no weight in law,[40] as in this case. Hence, Villanueva's denial cannot prevail over the positive testimony of the private complainant.","
ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DENIED. The Decision dated October 28, 2016 and the Resolution dated January 4, 2017 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 35988 are hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. Petitioner Marvin Villanueva y Irodistan is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of lascivious conduct under Article III, Section 5(b) of Republic Act No. 7610. He is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of imprisonment for an indeterminate period of 14 years and eight months of reclusion temporal, as minimum, to 20 years of reclusion temporal, as maximum, and to pay a fine in the amount of PHP 15,000.00. Moreover, he is ordered to pay private complainant AAA the amounts of PHP 50,000.00 as civil indemnity, PHP 50,000.00 as moral damages, and PHP 50,000.00 as exemplary damages. All monetary awards shall earn legal interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of finality of this Decision until full payment.

Pursuant to Article 5 of the Revised Penal Code, the Court TRANSMITS the case to the Chief Executive, through the Department of Justice, for study and consideration of the mitigation of the penalty of petitioner Marvin Villanueva y Irodistan."
