"G.R. No. 270934, October 30, 2024","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. JOEMARIE UBANON Y MAN-AN ALIAS ""JOMARE FRANCESCO"" ALIAS ""ALEX"" [D-BJMP-V], ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","Joemarie and Amirah Macadatar (Amirah) were charged with qualified trafficking in persons under the following information:
[Criminal Case No. 25601-14val]

On April 13, 2014 at about 12:00 noon in front of xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx, Bukidnon, Philippines, within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, JOEMARIE UBANON Y MAN-AN Alias JOEMARIE FRANCESCO alias Alex and AMIRAH MACADATAR Alias OMERA, conspiring, confederating and mutually helping one another, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and criminally recruit, transport, transfer, harbor and provide [c]omplainants [AAA270934], 14 years old, [BBB270934] 14 years old and [CCC270934], 15 years old, under the pretext of domestic employment for the purpose of forced labor, slavery or involuntary servitude to the damage and prejudice of Complainants in such amount as maybe allowed by law.

Contrary to and in violation of Section 4(a), [Republic Act No.] 9208 in relation to Section 6(a) and Section 10(c), [Republic Act No.] 9208.[2]
When arraigned, Joemarie pleaded ""not guilty."" Trial then ensued.

The prosecution offered as evidence the birth certificates and testimonies[3] of private complainants AAA270934, BBB270934, and CCC270934.[4]

Private complainants testified that on April 14, 2014, they were watching a Manny Pacquiao fight at xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx. While taking a break in a motorela, a person who introduced himself as Joemarie, approached them and offered them work as onion peelers in xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx, with a monthly wage of PHP 2,500.00. AAA270934 expressed her desire to work and told Joemarie that they would go home first to ask permission from their parents. However, Joemarie insisted that the employer was already waiting for them. Joemarie instructed AAA270934's brother to inform their parents about their employment, then brought private complainants to xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.[5]

Joemarie accompanied private complainants to the house of Amirah's daughter, DDD.[6] He told them to watch television while waiting for DDD. Soon after, DDD arrived. Joemarie turned up the television volume and had a private conversation with DDD. Then, they all took a motorela to the bus terminal at xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx. At the terminal, Joemarie instructed private complainants to board the bus with DDD. After reaching xxxxxxxxxxxxxx, private complainants wanted to get off the bus but DDD stopped them. Private complainants and DDD arrived at Iligan City and took a van to Marawi City. By the time the van reached Marawi City, private complainants were already afraid and hungry. They had dinner and rested at Amirah's house. The next day, private complainants were brought to different homes.[7]

AAA270934 was taken to Talyugon, Lanao del Sur where she worked as a domestic helper to a Maranao family. While AAA270934 was fetching water at a common faucet, she met BBB270934 and discovered that the latter also performed domestic work. After two weeks, AAA270934 tearfully told her employer that she was homesick. AAA270934's employer comforted her and assured her that she would contact Amirah, AAA270934 then learned from her employer that her mother already received PHP 2,000.00 and that she would be given an additional PHP 2,000.000 before going home. However, AAA270934 did not receive the money. AAA270934 was eventually reunited with BBB270934 and CCC270934.[8]

BBB270934 was also brought to Talyugon, Lanao del Sur where she worked as a domestic helper to a Maranao family for two weeks. She was not paid for her service. Meanwhile, CCC270934 was brought to Iligan City, where she worked as a house helper. Like AAA270934 and BBB270934, CCC270934 was not paid for her labor.[9]

Amirah subsequently took private complainants to xxxxxxxxxxx and turned them over to AAA270934's father at the xxxxxxxxxxx Police Station. She then returned to Marawi City.[10]

Joemarie denied the accusations. He asserted that Amirah used to be his wife's employer. Joemarie claimed that on April 13, 2014, at 12:00 p.m., he was at the jeepney terminal bound for San Fernando, Bukidnon. There, three girls and a boy approached him and asked if he knew someone who could provide them with work. Joemarie referred them to Amirah and took them to her house. Before leaving, Joemarie reminded private complainants to ask permission from their parents. He maintained that he just wanted to help private complainants, who are his fellow indigenous people.[11]

On June 24, 2021, the Regional Trial Court (RTC) convicted Joemarie for qualified trafficking in persons:[12]
WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court finds Joemarie Ubanon alias Jomarie Francisco alias Alex guilty beyond reasonable doubt for Qualified Trafficking and sentences him to life imprisonment and pay a fine of [PHP 2,000,000.00] without eligibility for parole. He is also directed to pay [AAA270934], [BBB270934] and [CCC270934] the sum of [PHP] 200,000.00 as moral damages and [PHP] 100,000.00 as exemplary damages with interest at 6% per annum until full payment.

Joemarie Ubanon alias Jomarie Francisco alias Alex shall serve sentence at Davao Penal Farm and Prison, Dujali, Davao del Norte. His preventive suspension at BJMP xxxxxxxxxxx is fully credited in the service of his sentence.

The charge against Amirah Macadatar alias Omera is archived pending her arrest. Let alias warrant of arrest issue against her.

SO ORDERED.[13]
The RTC found all the elements of trafficking in persons present. Through deception and moral ascendancy, Joemarie recruited private complainants to work in a distant place as house helpers without their consent and without receiving compensation for their labor.[14]

Joemarie elevated the case to the CA.[15] Joemarie lamented that the prosecution failed to prove his involvement in the crime. Specifically, there was insufficient evidence to show that he had taken part in transporting the victims to Marawi City for forced labor.[16]

In its Brief, the People of the Philippines, through the Office of the Solicitor General, submitted that Joemarie's false offer of employment, refusal to let the victims seek permission from their parents, and instruction to accompany Amirah's daughter to Marawi City, showed a unity of action and purpose with Amirah to recruit and transport the victims as house helpers and subject them to forced labor.[17]

On August 25, 2023, the CA affirmed Joemarie's conviction for qualified trafficking in persons but deleted the phrase ""without eligibility for parole"", thus:[18]
WHEREFORE, the Appeal is DENIED. The Judgment of the Regional Trial Court, 10th Judicial Region, Branch xxxxxxxxxxx, Bukidnon, dated 24 June 2021, in Criminal Case No. 25601-14val, is hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION that the phrase ""without eligibility for parole"" in the dispositive portion is DELETED.

SO ORDERED.[19] (Emphasis in the original)
Hence, this recourse.[20] Joemarie now challenges his conviction by reiterating that the prosecution failed to establish his participation in recruiting and transporting the victims to Marawi City for forced labor.[21]","The present appeal assails the August 25, 2023 Decision[1] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 03063-MIN which affirmed the conviction of Joemarie Ubanon y Man-an alias ""Jomare Francesco"" alias ""Alex"" (Joemarie) for qualified trafficking in persons under Section 4, in relation to Section 6(a) and Section 10(c) of Republic Act No. 9208, as amended by Republic Act No. 10364.","The appeal lacks merit.

In criminal cases, an appeal throws the entire case wide open for review and the reviewing tribunal can correct errors, though unassigned in the appealed judgment, or even reverse the trial court's decision based on grounds other than those that the parties raised as errors. The appeal confers the appellate court full jurisdiction over the case and renders such court competent to examine records, revise the judgment appealed from, increase the penalty, and cite the proper provision of the penal law.[22]

Guided by these precepts, the Court will now determine whether the CA and the RTC correctly found the accused-appellant Joemarie Ubanon y Man-an guilty, including the appropriate penalty and damages.

Accused-appellant is guilty of qualified trafficking in persons

Section 3(a) of Republic Act No. 9208, as amended, defines ""trafficking in persons"" as:
(a) Trafficking in Persons — refers to the recruitment, transportation, transfer or harboring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders by means of threat or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction. fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the persons, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person for the purpose of exploitation which includes at a minimum, the exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs.
The elements of trafficking in persons, which consist of the acts performed, the means employed, and the purpose of the accused, are as follows: (1) The act of recruitment, transportation, transfer or harbouring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders; (2) the means used, which include threat or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the person, or the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another; and (3) the purpose of trafficking being for exploitation which includes exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs.[23]

Section 3(d) of Republic Act No. 9208 defines the term ""forced labor and slavery"" as ""the extraction of work or services from any person by means of enticement, violence, intimidation or threat, use of force or coercion, including deprivation of freedom, abuse of authority or moral ascendancy, debt-bondage or deception.""[24]

Trafficking is qualified when the trafficked person is a child.[25] Section 3(6) of Republic Act No. 9208, as amended, defines ""child"" as ""a person below 18 years of age or one who is over 18 but is unable to fully take care of or protect [themself] from abuse, neglect, cruelty, exploitation, or discrimination because of a physical or mental disability or condition."" The crime is also qualified if committed on a large scale or against three or more persons, individually or as a group.[26]

The prosecution established all these elements beyond reasonable doubt. AAA270934, BBB270934, and CCC270934 positively testified that Accused­-appellant convinced them to work as onion peelers in a nearby town. He introduced the victims to DDD and accompanied them to the bus terminal. He directed the victims to board the bus with DDD, who subsequently brought them to Amirah in Marawi City. There, private complainants were deployed to work as domestic helpers without compensation.[27] The three victims were all minors under Section 3(b) of Republic Act No. 9208, as proven by their birth certificates. Accused-appellant took advantage of the victims' vulnerability as minors and their eagerness to earn money. CCC270934 testified:
Q:
[CCC270934], do you know Joemarie Ubanon?
A:
No.
....


Q:
When he talked to you whether you want to work as onion peeler, you agreed, am I correct?
A:
Yes, because Joemarie said that ______________ and ______________ [sic] were there.


Q:
You agreed because you yourselves wanted to work?
A:
Yes, because I know ______________ [sic], Ma'am.
....


Q:
You went with him because you wanted to work, am I correct?
A:
Yes.[28]
Accused-appellant inveighed that he simply accompanied AAA270934, BBB270934, and CCC270934 to DDD's house. There is no direct evidence that he participated in transporting the victims to Marawi City to render forced labor.

We disagree.","ACCORDINGLY, the appeal is DENIED. The Decision dated August 25, 2023 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 03063-MIN is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION.

He is ORDERED to pay a fine of PHP 2,000,000.00, and is ORDERED to pay moral damages of PHP 500,000.00 and exemplary damages of PHP 100,000.00 to each of the minor victim, AAA270934, BBB270934, and CCC270934. The damages awarded shall earn interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of finality of this Decision until full payment."

(b) Child — refers to a person below eighteen (18) years of age or one who is over eighteen (18) but is unable to fully take care of or protect himself/herself from abuse, neglect, cruelty, exploitation, or discrimination because of a physical or mental disability or condition.
Meanwhile, Section 4 of Republic Act No. 9208, as amended, enumerates the acts that constitute trafficking in persons, thus:
SECTION 4. Acts of Trafficking in Persons. — It shall be unlawful for any person, natural or juridical, to commit any of the following acts:

HEIRS OF BURGOS MALAYA, REPRESENTED BY CAESAR SAUL MALAYA, PURIFICACION MALAYA, GINA M. MERANO, CHEREMIE MERANO, AND REGIE MALAYA, RESPONDENTS.","In 1952, Leodegario Musico (Musico) served as caretaker of a cocoland owned by Domingo Gutierrez (Gutierrez) in Romblon, Romblon. When Gutierrez died, his daughter, Araceli Gutierrez-Orola (Orola), took over the management of their property.[5]

Sometime later, Musico moved to Manila to work as a foreperson for Orola's husband. Musico's daughter Florsita and her husband, Ulderico Rodeo (the Rodeo spouses), continued to take care of Gutierrez's land. When Orola died, Gutierrez's grandson, Burgos Malaya (Burgos), was appointed as administrator of the estate.[6]

Upon Burgos's death, his heirs, represented by Reynaldo M. Malaya, entered into a Kasunduan[7] with the Rodeo spouses. It allowed the Rodeo Spouses to reside in the property for free while taking care of the land.[8]

In 2009, one of Burgos's children, Ceasar Saul Malaya, allegedly ordered the Rodeo spouses to vacate the property. He also asked his relatives to harvest the coconuts without the consent of Florsita or Ulderico.[9]

As such, the Rodeo spouses filed a Complaint[10] before the Office of the Provincial Adjudicator, claiming they were bona fide tenants of the property, and thus, entitled to the security of tenure.[11]

The Complaint filed was decided by the Office of the Regional Adjudicator. In its Decision,[12] the Office of the Regional Adjudicator dismissed the Complaint for lack of merit.[13] It found that the Rodeo spouses failed to establish all the elements of a tenancy relationship, particularly the requisite that there be sharing of harvests of the property. It also noted that the Rodeo spouses filed the case not against the landowner, but only against the heirs of Burgos, who used to be the administrator of the property.[14] Moreover, the Rodeo spouses could not state the ratio of the sharing of harvests between them and the heirs of Burgos.[15]

On appeal by the Rodeo spouses,[16] the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board issued a Decision[17] on January 29, 2019, affirming the ruling. It likewise held that the Rodeo spouses failed to establish all the elements of a tenancy relationship. Aside from the missing element of sharing of harvest, it also found lacking the element of consent by the landowner. It ruled that the Rodeo spouses' cultivation was only germane to fulfilling their obligations as caretakers of the land. Absent consent and sharing of harvests, the Rodeo spouses were only cultivators of the property.[18]

The Board found that Musico himself was not a tenant; as such, the Rodeo spouses cannot succeed as tenants.[19] It also ruled that they cannot claim that they are tenants in their own right since they could not produce any piece of evidence that there was sharing of harvests.[20]

In its September 29, 2021 Decision,[21] the Court of Appeals denied the Petition for Review filed by the Rodeo spouses. Again, it found that they failed to establish the elements of consent and sharing of harvests and that they were not installed as tenants under the Kasunduan.[22]

In a September 19, 2022 Resolution,[23] the Court of Appeals denied the Rodeo spouses' Motion for Partial Reconsideration.[24]

Thus, the Rodeo spouses filed their Petition[25] before this Court against the heirs of Burgos. They argue that there is a written implied tenancy between the parties in the Kasunduan, and that they had cultivated the land and shared the harvest with respondents.[26]

In their Comment,[27] respondents counter that there is no agricultural leasehold relationship.[28] They add that the lower tribunals have already settled the issues raised by petitioners.[29]

This Court resolves whether the Court of Appeals erred in denying the Petition for Review on the ground that there is no tenancy relationship between the parties.

We deny the Petition.","Cultivating the land of another does not automatically mean that an agricultural leasehold relation arises between the tiller and the landowner. The party claiming to be an agricultural lessee must show that the elements of an agricultural leasehold are present to be afforded protection under our agrarian laws.

This Court resolves the Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] assailing the Decision[2] and Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board rulings[4] finding that there is no agricultural leasehold relation between the parties.","This Court resolves whether the Court of Appeals erred in denying the Petition for Review on the ground that there is no tenancy relationship between the parties.

I

A look at the long history of agrarian laws in our country, and how they evolved from share tenancy to agricultural leasehold, is in order.

Before the Spanish colonial period, land ownership in the Philippines was through a communal system. The produce harvested from the land were shared equally. But this system of communal land ownership changed when the Spaniards arrived.[30] They ""purchased communal lands from heads of the different barangays and registered the lands in their names.""[31] Then, all lands not privately owned were deemed owned by the State.[32]

The Spanish colonial period also introduced the encomienda system.[33] The caretaker of the land was called the encomendero. Natives who tilled the lands under the encomienda system could not own the land or its produce. Instead, they were required ""to pay tribute to their encomenderos.""[34]

The hacienda system was like the encomienda system. Those who tilled the hacienda could also not own the land or its produce despite their hard work. It was a system of forced labor, akin to slavery.[35]

Vestiges of the encomienda and hacienda systems could be seen in our earlier agricultural tenancy laws.

Act No. 4054, or the Philippine Rice Share Tenancy Act, defined the contract of share tenancy as ""one whereby a partnership between a landlord and a tenant is entered into, for a joint pursuit of rice agricultural work with common interest in which both parties divide between them the resulting profits as well as the losses.""[36] In Pineda v. Pingul,[37] this Court explained the policy behind the law:
The Rice Share Tenancy Law, Act No. 4054, as amended by Commonwealth Act No. 178 and Republic Act No. 34, intended to protect the interests of both the landlord and the tenant, without infringing upon or curtailing the proprietary rights of the landlord or owner, was undoubtedly conceived mainly to redeem the tenant from his life of misery, want and oftentimes oppression, arising from onerous terms of his tenancy. Side by side with this objective, and in obedience to the declared principle of promoting social justice to insure the well-being and economic security of all the people (Constitution, Article 11, Section 5), and to the mandate to afford protection to labor and to regulate the relations between landowner and tenant (Constitution, Article XIV, Section 6), the Rice Share Tenancy Law was also aimed at the upliftment of the social and financial status of the tenant.[38]
Act No. 4054, as amended, was eventually superseded by Republic Act No. 1199, which classified agricultural tenancy into either leasehold tenancy or share tenancy. Section 4 states:
SECTION 4. Systems of Agricultural Tenancy; Their Definitions. — Agricultural tenancy is classified into leasehold tenancy and share tenancy.

Share tenancy exists whenever two persons agree on a joint undertaking for agricultural production wherein one party furnishes the land and the other his labor, with either or both contributing any one or several of the items of production, the tenant cultivating the land personally with the aid of labor available from members of his immediate farm household, and the produce thereof to be divided between the landholder and the tenant in proportion to their respective contributions.

Leasehold tenancy exists when a person who, either personally or with the aid of labor available from members of his immediate farm household, undertakes to cultivate a piece of agricultural land susceptible of cultivation by a single person together with members of his immediate farm household, belonging to or legally possessed by, another in consideration of a price certain or ascertainable to be paid by the person cultivating the land either in percentage of the production or in a fixed amount in money, or in both.
The definition of leasehold tenancy was amended in Republic Act No. 2263. Section 4, as amended, states:
Leasehold tenancy exists when a person who, either personally or with the aid of labor available from members of his immediate farm household, undertakes to cultivate a piece of agricultural land susceptible of cultivation by a single person together with members of his immediate farm household, belonging to or legally possessed by, another in consideration of a fixed amount in money or in produce or in both. (Emphasis supplied)
As the years passed, it became apparent that share tenancy did not work in favor of the tenant-farmers.[39] In 1963, Republic Act No. 3844, or the Agricultural Land Reform Code, was signed into law. It abolished agricultural share tenancy, declaring it as contrary to public policy.[40] Republic Act No. 6389 later amended Republic Act No. 3844 and converted all existing contracts of share tenancy into agricultural leasehold.[41]

The main difference between agricultural leasehold and share tenancy is that an agricultural leasehold relation is not extinguished ""by mere expiration of the term or period in a leasehold contract nor by the sale, alienation or transfer of the legal possession of the landholding.""[42] It also allows the lessee to purchase the land tilled because it provides for a lessee's right of preemption[43] and redemption,[44] as the case may be.

In 2009, Republic Act No. 9700 repealed Section 53 of Republic Act No. 3844.[45] Other than that, the provisions of Republic Act No. 3844 not expressly repealed and remain consistent with subsequent laws still have suppletory effect.

The most recent agrarian reform law is Republic Act No. 11953, or the New Agrarian Emancipation Act. The law condones the principal debt of agrarian reform beneficiaries subject to certain requirements.[46] It also protects the rights to just compensation of landowners whose agricultural lands were subjected to the agrarian reform program.[47]

"G.R. No. 236166, October 30, 2024","KENNETH KARL ASPIRAS Y CORPUZ, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","Kenneth Karl Aspiras y Corpuz (Aspiras) was charged with the crime of Murder in an Information that reads:
That on or about January 13, 2011 in the city of Manila, Philippines, the said accused, with intent to kill, with treachery and evident premeditation and taking advantage of superior strength, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and use personal violence upon JET LEE REYES y DAQUIL, by then and there stabbing her with a kitchen knife on the abdomen, thereby inflicting upon the latter a mortal stab wound which was the direct and immediate cause of her death thereafter.

Contrary to law.[5]
Upon Aspiras' request, a preliminary investigation was conducted by Assistant City Prosecutor Lourdes A. Gatdula, who eventually issued a Resolution dated May 3, 2011 affirming the finding of probable cause to indict Aspiras for murder. The Resolution was approved by both Senior Assistant City Prosecutor Maria Gene Z. Julianda-Sarmiento and then City Prosecutor Jhosep Y. Lopez. Aspiras' subsequent Motion for Reconsideration was denied in a Resolution dated August 1, 2011.[6]

Aspiras pleaded not guilty during arraignment.[7]

During the pre-trial conference, the prosecution and defense stipulated on ""the date and place of the crime[,] the knife used in the stabbing, [and] the fact that the victim died after [Aspiras] stabbed her.""[8]

Aspiras was released on bail after posting a cash bond. Trial on the merits then ensued.[9]

Cleopatra Reyes (Cleopatra), the mother of the victim, Jet Lee Reyes (Jet Lee) testified that Jet Lee and Aspiras are common law spouses. They live with her in a three-storey house located at 409 Moriones Street, Tondo, Manila, with the spouses occupying the room at the third floor, while she and her granddaughters occupy the room at the second floor.[10]

At 6:00 p.m. on January 13, 2011, Rio, a friend of the Reyes family, arrived with a bottle of Emperador brandy. Rio invited Aspiras for a drinking spree while playing cards. The two were later joined by Jet Lee and three others, Aiza, Jersey and Jellie. The drinking spree ended at around 10:00 p.m.[11]

While Cleopatra was resting in her room, she overheard Aspiras and Jet Lee arguing while they were going up to the third floor. Afterwards, Cleopatra heard Jet Lee screaming for help and shouting that she was stabbed by Aspiras. Cleopatra hurriedly went out of her room to check on Jet Lee. She met the half-naked Aspiras descending from the third floor with bloodied hands.[12]

Shortly after, Cleopatra saw Jet Lee also going down the stairs and holding onto her bloodied side. She embraced Cleopatra and said ""mommy sinaksak po ako ni Kenneth."" Cleopatra immediately asked for help from their neighbor and brought Jet Lee to Mary Johnston Hospital in Juan Nolasco Street, Tondo, Manila. Jet Lee died shortly thereafter.[13]

Cleopatra also testified that Aspiras and Jet Lee usually argue ""because of jealousy, especially since Jet Lee was a dance instructor and she usually goes home with pictures of her male students.""[14]

Aiza Padillo (Padillo), a friend of the couple, ""testified that sometime in September 2010, while Jet Lee was in her house, Aspiras suddenly arrived and dragged Jet Lee to the bathroom. [Padillo] alleged that [Aspiras] hit Jet Lee and exclaimed 'hindi ka pakikinabangan ng iba sisirain ko mukha mo.' ""Aiza asserted that Aspiras is the jealous type who has the tendency to hurt another person.""[15]

On cross-examination, Padillo averred that she knew about Aspiras' jealousy because Jet Lee told her about it. She had also witnessed Aspiras' jealousy whenever all three of them are together. When someone stares at Jet Lee, Aspiras gets angry then inflicts harm or utters hurtful words against Jet Lee, such as ""lumalandi ka na naman."" Padillo revealed that Aspiras pulls Jet Lee's hair, slaps her or kicks her because of jealousy.[16]

Jersey Reyes (Jersey), Jet Lee's brother, testified that one time, Aspiras became silent and upset during a drinking spree after Jet Lee purportedly said something wrong. The next day, Jet Lee already had a contusion, but he was told not to interfere. Jersey affirmed that when he was still living in the Reyes' house, he would hear Aspiras and Jet Lee quarreling since their rooms were adjacent to each other. At the time of the incident though, he was no longer living in the house. He was the one who found the knife in the couples' room and turned it over to the police.[17]

PO2 James G. Lagasca, the investigating officer assigned to the case, testified that Aspiras was shouting ""hindi ko sinasadya"" while visibly drunk in the police station.[18]

Dr. Jesille Cui Baluyot, the medico-legal officer who examined Jet Lee's body, declared that ""Jet Lee sustained two stab wounds: a defensive wound on the right shoulder and a fatal wound on the right abdomen; as well as hematoma on the lateral side of the right eye.""[19]

For his part, Aspiras claimed that after the drinking session, he went up to their room, washed Jet Lee's uniform and hung them in the bathroom. Then, he rejoined the people conversing in the sala until he fell asleep. An angry Jet Lee then woke him up, and both of them went up to their room.[20]

After going to their room, Aspiras claimed he slept but was awakened by Jet Lee, who was mad because her clothes were hung in the bathroom and not outside the house. Aspiras noticed that Jet Lee was holding a knife on her right hand. He told Jet Lee to put the knife down but she refused and thrust the knife toward Aspiras' stomach. He was able to parry the thrust and tried to wrest the knife from Jet Lee's hand. ""Nag-aagawan po kami, naghilahan kami ng kutsilyo"" averred Aspiras. Afterwards, Jet Lee suddenly shouted ""Ahhh"" holding the right side of her body. Aspiras saw blood where the knife pierced Jet Lee's body. He claimed he did not intend to stab her.[21]

Aspiras got rattled and ran downstairs, leaving Jet Lee. He saw Jet Lee's mother in the stairway, who asked him what happened. He replied, Jet Lee 'may saksak'. He continued running away from the house when he met a neighbor, Liza. He told her to help Jet Lee. He felt blank until the police arrested him.[22]

On cross-examination, Aspiras admitted that he was the jealous type, but only when he and Jet Lee were still a new couple.[23]","This Court resolves a Petition for Review[1] assailing the Court of Appeals Decision,[2] which affirmed with modification, the Regional Trial Court Decision[3] convicting petitioner of homicide, and its Resolution[4] denying petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration.","The issues for resolution are: first, whether or not the Court of Appeals erred in not annulling and setting aside the Regional Trial Court's Decision for lack of jurisdiction since the Information was not signed and approved by the City Prosecutor as required under Rule 112, Section 4 of the Rules of Court; and second, whether or not the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the petitioner's conviction for homicide.

The Petition is denied.

I

The Information filed against petitioner was signed by Assistant City Prosecutor Francisco L. Salomon, and was approved ""for the City Prosecutor"" by Assistant Chief, Inquest Division, Prosecutor Elaine Y. Cerezo.[30] The accompanying certification of the Assistant City Prosecutor also stated that it was filed with the prior authority of the City Prosecutor.

Petitioner contends that the Information did not comply with Rule 112, Section 4[31] of the Rules of Court requiring prior written authority or approval of the City or Provincial Prosecutor. Hence, the criminal case must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.[32]

The Court of Appeals, in rejecting petitioner's contention, held:
Perusal of the Information showed that although there is no signature or indication of an express approval of the City Prosecutor, there is a stamp which stated that the same was approved ""for the City Prosecutor,"" in addition to the certification of the Assistant City Prosecutor that it was filed with the prior authority of the City Prosecutor. Aside from this, there is no question that Kenneth asked for a preliminary investigation even after the conduct of inquest and before his arraignment. In any case, the records show that the Resolution dated May 3, 2011 in relation to the preliminary investigation was signed by the City Prosecutor. Additionally, the said Resolution stated that the Information was approved by the Chief Inquest Prosecutor. Furthermore, the filing of the said Information enjoys the presumption of regularity. In view of these, this Court finds no convincing reason to invalidate the Information.[33]
We agree with the Court of Appeals.

Essentially, petitioner questions the correctness of the accompanying certification in the Information, if it was filed with the prior approval of the City Prosecutor. This is a factual matter that is not proper to be resolved in a Rule 45 petition. More importantly, petitioner did not file a motion to quash[34] before he entered his plea, but raised his objection for the first time on appeal before the Court of Appeals. Such failure amounts to a waiver on his part to question the purported defect.

In Gomez v. People,[35] this Court held that the lack of written authority or approval to file the Information is a waivable ground for a motion to quash information. This Court further clarified that the requirement of a prior written authority or approval of the city or provincial prosecutor is a matter of procedure, and does not affect the validity of the Information nor the jurisdiction of the court over the subject matter and the person of the accused.
Lack of prior written authority or approval on the face of the Information by the prosecuting officers authorized to approve and sign the same has nothing to do with a trial court's acquisition of jurisdiction in a criminal case.","WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Petition is DENIED.

"G.R. No. 257483, October 30, 2024","SONIA BALAGTAS, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","This Court resolves the Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] filed by Sonia Balagtas (Balagtas) assailing the Decision[2] and Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA), which affirmed the Decision[4] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC). The RTC found Balagtas guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of qualified theft.[5]

The instant case stemmed from an Information[6] filed against Balagtas, the accusatory portion of which states:
That on or about the period comprised from June, 2006 to February 2007, in Quezon City, Philippines, the above-named accused being then employed as an Operation Manager of VISATECH INTEGRATED CORPORATION and represented by ANTHONY GALORPO located at 200 Pluto Street, Brgy. Bahay Toro, this City, and as such have free access to the property stolen, with grave abuse of confidence reposed upon her by the said company, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously, with intent of gain and without the knowledge and consent of the owner thereof, take, steal and carry away cash money in the amount of Php304,569.38, Philippine Currency, which represents six (6) payroll periods which she padded belonging to said VISATECH INTEGRATED CORPORATION, to the damage and prejudice of the said offended party in the amount aforementioned.","In cases of qualified theft committed with grave abuse of confidence, the prosecution must first establish the existence of a relationship of confidence between the offended party and the accused. If the prosecution fails to prove this relationship any subsequent claims of grave abuse of confidence would be unfounded.","The Petition is partly meritorious.

Balagtas argues that: (1) there is no direct evidence proving the first element of qualified theft, i.e., the taking of PHP 304,569.38;[29] (2) the evidence is inconsistent and unsubstantiated, and one witness denies payroll padding;[30] and (3) the evidence against her were illegally obtained.[31]

We shall address these arguments in sequence.

The elements of qualified theft committed with grave abuse of confidence as defined under Articles 308 and 310 of the Revised Penal Code are:
(1) taking of personal property; (2) said property belongs to another; (3) said taking be done with intent to gain; (4) that the taking be done without the owner's consent; (5) that it be accomplished without the use of violence or intimidation against persons, nor of force upon things; and (6) that it be done with grave abuse of confidence.[32]
Balagtas argues that the prosecution failed to present any direct evidence proving the first element because nobody allegedly saw her pad the payroll and pocket the total amount of PHP 304,569.38.[33]

This argument has no merit.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is PARTIALLY GRANTED. The September 23, 2020 Decision and the September 24, 2021 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 41206 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION in that Sonia Balagtas is found guilty of simple theft and is sentenced to suffer the penalty of imprisonment for an indeterminate period of six months of arresto mayor, as minimum, to four years and two months of prision correccional, as maximum. Sonia Balagtas is further ORDERED to PAY Visatech Integrated Corporation the amount of PHP 304,569.38 with legal interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of finality of this Decision until full payment."
"G.R. No. 268094, October 30, 2024","PEAKPOWER SAN FRANCISCO, INC., PETITIONER, VS. ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION, RESPONDENT.","PSFI operates a 1 x 5.2 MV (Gross) Wartsila 12V32 Bunker/Diesel-fired power plant located at the ASELCO Office Compound. The power plant is contracted exclusively to ASELCO and directly connected to its distribution system. ASELCO is a distribution utility (DU) that uses the PSFI Power Plant primarily as a peaking plant and as an intermediate source of electricity, especially when there is a supply shortage from the Mindanao Grid.[4] This agreement is covered by a PPTA between PSFI and ASELCO, which was executed on May 29, 2013 (First PPTA).[5]

On December 8, 2014, PSFI and ASELCO negotiated and executed another PPTA (Second PPTA) contract for an additional Wartsila 12V32 generating unit (additional unit) at the PSFI Power Plant under substantially the same terms and conditions as the First PPTA. Under their agreement, PSFI would finance, build, and operate the unit, and then transfer it to ASELCO at the end of the term of the PPTA for the additional unit.[6]

On June 11, 2015, the Department of Energy (DOE) issued Department Circular No. DC2015-06-0008 (2015 DOE Circular) requiring all distribution utilities to procure their power supply agreements (PSAs) exclusively through a Competitive Selection Process (CSP). The main features of a CSP-compliant operations were provided as follows:

Section 3. Standard Features in the Conduct of CSP. After the effectivity of this Circular, all Dus shall procure PSAs only through CSP conducted through a Third Party duly recognized by the ERC and the DOE. In the case of ECs, the Third Party shall also be duly recognized by the National Electrification Administration (NEA).[7]

On April 28, 2016, ASELCO and PSFI filed an application for the approval of their Second PPTA with prayer for the issuance of provisional authority.[8]

On October 7, 2016, the ERC granted the prayer for the issuance of provisional authority and issued an Order and Notice of hearing, setting the Application for hearing, on the determination of its compliance with jurisdictional requirements, expository presentation, pre-trial conference, and presentation of evidence.[9]

On May 8, 2017, the ERC granted provisional authority to ASELCO and PSFI for the implementation of their Second PPTA. The dispositive portion of that Order states:","This Court resolves a Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition With Application for the Issuance of Temporary Restraining Order and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction[1] filed before this Court by Peakpower San Francisco, Inc. (PSFI), assailing the September 11, 2019 Order[2] (First Order) and the March 1, 2023 Order[3] (Second Order) (collectively, assailed orders) of the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC), which dismissed PSFI's and Agusan Del Sur Electric Cooperative, Inc. (ASELCO)'s application for the approval of their Power Purchase and Transfer Agreement (PPTA).","The Rules of Court are clear regarding the proper appeal from decisions and final decisions of quasi-judicial agencies, which include the ERC:

RULE 43

Appeals From the Court of Tax Appeals and Quasi-Judicial Agencies
to the Court of Appeals

Section 1. Scope. — This Rule shall apply to appeals from judgments or final orders of the Court of Tax Appeals and from awards, judgments, final orders or resolutions of or authorized by any quasi-judicial agency in the exercise of its quasi-judicial functions. Among these agencies are the Civil Service Commission, Central Board of Assessment Appeals, Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of the President, Land Registration Authority, Social Security Commission, Civil Aeronautics Board, Bureau of Patents, Trademarks and Technology Transfer, National Electrification Administration, Energy Regulatory Board, National Telecommunications Commission, Department of Agrarian Reform under Republic Act No. 6657, Government Service Insurance System, Employees Compensation Commission, Agricultural Invention Board, Insurance Commission, Philippine Atomic Energy Commission, Board of Investments, Construction Industry Arbitration Commission, and voluntary arbitrators authorized by law.[20]

Clearly, the decisions and final orders of the Energy Regulatory Board, predecessor of the respondent,[21] are explicitly included as those which are subject to the remedy of appeal, first to the Court of Appeals. In determining whether an order from quasi-judicial agencies is interlocutory or final, jurisprudence provides that a final order is one that ""finally disposes of, adjudicates or determines the rights, or some rights of the parties, either on the controversy of some definite and separate branch thereof, and which concludes them until it is reversed or set aside.""[22] Such final orders are a proper subject of appeal, not certiorari.

In this case, the respondent's assailed Orders clearly disposed of the controversy over petitioner's application when it dismissed the same with prejudice and directed it and ASELCO to stop implementing their Second PPTA immediately. Also, the assailed Orders terminated, without prejudice to any rate adjustment, the provisional authority granted to ASELCO and petitioner. Given the adjudication on the controversy, the proper appeal should have been lodged with the appropriate court within 15 days from petitioner's receipt of the final order.

Nevertheless, it is an established principle in case law that the mere availability of an appeal is not a sufficient ground to prevent a party from making use of the extraordinary remedy of certiorari:

[A]lthough Section 1, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court provides that the special civil action of certiorari may only be invoked when ""there is no appeal, nor any plain speedy and adequate remedy in the course of law,"" this rule is not without exception. The availability of the ordinary course of appeal does not constitute sufficient ground to prevent a party from making use of the extraordinary remedy of certiorari where the appeal is not an adequate remedy or equally beneficial, speedy and sufficient. It is the inadequacy—not the mere absence—of all other legal remedies and the danger of failure of justice without the writ, that must usually determine the propriety of certiorari.[23]

Given the potential injustice or injurious effects of the assailed Orders in this case, the mere presence of the remedy of appeal should neither preclude the parties from availing of a certiorari, nor should it prevent this Court from entertaining it.

II.
The CSP Requirement in the 2015 DOE Circular, its effectivity, and its mandatory nature, is unequivocal
At the outset, it bears emphasizing that the mandatory nature and effectivity of the CSP requirement in the 2015 DOE Circular is not in dispute.

The petitioner was created by the EPIRA, which declares the following State policies:

(b) To ensure the quality, reliability, security and affordability of the supply of electric power;
(c) To ensure transparent and reasonable prices of electricity in a regime of free and fair competition and full public accountability to achieve greater operational and economic efficiency and enhance the competitiveness of Philippine products in the global marker;
(d) To enhance the inflow of private capital and broaden the ownership base of the power generation transmission and distribution sectors in order to minimize the financial risk exposure of the national government;
. . . .
(f) To protect the public interest as it is affected by the rates and services of electric utilities and other providers of electric power.[24]

The EPIRA likewise states that generation of electric power shall be competitive and open.[25] For the distribution sector, which includes ASELCO, the EPIRA is clear that DUs shall have the obligation to supply electricity in the least costly manner to its captive market, subject to the collection of distribution retail supply rate duly approved by respondent.[26] Finally, with the objective of market competition in the interest of consumers, the EPIRA states that DUs may enter into bilateral power supply contract subject to review by ERC.[27] This provision unequivocally requires approval from the respondent before the execution of any power supply agreement, such as the Second PPTA in this case.

With this as the legal and policy backdrop, the DOE issued the 2015 DOE Circular mandating all DUs to undergo a competitive selection process in securing power supply agreements (PSAs). It stated the following general principles:

Section 1. General Principles. Consistent with its mandate, the DOE recognizes the Competitive Selection Process (CSP) in the procurement of PSAs by the DUs ensures security and certainty of electricity prices of electric power to end-users in the long-term. Towards this end, all CSPs undertaken by the DUs shall be guided by the following principles:

(a) Increase the transparency needed in the procurement process in order to reduce risks;
(b) Promote and instill competition in the procurement and supply of electric power to all electricity end-users;
(c) Ascertain least-cost outcomes that are unlikely to be challenged in the future as the political and institutional scenarios should change; and
(d) Protect the interest of the general public.

The 2015 DOE Circular included a provision that the ""[respondent] in coordination with the DOE shall issue supplemental guidelines and procedures to properly guide the DUs and the Third Party in the design and execution of the CSP.""[28] Nevertheless, the same Circular already detailed the standard features in the conduct of CSP:

Section 3. Standard Features in the Conduct of CSP. After the effectivity of this Circular, all DUs shall procure PSAs only through CSP conducted through a Third Party duly recognized by the ERC and this DOE. In case of ECs, the Third Party shall also be duly recognized by the National Electrification Administration (NEA).

Under this Circular, CSPs for the procurement of PSAs of all DUs shall observe the following:

(a) Aggregation for un-contracted demand requirements of DUs;
(b) Annually conducted; and
(c) Uniform template for the terms and conditions in the PSA to be issued by the ERC in coordination with the DOE.

Verily, the effectivity of the 2015 Circular placed the DUs, including ASELCO, under obligation to reform their process of selecting contractors from the power generation companies, without any qualification by the ERC, with the objective of security and certainty in electricity prices.

We quote below the entirety of Section 43 of the EPIRA, prescribing the functions of the ERC, and there is absolutely nothing whatsoever in this complete enumeration of the ERC's functions that grants the ERC rule­ making power to supplant or change the policies, rules, regulations, or circulars prescribed by the DOE. The ERC's functions, as granted by the EPIRA, are limited, inter alia, to the enforcement of the implementing rules and regulations of the EPIRA, and not to amend or revoke them. At most, as stated in paragraph (m) of Section 43, the ERC may only take any other action delegated to it pursuant to EPIRA. The ERC may not exceed its delegated authority.[29]

In the Alyansa case, this Court was unequivocal about the effectivity of the CSP requirements:

Section 5 of the 2015 DOE Circular states the non-retroactivity of the Circular's effect.

Section 5. Non-Retroactivity. This Circular shall have prospective application and will not apply to PSAs with tariff rates already approved and/or have been filed for approval by the ERC before the effectivity of this Circular.

Clearly, PSAs filed with the ERC after the effectivity of the 2015 DOE Circular must comply with CSP as only PSAs filed ""before the effectivity"" of the Circular are excluded from CSP.

Section 10 of the 2015 DOE Circular provides for its effectivity:

Section 10. Effectivity. This Circular shall take effect immediately upon its publication in two (2) newspapers of general circulation and shall remain in effect until otherwise revoked. (Boldfacing added)

The 2015 DOE Circular took effect upon its publication on 30 June 2015 in the Philippine Daily Inquirer and the Philippine Star. Section 10 expressly declares that the ""Circular [....] shall remain in effect until otherwise revoked."" Indisputably, CSP became mandatory as of 30 June 2015. Taking all these provisions together, all PSAs submitted to the ERC after the effectivity of the 2015 DOE Circular, on or after 30 June 2015, are required to undergo CSP.[30] (Emphasis supplied)

Hence, the CSP requirement itself is prospective in application because it only comes into effect for PSA applications submitted to the ERC after June 30, 2015, which was the effectivity date of the 2015 DOE Circular.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Certiorari filed by Peakpower San Francisco, Inc. is GRANTED.

PONDOC, IN THEIR CAPACITY AS COMMISSIONERS, ALL OF THE COMMISSION ON AUDIT, RESPONDENTS.","Petitioner Edito A.G. Balintona (petitioner) was a former Mayor of the Municipality of Sarrat, Ilocos Norte (the Municipality). During his term, the Municipality received financial assistance from the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) allocation of Congressman Roque R. Ablan, Jr. (Ablan), former Representative of the First District of Ilocos Norte (First District). In three separate transactions in 2009 and 2010, a total of PHP 30,000,000.00 PDAF funds was returned to Ablan through the 1st District Monitoring Office, in the sequence of events that follows:

First Fund Transfer

On December 19, 2008, an Advice of NCA Issued[4] signed by then Department of Budget and Management (DBM) Secretary Rolando G. Andaya, Jr., (Andaya) informed the Director of DBM Regional Office No. 1 of cash allocation in the amount of PHP 10,000,000.00 issued for credit to the said Regional Office's account. The stated purpose of the funds is ""[t]o cover the cash requirements of the Municipality of Sarrat, Ilocos Norte for priority programs and projects in the 1st District, Ilocos Norte, authorized under Special Allotment Release Order (SARO) No. ROCS-08-09458 dated November 25, 2008, issued per request of Congressman Roque R. Ablan, Jr., 1st District, Ilocos Norte, chargeable against the [Fiscal Year (FY)] 2008 Budget, R.A. 9498.""[5]

Pursuant to the Advice, Atty. Janet B. Abuel (Abuel), Director IV of the DBM Regional Office No. 1 sent to petitioner a Notice of Funding Check Issued[6] dated December 24, 2008. The Notice stated that the amount of PHP 10,000,000.00 was deposited for credit to the account of the Municipality and ""represents financial assistance to the Municipality for priority development programs and projects in the 1st District of Ilocos Norte, which was released ... upon the request of Honorable Congressman Roque R. Ablan, Jr.""[7]

Petitioner claims that prior to the written notice from the DBM, Ablan personally informed petitioner that he (Ablan) requested the DBM to release his PDAF allocation for the implementation of his priority projects in the First District. Ablan further told petitioner that he would be requiring the transfer of said amount from the Municipality to the account of the 1st District Monitoring Office at the Laoag City Branch of the Philippine National Bank (PNB).[8]

According to petitioner, it was the first time he encountered a request for transfer of PDAF funds. He claims to have asked his fellow mayors and the Provincial Auditor whereby he was informed that similar transfers were requested from and earlier made by the Municipalities of Dumalneg, Burgos, Bacarra, and Vintar, all belonging to the First District of Ilocos Norte, and there was no recorded audit disapproval or disallowance whatsoever.[9]

In preparation for the transfer, petitioner sought authorization from the Sangguniang Bayan of Sarrat (Sangguniang Bayan). Resolution No. 2009-01[10] dated January 5, 2009 authorized petitioner to ""enter into a [Memorandum of Agreement (MOA)] with Congressman Roque R. Ablan, Jr. for the transfer and implementation of the amount of [PHP 10,000,000.00)""[11] covered by SARO No. ROCS-08-09458.

Meanwhile, Ablan's request was formalized through a January 8, 2009 letter[12] addressed to petitioner, informing petitioner that the PHP 10,000,000.00 released to the Municipality through SARO No. ROCS-08-09458 was ""intended to cover financial support for Priority Development Programs and Projects of [Ablan's] district."" Thus, he requested ""the immediate transfer of [f]unds to [the] District Monitoring Office, 1st District, Ilocos Norte Congressional Office with [his] Philippine National Bank Account Number 152903300011.""[13]

Subsequently, a MOA[14] was signed between petitioner and Ablan on January 12, 2009. Under the MOA, the 1st Congressional District of Ilocos Norte, represented by Ablan, shall, among others, (1) cause the implementation of the fund for its priority development programs in the First District of Ilocos Norte and furnish the Municipality a list of said programs and projects from time to time, and (2) administer, manage, disburse, and utilize the said fund for its avowed purpose and in accordance with auditing and accounting rules and regulations and other pertinent laws. The Municipality, represented by petitioner, shall (1) transfer and deposit the amount of PHP 10,000,000.00 to the account of the 1st District Monitoring Office, and (2) monitor the implementation of the program by the 1st Congressional District and require the submission of progress report from time to time.

Referencing the letter request of Ablan, petitioner thus wrote to Sarrat Municipal Accountant Enrico Paz and OIC Municipal Treasurer Liza Cariño, instructing them to process the appropriate documents for the transfer.[15] Pursuant to petitioner's instructions, the transfer was made.[16]

Second Fund Transfer
 
Some months later, petitioner claims that he was again personally informed by Ablan that he (Ablan) had requested DBM the release of PHP 10,000,000.00 intended for the implementation of Ablan's priority development projects in the First District, and that upon receipt thereof, it had to be transferred to the 1st District Monitoring Office's account, just like the first transfer.[17] Thereafter, petitioner received Notice of Funding Check Issued[18] dated May 28, 2009, advising petitioner of the deposit of another PHP 10,000,000.00 released under SARO No. ROCS-09-01883 dated April 13, 2009.[19] Another letter[20] was again received from Ablan on June 15, 2009, requesting the immediate transfer of the amount covered by the Notice.

Petitioner again sought legislative authority from the Sangguniang Bayan, which in turn promulgated Resolution No. 2009-37[21] on June 8, 2009. On June 15, 2009, another MOA[22] was executed by petitioner and Ablan, containing the same terms as the earlier MOA. Petitioner instructed the Municipal Accountant and Municipal Treasurer to effect the second transfer,[23] which was completed on even date.[24]

Third Fund Transfer

On December 10, 2009, an Advice of NCA Issued[25] signed by Andaya, notified the DBM Regional Office No. 1 of the deposit PHP 10,000,000.00 pertaining to SARO No. G-09-08-006 dated October 26, 2009. Petitioner claims that on the following day, he was faxed a copy of the said Advice of NCA Issued by the office of Ablan.[26] Simultaneously, he received a phone call from Ablan informing him of the incoming funds and that it was going to be transferred to the 1st District Monitoring Office just like in the two previous instances.[27]

As with the first two transfers, petitioner requested the authorization from the Sangguniang Bayan to enter into a MOA with Ablan for the implementation and transfer of the funds. Resolution No. 2009-65[28] was issued on December 14, 2009 for that purpose.

Ablan and petitioner signed a third MOA[29] on December 21, 2009, containing common terms as the first two MOAs where the Municipality shall transfer the funds while the 1st District Congressional Office will cause the implementation of its priority development programs in the First District of Ilocos Norte and utilize and disburse the transferred funds therefor.
 
After passing pre-audit, the appropriate municipal officers transferred the funds[30] as directed by petitioner.[31] Ablan's earlier verbal instructions to transfer the funds to the 1st District Monitoring Office was formalized through a Letter[32] dated January 4, 2010.

In this way, a total amount of PHP 30,000,000.00 of Ablan's PDAF funds was transferred from the Municipality to the 1st District Monitoring Office.

Two years later, former COA Commissioner Heidi L. Mendoza issued a Memorandum dated February 28, 2012 addressed to Marilyn J. Llaguno, the Audit Team Leader (ATL) assigned to the Municipality.[33] In the Memorandum, it was observed that not a single project was implemented by the Municipality and instead, the funds were transferred to the private bank account of the 1st District Monitoring Office. Furthermore, the third transfer passed in pre-audit as appearing on the face of the relevant Disbursement Voucher. Thus, the ATL was required to explain why the fund transfers were allowed in audit or pre-audit and to provide information on the audit actions taken on the fund transfers.

In turn, ATL Llaguno wrote to petitioner on August 30, 2012, requesting a list of projects that were implemented together with the supporting documents.[34] In response, petitioner submitted the Notices from the DBM, the letters from Ablan, the Sangguniang Bayan Resolutions, the pertinent MOAs signed by him and Ablan, and the documents effecting the transfers. Petitioner also explained that their understanding was that the ""implementation of the PDAF funds"" would be undertaken by the 1st District Congressional Office as stated in the request for transfer by Ablan. Petitioner assured the ATL that the Municipality is still exerting best efforts in getting in touch with the 1st District Congressional Office.[35]

Audit Observation Memorandum (AOM) No. 13-008[36] signed by ATL Llaguno was issued on January 10, 2013 noting that the transfers of PHP 30,000,000.00 were not yet liquidated as required by COA Circular No. 94-103 dated December 13, 1994, thus proper utilization for its intended purpose, including compliance with COA accounting, auditing rules and regulations, was not ascertained. It concluded, thus:
As a source agency, the municipality must require the implementing agency to submit reports or the list of projects with the supporting documents as stated under the provisions of COA Circular No. 94-013. We therefore recommend that the municipality should require the implementing agency to submit reports for monitoring purposes and liquidation.[37]
On June 4, 2013, ATL Llaguno separately wrote to petitioner[38] and for the first time to Ablan,[39] requesting the submission of a list of projects implemented pertaining to the PHP 30,000,000.00 together with supporting documents.","Before the Court is a Petition for Certiorari[1] (Petition) under Rule 64 assailing the Decision No. 2017-468[2] dated December 28, 2017 and Resolution No. 2020-024[3] dated January 8, 2020 rendered by the Commission on Audit (COA), affirming the disallowance of three fund transfers from the Municipality of Sarrat, Ilocos Norte to the District Monitoring Office, 1st District, Ilocos Norte Congressional Office (1st District Monitoring Office) in the aggregate amount of PHP 30,000,000.00.","The Court sides with petitioner on this point. It is well-settled that public officers are presumed to know and are expected to keep abreast of the rules and regulations bearing upon their functions. Arguably, this presumption operates with greater strength upon a member of the bar. However, as shown above, the circumstances of this case prevent its full application. Lastly and perhaps as an aside, it bears to note that the legislator proponent who requested the fund transfers was himself a member of the bar.

It is unfair to penalize public officials based on overly stretched and strained interpretations of rules which were not that readily capable of being understood at the time such functionaries acted in good faith. If there is any ambiguity, which is actually clarified years later, then it should only be applied prospectively.[109]

In fine, the Court holds that petitioner cannot be held civilly liable for the disallowed amounts for having acted in good faith with respect to the disallowed fund transfers.","ACCORDINGLY, premises considered, the Petition for Certiorari is hereby PARTLY GRANTED.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[3]
The case was raffled to the Branch xxxxxxxxxxx, Regional Trial Court, xxxxxxxxxxx.[4] Upon arraignment, Dela Cruz pleaded not guilty to the charge.[5]

During trial, AAA267163[6] and Dela Cruz testified for the prosecution[7] and the defense, respectively.[8]","This Appeal[1] assails the Decision[2] dated October 28, 2022 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR HC No. 14824, affirming with modification the conviction of accused-appellant Eduardo Dela Cruz y Tolentino (Dela Cruz) for rape in Criminal Case No. 3492-2015.","We modify.
 
Rape under Article 266-A(1) of the Revised Penal Code
 

Article 266-A(1) of the Revised Penal Code defines and penalizes rape, as follows:
Article 266-A. Rape: When and How Committed. – Rape is committed:

1)
By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:

a) Through force, threat, or intimidation;

b) When the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious;

c) By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority; and

d) When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present.
Rape by sexual intercourse requires the following elements: (1) the offender had carnal knowledge of the victim; and (2) such act was accomplished through force or intimidation; or when the victim is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; or when the victim is under 12 years of age.[30]

Here, AAA267163 unequivocally averred that Dela Cruz had carnal knowledge of her. She testified that she was inside a Born Again church when Dela Cruz touched her breast and vagina, and inserted his finger into her vagina. He then removed her shorts and underwear, laid her on a chair, kissed her vagina, and eventually inserted his penis into her vagina (""higa niya ako, kiss niya pisngi ko, kiss nya dede ko, kiss niya pepe ko, pasok nya titi niya sa pepe ko."").[31]
 
Both the trial court and the Court of Appeals found the sole testimony of AAA267163 to be credible, natural, convincing, and consistent. Though the medical certificate indicated that her hymen remained intact, and there were no indicated bleeding, abrasions, or erythema at the time of examination, the Court has consistently ruled that a medical certificate is merely corroborative in character and its absence does not disprove the occurrence of rape. It is enough that the evidence on hand convinces the court that conviction is proper, as in the present case.[32]

In any event, where the clashing values of the victim's positive testimony and accused-appellant's plain denial are in issue, the factual findings of the trial court thereon carry great weight and respect especially when sustained by the Court of Appeals as in this case. This is because trial courts are in the best position to ascertain and measure the sincerity and spontaneity of witnesses through their actual observation of the manner by which witnesses testified, acted, and behaved in court.[33] Against the bare denial of Dela Cruz, therefore, the positive testimony of the victim deserves greater weight and credit.
 
Dela Cruz is guilty of rape under Article 266-A paragraph 1(a) of the Revised Penal Code
 

We now reckon with the allegation in the Information that AAA267163 is a ""special child."" The trial court concluded that AAA267163 was a child based on her appearance and demeanor during the trial. It particularly noted that on the witness stand, she murmured ""hindi na ba ako babalik, uuwi na ba ako?"" According to the trial court, such action is ""attributed to a child of tender age."" Further, the trial court took into consideration that the defense did not object to the treatment of AAA267163 as a child witness.[34] Consequently, both the trial court and the Court of Appeals were convinced that Dela Cruz should be held liable for statutory rape under Article 266-A paragraph 1(d) of the Revised Penal Code.

We note that while the trial court did observe that based on the appearance and demeanor of AAA267163 during the trial, she was a child, it failed to identify or at least calculate her mental age. Also, the records did not bear any clinical identification of her mental age either. Verily, therefore, there is nothing to support the conclusion that the 16-year-old AAA267163 had a mental age of a child below 12 years old at the time she was raped to sustain a conviction for statutory rape.

In People v. XXX,[35] the mental disability of the victim was not disputed. However, the victim's level of disability has not been equated to a specific ""mental age."" The medical certificate merely stated that the victim is suffering from ""moderate retardation."" In ruling that there was no statutory rape, the Court ordained that the mental age of the victim must first be identified, viz.:
Evidence must be adduced to aid the court in determining not only the existence of the illness and its level of severity but as well of its manifestations and the corresponding mental age of the subject.

The determination of mental retardation, particularly, the degrees thereof, is deeply rooted in medical psychology; as such, courts are largely dependent upon psychometric evaluation. It is true that such mental condition can be proved by evidence other than medical and clinical evidence, such as the testimony of witnesses and the observation of the trial court. This may be sufficient when the issue is the ability of a subject to testify in court or to stand trial, the only consideration being the ability to comprehend the questions propounded and to respond to the same intelligibly.

However, when the determination of mental disability constitutes as an element of the crime of rape, or when the victim's mental age is necessary in characterizing whether carnal knowledge can be considered as statutory rape, or when mental disability relates to the capacity of the accused to commit the crime; the same must be medically defined and specified, over which the court must rely upon the findings and evaluation of experts in the field, social workers, or persons close to the subject sufficiently averring circumstances to depict the mental development and status. In the same way, the Court cannot merely rely upon the comparative classification of mental age vis-à-vis the level of mental retardation of a person provided for in Dalandas as past cases show us that mental aging is variable. And ultimately, the conviction of an accused of rape based on the mental retardation of the victim must be anchored on proof beyond reasonable doubt and not on mere inferences.

Courts cannot hastily resort to deductive reasoning with respect to the proper designation of the crime. The rule must be that in order to be properly appreciated, mental retardation, particularly when disputed, whether of the victim or of the accused, must be sufficiently characterized by adducing evidence stating the intelligence quotient, manifestations of the illness, and mental age.

The nature of a crime including its mode of commission must be sufficiently alleged as to allow the accused to adequately prepare for his or her defense. This requirement is vital in all criminal prosecutions as it is deeply rooted on one's constitutional rights to due process and presumption of innocence. While, admittedly, the penalty provided for by law is the same in any of the circumstances under Article 266-A(1) of the RPC, this fact alone does not diminish the substance of the requirement nor of the importance of the rule's observance.

Whereas, a victim's chronological age is factual and evidentiary in nature, which must be established by evidence during trial. Comparatively, the same also holds true even more with the determination of the mental age of a person suffering from mental retardation as it is primarily a scientific and a medical issue. As such it must be properly characterized and substantiated by medical evaluation or by adequate proof external manifestations of the person allegedly suffering from mental retardation.[36] (Citations omitted)
But this identification need not be based alone on the existence of a clinical or medical finding on record. In fact, the Court emphasized in People v. Bermas[37] that the lack of medical or clinical evidence does not preclude the presentation of other evidence to prove the victim's mental disability. Medical finding is necessary only for borderline cases when there is difficulty in ascertaining the mental capacity of the victim.[38] In cases where the cognitive disability is readily apparent, the trial court can resort to other pieces of evidence. Consequently, People v. Dumanon[39] pronounced that the trial court itself can determine whether a person is suffering from mental disability. People v. Dalandas[40] also recognized that the mental disability of persons and the degrees thereof may be manifested by their overt acts, appearance, attitude, and behavior.

To repeat, the trial court here made its own observation that AAA267163 was a child based on her appearance and demeanor, but failed to identify her mental age to support a conviction for statutory rape. This is significant considering that under the law then prevailing, statutory rape involved child victims who are below 12 years of age. Hence, in cases of statutory rape involving victims with cognitive deficiency, their mental age corresponding to that of a child below 12 years of age should be established.

As shown here, the mental age of AAA267163 was not proved, thus, Dela Cruz should be adjudged guilty not of statutory rape but of rape under Article 266-A paragraph 1(a) of the Revised Penal Code. To recall, Dela Cruz succeeded in having carnal knowledge of AAA267163 by using force or intimidation in the form of moral ascendancy.[41] AAA267163 called him ""Uncle Edward."" Too, the big discrepancy between their ages, i.e. 40 years old vis-à-vis 16 years old, is indicative of coercion. Further, as a full-grown adult, Dela Cruz took advantage of AAA267163, who was not only a minor but was even afflicted with cognitive disability. He even testified that he knew of her mental state ""[b]ecause she is roaming around and she is doing like this (the witness is shaking his body).""[42] He further observed that ""[i]t's like [AAA267163] doesn't have [a] mind. She is mentally disordered[.]""[43]","ACCORDINGLY, the Appeal is DENIED. The Decision dated October 28, 2022 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR HC No. 14824 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION.

Accused-appellant Eduardo Dela Cruz y Tolentino is found GUILTY of rape under Article 266-A paragraph 1(a) of the Revised Penal Code. He is sentenced to reclusion perpetua and ORDERED to PAY AAA267163 the following:

GIGANTE, UTILITY WORKER, ALL OF BRANCH 67, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, PANIQUI, TARLAC, RESPONDENTS.","The Memorandum,[1] dated February 13, 2023, issued by Court Administrator Raul B. Villanueva, Office of the Court Administrator (OCA), provides the following context:

On July 12, 2022, the Court, through an En Banc Resolution,[2] referred the letters of Maria Olympia N. Bailey (Maria Olympia) and Atty. Ana Murray Y. Santillan (Atty. Santillan) to the OCA for appropriate action.[3]

In the letter,[4] dated June 21, 2016, Spouses Arvin John Bailey (Arvin) and Maria Olympia Bailey (Spouses Bailey) sought confirmation from the OCA regarding the validity of their marriage. This arose due to a Decision, dated September 21, 2010, issued by Judge Castañeda in Civil Case No. 666-09, which declared their marriage null and void. The Spouses Bailey further stated that the Quezon City Civil Registrar refused to recognize the Decision and, consequently, did not proceed with the annulment registration. This was allegedly due to a pending administrative case against Judge Castañeda concerning annulment of marriage cases assigned to her sala. The Spouses Bailey elaborated that the Quezon City Civil Registrar refrained from pursuing the registration of their annulment due to their eventual reconciliation and Maria Olympia's subsequent pregnancy. Nevertheless, Arvin informed his company about the nullity of his marriage, which changed his status from ""married"" to ""annulled."" This modification resulted in Maria Olympia losing her status as a dependent and all contingent benefits thereof. Currently, Maria Olympia is endeavoring to obtain proof (i.e., a letter or document) from the OCA, which she intends to furnish to the legal department of Arvin's company to revert Arvin's status to married, thereby restoring her eligibility for dependent benefits.[5]

A review of the records revealed that Civil Case No. 666-09 was decided on September 21, 2010, during Judge Castañeda's suspension, but prior to her dismissal on October 9, 2012.[6]

As regards the letter,[7] dated June 5, 2018, Atty. Santillan also sought clarification on the validity of the decision rendered by Judge Castañeda during the latter's period of suspension and its legal implications on the status of Civil Case No. 595-M 2017, currently pending before Branch 10, RTC, Malolos, Bulacan. Atty. Santillan contended that the petitioner in Civil Case No. 595-M-2017 had declared in the Certificate of Non-Forum Shopping that a similar petition for the declaration of nullity of marriage had been previously filed in Judge Castañeda's court. Although Judge Castañeda decided on the petition, her decision was not recognized by the Quezon City Civil Registrar due to her suspension at that time. In the absence of any ruling on the validity of the decision, the petitioner lodged another petition for nullity of marriage in a different court in Bulacan.[8]

The records confirmed that Judge Castañeda was suspended from service effective from January 12, 2010, until October 9, 2012, when she was ultimately dismissed.[9]

In compliance with the Court En Banc's Resolution, the OCA, in its letters dated January 3, 2023, addressed to Spouses Bailey and Atty. Santillan, stated that if the cases were decided when Judge Castañeda was suspended from service, from January 12, 2010 until her dismissal on October 9, 2012, such decisions could be declared null and void or expunged by the Court. This is according to the case of Dr. Alday v. Judge Cruz, Jr.,[10] where the Court held that decisions, resolutions, orders, and other processes erroneously and improperly issued after a respondent judge was suspended from office may be declared null and void or expunged by the Court.[11] However, while the decision in Alday suggests that a judgment rendered by a judge under suspension may be declared null and void, and even expunged from the records as it cannot possibly produce any legal effect, the OCA clarified that it does not possess the authority to rule on the validity of the decision rendered by Judge Castañeda and its effect on the similar petition filed in another court. The OCA expressed that its authority is confined to the administrative supervision of lower court officials and personnel.[12]

In a recent Decision in Flores-Concepcion v. Judge Castañeda,[13] the Court dismissed the complaint against Judge Castañeda due to her demise during the pendency of the case.[14] However, the Court did not pass judgment on the validity of the decisions issued when Judge Castañeda was suspended. Consequently, the OCA advised the parties to seek judicial remedies as provided in the Rules of Court to obtain a definitive ruling on the validity of the decisions issued by Judge Castañeda.[15]

To recall, in the Resolution, dated January 27, 2015, in A.M. No. RTJ-12-2316 (OCA v. Hon. Liberty O. Castañeda, Presiding Judge, Atty. Paulino I. Saguyod, Clerk of Court, Lourdes E. Collado, Sheriff, Marylinda C. Doctor, Evelyn B. Antonio, Rosalie P. Sarsagat and Cheryl B. Esteban, Court Stenographers, George P. Clemente, Clerk, Maritoni Florian C. Cervantes, Court Interpreter, and Ruben A. Gigante, Utility Worker, All of Branch 67, Regional Trial Court, Paniqui, Tarlac), the Court resolved, among other things, to direct the OCA to conduct a thorough investigation into the specifics of each case adjudicated by former Judge Castañeda during her suspension period (i.e., from January 12, 2010 until her dismissal from the service on October 9, 2012) to identify any irregularities in the proceedings, including any instances of corruption, fraud, or bad faith involving any of the parties.[16]

Furthermore, in the subsequent Resolution, dated April 21, 2015, in A.M. No. RTJ-15-2404 (OCA v. Judge Castañeda), the Court authorized the OCA to take into custody and safeguard the records of the 1,237 cases decided by Judge Castañeda. The OCA also assigned a team to scrutinize the records of these cases and investigate them, per the Court's directive in its Resolution,[17] dated January 27, 2015, in A.M. No. RTJ-12-2316.[18] Out of the 1,237 cases, the OCA team managed to retrieve 1,194 cases that were decided by Judge Castañeda from Atty. Paulino Saguyod, Clerk of Court, Branch 67, RTC, Paniqui, Tarlac, from January 12, 2010 (the time of her suspension) to October 9, 2012 (the time of her dismissal from the service). Out of the 1,194 cases, the team examined 722 cases involving annulment or nullity of marriage. The team also noted that the most significant procedural flaws were found in cases involving Absolute Nullity or Annulment of Void Marriages.[19]","The validity of judicial decisions rendered during a judge's suspension period, particularly when such suspension spans a significant period, raises profound questions about the legitimacy and integrity of judicial acts performed during the period of incapacity. The case at hand, involving the suspension of Judge Liberty O. Castañeda (Judge Castañeda), formerly the Presiding Judge of Branch 67, Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Paniqui, Tarlac, brings to the forefront issues about the authority of a judge to continue adjudicating cases and rendering decisions that bear the gravitas of law during a period of suspension. The primary task before this Court is to determine whether the orders and decisions issued by Judge Castañeda during her suspension should stand or if they must be rendered void in order to preserve the sanctity of the judicial process.","In resolving this issue, the Court must strike a balance between safeguarding procedural integrity and upholding the rights of litigants who have relied in good faith on the decisions issued during her period of suspension. A critical guiding principle in this determination is the recognition that, while judicial authority must be exercised within legal bounds, the disruption of justice and the resultant harm to litigants cannot be overlooked. Therefore, the Court must weigh the need for procedural propriety against the broader goals of equity and justice, ensuring that the dispensation of law remains unsullied by administrative missteps and that the rights of the parties involved are protected.

The de facto officer doctrine offers a possible solution to this legal quandary. This doctrine, recognized in our jurisprudence, allows for the validation of acts performed by an individual exercising the duties of an office under color of authority, even if that person was not lawfully entitled to hold the office at the time. It exists as a rule of necessity and public policy, designed to prevent the disruption of governmental and judicial functions. It aims to protect the public and individuals who have relied on the official acts of persons performing duties with apparent authority.[20] In this regard, the de facto officer doctrine safeguards against the potential chaos that would ensue if all actions taken by improperly seated officers were to be retroactively invalidated. 
 
The Orders and Decisions issued by Judge Castañeda as a de facto officer from March 23, 2010 to June 3, 2011 are deemed valid
 

In the case of Judge Castañeda, it is undisputed that she was suspended from office from January 12, 2010 until October 9, 2012.[21] However, despite her suspension, she continued to issue decisions and orders in her capacity as Presiding Judge of Branch 67, RTC, Paniqui, Tarlac. Specifically, Judge Castañeda rendered decisions from March 23, 2010 to June 3, 2011, while no judicial acts were performed from January 12, 2010 to March 22, 2010, and from June 4, 2011 to October 9, 2012. During her active period, she adjudicated a total of 1,237 cases, raising serious concerns regarding the legality of these decisions. The Court has received several inquiries questioning the validity of these judicial acts, given that Judge Castañeda was suspended at the time and, therefore, ostensibly lacked the lawful authority to act as a judge.

Civil Service Commission v. Joson, Jr.[22] traced the historical underpinnings of the concept of a de facto officer:
The broad definition of what constitutes an officer de facto was formulated by Lord Holt in Parker v. Kent, and reiterated by Lord Ellenborough and full King's Bench in 1865 in Rex v. Bedford Level, ""One who has the reputation of being the officer he assumes and yet is not a good officer in point of law."" A de facto officer is one who is in possession of the office and discharging its duties under color of authority. By color of authority is meant that derived from an election or appointment, however irregular or informal, so that the incumbent is not a mere volunteer. The difference between the basis of the authority of a de jure officer and that of a de facto officer is that one rests on right, the other on reputation. It may be likened to the difference between character and reputation. One is the truth of a man, the other is what is thought of him. It is the color of authority, not the color of title that distinguishes an officer de facto from a usurper.[23] (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted.)
The de facto officer doctrine, grounded in principles of public policy and necessity, recognizes that while an officer may not hold valid legal title to the office, the actions they perform under the color of authority should not automatically be invalidated, particularly when the public or third parties have relied on their acts. The doctrine has been invoked to prevent disruptions in the functioning of government institutions, including the Judiciary, and to protect the public's confidence in the continuity and stability of governmental processes.[24]

In Tayko v. Capistrano,[25] the Court emphasized that the de facto officer doctrine was engrafted upon the law as a policy measure to protect the interests of the public and individuals involved in the official acts of persons exercising the duties of an officer without being lawfully entitled to do so. The Court further elaborated that it would be unreasonable to require the public to constantly question the legal title of an officer, as this would lead to confusion and uncertainty in government affairs.[26] This reasoning applies with equal force to judicial officers, whose acts carry significant legal consequences, thus:
The rightful authority of a judge, in the full exercise of his public judicial functions, cannot be questioned by any merely private suitor, nor by any other, excepting in the form especially provided by law. A judge de facto assumes the exercise of a part of the prerogative of sovereignty, and the legality of that assumption is open to the attack of the sovereign power alone. Accordingly, it is a [well-established] principle, dating from the earliest period and repeatedly confirmed by an unbroken current of decisions, that the official acts of a de facto judge are just as valid for all purposes as those of a de jure judge, so far as the public or third persons who are interested therein are concerned. The rule is the same in civil criminal cases. The principle is one founded in policy and convenience, for the right of no one claiming a title or interest under or through the proceedings of an officer having an apparent authority to act would be safe, if it were necessary in every case to examine the legality of the title of such officer up to its original source, and the title or interest of such person were held to be invalidated by some accidental defect or flaw in the appointment; election or qualification of such officer, or in the rights of those from whom his appointment or election emanated; nor could the supremacy of the laws be maintained, or their execution enforced, if the acts of the judge having a colorable, but not a legal title, were to be deemed invalid.[27] (Emphasis supplied)
The doctrine, rooted in fairness and justice, recognizes that the legal rights of individuals should not be imperiled for relying on the acts of an official who appeared to hold valid authority. Drawing from both American and Spanish legal traditions, the Court, in another case involving the authority of a judge, stated the rationale of the doctrine, thus:
It is a universally professed doctrine that the acts of judges considered such by common error, whether there be color or title or not . . . are valid and effective in favor of the public welfare. This, according to the phrase of one law, is the most humane course, one which can injure no one, and brings no discredit upon the administration of justice.[28] (Emphasis supplied)
Furthermore, in Republic v. Sereno,[29] the Supreme Court dealt with questions surrounding the validity of the acts of an officer–namely the Chief Justice–who had been allegedly unlawfully appointed. The application of the de facto officer doctrine in this case echoes its long-standing purpose: to uphold the validity of official acts performed by a person who, although later found to be unlawfully holding office, appeared to have the authority at the time of the act.

With the continuous reliance on this jurisprudential precept, the Court, in Tuanda v. Sandiganbayan,[30] required the presence of the following elements for the application of the de facto officer doctrine: (1) there must be a de jure office; (2) there must be a color of right or general acquiescence by the public; and (3) there must be actual physical possession of the office in good faith.[31] These elements were later reiterated and applied in the cases of Re: Nomination of Atty. Chaguile as Replacement for IBP Governor for Northern Luzon, Denis B. Gabawel[32] and Laud v. People.[33]

The Court finds these three elements that warrant the application of the de facto officer doctrine present in this case.","ACCORDINGLY, the Orders and Decisions rendered by Judge Liberty O. Castañeda, formerly the Presiding Judge of Branch 67, Regional Trial Court of Paniqui, Tarlac, acting as a de facto officer during her suspension from January 12, 2010 to October 9, 2012, are declared VALID. Let a copy of this Resolution be furnished to the parties concerned, and the same shall be duly entered into the records of the covered cases."
"A.C. No. 14211 [Formerly CBD 19-6078], October 29, 2024","MELINDA B. BAUTISTA-REGODOZ, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. VIVIAN G. RUBIA, RESPONDENT.","In her complaint-affidavit, Regodoz alleged that sometime in January 1998, she was referred by a church friend in Digos City to Atty. Rubia for legal assistance. Vicenta Nugas (Nugas) and Mindalina Pepino (Pepino) owed her PHP 5,000.00 and PHP 20,000.00, respectively. Both Nugas and Pepino were employees of Branch 18, Regional Trial Court, Digos City, Davao del Sur.[2]

During Regodoz's initial consultation with Atty. Rubia, she assured her that she could get back her money with interest. Atty. Rubia asked for PHP 600.00 to send the demand letters but did not issue a receipt therefor. They did not execute any written retainer agreement nor fixed the amount of legal fees for Atty. Rubia. She also informed Atty. Rubia that she could not afford the legal fees if it exceeded the amount to be collected. Atty. Rubia assured her further that the legal fees will be paid by Nugas and Pepino themselves should she win the case against them.[3]

Through the efforts of Atty. Rubia, Regodoz succeeded in getting Nugas and Pepino to acknowledge their indebtedness and sign a memorandum of agreement wherein they undertook to pay Regodoz. Eventually, however, Nugas and Pepino defaulted in their payment. Atty. Rubia consequently advised her to file a collection case before the Municipal Trial Court (MTC) of Digos City. Atty. Rubia told her that there was no need to go through the Katarungang Pambarangay as there was already a signed memorandum of agreement between her and the debtors.[4]

During the hearing held on October 7, 1999, Nugas and Pepino's counsel in the collection case interjected that the case should be dismissed on ground of misjoinder of parties. Based on her response, Atty. Rubia obviously did not know what Nugas and Pepino's affirmative defenses were. She was grossly negligent in her duty as counsel.[5]

Regodoz thereafter sent letters and made phone calls to Atty. Rubia, following up on the cases against Nugas and Pepino. But all Atty. Rubio did was send her a letter containing a shallow alibi for not communicating with her.[6]

Atty. Rubia got imported bags and goodies from Regodoz as a guarantee that she would pay for her legal services. The items she gave Atty. Rubia were all a product of her hard work when she was employed as a domestic helper in Hong Kong.[7]

Atty. Rubia did not inform Regodoz that Nugas and Pepino had already paid PHP 3,000.00 on March 31, 1998. She never received it. While the case was pending, Atty. Rubia did not advise her on the consequences of such development nor inform her of the steps to be taken. She kept asking Atty. Rubia about the status of her case but she did not receive a categorical advice.[8]

On April 23, 2015, Regodoz was alarmed by the inordinate delay in the prosecution of her case. While working in Canada at that time, she kept in touch with Atty. Rubia only through Messenger. Atty. Rubia misrepresented that she herself (Regodoz) had asked that the case be dismissed. Regodoz never made such a request. On the contrary, she requested Atty. Rubia, through registered mail and email, for copies of the case documents but her request went unheeded.[9]

It was only after she returned to the Philippines on March 16, 2018, that she was able to secure the case documents through the help of a good friend. She was able to confirm then that her case was dismissed. It was actually Atty. Rubia who moved to drop the case against Pepino due to misjoinder of parties. She was not made aware of this development. Even after the case was dismissed against Pepino, Atty. Rubia did not initiate a separate complaint despite being paid PHP 900.00 by her sister.[10]

Atty. Rubia violated her oath of fidelity to her client. Her conduct was unbecoming of a lawyer and officer of the court. She betrayed her trust and confidence, causing her injustice.[11]

By Order[12] dated September 17,2019, Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) Director for Bar Discipline Randall C. Tabayoyong directed Atty. Rubia to submit her answer within 15 days from notice.

By Order[13] dated July 30, 2020, IBP Commissioner Perpetuo T. Lucero, Jr. (Commissioner Lucero) directed the parties to submit their respective email addresses to which the subsequent notices and orders, including the invitation for video conferencing, shall be sent. This directive was issued in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. The parties were also directed to submit their mobile numbers for ease of communication.

By her Manifestation in Compliance with the Order dated July 30, 2020 and a Motion to Submit Belated Answer[14] dated November 3, 2020, Atty. Rubia submitted her email address and mobile number. She requested for an additional 15 days within which to file her answer as she had just recovered from vertigo.

On the other hand, per her Letter-Response[15] dated November 11, 2020, Regodoz manifested her compliance and waived the conduct of a mandatory conference.

In his Order[16] dated March 23, 2021, Commissioner Lucero deemed as waived the conduct of a mandatory conference. He gave the parties 15 days within which to file their respective verified position papers.

Only Regodoz submitted her Verified Position Paper[17] dated May 9, 2021.","This case arose from the Affidavit-Complaint[1] dated July 18, 2018 of complainant Melinda B. Bautista-Regodoz (Regodoz) for breach of professional responsibility, gross misconduct, gross negligence, and breach of the Lawyer's Oath against respondent Atty. Vivian G. Rubia (Atty. Rubia).","The provisions of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability (CPRA), as mandated under Section 1 of the General Provisions are applicable to the present case, thus:
SECTION 1. Transitory provision. The CPRA shall be applied to all pending and future cases, except to the extent that in the opinion of the Supreme Court, its retroactive application would not be feasible or would work injustice, in which case the procedure under which the cases were filed shall govern.
Previously, under the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR), jurisprudence imposed the penalty of suspension of varying durations on first­-time offenders of misappropriating of or failure to account for a client's funds, from six months[36] to two years,[37] depending on the discretion of the Court. If lawyers repeat the offense, compounded by other violations of the CPR, the Court meted the ultimate penalty of disbarment.[38] On the other hand, the CPRA imposes suspension for a period exceeding six months per infraction and, CPRA allows for a longer period of suspension, or even disbarment, if there are multiple infractions and/or aggravating circumstances.[39]

As for failure to file an answer or position paper before the IBP, jurisprudence, applying the CPR, considered such disobedience to the lawful orders of the IBP as conduct unbecoming of a lawyer and treated the same only as an aggravating circumstance.[40] Meanwhile, under the CPRA, disobedience of the lawful orders of the IBP are treated as a less serious offense.
 
In any event, despite the subtle distinctions of the CPR and CPRA on how Atty. Rubia's offenses are to be treated, the end result is the same. Hence, since there will be no injustice committed on Atty. Rubia by the retroactive application of the CPRA, the Court proceeds to examine Atty. Rubia's offenses and corresponding liability under the lens of the CPRA.

Notably, Commissioner Lopez-Baluyut found Atty. Rubia administratively liable for her failure to turnover to Regodoz the amount of PHP 3,000.00 as payments coming from Nugas and Pepino. As it was, however, the IBP-BOG found Atty. Rubia liable twice, one for a less serious offense and another for a serious offense. But, the IBP–BOG failed to specify the supposed acts or omissions of Atty. Rubia constituting these offenses.

After a thorough review of the records, the Court resolves to adopt the recommendation of Commissioner Lopez-Baluyut that Atty. Rubia be found liable for her failure to turnover PHP 3,000.00 to Regodoz, a breach of her fidelity to her client, which is a serious offense.

The relationship between lawyers and their clients is highly fiduciary and ascribes to lawyers a great degree of fidelity and good faith. As such, lawyers have the duty to account for the money or property they receive for or from their clients. When they receive money from a client for a particular purpose, they are bound to render an accounting of how the money was spent for the said purpose; and, in case the money was not used for the intended purpose, they must immediately return the money to the client. The failure of lawyers to return the money entrusted to them by their clients upon demand creates a presumption that they have appropriated the same for their own use.[41] Canon III, Sections 49 and 50 of the CPRA ordain:
SECTION 49. Accounting during engagement. — A lawyer, during the existence of the lawyer-client relationship, shall account for and prepare an inventory of any fund or property belonging to the client, whether received from the latter or from a third person, immediately upon such receipt.

When funds are entrusted to a lawyer by a client for a specific purpose, the lawyer shall use such funds only for the client's declared purpose. Any unused amount of the entrusted funds shall be promptly returned to the client upon accomplishment of the stated purpose or the client's demand.

SECTION 50. Separate funds. — A lawyer shall keep the funds of the clients separate and apart from his or her own and those of others kept by the lawyer.
Atty. Rubia claimed that she had already turned over to Regodoz the PHP 3,000.00 that was collected from Nugas and Pepino. But aside from this bare allegation, Atty. Rubia has not offered any substantiating evidence such as a receipt or any documentary proof. It is a basic rule in evidence that the person who alleges payment has the burden of proving that payment has indeed been made.[42] On this score, we quote with concurrence the relevant disquisition of Commissioner Lopez-Baluyut, viz.:
Complainant alleged that respondent received Three thousand eight hundred ([PHP] 3,800.00) from defendant Nugas and an amount of Two thousand pesos ([PHP] 2,000.00) from defendant Pepino. However, the two (2) Acknowledgment Receipts from Rubia Law Office both dated March 31, 1998 evidencing partial payment of their obligation show that said law office thru respondent herself received the amount of One thousand pesos ([PHP] 1,000.00) from defendant Nugas and Two thousand pesos ([PHP] 2,000.00) from defendant Pepino, respectively. Based on the conversations between the parties complainant was not informed about said payment and upon careful scrutiny of the evidence submitted, no reference can be found that respondent apprised her client or turned over said amounts to the complainant. The Complaint filed in court on June 1, 1998 is also silent as to the payments that were coursed through the respondent as the payments were not deducted [from] the amount originally claimed as obligations of the defendants to the complainant. It can be inferred that there was bad faith on the part of respondent considering that said payments were not disclosed in the complaint when payments were tendered personally to her prior to the institution of the complaint. It is established that respondent received the amount of One thousand pesos ([PHP] 1,000.00) from defendant Nugas and Two thousand pesos ([PHP] 2,000.00) from defendant Pepino, respectively. Consequently, the undersigned is convinced that respondent violated Canon 16 and Rules 16, 16.01 and 16.03 of Code of Professional Responsibility.[43]
In 1998, the sum of PHP 3,000.00 was quite substantial, when the Philippines, along with other Southeast Asian countries, was reeling from the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis. From a stable exchange rate of PHP 26.40 to a U.S. Dollar, the Philippine Peso considerably weakened by January 1998 with an exchange rate of PHP 42.70 to a U.S. Dollar. Through the sharp depreciation of the Philippine Peso, the financial system's reaction, the dramatic decline in trade, and the fall in investments, all drove the Philippine economy to the ground.[44] It should be in this economic context that Regodoz's relentless pursuit of the PHP 3,000.00 should be understood. To her, it was a substantial amount of money, and its value to her was so that she still pursued it in 2018 when she filed the administrative complaint against Atty. Rubia. Further, in 2024, the amount would be equivalent to about PHP 8,774.616.[45] Besides what should be considered here is not the mathematical value of the amount but the personal value it had to Regodoz, who earned her money while working as a domestic worker in Hong Kong.

Anent Atty. Rubia's failure to file her answer and position paper before the IBP—CBD, the Court finds her claim of depression as flimsy, if not bereft of credence. For one, her supposed state of depression has not been established. It is her mere say so. Nothing more. As it was, she has not produced any medical certificate or corroborative testimony to support such allegation. Verily, absent any valid justification, Atty. Rubia's failure or refusal to answer the complaint against her, is evidence of her contumacious attitude toward lawful orders of the court and illustrates her meager regard for her oath of office.[46]

On whether Atty. Rubia has the duty to return to Regodoz the amount of PHP 900.00 which she allegedly received from the sister of Regodoz as filing fee for a case to be refiled against Pepino, we are in accord with the observation of Commissioner Lopez-Baluyut that the narration of Regodoz with respect to the sequence of events did not jive with what actually transpired before the trial court. The complaint against Pepino was dimissed on April 6, 2004 but Regodoz claimed that Atty. Rubia was given money for the refiling of the complaint on January 20, 2000. Commissioner Lopez­ Baluyut observed that Regodoz could not have predicted that the complaint against Pepino would be dismissed in 2004 by giving money for refiling way back in 2000.[47]","ACCORDINGLY, respondent Atty. Vivian G. Rubia is:
declared GUILTY of violating Canon VI, Section 33(g) of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability. She is SUSPENDED from the practice of law for TWO YEARS;

declared GUILTY of violating Canon VI, Section 34(c) of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability. She is FINED PHP 35,000.00 and ordered to pay the same within three months from receipt of the Decision;

directed to RETURN the sum of PHP 3,000.00 to complainant Melinda B. Regodoz within three months from receipt of the Decision; and

STERNLY WARNED that future infractions shall be dealt with more severely.
Further, the Manifestation of Utmost Apology unto this Honorable Court, A Motion for Reconsideration and/or a Belated Answer dated June 20, 2024 is NOTED.

This Decision is IMMEDIATELY EXECUTORY.

Let copies of this Decision be furnished the Office of the Bar Confidant, to be appended to the personal record of respondent Atty. Vivian G. Rubia as an attorney; the Integrated Bar of the Philippines National Office and the local chapter to which she belongs, for their information and guidance; and the Office of the Court Administrator, for dissemination to all the courts in the country."
"A.M. No. RTJ-24-075 [Formerly JIB FPI No. 22-135-RTJ], October 29, 2024","ERNESTO CALLENA, JR., COMPLAINANT, VS. HON. CORPUS B. ALZATE, PRESIDING JUDGE, BRANCH 2, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, BANGUED, ABRA, RESPONDENT.","Callena claimed that from 2004 to 2021, Judge Alzate knowingly refused to pay his Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) dues. He asserts that said refusal cannot be excused simply because Judge Alzate is a judge. On the contrary, Judge Alzate should know the rules and his obligation to pay IBP dues.[3]

According to Callena, Judge Alzate sees himself as ""untouchable"" because of his connections in the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA). Too, Judge Alzate is known for his ""arrogance and self-centeredness,"" but lawyers are hesitant to complain because of their pending cases in his sala.[4]

In his Comment[5] dated May 26, 2022, Judge Alzate admitted that his name was not included in the list of qualified voters in the IBP chapter elections held on February 27, 2021. However, upon knowledge of Callena's complaint, he immediately secured an assessment of his arrears. Thereafter, he paid PHP 23,100.00 to the IBP Central Office for his IBP dues from 2004 to 2021 as evidenced by the IBP receipt dated May 24, 2022.[6]

Judge Alzate offered multiple reasons for his failure to pay his IBP dues. First. When he was a young lawyer, members of IBP Abra Chapter told him that one of the candidates in the IBP elections sponsored the payment of IBP dues for members of the chapter. Second. Whenever there were no ""sponsors"", he would pay his IBP dues to the chapter. But there was a time the IBP Abra Chapter did not remit payments to the IBP Central Office. When the non-remittance was discovered, he was told that the payment records would be reconciled. As years passed by, no reconciliation of accounts was made which resulted in him forgetting about his IBP dues. Third. One Judge Conrado Venus of Regional Trial Court, Narvacan advised him that when a lawyer employed in the government service fails to pay his IBP dues, the arrears would automatically be deducted from his or her retirement pay or from his or her earned leaves. Judge Alzate merely relied on said advice in utmost ""good faith.""[7]

Judge Alzate also pointed out that he never received any notice of delinquency or any resolution to suspend his member's privileges from the IBP Central Office.[8] Lastly, Judge Alzate denied having strong connections to the OCA.[9]

In his Reply[10] dated June 20, 2022, Callena disputed the ""tall tales"" of Judge Alzate. He asserted that Judge Alzate's excuses were merely an attempt to justify his ""deliberate [and] stubborn"" refusal to pay IBP dues despite being a lawyer for 37 years and a judge for 22 years.[11] In any event, Judge Alzate admitted his non-payment of IBP dues. He also chided Judge Alzate for paying his dues only after receiving an administrative complaint.[12]

More, Judge Alzate has been found guilty in the following administrative cases: (1) OCA IPI No. 03-1745-RTJ; (2) OCA IPI No. 15-4479-RTJ; and (3) A.M. No. RTJ-19-2574. Callena averred that the Supreme Court had been ""very compassionate with [Judge Alzate]"" despite his repeated acts of misconduct since the latter had only ever been admonished and fined.[13]

Judge Alzate in his Rejoinder[14] dated July 4, 2022 surmised that Callena's reply may have been authored by Atty. Maria Saniata Liwliwa Gonzales-Alzate (Atty. Gonzales-Alzate), counsel of Callena and wife of dismissed Judge Raphiel F. Alzate, a relative of his.[15] He alleged that Atty. Gonzales-Alzate had become ""ballistic"" since the dismissal of her husband from the Judiciary.[16]

In a Letter[17] dated June 16, 2022, the Judicial Integrity Board – Office of the Executive Director (JIB-OED) directed Judge Alzate to submit a verified comment ""concerning the administrative case against [him] as a member of the Philippine Bar.""[18] It cited Rule 140 of the Rules of Court, as amended, viz.:
Section 4. Administrative Case Considered as Disciplinary Actions Against Members of the Philippine Bar. – An administrative case against any of those mentioned in Section 1(1) of this Rule shall also be considered as a disciplinary action against [them] as a member of the Philippine Bar, provided, that the complaint specifically states that the imputed acts or omissions therein likewise constitute a violation of the Lawyer's Oath, the Code of Professional Responsibility, the Canons of Professional Ethics, or such other forms of breaches of conduct that have been traditionally recognized as grounds for the discipline of lawyers.
In response, Judge Alzate filed his Manifestation[19] dated July 5, 2022 where he: (1) averred that the administrative case against him should be dismissed for violation of the rule against forum shopping; and (2) adopted the contents of his Comment and Rejoinder.[20]","Under a verified Affidavit-Complaint[1] dated May 18, 2021, complainant Ernesto Callena, Jr. (Callena) charged respondent Hon. Corpus B. Alzate (Judge Alzate), Presiding Judge, Branch 2, Regional Trial Court, Bangued, Abra with simple misconduct constituting a violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct.[2","The Court resolves to adopt the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations of the JIB in its Report dated July 30, 2024.

In administrative proceedings, the quantum of proof necessary for a finding of guilt is substantial evidence or ""that amount of relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.""[33] The burden of substantiating the charges in an administrative proceeding falls on the complainant, who must be able to prove the allegations in the complaint with substantial evidence.[34]

Rule 139-A, Section 1 of the Rules of Court provides that all persons whose names appear or are included in the Roll of Attorneys compose an official body known as the Integrated Bar of the Philippines.[35] Membership in the IBP is automatic and without exception.[36] Every member of the Integrated Bar is required to pay annual dues for the ensuing fiscal year on or before the 31st day of December, as may be extended by the IBP Board of Governors.[37] There is nothing in the law or rules which allows the exemption of any person—much more for members of the bench such as Judge Alzate—from payment of IBP dues.[38]

Here, Judge Alzate admitted in his various submissions to the JIB that he failed to pay his IBP dues from 2004-2021.[39] He stated that:
Immediately after I received the instant complaint, I have undertaken steps to secure an assessment of my arrears and have PAID the IBP Central Office the amount of [PHP 23,100.00] corresponding to my dues from 2004-2021. . .

Admittedly, I have arrears with the IBP (which I have NOW PAID) but the non-payment is a mental lapse. I was under the belief that the advice of a senior judge was true. I relied on this belief in utmost good faith. Thus, the non-payment cannot be considered as a stubborn or arrogant refusal to pay[.]

Mr. Callena aver[s] that I only paid my delinquent dues when this complaint was filed. This is admitted. . .

Admittedly, I have been remiss in my duty to pay my dues on time. . .

. . . .

To emphasize, the non-payment on my part was based on an honest belief; I may be mistaken in assuming that the dues will be paid with interest at the time of retirement but this mistake was done in good faith and not tainted with an evil scheme to defraud the IBP. (Emphasis supplied)
These statements are judicial admissions that require no further proof[40] and remove the admitted facts from the field of controversy.[41] Thus, Judge Alzate's non-payment of IBP dues is beyond dispute.

In any event, the record is replete with documentary evidence of Judge Alzate's malfeasance. In a Letter[42] dated March 22, 2021, IBP National Treasurer Grace P. Quevedo-Panagsagan certified that ""Alzate, Corpus B."" with Roll No. 33514 had ""arrears in IBP Membership Dues"" from 2004-2021. By Certification[43] dated May 20, 2022, Marnelli A. Acosta, Legal Aid Clerk of IBP Abra Chapter, attested that based on the records of IBP Abra Chapter and its List of Members with Delinquencies issued by the IBP National Office, Judge Alzate has not paid his IBP dues for a period of 18 years. Lastly, IBP Official Receipt No. 224392 dated May 24, 2022 submitted by Judge Alzate shows that his payment of PHP 23,100.00 was ""Payment For M[embership] D[ues] 2004-2021.""[44]","ACCORDINGLY, Judge Corpus B. Alzate is found GUILTY of the less serious charge of simple misconduct under Section 15(a), Rule 140 of the Rules of Court, as amended by Administrative Matter No. 21-08-09-SC and FINED in the amount of PHP 150,000.00 payable within three months from the promulgation of this Decision. If unpaid, such amount may be deducted from his salaries and benefits, including accrued leave credits.

Judge Alzate is also found GUILTY of violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability. He is FINED in the amount of PHP 50,000.00 payable within three months from the promulgation of this Decision. Finally, he is STERNLY WARNED that a repetition of the same or similar offense will be dealt with more severely.

Lastly, Judge Alzate is directed to update his IBP membership dues and report his compliance within 10 days from receipt of this Decision."
"G.R. No. 259982, October 28, 2024","PACIFIC OCEAN MANNING, INC. AND/OR V. SHIPS UK LTD./NORDIC AMERICAN TANKERS LIMITED, PETITIONERS, VS. NICOLAS F. BOBILES, RESPONDENT.","On January 27, 2017, Bobiles inspected ... the welded pumps and found that the equipment needs servicing. When he lifted the equipment to be fixed in the work area, he felt something which snapped his back nerves. The impact caused pain which radiated from his shoulder down to his waist. The Master, who was advised on the condition of Bobiles who became incapable to work, requested a medical service from CIRM in Italy.

An advisory was given to the Master to prescribe him with several oral medications. Bobiles was also advised to stay in his cabin to take a rest. Despite the pain relievers, his back remained stiff including his waist. He was practically immobile because of the intense and piercing pain through his back. With this condition, Bobiles remained in his cabin for two weeks.

On February 6, 2017, when Bobiles was able to regain some level of comfort, he tried his best to return to duty but the excruciating pain prevented him from assuming his functions. As a result, Bobiles was advised to stay in his cabin to continue his bed rest... He religiously took medicines as advised and despite oral medications, Bobiles continued to be in severe pain.

On February 27, 2017, when the vessel arrived in Vadinar, India, Bobiles was disembarked upon the advice of the Master. He was brought to Divya Orthopaedic Hospital & Physiotherapy Center where he was attended by Dr. Niraj Vora, an orthopedic specialist who recommended Bobiles to undergo X-Ray and MRI on his Lumbosacral Spine. After undergoing the procedures, he was found to have ""L2-L3"" Instability. Dr. Vora prescribed medications and recommended for his repatriation.

Bobiles arrived in the Philippines on February 28, 2017 and he reported to his manning agent and was referred to Marine Medical Clinic, Manila. He was later endorsed to Cardinal Santos Medical Center, San Juan City and was attended by Dr. Robert Lim who advised [him] to undergo MRI on his lumbar spines.

On March 2, 2017, [per] the MRI, Bobiles was found to have severe injury on his lumbar spine described as ""At L4-5, there is a mild disc bulge with a superimposed 3x10 mm central and bilateral paracentral disc protrusion effacing the ventral thecal sa. No nerve root impingement seen; Minimal L2-3 and L3-4 disc bulges.""

These findings were identical to the previous diagnosis of the company doctor in India.

On March 8, 2017, Bobiles, per advice by Dr. Lim, underwent EMG-NCV. On April 21, 2017, the company doctor issued a diagnosis that Bobiles was suffering from ""L4-L5 Disc Herniation, 15 Radiculopathy."" With these findings, Bobiles was advised to undergo physiotherapy program. He underwent therapy at the Marine Medical Services from April 22, 2017 up to May 18, 2017, which was extended until June 13, 2017. Despite the therapies, Bobiles showed no favorable prognosis and so the therapy was extended on a month to month basis.

... Bobiles sought a second opinion from Dr. Manuel Fidel M. Magtira, MD... Dr. Magtira advised him to undergo laboratory test and examinations. Thus, Dr. Magtira issued a Medical Certificate dated October 30, 2017, pertinent portions of which states:
""Mr. Bobiles still continue[s] to have pain and discomfort on his lower back. He is unable to tolerate prolonged walking and standing. He has not regained his usual capacity. Being a [s]eaman, his works demands are heavy. Since the time of his injury he is unable to work at his previous occupation. Mr. Bobiles is UNFIT to work back as a seaman. He is now permanently disabled.

....
Bobiles claims that he lost the possibility of being employed as a seaman as he cannot tolerate the pain because of the injury...

... [POMI] maintains that ... based on his lumbosacral MRI result, which only showed mild disc bulges, patient is not permanently unfit to sea duties because he may improve over time. Thus, on September 4, 201[7], a final disability assessment of Grade 11 (slight rigidity or 1/3 loss of lifting power of the trunk) was determined by the company doctor... Bobiles refused the offer but never presented any 2nd contrary medical report.

[G]rievance proceedings ensued. [POMI] was willing to refer [Bobiles] to a 3rd doctor; however, Bobiles' representative moved to terminate the proceedings ""for failure to reach amicable settlement."" ...

Bobiles prays that [POMI] be ordered to pay him US$102,308.00 for total permanent disability, [USD] 4,000.00 for unpaid sick wages, [P]500,000.00 for actual and exemplary damages, plus 10% of the award for attorney's fees...

[POMI] prays for the dismissal of the case for utter lack of merit, with cost against Bobiles. In the alternative, [POMI] is willing to pay Bobiles the amount of [USD] 7,465.00 based on the Grade 11 disability assessment of the company designated physician.

... [POMI] maintains that the injury sustained by Bobiles was not a result of an accident, thus not covered by the CBA, and that damages and attorney's fees are not recoverable.[5] (Brackets and italics in the original)
On August 21, 2018, the NCMB issued a Decision in favor of Bobiles. It found that the appointment of a third doctor is not a condition sine qua non to the filing of a complaint for permanent total disability benefits and that his disability is total and permanent. Moreover, it ruled that the disability compensation rates in the CBA should be taken into consideration since they are more favorable to the seafarers. The dispositive portion reads:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment [i]s hereby rendered ordering [petitioners] to jointly and severally pay [Bobiles] the amount of US$102,308.00 as his total permanent disability compensation, plus attorney's fees equivalent to ten percent (10%) of the total monetary award or in their Philippine peso equivalent at the prevailing exchange rate at the actual date of payment.","Over the years, the Court has vacillated on the award of attorney's fees on the basis of Article 111 of the Labor Code and Article 2208 of the Civil Code in worker disability indemnification cases. We clarify that attorney's fees under Article 111 of the Labor Code are recoverable only where there is unlawful withholding of wages, not in cases involving only indemnification claims for disability or death. Anent attorney's fees under Article 2208(2) of the Civil Code, it is not sufficient that the plaintiff be compelled to litigate or incur expense to protect their interest. The litigation or incurrence of expense must be in relation to third persons. A contrary rule would make entitlement to attorney's fees the general rule instead of the exception and would negate the policy against placing a premium on the right to litigate. Finally, attorney's fees under Article 2208(8) of the Civil Code are recoverable only in actions for indemnity under workmen's compensation and employer's liability laws, not under contract.","It is likewise erroneous to base an award of attorney's fees on Article 2208(8) of the Civil Code for the mere reason that the case involves an action for indemnity for disability since said paragraph applies only when the action is under workmen's compensation and employer's liability laws.

Prior to the effectivity of Presidential Decree No. 442 or the Labor Code, workmen's compensation and employer's liability were governed by the Workmen's Compensation Act or Act No. 3428[46] and the Employer's Liability Act or Act No. 1874[47], respectively.[48] With their repeal by the Labor Code, workmen's compensation was thenceforth governed by Title II, Book IV of said Code titled Employee's Compensation and State Insurance Fund.[49] In the case at bench, however, the action for indemnity is not based on the workmen's compensation provisions of the Labor Code or any employer liability law for that matter, but on contract, specifically, the POEA-SEC. Hence, Article 2208(8) of the Civil Code finds no application here.

Since neither Article 111 of the Labor Code nor Article 2208(2) and (8) of the Civil Code apply, may the catch-all provision of Article 2208(11) justify an award of attorney's fees in this case? Our ruling in Estate of Buan v. Camaganacan[50] is instructive:
The exercise of judicial discretion in the award of attorney's fees under Article 2208(11) of the Civil Code demands a factual, legal, or equitable justification upon the basis of which the court exercises, its discretion. Without such justification, the award is a conclusion without a premise, its basis being improperly left to speculation and conjecture.[51]
Other than the bare statement that respondent was forced to litigate to enforce his rights, no factual, legal, or equitable justification was proffered to warrant attorney's fees. Au contraire, since petitioners covered all of respondent's treatment costs, as well as full sickness allowances, it is only equitable under the circumstances to delete the award of attorney's fees.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is PARTLY GRANTED. The July 15, 2021 Decision and March 22, 2022 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA­-G.R. SP No. 158388 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION in that the award of USD 60,000.00 or its equivalent in Philippine pesos shall be subject to 6% legal interest per annum from the finality of this Decision until full payment, and that the award of attorney's fees is DELETED."
"OCA-IPI No. 18-4887-RTJ, October 28, 2024","MARIA MAGDALENA R. JOVEN, COMPLAINANT, VS. HON. MONIQUE A. QUISUMBING-IGNACIO, PRESIDING JUDGE, BRANCH 209, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, MANDALUYONG CITY, VICTOR M. PE BENITO, SHERIFF IV, AND ALFREDO MARCELO BERMEJO, ADMINISTRATIVE AIDE IV, ALL OF BRANCH 209, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, MANDALUYONG CITY, RESPONDENTS.","The facts of the case are lifted from the Report[3] of the Judicial Integrity Board (JIB), as follows:
Anna Marie Sison (Sison), represented by her attorney-in-fact, Rosario de Silva Perion (Perion), filed the complaint in the Civil Case to recover possession of a parcel of land situated in Mandaluyong City, and covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 008-201000489. [Joven] was the defendant in the Civil Case.

During the hearing in the Civil Case on March 20, 2018, Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio tackled [two] incidents raised by the parties, i.e., Sison's motion for the issuance of Writ of Preliminary Mandatory Injunction (Writ of Injunction); and [Joven]'s Omnibus Motion to Dismiss, which was incorporated in her verified Answer with Affirmative and Special Defenses with Counterclaim.

During the hearing on the motion for the issuance of the Writ of Injunction, [Joven]'s counsel objected to portions of Perion's testimony, as narrated in her Judicial Affidavit for being leading and without basis. Thus, in her March 20, 2018 Order, Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio directed Perion: to file her ""Comment on the Motion to Strike Out Certain Portions of the Judicial Affidavit of [Perion] (Motion to Strike Out),"" which was made in open court; to file her Formal Offer of Evidence (FOE) relative to the motion for the issuance of a Writ of Injunction; and to file her Opposition to [Joven]'s Motion to Dismiss within [five] days therefrom, or until March 26, 2018. [Joven], on the other hand, was directed to file her Comment on the FOE, and to file her Reply to the Opposition, to be filed by Perion, within the same number of days from receipt thereof.

However, Perion filed her Opposition and her Comment to [Joven]'s Motion to Strike Out only on March 27, 2018. Thus, in her Reply, [Joven] also included therein a Motion to Expunge Comment/Opposition (Motion to Expunge).

In its May 9, 2018 Notice of Pre-Trial Conference, RTC Branch 209 scheduled the Pre-Trial Conference (Pre-Trial) on May 15, 2018, directing the parties in the Civil Case to submit their respective pre-trial briefs at least [three] days before the scheduled hearing, among others.
 
During the Pre-Trial on May 15, 2018, only Perion's counsel appeared. Moreover, it was only then that she submitted the required pre­-trial brief, without furnishing [Joven] or her counsel with a copy thereof. [Joven], on the other hand, submitted her pre-trial brief earlier on time and was present in court. Accordingly, [Joven]'s counsel moved for the outright dismissal of the case. However, Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio did not immediately rule on the motion and instead declared that the Civil Case should be first referred to mediation and Judicial Dispute Resolution.

In her May 15, 2018 Order, Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio cancelled the pre-trial and declared as submitted, the following motions of [Joven] for resolution: Omnibus Motion to Dismiss; Motion to Strike Out; and the open court Motion to Dismiss on the ground of plaintiffs (as represented by Perion) absence during the pre-trial and failure to submit a copy of the pre­trial brief on time.

[Joven] alleged that on May 30, 2018, she received [three] separate Orders from the RTC: the May 21, 2018 Order, denying all of Joven's motion to strike out certain portions of Perion's Judicial Affidavit; another May 21, 2018 Order, granting Perion's FOE; and the May 22, 2018 Order, denying [Joven]'s Omnibus Motion to Dismiss. [Joven] observed that in the issuance of the said Orders, Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio justified the shortcomings and corrected the errors in the pleadings filed by Perion.

In her June 4, 2018 Order, Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio denied [Joven]'s open court Motion to Dismiss the Civil Case, stating therein that Perion substantially complied with the requirements of the Rules of Court and that, since an earlier case involving the same subject matter was dismissed due to technicalities, the present Civil Case should now be decided on the merits. Thereafter, the Pre-Trial in the Civil Case was reset to July 24, 2018.

In a separate June 4, 2018 Order, Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio granted Perion's motion for the issuance of a Writ of Injunction, conditioned on her posting and court's approval of a bond in the amount of [PHP] 100,000.00.

On June 6, 2018, [Joven] was furnished with a copy of Perion's pleading [titled] ""Compliance (with Very Urgent Request for Approval and Issuance of Writ of Preliminary Mandatory Injunction)"" (Compliance with Request for WPI). Attached thereto as ""Annex A"" is a copy of the June 4, 2018 Order. [Joven] alleged that she was confused as to the nature of the said pleading as she had not yet received any court issuance relative to Perion's prayer for a Writ of Injunction.

In her June 7, 2018 Order, Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio issued the Writ of Preliminary Injunction.

On June 19, 2018, [Joven] filed a Motion for Reconsideration with Motion for Voluntary Inhibition. [Joven] claimed that she received copies of the [two] June 4, 2018 Orders only on June 13, 2018 through mail, while Perion received the same on June 5, 2018. [Joven] insisted that the belated receipt of the Orders effectively prevented her from pursuing the judicial remedies available to her.
 
[Joven] found it highly unusual that the Writ of Injunction was issued the day after Perion's filing of her Compliance with Request for WPI, essentially denying her the chance to oppose it. In addition, [Joven] also observed that all of her motions relative thereto were denied, while Perion's lone pleading, was immediately granted. [Joven] asserted that Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio's bias and partiality were further manifested when orders were sent to her through registered mail while those sent to Perion were served personally, despite the fact the offices of the counsels for both parties are in Mandaluyong City.

Since the Writ of Injunction was already issued, [Joven] filed a Motion to Recall Writ of Preliminary Injunction with Motion for Voluntary Inhibition (Motion to Recall), setting the hearing thereof on July 10, 2018. On that day, however, the scheduled hearing was reset to July 24, 2018 due to the delay in the delivery of the pertinent pleadings through regular mail.

On July 24, 2018, during the supposed hearing on [Joven]'s Motion to Recall, Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio ordered the parties to proceed with the pre-trial instead. [Joven]'s counsel at the time was appearing only by way of special appearance, for the sole purpose of her Motion to Recall. Nonetheless, the said counsel was ordered to read the pre-trial briefs already submitted so they could proceed with the pre-trial conference. Thereafter, Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio issued the Pre-Trial Order and set the trial dates for the plaintiffs presentation of evidence without referring the Civil Case for mediation or Judicial Dispute Resolution.

In her August 10, 2018 Order, Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio directed [Joven] to show cause why she should not be cited in contempt of court for disobeying the directives stated in the Writ of Injunction, which the latter received on August 13, 2018. From the records, it appears that the Writ of Injunction was served upon [Joven] on June 18, 2018.

In her August 17, 2018 Manifestation and Compliance, by way of response to the August 10, 2018 Order, [Joven] explained that due to the pendency of several incidents, the implementation of the Writ of Injunction should be suspended. Further, she stated that Sheriff Pe Benito did not go to her house for its implementation. In addition, [Joven] informed the court that her counsel of record just withdrew his appearance and she would need time to get a new one. Moreover, Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio has yet to refer the case to mediation or Judicial Dispute Resolution.

[Joven] opined that Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio was bent on having her evicted from the subject property, hence, her inaction on the pending incidents.

Thereafter, [Joven] filed a Motion To Set the Hearing for Judicial Dispute Resolution and Motion for Inhibition. [Joven] argued in the motion for inhibition that [Bermejo], who was detailed to RTC Branch 209 by the City of Mandaluyong, is related to Perion's counsel, Atty. Roberto C. Bermejo (Atty. Bermejo), thus, Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio cannot be expected to handle the Civil Case fairly. The hearing on both motions was set on a September 7, 2018, but was rescheduled on September 11, 2018.
 
In her September 11, 2018 Order, Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio referred the Civil Case to mediation. Upon the conclusion of the mediation hearing on September 18, 2018, [Joven] was immediately arrested by the police as soon as she exited the court room pursuant to a Warrant of Arrest issued by Judge Quisumbing-lgnacio on September 6, 2018 for [i]ndirect [c]ontempt of [c]ourt for her refusal to comply with the Writ of Injunction.

In her September 13, 2018 Order, Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio denied [Joven]'s motion for bail and ruled that the latter shall remain imprisoned until the directives of the Writ of Injunction are obeyed.

Finally, [Joven] concluded that the collective acts of the respondents in the case at bar caused her undue injury, and are in violation of Republic Act No. 3019 or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.

In her Comment, respondent Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio prayed for the immediate dismissal of the [C]omplaint for lack of merit, stressing at the outset, that in her October 8, 2018 Order, she had already inhibited from the Civil Case, as prayed for by [Joven] in the latter's several motions for inhibition.

Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio denied that she was merely getting back at [Joven], for the latter's filing of the instant administrative case when she issued the herein assailed Orders. She pointed out that she received the October 18, 2018 1st Indorsement from the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA), directing her to file her Comment on the letter of complaint, sometime in November 2018, while all of the Orders relative to the Civil Case, as assailed by [Joven] were issued prior to that date.","Before this Court is a Letter-Complaint[1] and Supplemental Complaint[2] (collectively, Complaint) filed by Maria Magdalena R. Joven (Joven) charging respondents Hon. Monique Quisumbing-Ignacio (Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio), Presiding Judge, Victor Pe Benito (Sheriff Pe Benito), Sheriff IV, and Alfredo Marcelo Bermejo (Bermejo), Administrative Aide IV, all of Branch 209, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Mandaluyong City, with gross ignorance of the law, gross misconduct, conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service, and violations of the New Code of Judicial Conduct, relative to Civil Case No. R-MND-18-00315-CV, titled ""Anna Marie Sison, represented by Attorney-in-Fact Rosario de Silva Perion v. Magdalena R. Joven (and all persons claiming rights under her),"" a case for recovery of property with prayer for the issuance of preliminary mandatory injunction (the Civil Case).","We adopt the recommendation of the JIB.

Time and again, this Court has ruled that the filing of an administrative complaint is not the proper remedy for every action of a judge considered ""aberrant or irregular"" especially when a judicial remedy exists.[7]

A perusal of the records of the case clearly shows that complainant Joven resorted to the filing of this administrative case merely to get back at Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio for the latter's alleged bias and partiality emanating from her denial of Joven's motions. However, what Joven failed to understand is that the assailed issuances of Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio were issued in the exercise of her judicial discretion, which is beyond the realm of administrative proceedings.

In Biado v. Hon. Brawner-Cualing,[8] this Court held that:
""[A]n administrative complaint is not the appropriate remedy for every act of a Judge deemed aberrant or irregular where a judicial remedy exists and is available."" It must be underscored that ""the acts of a judge in [their] judicial capacity are not subject to disciplinary action."" [They] cannot be civilly, criminally, or administratively liable for [their] official acts, ""no matter how erroneous,"" provided [they act] in good faith.[9] (Citations omitted)
In Bello III v. Judge Diaz,[10] We ruled that ""disciplinary proceedings against judges do not complement, supplement or substitute judicial remedies, whether ordinary or extraordinary. An inquiry into their administrative liability arising from judicial acts may be made only after other available remedies have been settled.""[11]

Likewise, in Ala v. Judge Peras,[12] We ruled that:
Until and unless there is an authoritative pronouncement that the questioned orders of the respondent Judges were indeed tainted by anomaly, there would be no ground to prosecute the respondent Judges, either administratively or criminally, for rendering them. Thus, an administrative complaint is not the appropriate remedy for every act of a judge deemed aberrant or irregular where a judicial remedy exists and is available, for if subsequent developments prove the judge's challenged act to be correct, there would be no occasion to proceed against [them] at all. Thus, the charges being judicial in nature, the remedy of the complainant should have been with the proper court/or the appropriate judicial action and not with the OCA by means of an administrative complaint.[13] (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)
From the foregoing, the alleged errors raised by Joven pertain to Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio's exercise of judicial discretion. Hence, these cannot be the proper subject of an administrative complaint but must be addressed through appropriate judicial remedies.

In fact, as correctly noted by the JIB, Joven filed a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 before the Court of Appeals (CA) on September 17, 2018, docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 157587, assailing the issuances of Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio. The CA dismissed the petition for being filed out of time.[14] Clearly, Joven was aware of the available judicial remedies for her case. This bolsters the fact that her resort to the present administrative complaint is improper.

Moreover, We emphasize that complainant Joven miserably failed to substantiate her claims that Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio acted in bad faith, and with bias and partiality through substantial evidence or such amount of relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion, even if other equally reasonable minds might conceivably opine otherwise.[15] The standard of substantial evidence is satisfied when there is reasonable ground to believe that respondent is responsible for the misconduct complained of, even if such evidence might not be overwhelming or even preponderant.[16]

Bad faith and malice cannot be presumed just because the judgment or order rendered by a Judge is adverse to the complainant.[17]

In Sampiano v. Judge Indar,[18] this Court defined bad faith in this wise:
Bad faith does not simply connote bad judgment or negligence; it imputes a dishonest purpose or some moral obliquity and conscious doing of a wrong; a breach of a sworn duty through some motive or intent or ill-will; it partakes of the nature of fraud. It contemplates a state of mind affirmatively operating with furtive design or some motive of self-interest or ill-will for ulterior purposes. Evident bad faith connotes a manifest deliberate intent on the part of the accused to do wrong or cause damage.[19] (Citation omitted)
Before a judge can be held liable for deliberately rendering an unjust judgment or order, one must be able to show that such judgment or order is unjust and that it was issued with malicious intent to cause injustice to the aggrieved party.[20] In administrative proceedings, the burden of proof rests on the complainant, who must be able to support and prove by substantial evidence his or her accusations against respondent. This Joven failed to do. Apart from her bare allegations, Joven failed to produce any evidence that would show that the assailed orders and issuances were issued without basis, and with manifest partiality. Adequate proof, not mere conjectures or speculations, should be offered. Otherwise, the same deserves no consideration at all.

Anent Joven's allegations against Sheriff Pe Benito and Bermejo, she likewise failed to prove the same through substantial evidence. Sheriff Pe Benito's participation in the Civil Case was limited to his ministerial duty of serving the writ of injunction, and the September 6, 2018 Order upon Joven. With regard to Bermejo, Joven failed to show how his relation to Atty. Bermejo was a factor in the issuance of Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio's assailed issuances.","ACCORDINGLY, the Complaint for gross ignorance of the law, gross misconduct, conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service, and violations of the New Code of Judicial Conduct against Hon. Monique A. Quisumbing-Ignacio, Presiding Judge, Victor Pe Benito, Sheriff IV, and Alfredo Marcelo Bermejo, Administrative Aide IV, all of Branch 209, Regional Trial Court, Mandaluyong City, is DISMISSED for lack of merit and for being judicial in nature."
"G.R. No. 270149, October 23, 2024","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES. PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. XXX270149, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.*","The instant case stemmed from an Information[5] filed against XXX270149, the accusatory portion of which reads:
That on or about 16th day of February 2015 in the xxxxxxxxxxx, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, exercising moral ascendancy, influence and parental authority over his daughter, [AAA270149], a six (6) year old minor, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have sexual intercourse with the latter, by inserting his penis inside her vagina, against her will and without her consent, to her damage and prejudice.

That the crime is qualified by the aggravating circumstance of relationship, the accused being the parent and/or biological father of the minor victim.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[6] (Emphasis in the original)
On November 20, 2019, the City Prosecutor of xxxxxxxxxxx originally charged XXX270149 with rape, which was docketed as Criminal Case No. FC-15-1707. The said case was dismissed for lack of authority of the signing prosecutor in accordance with Rule 112, Section 4 of the Rules of Court.[7] Upon securing the proper authority, the case was re-filed on December 12, 2019 and re-docketed as Criminal Case No. FC-19-3112.[8]

Upon arraignment, XXX270149 pleaded not guilty to the crime charged. Pre-trial was conducted, then trial on the merits ensued.[9] During pre-trial, the parties both stipulated that XXX270149 is the biological father of AAA270149.[10]

AAA270149 narrated that her parents are separated, and she lived with her father, XXX270149. On February 16, 2015, they went to the house of XXX270149's friend, Joey Amboyao (Joey), in xxxxxxxxxxx for a drinking session. Joey's wife, Melody Amboyao (Melody), their children, and AAA270149 were inside their house, while he and XXX270149 were drinking in their porch.[11]

AAA270149 went to the bathroom to defecate and then called XXX270149 to help her clean up. When XXX270149 was inside the bathroom with AAA270149, he removed his brief and AAA270149's panty, then he inserted his finger into AAA270149's vagina. Afterwards, she made AAA270149 lean on a cement wall inside the bathroom. XXX270149 was behind AAA270149 and inserted his penis into her vagina. She cried because it was so painful and uttered the words ""aray ko papa, tama na."" AAA270149 noted that while XXX270149 was doing these things to her, Melody was near the bathroom.

Melody testified that she sensed that something bad was happening to AAA270149, so she went inside the bathroom. When she brushed the curtain aside, she was surprised to see AAA270149's underwear on her feet, and XXX270149 was behind AAA270149 with his underwear down to his knees, and his penis was inside AAA270149's vagina.[12] Melody immediately ordered AAA270149 to go to her room, and when Melody checked her underwear, she saw blood stains on it.

Meanwhile, XXX270149 immediately went back to the porch where he was drinking liquor with Joey. Afterwards, Melody brought AAA270149 to Marilyn Tan (Marilyn), a social worker in their area. Marilyn also saw the blood stains on AAA270149's underwear. Then, they went to the police station to report the incident.[13]

Joey corroborated the testimony of Melody. He testified that XXX270149 asked him where AAA270149 was. Joey responded that AAA270149 went with Melody to buy some drinks. XXX270149 immediately ran away, and when Joey chased him, they engaged into a fist fight until the barangay tanods arrived to pacify them. XXX270149 was then brought to the barangay hall, and later to the police station.[14]

For his part, XXX270149 admitted that he is AAA270149's father, but denied the accusation against him. He testified that he went to the house of his friend Joey, with his daughter, to cook dog's meat. Joey asked him to climb a coconut tree to get a coconut, which they would use in cooking dog's meat. When he was at the top of the coconut tree, he heard his daughter AAA270149 calling him, so he immediately went down from the tree. Upon reaching down, Joey boxed him, so he ran away, leaving his daughter behind.[15]

In its Judgment,[16] the RTC found XXX270149 guilty of qualified rape, disposing as follows:
WHEREFORE, the Court finds accused [XXX270149] GUILTY of Qualified Rape under Article 266-A[,] paragraph 1(d), as qualified under Article 266-B of the RPC, as amended, and hereby imposes upon him the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA, without eligibility for parole, pursuant to Section 3 of [Republic Act] No. 9346.

The accused is likewise ordered to pay of [PHP] 100,000.00 as civil indemnity; [PHP] 100,000.00 as moral damages; and [PHP] 100,000.00 as exemplary damages, with interest at the rate of 6% per annum counted from the date of finality of this judgment until fully paid.","This Court resolves an Appeal[1] assailing the Decision[2] of the Court of Appeals (CA), which affirmed the Judgment[3] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) convicting XXX270149 of violation of Article 266-A in relation to Article 266-B(1) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended.[4]","The Appeal is bereft of merit.

Preliminary, as a rule, only questions of law, and not questions of fact, can be raised in a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. This Court, not being a trier of facts, is not duty-bound to re-examine and calibrate the evidence on record. It will not entertain questions of fact as the factual findings of the appellate courts are ""final, binding, or conclusive on the parties and upon this Court when supported by substantial evidence.""[22]

After a careful review of the records of this case, this Court finds no cogent reason to reverse the ruling of the CA. Time and again, this Court has ruled that the ""trial court's factual findings, especially its assessment of the credibility of witnesses, are accorded great weight and respect and binding upon this Court, particularly when affirmed by the CA.""[23]

Articles 266-A and 266-B(1) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 8353, state:
ARTICLE 266-A. Rape: When and How Committed. — Rape is committed:

1) By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:
a) Through force, threat, or intimidation;

b) When the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious;

c) By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority; and

d) When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present.
Article 266-B. Penalties. — Rape under paragraph 1 of the next preceding article shall be punished by reclusion perpetua.

....

The death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following attendant circumstances:
1) When the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, [stepparent], guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim[.]
Under Article 266-A(1) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, the elements of rape are:
(1) the offender is a man who had carnal knowledge of a woman; and (2) he accomplished such act through force or intimidation upon her; or she is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; or she is under 12 years of age or is demented. The gravamen of rape is carnal knowledge or sexual intercourse with a woman against her will or without her consent.[24] (Citation omitted)
In People v. Tulagan,[25] this Court held that if the victim of the sexual abuse is below 12 years old, the offender should be prosecuted for statutory rape under Article 266-A(d) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended. Here, AAA270149 was below 12 years old when the rape incident happened.

More, rape is qualified when the victim is under 18 years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, stepparent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim. The elements of qualified rape are: (1) sexual congress; (2) with a woman; (3) done by force and without consent; (4) the victim is under 18 years of age at the time of the rape; and (5) the offender is a parent (whether legitimate, illegitimate or adopted) of the victim.[26]

Hence, to raise the crime of rape, be it simple rape or statutory rape to qualified rape, the twin circumstances of minority of the victim and her relationship to the offender must concur. In the present case, the elements of qualified rape were sufficiently alleged in the Information: a) AAA270149 was 6 years old at the time of the rape incident; and b) accused-appellant is AAA270149's biological father. The foregoing elements were also sufficiently proven by the prosecution.

In People v. Pruna,[27] this Court enumerated the guidelines for proving the victim's age, thus:
In order to remove any confusion that may be engendered by the foregoing cases, we hereby set the following guidelines in appreciating age, either as an element of the crime or as a qualifying circumstance.

1. The best evidence to prove the age of the offended party is an original or certified true copy of the certificate of live birth of such party.

2. In the absence of a certificate of live birth, similar authentic documents such as baptismal certificate and school records[,] which show the date of birth of the victim[,] would suffice to prove age.

3. If the certificate of live birth or authentic document is shown to have been lost or destroyed or otherwise unavailable, the testimony, if clear and credible, of the victim's mother or a member of the family either by affinity or consanguinity who is qualified to testify on matters respecting pedigree such as the exact age or date of birth of the offended party pursuant to Section 40, Rule 130 of the Rules on Evidence shall be sufficient under the following circumstances:
a. If the victim is alleged to be below 3 years of age and what is sought to be proved is that [they are] less than 7 years old;

b. If the victim is alleged to be below 7 years of age and what is sought to be proved is that [they are] less than 12 years old;

c. If the victim is alleged to be below 12 years of age and what is sought to be proved is that [they are] less than 18 years old.
4. In the absence of a certificate of live birth, authentic document, or the testimony of the victim's mother or relatives concerning the victim's age, the complainant's testimony will suffice provided that it is expressly and clearly admitted by the accused.

5. It is the prosecution that has the burden of proving the age of the offended party. The failure of the accused to object to the testimonial evidence regarding age shall not be taken against [them].

6. The trial court should always make a categorical finding as to the age of the victim.[28] (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)
From the foregoing guidelines, the best evidence to prove the age of a person is the original birth certificate or certified true copy. In their absence, similar authentic documents may be presented such as baptismal certificates and school records. If the original or certified true copy of the birth certificate is not available, credible testimonies of the victim's mother or a member of the family may be sufficient under certain circumstances.[29] In the event that both the birth certificate or other authentic documents and the testimonies of the victim's mother or other qualified relative are unavailable, the testimony of the victim may be admitted in evidence provided that it is expressly and clearly admitted by the accused.[30]","ACCORDINGLY, the Appeal is DENIED.

CEB CR. HC. No. 03586, which affirmed the Decision[3] dated August 19, 2019 and the Order[4] dated September 17, 2019 of Branch 55, Regional Trial Court of xxxxxxxxxxx, xxxxxxxxxxx (RTC). The RTC found Andre Gayanilo y Eleveran (Andre), Stephen Lumanog y Eleveran (Stephen), and Aldrin Gayanilo y Eleveran (Aldrin; collectively, accused-­appellants) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of rape, as defined and penalized under Article 266-A, in relation to Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).","The appeal is without merit.

At the outset, it must be stressed that in criminal cases, an appeal throws the entire case wide open for review and the reviewing tribunal can correct errors, though unassigned in the appealed judgment, or even reverse the trial court's decision based on grounds other than those that the parties raised as errors. The appeal confers the appellate court full jurisdiction over the case and renders such court competent to examine records, revise the judgment appealed from, increase the penalty, and cite the proper provision of the penal law.[21]

Guided by the foregoing consideration, the Court affirms accused-­appellants' conviction with modification, as will be explained hereunder.

Pertinent portions of Article 266-A(l) and Article 266-B of the RPC respectively read:
Article 266-A. Rape: When and How Committed. – Rape is committed –

1) By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:

a) Through force, threat, or intimidation;

b) When the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious;

c) By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority; and

d) When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present.

....

Article 266-B. Penalty. – Rape under paragraph 1 of the next preceding article shall be punished by reclusion perpetua.

Whenever the rape is committed with the use of a deadly weapon or by two or more persons, the penalty shall be reclusion perpetua to death.
Thus, the elements of rape are: (a) the offender had carnal knowledge of the victim; and (b) such act was accomplished through force or intimidation, or when the victim is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious, or when the victim is under 12 years of age.[22]

Further, it bears stressing that sexual abuse cases are, more often than not, solely decided based on the credibility of the testimony of the private complainant. Thus, in evaluating the credibility of witnesses, the Court should abide by the following guidelines: (a) the Court gives the highest respect to the RTC's evaluation of the testimony of the witnesses, considering its unique position in directly observing the demeanor of a witness on the stand. From its vantage point, the trial court is in the best position to determine the truthfulness of witnesses; (b) absent any substantial reason which would justify the reversal of the RTC's assessments and conclusions, the reviewing court is generally bound by the lower court's findings, particularly when no significant facts and circumstances, affecting the outcome of the case, are shown to have been overlooked or disregarded; and (c) the rule is even more stringently applied if the CA concurred with the RTC.[23]

Moreover, in People v. Amper,[24] the Court held that ""when a woman says she was raped, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that a rape was committed, and if her testimony meets the test of credibility, conviction may issue on the basis thereof.""[25]

Here, the courts a quo correctly ruled that the prosecution—through the positive, candid, and categorical testimony of AAA—had established beyond reasonable doubt that accused-appellants had carnal knowledge of AAA through force. Thus, the Court finds no cogent reason to reverse the RTC's assessment of AAA's credibility, which was affirmed by the CA. Absent any evidence that such assessment was tainted with arbitrariness or oversight of a fact of consequence or influence—especially so when affirmed by the CA—it is entitled to great weight, if not conclusive and binding on the Court.[26] As such, accused-appellants' criminal liability must be sustained.

In an attempt to relieve themselves from liability, accused-appellants aver that no evidence, i.e., photographs, medical report and/or testimonial evidence from a medical expert, was presented during the trial to prove the physical trauma or hematoma that would have resulted from the alleged force that was exerted upon AAA. Accused-appellants further allege that AAA was not distressed the day after the alleged rape when she appeared before the police and medical officer, which negate AAA's claim that she was sexually molested by force, threat or intimidation. In addition, accused-appellants assert that AAA's testimony does not deserve credence as it is riddled with inconsistencies.[27]

Accused-appellants arguments fail to persuade.","ACCORDINGLY, the appeal is DENIED. The Decision dated February 10, 2021 and the Resolution dated September 29, 2021 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CEB CR. HC.

"G.R. No. 255703, October 23, 2024","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. SIM O. MATA, JR., ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","The instant case stemmed from an Information[4] charging Mata, Edgardo A. Tallado (Tallado), and Mario T. Dela Cruz (Dela Cruz), in their respective capacities as provincial legal officer, provincial governor, and supervising administrative officer of the Province of Camarines Norte of the aforesaid crime. The accusatory portion of the said Information reads:
That on 19 November 2012, or sometime prior or subsequent thereto, in Daet, Camarines Norte Province, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, accused public officers, EDGARDO A. TALLADO, being the Governor of Camarines Norte Province, SIM O. MATA, JR., Provincial Legal Officer[,] and MARIO T. DELA CRUZ, Supervising Administrative Officer of said province, committing the offense in relation to their office and taking advantage of their respective official positions, conspiring with one another did then and there willfully[,] unlawfully, and criminally cause undue injury and prejudice to Provincial Veterinarian Edgardo S. Gonzales, in the discharge of their official and/or administrative functions through evident bad faith, by adamantly ignoring the orders of the Civil Service Commission (CSC) directing TALLADO to reinstate Gonzales as Provincial Veterinarian from the Provincial Information Office back to the Provincial Veterinary Office (PVO), and with the cooperation of MATA and DELA CRUZ, TALLADO dropped Gonzales from the rolls and obstinately refused to effectuate CSC Decision No. 13-0841 dated 12 August 2013 directing him to restore Gonzales in the amount representing his compensation, salary[,] and allowances from the time he was removed from his station [or] specific position.","Before the Court is an ordinary appeal[1] assailing the Decision[2] dated September 25, 2020 and the Resolution[3] dated January 7, 2021 of the Sandiganbayan in Criminal Case No. SB-17-CRM-0250. The assailed Decision finds accused-appellant Sim O. Mata, Jr. (Mata) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 3019, entitled the ""Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.""","The appeal is meritorious.

I.

Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 states:
Section 3. Corrupt practices of public officers. — In addition to acts or omissions of public officers already penalized by existing law, the following shall constitute corrupt practices of any public officer and are hereby declared to be unlawful:

....

(e) Causing any undue injury to any party, including the Government, or giving any private party any unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of his official administrative or judicial functions through manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence. This provision shall apply to officers and employees of offices or government corporations charged with the grant of licenses or permits or other concessions.
Verily, the elements of violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 are as follows: (a) that the accused must be a public officer discharging administrative, judicial, or official functions (or a private individual acting in conspiracy with such public officers); (b) that they acted with manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or inexcusable negligence; and (c) that their action caused any undue injury to any party, including the government, or gave any private party unwarranted benefits, advantage, or preference in the discharge of his functions.[26]

The first element is self-explanatory. With respect to the second element, in People v. Naciongayo,[27] the Court explained that there are three means of committing the crime charged—i.e., through manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence—and proof of any of these in connection with the prohibited acts under Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 is enough to convict.[28] Finally, as regards the last element, Naciongayo further expounded that ""there are two ways by which a public official violates Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 in the performance of his functions, namely: (1) by causing undue injury to any party, including the Government; or (2) by giving any private party any unwarranted benefit, advantage or preference. The accused may be charged under either mode or both. The disjunctive term 'or' connotes that either act qualifies as a violation of Section 3 (e) of R.A. No. 3019. In other words, the presence of one would suffice[.] ""[29]

The first element is present in this case as it is undisputed that at the time material to this case, Mata was the provincial legal officer of the Province of Camarines Norte, and he committed the acts subject in the performance of his official duties.

However, the prosecution failed to establish beyond reasonable doubt the presence of the second and third elements in this case, as will be explained.

Essentially, the Sandiganbayan hinged Mata's conviction on his act of giving erroneous legal advice to Tallado, namely: first, not to immediately implement CSC Decision No. 120494, and instead, to make use of the legal remedies available to them; and second, to drop Dr. Gonzales from the rolls due to his purported absences.

The Court is not convinced.","ACCORDINGLY, the Appeal is GRANTED. The Decision dated September 25, 2020 and the Resolution dated January 7, 2021 of the Sandiganbayan in Criminal Case No. SB-17-CRM-0250 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Accused-appellant Sim O. Mata, Jr. is ACQUITTED of the crime of violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019, entitled the ""Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.""

Mata, Jr. is required to SHOW CAUSE within thirty (30) days from receipt of this Decision as to why he should not be disciplined as a member of the Bar in accordance with the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability for his refusal to immediately implement CSC Decision No. 120494, in violation of prevailing civil service rules."

CONCHITA CARPIO-MORALES, IN HER CAPACITY AS OMBUDSMAN, AND HON. MEL SENEN S. SARMIENTO, IN HIS CAPACITY AS SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT, RESPONDENTS.","In 2009, the Bids and Awards Committee of the National Headquarters (NHQ BAC) of the Philippine National Police (PNP) issued Resolution No. 2009-53[2] for the procurement of the PNP Maritime Group's (PNP MG) 16 police coastal crafts. The NHQ BAC likewise issued Resolution No. 2009-54[3] delegating its authority to PNP MG for the procurement of said coastal crafts through public bidding. The delegated authority was subject to the condition that the procured items must be first accepted by an inspection and acceptance committee (IAC) created for the purpose or as determined by the NHQ BAC to ensure compliance with the National Police Commission (NAPOLCOM) specifications for coastal crafts, thus:
NOW THEREFORE, the Committee resolved, as it hereby resolves, to recommend to the Chief, PNP that the public bidding of the procurement of sixteen (16) units [of] Police Coastal Craft. . . should be delegated to [the PNP] MG Bids and Awards Committee subject to existing accounting and auditing rules and regulations. The item delivered, however, shall be accepted by the Inspection and Acceptance Committee (IAC) created for the purpose or as determined by the NHQ-BAC as a matter of procedure to ensure compliance with the NAPOLCOM confirmed PNP specifications and for record purposes.[4] (Emphasis supplied)
Accordingly, the PNP MG created its own Bids and Awards Committee (PNP MG BAC) which included Police Senior Superintendent (PSSUPT) Cornelio Salinas, Police Superintendent (PSUPT) Nepomuceno Corpus, Jr., and PSSUPT Michael Amos Filart (PSSUPT Salinas et al.).[5] However, the PNP MG failed to create its own IAC. Neither did the NHQ BAC issue any resolution or authorization for the inspection of the items to be procured by the PNP MG as the end user of coastal crafts.[6] Meantime, in September and October 2009, tropical storms Ondoy and Pepeng devastated the country and led to the declaration of a state of national calamity. In November 2009, strong tropical cyclones Quedan, Ramil, Santi, Tino, Urduja, and Vinta came in the wake of Ondoy and Pepeng.[7]

On November 27, 2009, the PNP MG BAC and its observers held a conference attended by two bidders: Four Petals Trading (Four Petals) and business partners Dante Samandan and Antonio Martines. However, Samandan and Martines were disqualified because their company was not registered and had no personality to participate. Thus, Four Petals became the sole participant. Considering that there were no existing specifications for coastal crafts yet, the PNP MG BAC used the particulars for motorized bancas under NAPOLCOM Resolution No. 2005-064.[8]

Thereafter, the PNP MG BAC found Four Petals qualified based on the following documentary requirements: (1) registration with the Department of Trade and Industry; (2) verified information sheet dated January 26, 2009; (3) verified letter of its proprietress, Ma. Pacita H. Umali; (4) certification of its personnel; (5) location map of its office address; (6) Parañaque City business permits for the years 2009 and 2010; (7) certificate of registration with the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR); (8) BIR tax clearance for 2008 and 2010; (9) certificate of registration dated August 12, 2009 issued by the Procurement Service of the Department of Budget and Management; (10) license to engage in afloat ship repair dated April 4, 2007 issued by the Maritime Industry Authority and (11) various certificates of good standing issued by the PNP MG, PNP Traffic Management Group, PNP Office of the Legal Service, and PNP Police Community Relations Group.[9]

Cognizant of the widespread and massive damage brought about by Ondoy and Pepeng, and given the announcement from the Department of National Defense (DND) and the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) that more typhoons were still to be expected, the PNP MG BAC issued undated Resolution No. 2009-10[10] recommending the emergency purchase of the coastal crafts and awarding the negotiated contract to Four Petals:
WHEREAS, inasmuch as there is a need to address immediately the problem of proper equipage, this Group recommends the emergency purchase of sixteen (16) Police Coastal Crafts.","The Court resolves in these consolidated Petitions for Review on Certiorari[1] the administrative liability of the members of the Bids and Awards Committee and chairperson of the Logistics Support Services in the procurement, inspection, and acceptance of police coastal crafts.","The Office of the Ombudsman exercises full administrative disciplinary jurisdiction over all elective and appointive officials, save only for impeachable officers. This power covers the entire range of administrative activities attendant to administrative adjudication. It includes the authority to receive complaints, conduct investigations, hold hearings in accordance with its rules of procedure, summon witnesses and require the production of documents, place under preventive suspension public officers and employees pending an investigation, determine the appropriate penalty imposable on erring public officers or employees as warranted by the evidence, and impose the corresponding penalties.[64] The quantum of proof in administrative proceedings necessary for a finding of guilt is substantial evidence or such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind may accept as adequate to support a conclusion.[65] The burden to establish the charges rests upon the complainant. The case should be dismissed for lack of merit if the complainant fails to show in a satisfactory manner the facts upon which his or her accusations are based.[66] The respondent is not even obliged to prove his or her exception or defense.[67] More importantly, an absolution from a criminal charge is not a bar to an administrative prosecution or vice versa. The ruling on the existence or absence of probable cause is entirely independent from an inquiry as to the administrative liability of the respondent.[68] Given these precepts, the Court now rules on the administrative liability of PSSUPT Salinas et al. and PSUPT Marasigan.

The Petitions are unmeritorious.   ","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition in G.R. No. 238934 is DENIED. The Decision dated January 30, 2018 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 145739 is AFFIRMED.

A review of the evidence on record shows that the prosecution discharged its burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt that: first, all the elements of the crimes charged are present; and second, accused-appellant is the one who perpetrated the crimes.[67]
 
The prosecution has proven beyond reasonable doubt that XXX270317 is guilty of acts of lasciviousness under Article 336 of the Revised Penal Code, in relation to Section 5(b) of Republic Act No. 7610.
 

To convict an accused of acts of lasciviousness under Article 336 of the Revised Penal Code, in relation to Section 5(b) of Republic Act No. 7610, the prosecution must prove all the elements of acts of lasciviousness under the Revised Penal Code and sexual abuse under Republic Act No. 7610.[68] Relevantly, the elements of acts of lasciviousness are: (1) the offender commits any act of lasciviousness or lewdness; (2) the lascivious act is done under any of the following circumstances: (a) by using force or intimidation; (b) when the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; or (c) when the offended party is under 12 years of age; and (3) the offended party is another person of either sex.[69]

On the other hand, sexual abuse under Republic Act No. 7610 has three elements: first, that the accused commits an act of sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct; second, the said act is performed with a child exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse; and third, the child, whether male or female is below 18 years old.[70]

Here, the prosecution was able to prove the relevant elements of acts of lasciviousness and sexual abuse to the point of moral certainty.

First, accused-appellant committed lascivious conduct against AAA270317. Section 2(h) of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of Republic Act No. 7610 defines ""lascivious conduct"" as follows:
""Lascivious conduct"" means the intentional touching, either directly or through clothing, of the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks, or the introduction of any object into the genitalia, anus or mouth, of any person, whether of the same or opposite sex, with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person, bestiality, masturbation, lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of a person; (Emphasis supplied)
In her affidavit[71] which was duly offered[72] and admitted[73] into evidence, AAA270317 narrated that her father touched her breasts and vagina on March 6, 2015:
07. TANONG: Bakit ka narito sa police station ngayun?
SAGOT: Para po maikwento sainyo ang mga ginagawa sakin ni papa.

08. TANONG: Anong pangalan ni papa, edad at trabaho?
SAGOT: [XXX270317] po, 31 taong gulang, poultry boy at tubong Romblon, Romblon po.

09. TANONG: Ano yung sinasabi mo sakin na ikukwento mo na ginawa saiyo ni papa mo?
SAGOT: Na ano po, na pinapagsamantalahan po ako ni papa.

10. TANONG: Ano yung sinasabi mo na pinagsasamantalahan ka ni papa?
SAGOT: Ako po ay iniiyot nya.

11. TANONG: Ano yung sinasabi mo na iniiyot ka ni papa?
SAGOT: Yun po ay yung ginagawa niya sa akin.

....

20. TANONG: Mga ilang beses ginawa sa iyo ni papa ([XXX270317]) na sinabi mo na pagsasamantala sa iyo?
SAGOT: Madaming madami po, hindi ko na po mabilang sa sobrang dami, at ang huli po ay kahapon po ng madaling araw, (Marso 6, 2015) mga alas kwatro (4:00 AM) habang ako po ay nagpapainit pong tubig na panligo ay lumapit si papa at pinipilit po akong pinapupunta sa bodega para daw po ako ay kanyang iyutin, pinaghihipo niya ang aking dede at pepe at nakatakbo ako palayo sa kanya at umakyat at natulog ulit ako ng kalahating oras at saka po ako lumabas ng wala na si papa sa labas.[74]
AAA270317 affirmed the contents of her affidavit when she was presented as a witness before the trial court;[75] the lower courts also found her testimony credible and worthy of belief.[76]

Second, AAA270317 was a child subjected to sexual abuse. Section 2(g) of the IRR of Republic Act No. 7610 defines ""sexual abuse"" as follows:
""Sexual abuse"" includes the employment, use, persuasion, inducement, enticement or coercion of a child to engage in, or assist another person to engage in, sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct or the molestation, prostitution, or incest with children;
In Quimvel v. People,[77] this Court ruled that the terms ""coercion"" or ""influence"" under the law is broad enough to include ""force and intimidation"" and influence is subsumed under the term persuasion or coercion.[78] Here, AAA270317 narrated that her father used force to grope her breasts and vagina.[79]

Third, the minority of AAA270317 at the time the rape incident occurred was proven by her certificate of live birth,[80] which shows that she was born on May 21, 2004. Thus, she was only 10 years old when XXX270317 sexually abused her.
 
Similarly, the prosecution has proven to the point of moral certainty that XXX270317 is guilty of six counts of sexual assault under Article 266-A(2) of the Revised Penal Code, in relation to Section 5(b) of Republic Act No. 7610.
 

To convict an accused of rape through sexual assault under Article 266-A(2) of the Revised Penal Code, the following elements must be proven beyond reasonable doubt: (1) the accused committed an act of sexual assault by (a) inserting his penis into another person's mouth or anal orifice, or (b) inserting any instrument or object into the genital or anal orifice of another person; and, (2) the act was accomplished (a) through the use of force or intimidation, or (b) when the victim is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious, or (c) when the victim is under 12 years of age or is demented.[81] In People v. Tulagan,[82] We held that when the victim is under 12 years of age or is demented, the proper nomenclature of the crime should be sexual assault under Article 266-A(2) of the Revised Penal Code, in relation to Section 5(b) of Republic Act No. 7610.[83]

Aside from the above elements, the courts are also guided by the following principles in the review of rape cases:
(1) [A]n accusation of rape, while easy to make, is difficult to prove and even harder for the person accused, though innocent, to disprove; (2) because rape, by its very nature, involves only two persons, the testimony of the complainant should be scrutinized with greatest caution; (3) the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merits and must not be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense; and (4) the complainant's credibility assumes paramount importance because her testimony, if credible, is sufficient to support the conviction of the accused.[84]
Thus, the primordial consideration in rape cases is the credibility of the testimony of the victim because the accused may be convicted solely on such testament, provided that it is credible, natural, convincing, and consistent with human nature and the normal course of things.[85]

Here, the prosecution proved the elements of the crime to the point of moral certainty through the clear and credible testimonies of AAA270317 and BBB270317, and documentary evidence.

AAA270317 and BBB270317's testimonies established that they were sexually assaulted by accused-appellant on six different occasions. AAA270317 narrated in her affidavit[86] that accused-appellant inserted his finger in her vagina on two occasions sometime in September 2013:
12. TANONG: Kelan at saan ginawa ni papa ([XXX270317]) iyon?
SAGOT: Nagsimula po iyon noong tumira kami xxxxxxxxxxx, xxxxxxxxxxx, noon pong September 2013.

13. TANONG: Pwede mo bang ikwento sa akin kung pano yung sinasabi mong pagsasamantala ni papa sa iyo?
SAGOT: Opo, Nagsimula po iyon pagkatapos ng dalawang araw na lumipat kami sa xxxxxxxxxxx galing Calamba, na pilit po akong isinama ni papa sa banyo at hinubad ang aking suot na shorts at panty, sinabihan po niya ako na huwag maingay at yung gagawin niya sa akin ay sa una lamang masakit at pagtagal ay masasarapan po ako at malaki daw ang tiyan ni mama kaya ako na ang gusto niya. Pagkahubad po niya ng aking shorts at panty ay kinandong niya ako, hubo po si papa at ipinasok niya ang daliri niya sa aking pepe (the victim show her right middle finger). Sinabi ko po na huwag po niya gawin iyon pero sinabihan niya ako na huwag maingay at huwag magsumbong. Pagkatapos po ay pinalabas na ako ni papa ng banyo.

....

16. TANONG: May sunod pa bang nangyari?
SAGOT: Opo, pagkatapos po ng isang araw ay gabi ng kumakain siya ng sili at isinama niya ulit ako sa banyo at doon ipinasok niya and daliri niyang maanghang kaya sumakit ang pepe ko, kaya pinaghugas na niya ako at pinalabas na ng banyo.[87]
On the other hand, BBB270317 averred in her affidavit[88] that she was anally penetrated by XXX270317 on three occasions in 2014 and again on March 6, 2015:
07. TANONG: Bakit ka narito sa Police Station nagayun?
SAGOT: Para po maikwento ko sainyo ang ginawa sa akin ni papa.

08. TANONG: Anong pangalan ni papa, edad at trabaho?
SAGOT: [XXX270317] po, 31 taong gulang, poultry boy at tubong Romblon, Romblon po.

09. TANONG: Ano yung sinasabi mong gusto mong sabihin sa akin na ginawa sa iyo ni papa mo.
SAGOT: Kasi po eh masama ang ginawa ni papa.

10. TANONG: Kagaya ng ano?
SAGOT: Hinindot po ako.

10. TANONG: Kailan at saan yung sinasabi mo na hinindot ka ni papa?
SAGOT: Hindi pa po ako napasok sa xxxxxxxxxxx Elementary School (sometime in 2014). Sa looban po, malayo sa aming bahay noon isinama po ako sa pangunguha ng sili.

11. TANONG: Ikwento mo nga sa akin kung anong nangyari doon sa looban?
SAGOT: Nangunguha po kami ng sili tapos po ay hinubadan ako ni papa ng shorts at panty, tapos po e pinahawak nya ako sa puno tapos po e hinindot ako ni papa sa pwet, hinubo ni papa ang kanyang shorts at brief (the victim demonstrate the sexual act of his father). Ipinasok ni papa ang kanyang titi sa aking puwet. Umiyak po ako at sinabihan ni papa na huwag maingay. Pagkatapos po na maipasok ni papa ang titi niya sa aking puwet ay pinagbihis na niya ako at biglang dumating si ate ([AAA270317]) at sinabi na hinahanap na ako ni mama.

12. TANONG: Meron pa bang nangyari?
SAGOT: Meron pa po, medyo matagal na din po, gabi po ay pinalabas ako ni papa, tapos po ay hinila ako sa bodega, hinubadan ng tsinelas, shorts at panty tapos po ay pinahiga/pinatuwad ako sa sahig (the victim demonstrated the position). Naghubo po si papa ng shorts at brief at nilagyan ng mantika ang kanyang titi tapos po eh pinasok niya ang kanyang titi sa aking puwet. Umiyak po ako at tinakpan niya ang aking bibig ng kanyang kamay at sinabing tumigil ako sa pag-iyak ko. Habang ipinapasok po ni papa ang kanyang titi sa aking puwet at hinahawakan niya ang dede ko. Sabi ko po sakanya ""PAPA AYOKO NA"", ang sagot po niya ay ""HALA HINDI KO NA BIBILHIN AT AASIKASUHIN ANG PROJECT MO"".

13. TANONG: May sunod pa bang nangyari?
SAGOT: Opo, meron pa po. Isang gabi po ay hinila ako ni papa papuntang CR, umiyak po ako at sinabi ko kay papa na ""PAPA, AYOKO NA, AYOKO NA"", pero po ang sabi nya ay ""HALA SIGE PAPALUIN KITA"", tapos po ay hinubadan niya ako ng shorts at panty at pinahawak sa pader tapos po ay hinubad niya ang kanyang shorts at brief at hinindot po niya ako, pinasok niya ang kanyang titi sa aking puwet. Pagkatapos ay binihisan na po niya ako at habang palabas ng CR ay hawak hawak ni papa ang pepe ko.

14. TANONG: May susunod pa bang nangyari?
SAGOT: Opo, kahapon po (Marso 6, 2015) ng madaling araw at titingnan ko po ang sinaing ni ate, paglabas ko ay nandoon si papa, pagkatingin ko po ng sinaing ay hinindot ako ni papa, hinalikan sa pisngi, hinubadan ng shorts at panty at pinahawak sa abuhan (lutuan) tsaka ipinasok ni papa ang kanyang titi sa aking puwet. Tapos po ay inihatid pa ako ni papa sa loob ng bahay hawak ang akin pepe.[89]
Both AAA270317[90] and BBB270317[91] affirmed the contents of their affidavit when they were presented as witnesses during trial. The RTC found their narration of what occurred ""credible, clear, positive, and convincing""[92] and the CA mirrored the RTC's findings and added that their testimonies are ""conclusive, logical, and probable.""[93]

It was duly proven by the evidence on record that both AAA270317 and BBB270317 were below 12 years of age when the sexual assaults occurred. Based on her certificate of live birth,[94] AAA270317 was only 9 years old when she was sexually assaulted by accused-appellant sometime in 2013. As for BBB270317, her certificate of live birth[95] reveals that she was only 8 years old when she was sexually assaulted by accused-appellant on four different occasions between 2014 to 2015.","FOR THESE REASONS, the appeal is DENIED.

"G.R. No. 268891, October 22, 2024","GERARDO ""JERRY"" A. NOVERAS, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS AND NARCISO DELA CRUZ AMANSEC, RESPONDENTS.","In the late afternoon of March 30, 2022, respondent Narciso Dela Cruz Amansec (Amansec) and his wife went to the Aurora Training Center (ATC) compound to visit a police officer friend who was stationed there. While walking towards the compound, which hosted facilities of the provincial government, Amansec saw a tarpaulin with a certain image and red background. When Amansec moved closer to the premises, he saw the same image and background being printed on tarpaulin sheets, which turned out to be materials for Noveras's vice-gubernatorial campaign. Amansec also discovered that the tarpaulin printing machine was being run by Michael Tecuico (Tecuico), a casual employee of the Aurora Local Government Unit (LGU). Amansec approached Tecuico and asked him to explain why Noveras's campaign materials were being printed on LGU premises. Amansec claimed that Tecuico got angry and defensive at the inquiry and forcibly removed him from the premises. Amansec thus filed a police report and applied for a search warrant of the ATC compound.[4]

On March 31, 2022, the executive judge of Branch 91, Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Baler, Aurora issued a search warrant for ""illegally printed election propaganda or campaign materials of Atty. Christian Noveras and Atty. Gerardo Noveras, Gubernatorial and Vice-Gubernatorial candidates for the Province of Aurora, respectively, which materials are deemed properties ""subject of the offense"" or 'fruits of the offense""; and printing machines being used as a means of committing an offense which are kept inside the said Printing Room, also referred to as the ""Extension Office of the Provincial Capitol"" located at the Training Center (ATC), Sitio Setan, Barangay Calabuanan, Baler, Aurora.""[5] The search warrant was implemented on April 2, 2022. Recovered from the ATC premises were the following items: one tarpaulin eco solvent printer, one inkjet printer, a personal computer set and computer peripherals, a semi-automatic eyelet machine, and 41 pieces of tarpaulin campaign materials and/or tarpaulin design templates[6] bearing the names of Noveras and other candidates for various provincial and municipal elective offices in Aurora.[7] The implementation of the search warrant was witnessed by an elected barangay official and three media representatives.[8] Amansec further alleged that one of the witnesses was able to take a photograph of the tarpaulin campaign materials showing that they were paid for by Christian Noveras, the incumbent vice-governor and Noveras's brother.

On April 20, 2022, Amansec filed a criminal complaint against Noveras, Tecuico, and other persons for violation of Section 261(o) of the Omnibus Election Code and Article 217 of the Revised Penal Code, in connection with the tarpaulin printing incident.[9]

On April 26, 2022, Amansec petitioned the COMELEC to disqualify Noveras from standing as a candidate, claiming that the tarpaulin printing incident was a violation of Section 261(o) ultimately attributable to Noveras, whose campaign materials were found on the scene.[10]

Noveras argued that the petition should be dismissed outright for Amansec's failure to appear in the preliminary conference.[11] Noveras denied the allegation that his campaign materials were being printed on LGU premises using LGU resources.[12] Furthermore, violation of Section 261(o) is not among the grounds for disqualification of a candidate under Sections 12 and 68 of the Omnibus Election Code or Section 40 of the Local Government Code (LGC).[13] Finally, Noveras argued that a final judgment of conviction is necessary to disqualify a candidate whether under Section 12 of the Omnibus Election Code or Section 40 of the LGC.[14]

The May 9, 2022 national and local Elections were conducted as scheduled, with Noveras remaining on the ballot. He garnered the highest number of votes for the position of vice-governor.[15]

On March 8, 2023, the Aurora provincial prosecutor's office found probable cause to charge Noveras and five other individuals with violation of Section 261(o) of the Omnibus Election Code; but on June 16, 2023, the Department of Justice (DOJ) modified the provincial prosecutor's ruling and dismissed the charge as against Noveras.[16]

On July 10, 2023, the COMELEC First Division resolved to grant Amansec's petition.

The First Division resolved the case on the merits despite Amansec's non-appearance in the preliminary conference, invoking the public interest in the resolution of election cases and the liberal interpretation of the COMELEC rules of procedure.[17] The First Division stressed Noveras's failure ""to set forth the substance of the matters upon which he relies to support his denial of the factual allegations against him. He failed to controvert the pieces of evidence clearly establishing that tarpaulins for his campaign were being printed using provincial government resources by a casual plantilla employee under his control and supervision.""[18]

Noveras was disqualified on the basis of Section 261(d)(1) of the Omnibus Election Code, as he influenced his subordinate, Tecuico, into doing acts beneficial to his campaign. The witness statements and search reports prove that Tecuico, a casual employee of the Aurora LGU, was caught in the act of printing Noveras's campaign materials using Aurora LGU equipment, inside Aurora LGU premises. It was also proven that Noveras appointed Tecuico to the LGU. As head of the Aurora LGU and the signatory of Tecuico's appointment, Noveras wielded not only moral and legal ascendancy over Tecuico, but also command and control prerogatives over the facilities and resources implicated in the tarpaulin printing incident. Given the circumstances, the First Division concluded that Tecuico would not have used Aurora LGU resources to print campaign materials in the ATC compound if not for the moral and legal ascendancy exercised over him by Noveras. Furthermore, any such use of provincial government resources and facilities would not have been possible without the knowledge or influence of Noveras, the incumbent provincial governor.[19]

Noveras may be disqualified on the basis of Section 261(d)(1) of the Omnibus Election Code despite its apparent repeal by Section 2 of Republic Act No. 7890. The effect of Republic Act No. 7890 on the treatment of acts of coercion affecting the right of suffrage is ambiguous, as it increased the penalty for such acts, but repealed the specific provisions defining and regulating such acts in Section 261(d)(1) and (2) of the Omnibus Election Code. The COMELEC First Division resolved the ambiguity by resorting to the legislative history of the statute, which shows that: 1) the scope of the original bill which became Republic Act No. 7890 was limited to removing bloc voting by religious groups from the enumeration of acts punished in Section 261(d); and 2) there was no discussion or intention to remove the prohibition against acts of coercion and undue influence affecting the right of suffrage by public officers. The poll body in division thus concluded that Section 2 of Republic Act No. 7890 should be read not as a blanket repeal of Section 261(d) of the Omnibus Election Code, but as a mere amendment to remove any reference to acts of coercion affecting the right of suffrage committed by leaders or officials of religious organizations, which means that Section 261(d) remains an available ground to disqualify public officers like Noveras.[20]

In a separate opinion, Commissioner Ernesto Ferdinand P. Maceda, Jr. (Commissioner Maceda) echoed the reasoning of the First Division and further explained that Javier v. COMELEC,[21] which construed Section 2 of Republic Act No. 7890 as an express and blanket repeal of Section 261(d) of the Omnibus Election Code, ""did not in any way diminish [the COMELEC's] power to act in the face of situations where the coercion of voters on matters of suffrage is clearly apparent.""[22]","This is a petition for certiorari[1] against the July 10, 2023 Resolution[2] of the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) First Division and the September 6, 2023 Resolution[3] of the COMELEC En Banc in SPA No. 22-048 (DC).
On October 6, 2021, petitioner Gerardo ""Jerry"" A. Noveras (Noveras) filed a certificate of candidacy (COC) for the position of Vice-Governor of the province of Aurora in the May 9, 2022 general elections. At that time, Noveras was the incumbent governor of Aurora.","
There is no substantial evidence to prove that Noveras used a fraudulent scheme to induce voters to cast their votes in his favor.
As the ponencia discusses, the election offense of use of fraudulent scheme or device has the following elements:

1)
The existence of a fraudulent device or scheme;
 	 
2)
The use of said fraudulent device or scheme for the purpose of inducement or compulsion; and
 	 
3)
The inducement or compulsion is intended to produce, or actually produces, the following results
 	 	 

a.
Registration or refraining from registration of any voter;
 	 	 

b.
Participation in a campaign;
 	 	 

c.
Refraining or desistance from any campaign;
 	 	 

d.
Casting of any vote;
 	 	 

e.
Omission to vote; or
 	 	 

f.
Any promise to do the foregoing acts.[85]
The ponencia finds that the unlawful use of government resources by public officers constitutes fraud.[86] As such, the printing of campaign materials for the election campaign of an incumbent public official by a government employee within government premises is a fraudulent device or scheme involving the diversion of government resources to unauthorized ends.[87] The ponencia likewise finds that the campaign materials were calculated to induce the electorate of Aurora to cast their votes in favor of Noveras and his ticket. Furthermore, since Noveras was the ""ultimate beneficiary"" of the acts committed by Tecuico and he exercised moral and legal ascendancy over the latter, he may be disqualified under Section 261(e) even if the unauthorized printing was done by someone else. [88]

I agree that the unlawful and unauthorized use of government resources by public officers constitutes fraud. However, the nature by which the ponencia holds Noveras liable for the use of the fraudulent device or scheme—by virtue of being the ultimate beneficiary and by having moral and legal ascendancy—is akin to a principal by inducement or a co-conspirator.

In order to be made liable as a principal by inducement, the person must have either directly forced or directly induced another to commit the crime.[89] Directly forcing another to commit a crime may be accomplished by: (i) using irresistible force, or (ii) causing uncontrollable fear; whereas, directly inducing the commission of a crime may be: (i) by giving a price, reward, or promise, or (ii) by using words of command.[90] On the other hand, in order to be made liable as a co-conspirator, the person must have performed an overt act in pursuance of or in furtherance of the conspiracy, i.e., active participation in the actual commission of the offense itself, or extending moral assistance to his or her co-conspirators by being present at the time of the commission of the crime, or by exerting a moral ascendance over the other co-conspirators by moving them to execute or implement the criminal plan.[91]

Verily, liability as either a principal by inducement or a co-conspirator necessitates an overt act. Corollary to the rule on burden of proof in administrative cases, such overt act must be proven with substantial evidence.

Thus, similar to the previous discussion, I submit that, even if the use of fraudulent scheme or device may be committed indirectly, there must still be at least some iota of evidence linking the person to these acts to justify holding him or her responsible or accountable for the same. It must be shown through substantial evidence that he committed an overt act which shows his or her involvement or participation, whether direct or indirect, in the use of the fraudulent device or scheme. At the very least, there must be substantial evidence to prove knowledge and approval of the fraudulent scheme.

Here, as mentioned, there is absolutely no evidence that (1) Noveras was involved in or even knew of the tarpaulin printing incident, (2) Noveras directly or indirectly instructed Tecuico to print his party's campaign materials using government equipment, and (3) Noveras directly or indirectly authorized the use of the government tarpaulin printer to print the campaign materials. Knowledge or permission cannot be inferred from Noveras' position as governor, especially as there is no showing that use of these government resources would absolutely be impossible without Noveras' authorization.

Further, the orchestration of a fraudulent scheme cannot likewise be automatically imputed against Noveras on the basis of him being the ""ultimate beneficiary"" of the campaign materials. As can be gleaned from the records, the seized campaign materials endorsed the entire slate of Partido ng Demokratiko Pilipino (PDP) Laban, including candidates for city and municipal offices.[92] It was also indicated in the materials that Christian supposedly paid for the same.[93] To conclude that Noveras is the perpetrator of this scheme on account of his name and face appearing in the materials is non sequitur.

Lastly, I submit that the fraudulent scheme of using government resources for partisan activities was not ""calculated to induce the electorate of Aurora to cast their votes in favor of Noveras and his ticket""[94]—at least, not in the sense intended by the law.

In determining the ""inducement"" contemplated by Section 261(e), the Court's discussion in Aisporna v. CA[95] is instructive:

Legislative intent must be ascertained from a consideration of the statute as a whole. The particular words, clauses and phrases should not be studied as detached and isolated expressions, but the whole and every part of the statute must be considered in fixing the meaning of any of its parts and in order to produce harmonious whole. A statute must be so construed as to harmonize and give effect to all its provisions whenever possible. The meaning of the law, it must be borne in mind, is not to be extracted from any single part, portion or section or from isolated words and phrases, clauses or sentences but from a general consideration or view of the act as a whole. Every part of the statute must be interpreted with reference to the context. This means that every part of the statute must be considered together with the other parts, and kept subservient to the general intent of the whole enactment, not separately and independently. More importantly, the doctrine of associated words (Noscitur a Sociis) provides that where a particular word or phrase in a statement is ambiguous in itself or is equally susceptible of various meanings, its true meaning may be made clear and specific by considering the company in which it is found or with which it is associated.[96] (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)

Here, the ""inducement"" or ""compulsion"" punished under Section 261(e) must be read in conjunction with the other prohibited acts in the provision, i.e., threatening, intimidating, or inflicting violence, injury, punishment, damage, loss or disadvantage. From the title of the sub-section alone, ""threats, intimidation, terrorism, use of fraudulent device[,] or other forms of coercion,"" it is evident that the offense is intended to pertain to a certain degree of devious acts or machinations. Accordingly, the fraudulent scheme to induce or compel the casting of votes penalized under Section 261(e), involves a level of deceit akin to an infliction of violence upon persons. Notably, Section 261(e) has indeed been used to prosecute and disqualify candidates who commit vote-buying, terrorism, and similar schemes to induce voters and/or to rig the elections in their favor.[97]

As such, campaign materials per se cannot ""induce"" the electorate to cast their votes in favor of a certain candidate under the contemplation of Section 261(e). By its very nature, campaign materials endorse specific candidates and persuade voters to cast their votes in favor of these candidates. As such, mere printing of campaign materials using government resources can hardly be considered as calculated to induce the electorate to vote in favor of a certain candidate.

Accordingly, I submit that there is likewise no substantial evidence to find Noveras guilty of committing the second class of acts prohibited under Section 261(e). There is, thus, no basis to disqualify Noveras on this ground.

There is no evidence—direct or circumstantial—proving the guilt of Noveras.
During the case deliberations wherein I raised the opinion which I now write, it was suggested that: 1) I am espousing the view that only direct evidence can be sufficient to hold Noveras accountable, and 2) that such a view is mistaken because circumstantial evidence, as laid down in the ponencia, suffices to support a finding of guilt.

For clarity, I do not think that direct evidence is necessary in this case. I agree that circumstantial evidence—or evidence which proves another fact than the act in issue but nevertheless proves the same by inference or logic—can be enough, as long as the requisites therefore as established in jurisprudence are satisfied.

Under Section 4, Rule 133 of the Revised Rules of Court, circumstantial evidence is sufficient for conviction if the following requisites concur: (a) there is more than one circumstance; (b) the facts from which the inferences are derived are proven; and (c) the combination of all the circumstances is such as to produce a conviction beyond reasonable doubt. These circumstances must be consistent with one another, and the only rational hypothesis that can be drawn therefrom must be the guilt of the accused.[98]

While this provision appears to refer only to criminal cases, the Court has applied its principles to administrative cases. In Re: AC No. 04-AM-2002 (Josejina Fria v. Gemiliana de los Angeles),[99] the Court ruled:

For the third requisite to seal the circumstantial evidence against respondent, it is essential that the circumstantial evidence presented must constitute an unbroken chain which leads one to a fair and reasonable conclusion pointing to the person being accused, to the exclusion of others, as the guilty person.

Though administrative proceedings are not strictly bound by formal rules on evidence, the liberality of procedure in administrative actions is still subject to the limitations imposed by the fundamental requirement of due process, especially if the charge, as in the case at bar, if found to be true, also warrants her indictment criminally.[100] (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)

To be clear and as shown by a plain reading of this opinion, what I submit is not that direct evidence is indispensable, but that no evidence—either direct or circumstantial—was proven or alleged in this case which can support a fair and reasonable conclusion of Noveras's guilt. As mentioned, even assuming as true the allegations of Amansec, there can be no reasonable inference that the elements of the charges were proven.

The truth is that there is not even a reasonable connection among these allegations and the elements of the offenses. To stress an example I gave earlier, the ponencia relies on the ""circumstantial evidence"" of employer-employee relationship between Noveras and Tecuico to infer that the former employed threats and intimidation on Tecuico for the latter to help in the campaign by printing his (Noveras') tarpaulins using the machines in Tecuico's office.

With due respect, I submit that the inference that the ponencia makes (employment of threats, intimidation) from the fact established (Noveras is Tecuico's superior) nowhere near satisfies the requirements of the law. It is not an inference that is ""a fair and reasonable conclusion [that points to Noveras], to the exclusion of [all] others, as the guilty person.""[101] The fact that Noveras is Tecuico's superior, alone, cannot, by any stretch of imagination, lock in Noveras as the only possible ""mastermind"" in Tecuico's acts or even that Tecuico was instructed to commit the offense and did not act by his own volition.","ACCORDINGLY, the present petition is DISMISSED. The September 6, 2023 Resolution of the Commission on Elections En Banc in SPA Case No. 22-048 (DC) is AFFIRMED insofar as it disqualified petitioner Gerardo ""Jerry"" A.

"G.R. No. 264125, October 22, 2024","NOEL E. ROSAL, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS AND JOSEPH SAN JUAN ARMOGILA, RESPONDENTS.","In three separate petitions for disqualification[10] dated April 11, 2022, Armogila called for the disqualification of Noel, Carmen, and Barizo for alleged violations of Section 68(a)[11] and Section 68(e)[12] in relation to Section 261(v)(2)[13] of the Omnibus Election Code (OEC). Noel, Carmen, and Barizo were then running for the positions of Governor of Albay province, Mayor, and Councilor, respectively, in the City of Legazpi, Albay. Noel's disqualification case was raffled to the COMELEC First Division and was docketed as SPA No. 22-031 (DC). Carmen's disqualification case was raffled to the COMELEC Second Division and was docketed as SPA No. 22-032 (DC). Barizo's disqualification case was also raffled to the COMELEC Second Division and was docketed as SPA No. 22-030 (DC).

The petitions for disqualification similarly alleged that Noel, Carmen, and Barizo engaged in vote-buying under Section 68(a) of the OEC and violated the prohibition under Section 261(v) of the OEC against the release, disbursement, and expenditure of public funds within 45 days before the date of the regular election.[14]

Specifically, Armogila recounted that on March 31, 2022, Barizo posted in his Facebook account an activity called ""2-Day Tricycle Driver's Cash Assistance Payout @ Fishport Legazpi.""[15] The caption of the post read:
""2-Day Tricycle Driver's Cash Assistance Payout @ Fishport Legazpi.

Thank you Governor Noel E. Rosal, Mayor Gie Rosal, VM Bobby Cristobal, the incumbent [and] aspiring Councilors.

Salamat man sa TODA sa suporta asin marhay na kooperasyon! Mabuhay kamu!

Committee on Public Utilities & Energy
(Transportation)

#tapatsubokmay puso""[16]
The post was also allegedly accompanied by photographs of Noel, Carmen, and Barizo with numerous individuals who were presumably tricycle drivers who went to the activity to receive the cash assistance.[17]

Armogila claimed that he inquired with the members of the Tricycle Operators' and Drivers' Association (TODA) to verify the post of Barizo. The tricycle drivers allegedly told him that as early as March 25, 2022, they were directly contacted by Barizo or his representative, inviting them to the activity. The tricycle drivers were made to understand that the payout was a ""cash assistance"" in the amount of PHP 2,000.00 from one Mayor Rosal, who may either refer to Noel as the then incumbent Mayor, or Carmen, who was then a mayoralty candidate. Armogila stressed that the messages received by the tricycle drivers expressly manifested gratitude for the support given to Noel, Carmen, and Barizo.[18]

Armogila further recounted that another cash payout in the amount of PHP 2,000.00 was staged by the local government unit (LGU) in favor of the senior citizens on April 2, 2022.[19]

Armogila alleged that the messages and the Facebook post manifested the intention to influence, induce, and corrupt the electorate in casting their votes in favor of Noel, Carmen, and Barizo. The timing of the release of the cash assistance and the display of election paraphernalia excluded any other explanation for the payout. The constant mention of the names of Noel, Carmen, and Barizo, who were electoral candidates, in the text messages and in the Facebook post clearly established electioneering. Armogila stressed that Carmen was not an incumbent public official then and hence, her presence during the payout was uncalled for and unnecessary if said activity was indeed part of an official government function.[20]

Armogila further emphasized that Section 261(v)(2) of the OEC provides that ""[s]hould [a] calamity or disaster occur, all releases normally or usually coursed through the said [ministries] and offices of other [ministries] shall be turned over to, and administered [and disbursed] by, the Philippine National Red Cross, subject to the supervision of the Commission on Audit or its representatives, and no candidate or his or her spouse or member of his family within the second civil degree of affinity or consanguinity shall participate, directly or indirectly, in the distribution of any relief, or other goods to the victims of the calamity or disaster."" Hence, where the cash assistance was made in response to the pandemic, the OEC has strictly provided for the process and mechanism governing the release of the same. None was, however, followed. Instead, according to Armogila, the release of the funds was facilitated by the office of Barizo, in apparent cooperation with Noel and with the special participation of Carmen.[21]

On April 25, 2022, the COMELEC First and Second Divisions issued Summons with Notice of Preliminary Conference to Noel, Carmen, and Barizo directing them to file their Verified Answer within a non-extendible period of five days from notice. The Preliminary Conference was set on May 4, 2022.[22]

On May 2, 2022, Noel, Carmen, and Barizo each filed their Answer and asked for the resetting of the preliminary conference. All essentially argued that the payout of cash assistance to tricycle drivers and senior citizens cannot be considered as vote-buying as the same was only a continuation of the programs that were already implemented as early as August 2021 under the 2020-2022 Medium Term Public Investment Program (MTPIP) of the Local Government of Legazpi City and were duly reported before the Commission on Audit (COA).[23]

For his part, Barizo also denied having knowledge of the Facebook post. He claimed that although he has an official Facebook page, he was not personally handling the same. He also asserted that his presence during the said cash assistance payout cannot be determined based on the screenshot of the photos submitted by Armogila. The persons who rendered the cash assistance were duly authorized disbursement personnel and not him. Barizo further denied having knowledge of the text messages allegedly received by the tricycle drivers regarding the schedule of the cash payout.[24]

Meanwhile, Noel, Carmen, and Barizo all won as Governor, Mayor, and Councilor, respectively, in the May 9, 2022 NLE.[25]

On May 11, 2022, the COMELEC First Division in SPA No. 22-031 (DC) issued an Order noting Noel's Verified Answer but denying his motion to reset the hearing on the preliminary conference, as it did not find the prior professional engagements of his handling lawyers as sufficient justification to relax the rules. The COMELEC First Division also then considered the case submitted for resolution.[26]

On the other hand, the COMELEC Second Division reset the preliminary conference in the cases of Carmen and Barizo in SPA No. 22-­032 (DC) and SPA No. 22-030 (DC), respectively, to May 19, 2022.[27]

On September 19, 2022, the COMELEC First Division in SPA No. 22-031 (DC) granted the petition for disqualification against Noel.[28] It also acted on the previous motions of Noel, specifically the Partial Motion for Reconsideration of the Order dated May 11, 2022 and the Supplemental Partial Motion for Reconsideration with Motion to Admit Marking of Documentary Evidence and Attached Memorandum. Finding no cogent reason to relax the rules, the COMELEC First Division denied these motions.[29]

The COMELEC First Division found that the cash assistance payouts constituted a violation of Section 261(v)(2) of the OEC on the prohibition against the release, disbursement, and expenditure of public funds by public officials and employees for all social welfare and development projects and activities during the campaign period. The COMELEC First Division did not give credence to Noel's argument that the cash assistance was exempted from the prohibition since the activity was just a continuation of what already started in 2021. The COMELEC First Division held that the law does not state that a continuing social welfare and development project is excluded or exempted from the prohibition. The exemption applies only to ongoing public works commenced before the campaign period or similar projects under foreign agreements.[30]

The COMELEC First Division also held that the purported compliance with the reportorial requirement pursuant to COA Circular No. 2013-004 was ineffectual. Even assuming that it was not, the requirement is applicable only to exempted ongoing public work projects commenced before the campaign period.[31]

However, even as the COMELEC First Division found Noel to have violated Section 261(v)(2), it nonetheless ruled that he is not guilty of vote-buying under Section 68(a) of the OEC. It found that the evidence attached to the petition shows that the recipients of the payouts were made aware that the amount they received was due them and was not for the purpose of influencing or inducing them to vote for Noel. The text messages of gratitude for the support cannot be construed as having been intended to influence or induce the recipients to vote for Noel or Carmen because nowhere in these messages were their candidacies mentioned.[32]

Noel moved for reconsideration, but the COMELEC En Banc issued on November 18, 2022 its assailed Resolution[33] denying the same. Hence, his present Petition in G.R. No. 264125.

On January 26, 2024, Bichara, the second placer in the gubernatorial position in the Province of Albay during the May 9, 2022 NLE, filed a Motion for Leave of Court to File Petition for Intervention with Attached Petition for Intervention before the Court in G.R. No. 264125.[34] Bichara argues therein that he should be declared the rightful governor of Albay following the disqualification of Noel.[35]

Meanwhile, on October 4, 2022, the COMELEC Second Division also granted the petition for disqualification against Carmen in SPA No. 22-032 (DC).[36]

Like the First Division, the COMELEC Second Division also found nothing in the subject Facebook post which would support the charge of vote-buying against Carmen. It found that ""[w]hat the [Facebook] post shows is an organized group that appears to be listening to the speaker, nothing else.""[37]

Neither did the COMELEC Second Division find any link between the supposed text messages to the tricycle drivers and Carmen. Said messages did not mention that the sender was she, nor was her name mentioned. As with the affidavits of the tricycle drivers, the COMELEC Second Division noted that they were able to identify the sender of the text messages, who was not Carmen. Hence, what they had was only a conjecture that the cash assistance might have come from her.[38]

The COMELEC Second Division also reviewed a compact disc (CD) which purportedly showed a gathering. It observed, however, that it was unclear when such gathering happened. While a senior citizen mentioned a date and from whom the PHP 2,000.00 cash payout came, the COMELEC Second Division noted that the expression of gratitude did not equate to participation or inducement on the part of Carmen.[39]

As to the charge of violation of Section 261(v)(2) of the OEC, the COMELEC Second Division held that the provision does not admit any exemption for as long as the prohibited act transpired during the 45-day ban before a regular election. Citing Velez v. People[40] (Velez), the COMELEC Second Division held that the law does not state that ongoing social development projects are excluded from the prohibition. The exemption as regards continuing programs or projects only applies to public works and not to social services and development.[41]

The COMELEC Second Division also held that the reporting to COA likewise does not matter, since the only instance that the supervision of COA is required is during a calamity and disaster, where the public funds are turned over to the Philippine Red Cross (PRC). Drawing attention to Section 13[42] of COMELEC Resolution No. 10747,[43] the COMELEC Second Division held that what should have been done by the LGU was to file a petition before the Clerk of COMELEC for the issuance of a Certificate of Exception for the social welfare projects it intended to implement during the prohibited period.[44]

As to the argument of Carmen that she should not be held liable under Section 261 (v)(2) of the OEC since she was then a mere candidate and not a public official or employee, the COMELEC Second Division ruled that she should nonetheless be considered as a principal by indispensable cooperation, pursuant to Section 263[45] of the OEC. The COMELEC Second Division determined that it was established that Carmen appeared to have benefited from the LGU's project where public funds were definitely released, disbursed, and spent to sponsor the cash payout. The said project, the distribution of the individual cash payouts, the attribution of the project not only to the LGU but to Carmen, as well, and the fact that she eventually won were vital elements of the offense. In other words, Carmen made it appear that she was one with the LGU and with her husband, who was then the incumbent mayor. Her mere presence during the distribution of the cash assistance rendered moral assistance to the LGU.[46]

On October 10, 2022, Carmen filed a motion for reconsideration.[47]

On December 7, 2022, Alfredo A. Garbin, Jr. (Garbin) filed a Motion for Leave to File Petition for Intervention in SPA No. 22-032 (DC). Garbin argued that, as the one who obtained the second highest number of votes for the position of Mayor of Legazpi City during the May 9, 2022 NLE, he stands to be affected by the COMELEC Second Division's Resolution and thus should be allowed to intervene in the case. The COMELEC Second Division granted Garbin's motion.[48]

On February 16, 2023, Cristobal, the candidate who won as Vice Mayor of Legazpi City in the May 9, 2022 NLE, filed his Answer-in-Intervention.[49]

On May 4, 2023, the COMELEC En Banc partially granted Carmen's motion for reconsideration, but only insofar as to the ground for upholding her disqualification. The COMELEC En Banc held that Carmen cannot be held liable for violating the prohibition against release, disbursement, or expenditure of public funds during the 45-day period prior to election day because she was not a public official at the time the offense was committed. Section 261(v) of the OEC prohibits any public official or employee to release, disburse, or expend public funds for social welfare programs during the prohibited period.[50]

The COMELEC En Banc also found it erroneous to relate Section 261(v) of the OEC with Section 263 of the OEC. For one, no evidence was presented to show that the acts committed by Carmen were indispensable in the commission of the offense. Even if she was not present in the activities, the same would have still been held and the distribution of the cash assistance during the prohibited period would still have occurred. Additionally, Section 263 of the OEC is entitled ""Persons criminally liable;"" and hence, is confined to an enumeration of individuals who may incur criminal liability when an election offense is committed.[51]

Nonetheless, the COMELEC En Banc held that Carmen should still be disqualified for giving money to influence, induce, or corrupt the voters under Section 68(a) of the OEC. Unlike Section 261(v), Section 68(a) does not distinguish, and it disqualifies any candidate who is found by COMELEC of giving money to influence, induce, or corrupt the voters. The COMELEC En Banc found that to an ordinary reader, the Facebook post of Barizo necessarily evoked the message that the cash assistance payouts were given by no other than Noel, Carmen, Cristobal, and the incumbent and aspiring Councilors. There could be no other reasonable interpretation because gratitude is ordinarily and naturally accorded to the giver.[52]","These are four consolidated Petitions for Certiorari[1] (Petitions) under Rule 65 in relation to Rule 64 of the Rules of Court, filed by petitioners Noel E. Rosal (Noel), Carmen Geraldine Rosal (Carmen), Jose Alfonso V. Barizo (Barizo), and Oscar Robert H. Cristobal (Cristobal). All Petitions are with applications for the issuance of a temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction.

In G.R. No. 264125, Noel assails the Resolution[2] dated September 19, 2022 of public respondent Commission on Elections (COMELEC) First Division, which granted the petition for disqualification filed by Joseph San Juan Armogila (Armogila) against Noel and consequently disqualified him to run for the position of Governor in the Province of Albay in the May 9, 2022 National and Local Elections (NLE). Noel also assails the Resolution[3] dated November 18, 2022 of the COMELEC En Banc, which denied his motion for reconsideration.

In G.R. No. 264125, a Motion for Leave of Court to File Petition for Intervention with Attached Petition for Intervention[4] was likewise filed by Al Francis C. Bichara (Bichara), praying that the Court order his proclamation as rightful Governor of Albay, following Noel's disqualification.[5]

In G.R. No. 266796, Carmen assails the Resolution[6] dated October 4, 2022 of the COMELEC Second Division, which also granted the petition for disqualification filed against her by Armogila and thusly disqualified her, as well, to run for the position of Mayor of Legazpi City in the May 9, 2022 NLE. Carmen also assails the Resolution[7] dated May 4, 2023 of the COMELEC En Banc, which partially granted her motion for reconsideration, but ultimately maintained her disqualification on a different ground.

These same Resolutions being challenged by Carmen are likewise being questioned in G.R. No. 266775 by Cristobal, the incumbent Vice Mayor of Legazpi City, on the ground that they incorrectly declared the second placer in the May 9, 2022 NLE as the duly elected Mayor of Legazpi City.

On the other hand, in G.R. No. 269274, Barizo assails the Resolution[8] dated May 5, 2023 of the COMELEC Second Division, which also granted the petition for disqualification filed against him by Armogila and thusly disqualified him to run as Councilor in Legazpi City for the May 9, 2022 NLE. Barizo also assails the Resolution[9] dated September 27, 2023 of the COMELEC En Banc, which denied his motion for partial reconsideration.","In resolving these consolidated Petitions filed via Rule 64 in relation to Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, the Court is limited to the finding of whether or not the respondent tribunal committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in issuing the assailed Resolutions.[67] Grave abuse of discretion refers to such arbitrary, capricious, or whimsical exercise of judgment as is tantamount to lack of jurisdiction.[68] Mere abuse of discretion is not enough; the abuse of discretion must be patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law, or to act at all in contemplation of law, as where the power is exercised in an arbitrary and despotic manner by reason of passion and hostility.[69]

There is grave abuse of discretion when a constitutional organ such as the COMELEC makes manifestly gross errors in its factual inferences such that critical pieces of evidence, which have been nevertheless properly introduced by a party, or admitted, or which were the subject of stipulation, are ignored or not accounted for.[70] A glaring misinterpretation of the constitutional text or of statutory provisions, as well as a misreading or misapplication of the current state of jurisprudence, is also considered grave abuse of discretion. The arbitrariness consists in the disregard of the current state of our law.[71]

Here, the Petitions must prosper if COMELEC, in appreciating and calibrating the evidence as it arrived at the assailed Resolutions, exceeded its authority or exercised its discretion in an excessive, arbitrary, and gravely abusive manner. The grant of the Petitions based on these asserted violations effectively recognizes that, in acting as it did, COMELEC committed errors of the level that effectively affected its jurisdiction.[72]

On the other hand, the Petitions must fail, however, if COMELEC's acts, even though viewed erroneous under the terms of the asserted violations, were still well within the limits of its powers under the Constitution and relevant statutes. The Court must, in such case, recognize COMELEC's exercise of its discretion in issuing the assailed Resolutions to be proper and well within its jurisdiction.[73]

Viewed through this narrow lens, the Court partly grants the Petitions. The Court affirms the COMELEC Resolutions in SPA No. 22-031 (DC) and in SPA No. 22-030 (DC), which disqualified Noel and Barizo, respectively, for violation of Section 261(v)(2) of the OEC. Insofar as the COMELEC Resolutions in SPA No. 22-032 (DC) are concerned, the Court affirms the disqualification of Carmen, albeit on a different ground, which is for violation of Section 261 (v)(2) of the OEC.

Anent the issue of who replaces the disqualified and removed elected public officials, the Court is compelled to resolve the same on a much narrower perspective as it weighs the peculiar circumstances arising in this case, warranting a seemingly unprecedent action but one that does not, in itself, aspire to become doctrinal precedent beyond the bounds of the present sui generis action.

I.
COMELEC did not commit grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in holding that Noel and Barizo are not guilty of vote-buying under Section 68(a) of the OEC. However, COMELEC committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction when it held Carmen guilty of vote-buying under the same Section.


Section 68(a) of the OEC reads:
Sec. 68. Disqualifications. – Any candidate who, in an action or protest in which he is a party is declared by final decision of a competent court guilty of, or found by the Commission of having

a. given money or other material consideration to influence, induce or corrupt the voters or public officials performing electoral functions[.]
To be disqualified under the above-quoted provision, the following elements must be proved: (a) the candidate, personally or through his or her instructions, must have given money or other material consideration; and (b) the act of giving money or other material consideration must be for the purpose of influencing, inducing, or corrupting the voters or public officials performing electoral functions.[74] These elements are absent in this case.

The ruling in Lozano v. Yorac[75] (Lozano) is instructive. The Court in said case upheld the factual findings and conclusions reached by COMELEC in ruling on the disqualification case of Jejomar Binay on the charge of vote-buying in this wise:
Respondent COMELEC, in dismissing the petition for disqualification and in holding that respondent Binay is not guilty of vote buying, ruled as follows:

. . . .
""There is ample evidence to show that it was not respondent Binay who 'gave' the plastic bags containing Christmas gifts to the witnesses who executed affidavits for the petitioners. The 'giver' was in fact the Municipality of Makati.

. . . .

""More[,] Petitioners' documentary evidence, among which are Exhibits 'A'; 'A-1'; 'A-2'; 'A-20'; 'B'; 'B-1'; 'B-2'; 'B-25'; 'C-1; 'C-2'; 'C-27'; 'D'; 'E' and 'F', all show indubitably that the Christmas packages which were distributed between the periods of December 22-30, 1987, were ordered, purchased and paid for by the Municipality of Makati and not by respondent Binay. There is more than prima facie proofs to show that those gift packages received by the witnesses for petitioners were intended as Christmas presents to Makati's indigents in December 1988.

""It would therefore appear from the evidence submitted by the petitioners themselves that the giver, if any, of the Christmas gifts which were received by the witnesses for the petitioners was in fact, the Municipality of Makati and not respondent Jejomar C. Binay. The presence of respondent Binay, if at all true at the time the gifts were distributed by the Municipality of Makati to the recipients of the Christmas gifts, was incidental. It did not make respondent Binay as the ""giver"" of those Christmas gifts. Nor did the giving of such gifts by the Municipal Government of Makati influence the recipients to vote for respondent Binay considering that the affiants themselves who testified for the petitioners admitted and were aware that the gift packages came from the Municipality of Makati and not from respondent Jejomar C. Binay.[""]

. . . .
We uphold the foregoing factual findings, as well as the conclusions reached by respondent COMELEC, in dismissing the petition for the disqualification of respondent Binay. No clear and convincing proof exists to show that respondent Binay was indeed engaged in vote buying. The traditional gift-giving of the Municipality of Makati during the Christmas season is not refuted. That it was implemented by respondent Binay as OIC Mayor of Makati at that time does not sufficiently establish that respondent was trying to influence and induce his constituents to vote for him. This would be stretching the interpretation of the law too far. Petitioner deduces from this act of gift giving that respondent was buying the votes of the Makati residents. It requires more than a mere tenuous deduction to prove the offense of vote-buying. There has to be concrete and direct evidence or, at least, strong circumstantial evidence to support the charge that respondent was indeed engaged in vote-buying. We are convinced that the evidence presented, as swell as the facts obtaining in the case at bar, do not warrant such finding.[76] (Emphasis supplied)
The foregoing conclusion in Lozano strongly applies in this case. The allegations and evidence against Noel, Carmen, and Barizo do not concretely and directly show that they personally initiated, controlled, or supervised the conduct of the cash assistance payouts for the purpose of influencing, inducing, or corrupting the recipients to vote for them.

To begin with, the cash assistance payouts were established to be the project of the LGU, specifically by the City Social Welfare and Development Office (CSWDO). It was a cash assistance program that was already the subject of Appropriation Ordinance No. 15-0007-2022, which was approved by the Sangguniang Panlungsod on March 1, 2022. The funds were therefore already obligated, having been included in the 2020-2022 MTPIP of the LGU. The MTPIP, in turn, was adopted by the Sangguniang Panlungsod by virtue of Resolution No. 14-0182-2019. The CSWDO had scheduled and started the implementation of the program in August 2021, extending cash assistance payouts to tricycle drivers on September 17, 21, and 24, 2021, and to senior citizens on August 26 to 27, 2021, September 2 to 4, 2021, September 9 to 11, 2021, September 16 to 17, 2021, and September 23 to 24, 2021.[77] In other words, it was sufficiently established that at the time relevant to these cases, the program was an ongoing one, commenced as early as 2021, long before the start of the election and campaign periods on January 9 and February 8, 2022, respectively. Moreover, it was spearheaded by one Maria Marlene G. Manaya of the CSWDO. Given this factual backdrop, it cannot be gainsaid that the decision to go through with the cash assistance payouts did not come from Noel, Carmen, and/or Barizo in any way, shape, or form. Apart from the Facebook post and text messages that merely informed of the events, there was no other evidence presented which would prove that they gave the cash assistance payouts personally or through their own instructions.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition in G.R. No. 264125 is DISMISSED. The COMELEC Resolutions dated September 19, 2022 and November 18, 2022 in SPA No. 22-031 (DC), disqualifying Noel E. Rosal to run as Governor of the Province of Albay during the May 9, 2022 National and Local Elections are AFFIRMED. The Petition for Intervention of Al Francis C. Bichara filed in the same case is DISMISSED.

The Petition in G.R. No. 266796 is DISMISSED. The COMELEC Resolutions dated October 4, 2022 and May 4, 2023 in SPA No. 22-032 (DC) disqualifying Carmen Geraldine Rosal to run as Mayor in Legazpi City in the May 9, 2022 National and Local Elections are AFFIRMED.

The Petition in G.R. No. 266775 is DECONSOLIDATED from G.R. No. 264125, G.R. No. 266796, and G.R. No. 269274. Pro hac vice, COMELEC is directed, with dispatch, to separately docket a disqualification proceeding against Vice Mayor Oscar Robert H. Cristobal in order to determine whether he is also disqualified from running for the office of Vice Mayor in the 2022 National and Local Elections under Section 261(v)(2) in relation to Section 68 of the Omnibus Election Code.

In the meantime, the Status Quo Ante Order issued by the Court on May 11, 2023 is hereby LIFTED with immediate effect. Accordingly, the assailed COMELEC Resolutions dated October 4, 2022 and May 4, 2023 in SPA No. 22-032 (DC) shall likewise immediately take effect.

The Petition in G.R. No. 269274 is likewise DISMISSED and the COMELEC Resolutions dated May 5, 2023 and September 27, 2023 in SPA No. 22-030 (DC), disqualifying Jose Alfonso V.

TALAWEC, RESPONDENTS.","On October 6, 2021, Amangyen filed a COC for the position of Municipal Mayor of Paracelis, Mountain Province in the 2022 NLE.[5] On November 2, 2021, as a registered voter in the Municipality of Paracelis, Talawec filed a Petition to Cancel Amangyen's COC on the ground of material misrepresentation for making the following entries:[6]
Item 11. I am eligible for the office I seek to be elected to.

Item 22. Have you ever been found liable for an offense which carries with it the accessory penalty of perpetual disqualification to hold public office which has become final and executory?

Talawec argued that Amangyen misrepresented that he is eligible to run for public office and that he has never been found liable for an offense which carries with it the accessory penalty of perpetual disqualification because Amangyen was convicted for a violation of Presidential Decree No. 705 and was sentenced to suffer reclusion temporal in Criminal Case No. 2012-7-18-67 (For: Violation of Section 77 [formerly 68], of Presidential Decree No. 705, as amended)[7] titled, People of the Philippines v. Amangyen, before Branch 35, Regional Trial Court, Bontoc, Mountain Province (RTC Bontoc). This was later affirmed by the Court in G.R. No. 236892.[8] Pursuant to Articles 41 and 30 of the Revised Penal Code, the principal penalty of reclusion temporal carries with it the accessory of perpetual absolute disqualification, which deprives a person of the right to hold public office.[9] Additionally, Talawec alleged that Amangyen is disqualified to be a candidate pursuant to Section 12 of the Omnibus Election Code (OEC) after being sentenced to imprisonment for more than 18 months.[10]

On November 29, 2021, in his verified Answer, Amangyen countered that his conviction has not yet attained finality because of a pending Motion for Intervention filed by one Johnny B. Cailin (Cailin) before the Supreme Court.[11] Cailin, as the registered owner of Paracelis Furniture Shop, which was the subject of the criminal case against Amangyen, alleged that Amangyen's conviction is void for being tainted with grave abuse of discretion and violative of Cailin's constitutional right to due process of law.[12] Cailin prays for Amangyen's acquittal and seeks to be indicted and tried for the crime for which Amangyen was convicted. Amangyen further prayed for the summary dismissal of the Petition.[13]","Before the Court is a Petition for Certiorari[1] under Rule 64, in relation to Rule 65 (Petition), filed by petitioner Avelino C. Amangyen (Amangyen) to assail the Resolutions, dated April 19, 2022[2] and October 7, 2022,[3] of the respondent Commission on Elections (COMELEC), which granted the Petition[4] filed by private respondent Franklin W. Talawec (Talawec) to deny due course or cancel Amangyen's Certificate of Candidacy (COC) for the position of Mayor of Paracelis, Mountain Province in the May 9, 2022 National and Local Elections (2022 NLE).","The Petition is dismissed.   
 
Power of the COMELEC to suspend or relax its procedural rules	 

Amangyen contends that the COMELEC should have dismissed Talawec's Petition to cancel his COC because it invoked two grounds, namely, that he committed a material representation in the contents of his COC and that he is disqualified to be a candidate pursuant to Section 12 of the OEC after being sentenced to imprisonment for more than 18 months. He argues that this is in violation of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure[38], particularly Rule 23, Section 1 of the COMELEC Rules, which reads:
Section 1. Ground for Denial or Cancellation of Certificate of Candidacy. – A verified Petition to Deny Due Course to or Cancel a Certificate of Candidacy for any elective office may be filed by any registered voter or a duly registered political party, organization, or coalition of political parties on the exclusive ground that any material representation contained therein as required by law is false.

A Petition to Deny Due Course to or Cancel Certificate of Candidacy invoking grounds other than those stated above or grounds for disqualification, or combining grounds for a separate remedy shall be summarily dismissed.
While the COMELEC Rules provide that a Petition to Deny Due Course or Cancel a Certificate of Candidacy should invoke the exclusive ground that any material misrepresentation contained in a COC is false, the Court also agrees with the COMELEC that this procedural rule may be relaxed. Rule 1, Section 4 of the COMELEC Rules explicitly provides:
Section 4. Suspension of the Rules. –  In the interest of justice and in order to obtain speedy disposition of all matters pending before the Commission, these rules or any portion thereof may be suspended by the Commission.
The application of this rule is settled. In Hayudini v. COMELEC,[39] the Court reiterated the reason for the liberal interpretation of the COMELEC Rules, highlighting the need to ascertain the real choice of the electorate. It explained:
Settled is the rule that the COMELEC Rules of Procedure are subject to liberal construction. The COMELEC has the power to liberally interpret or even suspend its rules of procedure in the interest of justice, including obtaining a speedy disposition of all matters pending before it. This liberality is for the purpose of promoting the effective and efficient implementation of its objectives[—]ensuring the holding of free, orderly, honest, peaceful, and credible elections, as well as achieving just, expeditious, and inexpensive determination and disposition of every action and proceeding brought before the COMELEC. Unlike an ordinary civil action, an election contest is imbued with public interest. It involves not only the adjudication of private and pecuniary interests of rival candidates, but also the paramount need of dispelling the uncertainty which beclouds the real choice of the electorate. And the tribunal has the corresponding duty to ascertain, by all means within its command, whom the people truly chose as their rightful leader.[40] (Emphasis supplied)
In Caballero v. COMELEC,[41] the Court citing Hayudini excused the failure to personally serve a copy of the Petition to Deny Due Course or Cancel a Certificate of Candidacy to the respondent prior to its filing considering the physical impossibility of following the said requirement and the respondent received a copy of the said petition during a scheduled conference, which afforded him the opportunity to rebut the allegations through a memorandum.[42] The Court further explained that the relaxation of the rules was because the petition questioned the respondent's residency requirement, which pertains to his qualification and eligibility to run for public office and imbued with public interest.[43]

In the present case, Talawec sought to cancel Amangyen's COC because the latter misrepresented that he has not been found liable for an offense which carries with it the accessory penalty of absolute perpetual disqualification. This pertains to Amangyen's qualification and eligibility to run for public office and is thus imbued with public interest. Thus, the COMELEC was justified in not summarily dismissing the Petition even if it was not filed on the exclusive ground that a material representation in Amangyen's COC is false. The electorate of the Municipality of Paracelis has the right to vote for a candidate who is eligible to run for public office. To this end, the COMELEC has the discretion to brush aside any technicality that will prevent it from cancelling the certificate of candidacy of someone who is disqualified by law.   
 
Final and executory nature of the conviction for violation of Presidential Decree No. 705; Effect of the pending Petition for Modification of Penalty
 

Amangyen next argues that his conviction for qualified theft under Presidential Decree No. 705 has not yet attained finality because of the pendency of his Petition for Correction/Determination of Proper Imposable Penalty, which seeks to lower the penalty imposed against him following the passage of Republic Act No. 10951.[44]

This contention must be clarified. While Republic Act No. 10951 may apply to lower the penalty for Amangyen's conviction for qualified theft, this will not automatically suspend the service of his sentence for reclusion temporal and its accessory penalty of absolute perpetual disqualification until a decision to that effect by a competent court is rendered with finality.

As correctly pointed out by the COMELEC, the judgment of guilt against Amangyen for qualified theft under Presidential Decree No. 705 is already final and executory following the Entry of Judgment by the Court on July 23, 2018. Meanwhile, on September 16, 2017, Republic Act No. 10951 took effect and adjusted the value of property and damages on which the imposable penalties in the Revised Penal Code are based. The application of the law to cases with a final and executory judgment was clarified by the Court in Hernan v. Sandiganbayan,[45] where it held:
The general rule is that a judgment that has acquired finality becomes immutable and unalterable, and may no longer be modified in any respect even if the modification is meant to correct erroneous conclusions of fact or law and whether it will be made by the court that rendered it or by the highest court of the land. When, however, circumstances transpire after the finality of the decision rendering its execution unjust and inequitable, the Court may sit en banc and give due regard to such exceptional circumstance warranting the relaxation of the doctrine of immutability[.][46]
Thus, while the judgment in Amangyen's criminal case for qualified theft under Presidential Deere No. 705 had become immutable and unalterable, the same may be reopened insofar as modifying the penalty imposed due to the enactment of Republic Act No. 10951 after the finality of the said judgment. At any rate, pending resolution of Amangyen's Petition to determine the proper penalty for his conviction for qualified theft, he must continue to serve the sentence for reclusion temporal with the accessory penalty of absolute perpetual disqualification. Necessarily, the present petition to set aside the COMELEC ruling which disqualified him from running for the mayoralty position in the Municipality of Paracelis in the 2022 NLE must fail.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DISMISSED. The Resolutions, dated April 19, 2022 and October 7, 2022, of the Commission on Elections are AFFIRMED.

Petitioner Avelino C. Amangyen is found GUILTY of contempt of court for his failure to comply with the directive of the Court in its Resolution, dated February 21, 2023, and he is ORDERED to pay an additional fine in the amount of One Thousand Pesos PHP 1,000.00."
