"G.R. No. 261123, August 20, 2024","DUTY TO ENERGIZE THE REPUBLIC THROUGH THE ENLIGHTENMENT OF THE YOUTH [DUTERTE YOUTH] PARTY-LIST, REPRESENTED BY [CHAIRPERSON] RONALD GIAN CARLO L. CARDEMA AND REPRESENTATIVE DUCIELLE MARIE S. CARDEMA, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, KOMUNIDAD NG PAMILYA, PASYENTE AT PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES [P3PWD] PARTY-LIST AND ITS NOMINEES LED BY ROWENA AMELIA V. GUANZON, RESPONDENTS.","The factual antecedents as gathered from the respective memoranda of the Duterte Youth Party-List,[7] respondents P3PWD and Guanzon,[8] and the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) on behalf of respondent COMELEC[9] are as follows:

In 2012, the COMELEC issued Resolution No. 9366,[10] which laid down the rules on withdrawal and substitution of party-list nominees, among others.

In 2015, Guanzon was appointed as Commissioner of the COMELEC to serve a term of seven years, or until February 2, 2022.[11]

On January 27, 2021, the COMELEC promulgated Resolution No. 10690[12] which amended Resolution No. 9366 by setting new deadlines for the withdrawal and substitution of nominations, and requiring party-list groups, organizations, and coalitions to publish, at their own expense, their new list of substitute nominees, within five days from the submission of said list for purposes of the 2022 National and Local Elections (NLE).

On March 23, 2021, P3PWD filed its Petition for Registration and Accreditation as a regional sectoral organization under the party-list system.[13]

On August 18, 2021, the COMELEC issued Resolution No. 10717[14] which recapped the different deadlines concerning political parties and groups or organizations participating under the party-list system for the 2022 NLE.

By the last day set by COMELEC under its Resolution No. 10695, 270 party-list groups—including Duterte Youth and P3PWD—had expressed their intent to participate in the 2022 NLE.[15]

On October 6, 2021, P3PWD submitted the following list of nominees to the COMELEC Law Department:

Grace S. Yeneza

Joel R. Lopez

Michelle R. Ofalla

Guillermo R. Eugenio[16]
On November 5, 2021, P3PWD filed the withdrawal with substitution of its second to fifth nominees and published its new set of nominees in two newspapers of general circulation on November 6, 2021 pursuant to Resolution No. 10717. Thus, the new nominees of P3PWD were:

Marianne Heidi C. Fullon

Peter Jonas R. David

5th
Lily Grace A. Tiangco
Substitute nominee[17]
In Minute Resolution No. 21-13275 dated November 24, 2021, the COMELEC En Banc approved the withdrawal with substitution of nominees of several registered party-lists, including those of P3PWD.[18]

On December 29, 2021, the COMELEC published online the Final List of Party-List Candidates for the 2022 NLE, which included P3PWD.[19]

On February 2, 2022, Chairperson Sheriff Abas, Commissioners Antonio Kho, Jr., and Guanzon retired from their respective COMELEC posts,[20] leaving the body with a total of four Commissioners.

On election day, May 9, 2022, P3PWD garnered 391,174 votes or 1.0629% of the total votes cast for party-list organizations, thus, entitling it to one seat in the House of Representatives (HOR).[21]

On May 26, 2022, the COMELEC En Banc sitting as the National Board of Canvassers (NBOC) proclaimed P3PWD entitled to one seat in the HOR. On the same day, it proclaimed first nominee, Grace S. Yeneza, entitled to sit as representative in the HOR. On May 30, 2022, Yeneza took her oath before Presiding Judge Augusto Jose Y. Arreza of the Regional Trial Court of Makati, Branch 233. On even date, copies of her Certificate of Proclamation and Oath of Office were furnished to the HOR.[22]

On June 7, 2022, second nominee Pozon resigned as a trustee, nominee, and member of P3PWD for personal reasons. Two days later, third to fifth nominees Fullon, David, and Tiangco likewise resigned. Fullon did not state her reason while David resigned due to personal reasons. Tiangco reasoned that she needed to assist her husband in their businesses. A day later, first nominee Yeneza tendered her resignation in order to personally care for her daughter who was diagnosed with stage 3 cancer in December 2021. She acknowledged that while she already took her oath of office, it would not be fair to her party constituents to carry on as their representative in Congress if she cannot give her full attention to the job.[23] Their resignation en masse was reported by various news organizations on June 14, 2022.[24]

On June 14, 2022, P3PWD filed the following before the COMELEC Law Department: (1) Letter from P3PWD Secretary-General Donnabel C. Tenorio regarding the submission of the Board of Resolution of Resignation of Party-List Nominees and Acceptance of Nominees; (2) Affidavit of Filing; (3) Board Resolution No. 2022-02 accepting the resignations of all nominees and substituting its new nominees; (4) notarized resignation letters of nominees; (5) Affidavit of Tenorio and Yeneza stating that the substitute nominees have all the qualifications and none of the disqualifications provided by law; and (6) Certificate of Nomination (CON) and Certificates of Acceptance of Nomination (CAN) of the following substitute nominees:

On June 15, 2022, the COMELEC En Banc, voting three to one, promulgated Minute Resolution No. 22-0774,[26] which granted the withdrawal of the nominations of the previous nominees and gave due course to the above new list of nominees, subject to compliance with the publication requirement under Resolutions Nos. 10690 and 10717. The dispositive portion reads:","In order to safeguard the electorate's will as cast in the ballots, rules and regulations limiting the substitution of party-list nominees do not lose their mandatory character even after elections.
We jointly resolve the following related petitions:

(1)
G.R. No. 261123: Urgent Petition for Certiorari[4] filed by petitioner Duty to Energize the Republic Through the Enlightenment of the Youth (Duterte Youth) Party-List (referred to hereinafter as the Duterte Youth Party-List), represented by Ronald Gian Carlo and Ducielle Marie Cardema (""the Cardemas"") in their official and personal capacities, seeking the annulment of respondent Commission on Elections (COMELEC)'s approval of the substitution of the nominees of respondent Komunidad ng Pamilya, Pasyente at Persons with Disabilities (P3PWD) Party-List, which includes first substitute nominee respondent Ma. Rowena Amelia V. Guanzon (Guanzon); and
 	 
(2)
G.R. No. 261876: Petition[5] for indirect contempt against respondent Guanzon for alleged violation of the Temporary Restraining Order (TRO)[6] issued by the Court on June 29, 2022 in G.R. No. 261123.","This Court recognizes that the COMELEC is empowered by law to prescribe such rules so as to make efficacious and successful the conduct of elections. However, it is a long standing principle in jurisprudence that rules and regulations for the conduct of elections are mandatory before the election, but when they are sought to be enforced after the election they are held to be directory only, if that is possible, especially where, if they are held to be mandatory, innocent voters will be deprived of their votes without any fault on their part. Over time, we have qualified this doctrine to refer only to matters of form and cannot be applied to the substantial qualifications of candidates. This was discussed at length in Mitra v. Commission on Elections, thus:

... [I]t is an established rule of interpretation as regards election laws, that mandatory provisions, requiring certain steps before elections, will be construed as directory after the elections, to give effect to the will of the people.

Quite recently, however, we warned against a blanket and unqualified reading and application of this ruling, as it may carry dangerous significance to the rule of law and the integrity of our elections. For one, such blanket/unqualified reading may provide a way around the law that effectively negates election requirements aimed at providing the electorate with the basic information for an informed choice about a candidate's eligibility and fitness for office. Short of adopting a clear-cut standard, we thus made the following clarification:

... In a choice between provisions on material qualifications of elected officials, on the one hand, and the will of the electorate in any given locality, on the other, we believe and so hold that we cannot choose the electorate will.[105] (Emphasis supplied)","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition in G.R. No. 261123 is GRANTED. COMELEC Minute Resolution No. 22-0774, dated June 15, 2022 is declared NULL and VOID for having been issued with grave abuse of discretion insofar as it approved the substitution of the nominees of respondent P3PWD Party-List. The Court's Temporary Restraining Order dated June 29, 2022 is made PERMANENT.

Respondent P3PWD Party-List is DIRECTED to submit additional nominees pursuant to Section 16 of Republic Act No. 7941 but is STRICTLY ENJOINED from renominating for the duration of the Nineteenth Congress the nominees whose substitutions were declared null and void by this Decision, namely Ma. Rowena Amelia V. Guanzon, Rosalie J. Garcia, Cherrie B. Belmonte-Lim, Donnabel C. Tenorio, and Rodolfo B. Villar, Jr.

The Petition in G.R. No. 261876 is DISMISSED for lack of merit.

Respondent Ma. Rowena Amelia V. Guanzon's countercharge for indirect contempt is likewise DISMISSED for being procedurally defective.

This Decision is immediately executory."
"G.R. No. 254976, August 20, 2024","MARCELINO DELA CRUZ LINGGANAY, PETITIONER, VS. DEL MONTE LAND TRANSPORT BUS COMPANY, INC. AND NARCISO MORALES, RESPONDENTS.","The case stemmed from the amended complaint for illegal dismissal which Lingganay filed against respondents on July 13, 2017. In the amended complaint, Lingganay alleged that respondents illegally terminated his employment and claimed for payment of moral and exemplary damages and attorney's fees.[8]

On August 17, 2017, Lingganay filed his Position Paper With Urgent Motion to Amend[9] his amended complaint (motion to further amend), wherein he prayed for the following additional awards: separation pay, holiday premium, rest day pay, and underpaid wages.

Lingganay alleged that (1) respondents initially hired him as a bus driver with a daily salary of PHP 337.00; (2) on October 21, 2013, while driving the company bus along Maharlika Highway in Barangay Concepcion, Plaridel, Province of Quezon, he figured in an accident involving one Isidro Alvarez; (3) eventually, respondents settled the matter with Isidro Alvarez; (4) on December 7, 2013, his employment contract with respondents ended, but he continued to work as a ""yardman"" with a daily wage of PHP 300.00; (5) on December 10, 2013, respondents rehired him as a bus driver; (6) sometime in 2014, respondents assigned him at the motor pool division of the company in Cubao, Quezon City; (7) subsequently, on July 15, 2015, respondents transferred him to the Lucena Line of DLTB Co.;[10] (8) on November 5, 2015, respondents suspended him for five days for failure to ""take time schedule"" on October 8, 2015; (9) on January 21, 2017, respondents again suspended him for 10 days for being involved in an accident with a motorcycle on December 30, 2016; (10) he resumed his duties on January 31, 2017, but ""with warning"" from respondents; (11) on May 1, 2017, while driving the company bus along the San Juanico Bridge, Samar, he again figured in an accident as he crashed into the rear portion of a Toyota Wigo; (12) consequently, respondents issued a Memorandum[11] dated May 5, 2017, giving him five days to explain his side and placing him under preventive suspension; (13) on May 22, 2017, he submitted a handwritten Salaysay and attended the administrative hearing/investigation of the case.[12]

In the Decision[13] dated May 29, 2017, respondents terminated Lingganay from employment for transgressing the company rules and regulations on health and safety, i.e., ""Violation 8.1.4 — Any form of laxity, reckless driving and gross negligence resulting to damages to property, injuries, death[,] and other casualties.""[14] This prompted Lingganay to file a complaint for illegal dismissal with money claims against respondents. In his complaint, Lingganay argued as follows:
It was not his fault that a van suddenly overtook the Toyota Wigo which was in front of the bus he was then driving. Regardless of the driving distance between the two vehicles, the descending condition of the road made it difficult for the bus driven by the Complainant not to hit the Toyota Wigo which made a sudden and unexpected stop to avoid hitting the van that overtook it.

At any rate, the negligence – even if true – must be gross and habitual ... These [characteristics were] wanting in the present case.

....

[W]hile the Complainant had been involved in other accidents before, these accidents were only minor ones. There was also no finding by the Respondent Company that the Complainant was negligent and/or that he was the cause of these accidents. Notably, the Respondents even allowed the Complainant to report back to work after these accidents.[15]
For their part, respondents averred that they hired Lingganay as a bus driver on December 10, 2013, but they dismissed him on May 29, 2017, for habitually transgressing the company rules and regulations on health and safety. They recounted that on December 30, 2016, the bus driven by Lingganay bumped a motorcycle at Barangay Tabason, Tagkawayan, Quezon, causing physical injuries to the motorcycle driver and his back rider. Likewise, respondents narrated that on May 1, 2017, Lingganay, while driving the company bus along the San Juanico Bridge, Samar, figured in another accident when he crashed into the rear portion of a Toyota Wigo.[16] According to respondents, the recklessness of Lingganay caused damage to the company bus amounting to PHP 6,500.00 and to the Toyota Wigo in the amount of PHP 99,000.00;[17] and to avoid any legal suit against the company, they were compelled to settle the full amount of PHP 99,000.00 with the car owner.[18] Respondents argued that as Lingganay habitually drove the company bus recklessly, his dismissal from work was justified for violating the company rules and regulations on health and safety.","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assailing the Decision[2] and the Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 155756. The CA affirmed the Decision[4] and the Resolution[5] of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) in NLRC LAC No. 11-003517-17 (NLRC NCR-06-09385-17) which agreed with the Labor Arbiter (LA) that Del Monte Land Transport Bus Company, Inc. (DLTB Co.) and Narciso Morales (collectively, respondents) validly dismissed Marcelino Dela Cruz Lingganay (Lingganay) from employment. Moreover, the CA agreed with the LA in denying his motion to further amend[6] his Amended Complaint.[7]","""It is an established rule that only questions of law may be raised in a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45. The basic principle is set forth in the rule itself.""[39] The question as to whether Lingganay violated Rule V, Sections 11 and 12 of the 2011 NLRC Rules in incorporating his motion to amend and his second amended complaint in his position paper is a question of law; thus, it is a proper subject of the instant Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.

Equally important is the rule that in a Rule 45 review in labor cases, the Court examines the CA's Decision from the prism of whether [in a petition for certiorari,] the latter had correctly determined the presence or absence of grave abuse of discretion in the NLRC's Decision, i.e., in affirming the LA's denial of Lingganay's motion to further amend his amended complaint.[40]

In San Fernando Coca-Cola Rank-and-File Union (SACORU) v. Coca­Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc. (CCBPI),[41] the Court explained the concept of grave abuse of discretion as applied in NLRC decisions brought to the CA under Rule 65:
""[G]rave abuse of discretion may arise when a lower court or tribunal violates or contravenes the Constitution, the law or existing jurisprudence."" The Court further held in Banal III v. Panganiban that:
By grave abuse of discretion is meant, such capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction. The abuse of discretion must be grave as where the power is exercised in an arbitrary or despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility and must be so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined by or to act at all in contemplation of law.
The reason for this limited review is anchored on the fact that the petition before the CA was a certiorari petition under Rule 65; thus, even the CA did not have to assess and weigh the sufficiency of evidence on which the NLRC based its decision. The CA only had to determine the existence of grave abuse of discretion. As the Court held in Soriano, Jr. v. National Labor Relations Commission:
As a general rule, in certiorari proceedings under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, the appellate court does not assess and weigh the sufficiency of evidence upon which the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC based their conclusion. The query in this proceeding is limited to the determination of whether or not the NLRC acted without or in excess of its jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion in rendering its decision.[42]
To recall, the case stemmed from the original complaint for illegal dismissal which Lingganay amended on July 13, 2017. In his first amended complaint, Lingganay alleged that respondents illegally terminated him from employment and claimed for payment of moral and exemplary damages, and attorney's fees.[43] On August 17, 2017, Lingganay filed his position paper with motion to further amend his amended complaint,[44] wherein he added as a prayer his alleged entitlement to separation pay, holiday premium, and underpaid wages.[45] For being in violation of Rule V, Section 11 of the 2011 NLRC Rules, as amended, the LA did not allow Lingganay to further amend his complaint. On appeal although the NLRC did not discuss the issue of whether Lingganay violated the 2011 NLRC Rules, as amended, in incorporating his motion to amend and his second amended complaint in his position paper, it nonetheless affirmed altogether the ruling of the LA which not only held that respondents validly dismissed Lingganay from work, but likewise denied Lingganay's motion to further amend his amended complaint.[46] In his Rule 65 and Rule 45 petitions, Lingganay justified the incorporation of his motion to amend and his second amended complaint in his position paper, citing as basis the Court's ruling in the case of Our Haus Realty Development Corporation.

The case of Our Haus Realty Development Corporation involved the complaint of Alexander Parian et al. (Parian et al.) for underpayment of wages with claims for payment of holiday pay, 13th month pay, and overtime pay, which the LA dismissed in favor of Our Haus Realty Development Corporation. Upon appeal, the NLRC partially reversed the ruling of the LA and found that Parian et al. were actually underpaid. The NLRC also ruled that the employees were entitled to their respective proportionate 13th month pay and service incentive leave (SIL) pay. Our Haus Realty Development Corporation filed a petition for certiorari under Rule 65, but the CA affirmed the ruling of the NLRC. In its Rule 45 petition, Our Haus Realty Development Corporation argued, among others, that the CA erred in agreeing with the ruling of the NLRC that Parian, et al. were entitled to SIL pay, pointing out that such claim was not included in their pro forma complaint before the LA. Citing the case of Samar-Med Distribution v. NLRC,[47] the Court allowed the grant of SIL to Parian et al. holding that ""[a] claim not raised in the pro forma complaint may still be raised in the position paper.""[48] 
 
The ruling in Our Haus Realty Development Corporation was based on the Court's pronouncement in the case of Samar-Med Distribution
 ","WHEREFORE, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED. The July 6, 2020 Decision and December 9, 2020 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 155756 are hereby AFFIRMED."
"G.R. No. 271741, August 20, 2024","DATU SAJID S. SINSUAT, EBRAHIM P. DIOCOLANO, AND FEBY A. ACOSTA, PETITIONERS, VS. HON. AHOD BALAWAG EBRAHIM, IN HIS CAPACITY AS INTERIM CHIEF MINISTER OF THE BANGSAMORO GOVERNMENT, AND BANGSAMORO TRANSITION AUTHORITY (BTA), RESPONDENTS.","On July 21, 2018, the Bangsamoro Organic Law was approved. Its purpose is to establish a political entity and provide for its basic structure of government in recognition of the justness and legitimacy of the cause of the Bangsamoro people and the aspirations of Muslim Filipinos and all indigenous cultural communities in the BARMM to secure their identity and posterity, allowing for meaningful self-governance within the framework of the Constitution and the national sovereignty as well as territorial integrity of the Republic of the Philippines.[3]

Subsequently, on May 27, 2021, Republic Act No. 11550, or the Charter of the Provinces of Maguindanao del Norte and Maguindanao del Sur, was enacted into law. The Municipality of Datu Odin Sinsuat was designated as the capital town and seat of government of Maguindanao del Norte.[4]

On September 28, 2023, after its approval in the plenary on the third and final reading, Chief Minister Ebrahim and Bangsamoro Parliament Speaker Atty. Pangalian Balindong signed into law BAA 49, or the Bangsamoro Local Governance Code of 2023 (Bangsamoro LGC). It provided for the manner of division and merger of existing local government units and mandated the conduct of a plebiscite for divided and merged local government units, among others.

On December 20, 2023, the BTA, assembled in Parliament, and passed the bills creating three new towns in Maguindanao del Norte. Chief Minister Ebrahim signed BAAs 53, 54, and 55 on December 26, 2023.

First. BAA 53 created the Municipality of Nuling. Section 2 of BAA 53 identified the barangays to be separated from the Municipality of Sultan Kudarat, Maguindanao del Norte, thus:
Sec. 2. Creation of the Municipality. – The Barangays of Matengen, Ladia, Pigcalagan, Alamada, Raguisi, Pinaring, Damaniog, Ibotegen, Banatin, Nara, Kakar, Katidtuan, Maidapa, Kapimpilan, Bulibod, Kabuntalan, Nalinan, Panatan, and Katamlangan are hereby separated from the Municipality of Sultan Kudarat, Maguindanao del Norte and constituted into a distinct and independent municipality to be known as Municipality of Nuling, which is hereby created in the province of Maguindanao del Norte.
Second. BAA 54 created the Municipality of Datu Sinsuat Balabaran. Section 2 of BAA 54 identified the barangays to be separated from the Municipality of Datu Odin Sinsuat, the capital town of Maguindanao del Norte, thus:
Sec. 2. Creation of the Municipality. – The Barangays of Tapian, Linek, Dinaig Proper, Tamontaka, Tanuel, Kusiong, Mompong, Semba, Capiton, Tambak, Badak, Awang and Dulangan are hereby separated from the Municipality of Datu Odin Sinsuat, Maguindanao del Norte and constituted into a distinct and independent municipality to be known as Municipality of Datu Sinsuat Balabaran, which is hereby created in the Province of Maguindanao del Norte.
Third. BAA 55 created the Municipality of Sheik Abas Hamza. Section 2 of BAA 55 identified the barangays to be separated also from the Municipality of Datu Odin Sinsuat, thus:
Sec. 2. Creation of the Municipality. – The Barangays of Labungan, Taviran, Baka, Sapalan, Sifaran, Bugawas, Bitu, Kurintem, Margues, and Makir are hereby separated from the Municipality of Datu Odin Sinsuat, Maguindanao Del Norte and constituted into a distinct and independent municipality to be known as Municipality of Sheik Abas Hamza, which is hereby created in the Province of Maguindanao del Norte.
The petition in G.R. No. 271741 assailing BAAs 54 and 55 was filed on February 15, 2024, while the petition in G.R. No. 271972 challenging BAA 53 was filed on February 29, 2024.

The Court received the COMELEC's Comment[5] dated March 15, 2024 in G.R. No. 271741 on May 6, 2024. For G.R. No. 271972, the Court received the COMELEC's Comment[6] dated March 20, 2024 on March 25, 2024, and the BTA and Chief Minister Ebrahim's Comment[7] dated March 25, 2024 on April 3, 2024 and Supplemental Comment[8] dated June 3, 2024 on June 13, 2024. In the meantime, this Court ordered the consolidation of G.R. Nos. 271741 and 271972 in a Resolution[9] dated April 3, 2024.","The recognition of the cause of the Bangsamoro people and the aspirations of Muslim Filipinos and all indigenous cultural communities in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) sits at the core of the Bangsamoro Organic Law. It fulfills the promise of meaningful self-governance within the framework of the Constitution and national sovereignty. Since its enactment and implementation, the Court has protected the enshrined purpose of Republic Act No. 11054 or the Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (Bangsamoro Organic Law).

This case underscores the significance of ensuring that the Bangsamoro Government's actions are in consonance with our country's revered legal precepts. As new municipalities are created in the region, the Bangsamoro Government should ensure that the constituents who will be affected thereby are recognized and heard through an appropriate plebiscite. Failing to do so betrays the very spirit of the cause they have long fought for.","The Court declares that the plebiscite provisions of the BAAs 53, 54, and 55 violate the 1987 Constitution and the Bangsamoro Organic Law. As a consequence thereof, the COMELEC is enjoined from implementing COMELEC Resolutions Nos. 11011 and 11012 pursuant to BAAs 53, 54, and 55 effective immediately.

A final injunction is proper only after the court has a definite pronouncement respecting an applicant's right and of the act violative of such right.[59] In Consular Area Residents Association, Inc. v. Casanova,[60] We explained that a writ of injunction would issue only upon the satisfaction of three requisites, namely: (1) a right in esse or a clear and unmistakable right to be protected; (2) a violation of that right; and (3) that there is an urgent and permanent act and urgent necessity for the writ to prevent serious damage.

In this case, it is clear that the foregoing requisites are present.

First, the right to participate in the scheduled plebiscites of all qualified voters in the Municipalities of Sultan Kudarat and Datu Odin Sinsuat which are not part of the new municipalities of Nuling, Datu Sinsuat Balabaran, and Sheik Abas Hamza is enshrined in no less than Article X, Section 10 of the 1987 Constitution, Article VI, Section 10 of the Bangsamoro Organic Law, and settled jurisprudence.

Second, the uniform text in Section 5 of BAAs 53, 54, and 55 denied the affected voters their right to participate in the scheduled plebiscites. This unequivocal denial was issued in direct contravention of the Constitution and the Bangsamoro Organic Law.

Third, there is an urgent need to promptly enjoin the implementation of BAAs 53, 54, and 55 as the COMELEC has already promulgated the necessary resolutions implementing the plebiscites of the assailed BAAs.

There is no question that petitioners have established the existence of a clear and actual right that ought to be protected that warrants the protection of injunctive relief from this Court. Thus, We permanently enjoin the COMELEC from implementing COMELEC Resolution Nos. 11011 and 11012 pursuant to BAAs 53, 54, and 55.

X.  
Final Word

 
""With great power comes great responsibility.""[61] As a final note, in line with the principle of self-governance, the Bangsamoro Government is granted specific powers, which include the authority to create municipalities. The exercise of this power entails observance of the requirements under the 1987 Constitution, the Bangsamoro Organic Law, and other relevant laws. The conduct of a plebiscite in the political units directly affected by the proposed action is imperative. This democratic prerequisite recognizes that the entire constituency affected should always have the final say on the matter. To disenfranchise qualified voters makes a mockery of the entire exercise.","FOR THESE REASONS, the petitions in G.R. Nos. 271741 and 271972 are PARTIALLY GRANTED. The phrase ""qualified voters in a plebiscite to be conducted in the barangays comprising the municipality pursuant to Section 2 hereof"" in the uniform text of Section 5 in Bangsamoro Autonomy Act Nos. 53, 54, and 55 is declared UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

The prayer for injunctive relief is likewise GRANTED. Accordingly, a FINAL PROHIBITORY INJUNCTION is hereby ISSUED, EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY. Respondent Commission on Elections is ENJOINED to DESIST from holding plebiscites on September 7 and 21, 2024 pursuant to Resolution Nos. 11011 and 11012, as well as from performing any and all acts related to the ratification of Bangsamoro Autonomy Act Nos. 53, 54, and 55."

The case, docketed as Civil Case No. 15-10803, was raffled to the RTC presided by Judge Asuncion.[2]

On April 1, 2016, Judge Asuncion conducted a hearing on the plaintiffs' prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction. He ordered the parties to file their respective memoranda within 15 days from receipt of the ruling of the court on the formal offer of evidence, after which, the matter shall be deemed submitted for resolution.[3] Judge Asuncion issued separate Orders,[4] dated February 12, 2016, and April 27, 2016, respectively admitting the exhibits formally offered by the plaintiffs and the defendants in relation to the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction. The plaintiffs submitted their Memorandum[5] on July 14, 2016, while the defendants did not.[6]

On July 20, 2017, the plaintiffs filed a Motion to Re-Open Hearing on Plaintiffs' Prayer for Issuance of a Writ of Preliminary Mandatory Injunction[7] (motion to re-open) praying for the reopening of the hearing on the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction in view of the plaintiffs' newly discovered evidence. Judge Asuncion then required the parties to submit their pleadings. Despite compliance with this Order, the plaintiffs' motion was not resolved[8] so they filed an Ex-Parte Motion to Resolve Prayer for Writ of Preliminary Injunction[9] dated June 5, 2017, a Second Ex-Parte Motion to Resolve[10] dated November 2, 2017, an Ex Parte Motion to Resolve[11] dated April 23, 2018, and an Ex Parte Motion for Resolution of Prayer for Writ of Injunction[12] dated December 7, 2018.

Thereafter, the plaintiffs filed a Motion to Transfer Case to Another Sala[13] (motion to transfer) dated February 19, 2020, and a Motion for Inhibition[14] dated August 20, 2020.

Due to Judge Asuncion's continued failure to resolve their prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction, Castillo filed the present Complaint against him. He argued that Judge Asuncion is guilty of Gross Inefficiency for his failure to resolve their prayer for issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction, and Dishonesty for certifying, in relation to receiving his salary, that he has no pending matters to resolve.[15]

In its 1st Indorsement[16] dated November 16, 2021, the Judicial Integrity Board (JIB), through the Office of its Acting Executive Director (OED), required Judge Asuncion to file a verified comment to the verified Complaint within 10 days from his receipt of the Indorsement. The JIB issued another Indorsement[17] dated February 2, 2023, reiterating that Judge Asuncion should file his verified comment, as well as to show cause why he should not be disciplined as a member of the Bar for violation of Canon 12, Rule 12.04[18] of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR).

Judge Asuncion finally filed his Motion to Admit[19] with Comment[20] on April 17, 2023. He averred that he had to attend to an influx of equally important and pressing matters that demanded his immediate attention: (1) his designation as Executive Judge for the RTC Antipolo City from October 16, 2020, to November 3, 2022, or during the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) the conduct of hearings for applications of search warrants during said period; (3) pending applications for bail; (4) various meetings with local government offices; (5) his assignment as Assisting Judge[21] in January 2021; (6) his additional designation as Special Commercial Court and Cybercrime Court; and (7) the issuance of various circulars directing judges to give preference to criminal cases. Judge Asuncion explained that the foregoing contributed to the lapse of time that it took to resolve Civil Case No. 15-10803.[22]

In addition, Judge Asuncion averred that Castillo filed several motions that prayed for different reliefs. In any event, Judge Asuncion issued an Order[23] dated April 11, 2023, denying the plaintiffs' prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction. Judge Asuncion pointed out that the present Complaint is not the proper remedy to assail his ruling in the civil case. Finally, he stated that he was adopting his Comment as to why he should not be penalized as a member of the Bar.[24]","Before the Court is a Complaint[1] filed by Rolly C. Castillo (Castillo) against Hon. Miguel S. Asuncion (Judge Asuncion), Presiding Judge of Branch 99, Regional Trial Court of Antipolo City, Rizal (RTC) for Dishonesty and Gross Inefficiency.","The Court agrees with the findings of the JIB but modifies the penalty imposed.

Preliminarily, the Court clarifies that the subject of the Complaint is the alleged delay of Judge Asuncion in resolving the plaintiffs' prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction. Castillo does not assail the denial of their prayer in his Complaint before the Court. Accordingly, the principle that judicial remedies must first be exhausted before resorting to an administrative complaint,[38] does not apply here.

The timely resolution of pending matters before the court is required by no less than Article VIII, Section 15 of the Constitution:
SECTION 15. (1) All cases or matters filed after the effectivity of this Constitution must be decided or resolved within twenty-four months from date of submission for the Supreme Court, and, unless reduced by the Supreme Court, twelve months for all lower collegiate courts, and three months for all other lower courts.

(2) A case or matter shall be deemed submitted for decision or resolution upon the filing of the last pending, brief, or memorandum required by the Rules of Court or by the court itself.

(3) Upon the expiration of the corresponding period, a certification to this effect signed by the Chief Justice or the presiding judge shall forthwith be issued and a copy thereof attached to the record of the case or matter, and served upon the parties. The certification shall state why a decision or resolution has not been rendered or issued within said period.

(4) Despite the expiration of the applicable mandatory period, the court, without prejudice to such responsibility as may have been incurred in consequence thereof, shall decide or resolve the case or matter submitted thereto for determination, without further delay.
Thus, Canon 6, Section 5 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct enjoins judges to promptly rule on cases pending before the court:
SECTION 5. Judges shall perform all judicial duties, including the delivery of reserved decisions, efficiently, fairly, and with reasonable promptness.
In relation thereto, OCA Circular No. 243-2022 reminded judges to observe the following guidelines:
1. To strictly observe the reglementary or prescribed periods to decide pending cases and/or resolve incidents, and if in the mind of the Judge he or she could not comply with the aforementioned prescribed period/s, he or she may ask the Court, through the Office of the Court Administrator, for an extension of time to do so. Appended herein for your guidance is a list of reglementary periods to decide cases and/or resolve incidents (see Annex ""A"");

2. Except in certain situations under the Rules of Expedited Procedure in the First Level Courts in which memoranda are prohibited, cases are deemed submitted for decision upon admission of the evidence, unless the court directs the parties to argue or to submit their respective memoranda or any further pleadings; and

3. The ""[f]ailure to decide cases within the reglementary period constitutes a ground for administrative liability except when there are valid reasons for the delay.""
The plaintiffs in Civil Case No. 15-10803 filed their Complaint for Damages with Prayer for the Issuance of a Writ of Preliminary Injunction on November 11, 2015. Judge Asuncion issued an Order dated April 1, 2016, which required the parties to file their memoranda within 15 days from receipt of the ruling of the court on the formal offer of evidence, and declared the matter deemed submitted for resolution upon the lapse of such period. Judge Asuncion issued an Order dated February 12, 2016, and April 27, 2016, respectively, admitting the pieces of evidence of the plaintiffs and the defendants. Only the plaintiffs filed their memorandum on July 14, 2016. Nonetheless, Judge Asuncion only ruled on the plaintiffs' prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction on April 11, 2023, or almost seven years after it was submitted for resolution.

Judge Asuncion avers that the plaintiffs filed several motions which contributed to the delay in the resolution of their prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction. However, the plaintiffs cannot be blamed for such delay as it was already existent even before they filed their various motions a year after they submitted their memorandum, or on July 20, 2017. Further, the motions filed by the plaintiffs were consistent with their previous prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction. The various ex parte motions merely urged Judge Asuncion to finally rule on the matter, while the motion to reopen allegedly presented new evidence in support of their prayer. The motion to transfer and motion for inhibition were likewise filed for the purpose of securing the preliminary injunction, albeit through another court. Furthermore, Judge Asuncion still incurred delay even if the period is counted from the plaintiffs' motion to reopen, as it was filed in 2017, but he issued an order only in 2023.

Judge Asuncion also tries to excuse the delay on the ground that he had other pressing matters to deal with during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. But as duly observed by the JIB, the plaintiffs' prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction was submitted for resolution long before the COVID-19 pandemic began. While the COVID-19 pandemic was surely a challenging time for all members of the Judiciary, it cannot be used as a justification for wrongful acts or omissions that took place prior to or during this period.

Undue delay in rendering an order is now subsumed under neglect of duty in Rule 140 of the Rules of Court, as further amended. On the one hand, it is considered Gross Neglect of Duty when it is ""characterized by the want of even slight care, or by acting or omitting to act in a situation where there is a duty to act, not inadvertently but [willfully] and intentionally, with a conscious indifference to the consequences, insofar as other persons may be affected.""[39] On the other hand, it is Simple Neglect of Duty when there is failure to give proper attention to a required task or a disregard of duty due to carelessness or indifference.[40]

Judge Asuncion's seven-year delay is inexcusable considering that the prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction, by its nature, implies that it must be addressed urgently. Castillo explained in the pleadings that their very livelihood was at stake.[41] Judge Asuncion did not offer any sufficient justification for his delay, such as the complexity of the case or the filing of dilatory motions by the parties. Taking these circumstances into consideration, Judge Asuncion is guilty of gross neglect of duty.

Gross Neglect of Duty in the Performance or Non-performance of Official Functions is a serious charge under Rule 140, Section 14(d) of the Rules of Court, as further amended, that is punishable by first, dismissal from the service together with its accessory penalties; second, suspension from office without salary and other benefits for more than six months but not exceeding one year; or third, a fine of more than PHP 100,000.00 but not exceeding PHP 200,000.00.","ACCORDINGLY, the Court FINDS respondent Hon. Miguel S. Asuncion, Presiding Judge, Branch 99, Regional Trial Court, Antipolo, Rizal, GUILTY of Gross Neglect of Duty in the Performance or Non-Performance of Official Functions under Rule 140, Section 14(d) of the Rules of Court, as further amended by A.M. No. 21-08-09-SC, and hereby ORDERS him to pay a FINE of PHP 201,000.00. Respondent Hon. Miguel S. Asuncion is STERNLY WARNED that a repetition of the same or similar acts shall be dealt with more severely."
"A.M. No. 24-04-09-SC, August 20, 2024",RE: DRAFT IMPLEMENTING RULES AND REGULATIONS OF REPUBLIC ACT NO. 11691 OR THE JUDICIARY MARSHALS ACT,"In 2019, Judge Reymar Lacaya (Judge Lacaya) of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) in Zamboanga Del Norte, was shot and killed outside a courthouse.[1] He was at the parking area when a lone gunman approached and shot him in broad daylight.[2]

In the same year, Judge Mario Anacleto Bañez (Judge Bañez) of the RTC in Ilocos Sur, was gunned down by men on a motorcycle as he was driving home to San Fernando City, La Union.[3] He was found with a bullet wound in the head and died while being taken to the hospital.[4] His killing came only four days after a former Judge, Exequil Dagala (Judge Dagala), was shot dead inside his house in Surigao del Norte.[5]

The year after, in 2020, Judge Ma. Theresa Abadilla (Judge Abadilla) of the RTC Manila was shot in the head inside her chamber at Manila City Hall.[6] The killing was reported to have been done by Judge Abadilla's Clerk of Court, who purportedly shot her after their conversation about his work performance.[7] Unfortunately, Judge Abadilla was declared dead on arrival at the hospital.[8]

Reports reveal that the deaths of Judges Lacaya, Bañez, Dagala, and Abadilla represent just a fraction of the increasing incidents involving violent crimes committed against members of the Judiciary. There have been over 33­34 judges killed while in service.[9] Less than 10% of these cases have been resolved, and there are several wherein the instigator remains to be unidentified.[10]

In every case involving the killing of members of the Judiciary, the Court, together with the legal community, has strongly condemned such violent acts. The Court has expressed admiration for judges and their display of courage in the administration of justice. At the same time, it has exerted efforts to look into potential institutional changes, in order to enhance protection for members of the Judiciary.

Institutionalizing protection of the members of the Judiciary: Creation of the Office of the Judiciary Marshals


The Supreme Court called for a legislative act that will create a battalion-size independent armed unit patterned after the United States (U.S.) Marshal Service to secure the judiciary and assist in the administration of justice.[11] In response, Senator Richard Gordon (Senator Gordon) introduced Senate Bill No. 1947 entitled, ""An Act Creating the Office of the Judiciary Marshals, Defining its Functions and Powers, Appropriating Funds Therefor, and for Other Purposes."" In his sponsorship speech, he discussed the alarming problem of killing of judges, with deaths already reaching 34 since 1999, including the following notable cases:
In 2004, Judge Voltaire Rosales was ambushed in Batangas Road. The killer, an inmate and a drug lord in Muntinlupa, was traced through the help of Gen. Edgardo Aglipay.

In 2007, Judge Nathaniel Pattugalan was shot dead while on board a passenger jeepney in Quezon City. The first attempt to kill him was while he was driving to work in Cagayan where a gunshot wound in the head paralyzed him.

In 2015, Judge Erwin Alaba was mercilessly shot dead in the chest while he was driving in Baler, Aurora. His spouse was wounded in the incident.

In the same year, Judge Wilfredo T. Nieves died after incurring multiple gunshot wounds in the head and right upper extremities. Raymond Dominguez, one of the notorious Dominguez Brothers who have been involved in carnapping since 2010, was identified as the mastermind in the killing.

Judge Edmundo Pinlac was shot dead by motorcycle-riding gunmen while on his way to Ozamis City.
Meanwhile, in the co-sponsorship speech of Senator Ronald Dela Rosa, he highlighted the recent case of Atty. Baby Maria Concepcion Landero-Ole, who was gunned down by unidentified men while driving her pick-up truck along the Danao City Highway in Cebu.[12]

The Senators pointed out that since 2016, at least 54 judges, prosecutors, and lawyers have already been killed. Further, as of January 2021, only 23 cases had been filed in court, 15 of which were on trial, with only two convictions and six acquittals. The Philippine National Police further reported that 47 suspects were still at large, six suspects were already released, 26 suspects were detained, while seven were killed.[13]

With these reports, Senator Gordon remarked that there seemed to be a pandemic that has been causing the gruesome deaths of judges in the country. Nothing was being done except to leave the responsibility for protecting judges and resolving their cases with the police and other authorities. The government was simply letting the judges walk around as if they were expected to always remain strong and undeterred in handling cases assigned to them amid threats to their lives because of their profession.[14]","The Judiciary bears the crucial task of upholding the rule of law and preserving the rights and guarantees granted by the Constitution. To ensure the fulfillment of such duty, the members of the Judiciary must be free from any threat that may prevent them from exercising their functions. It is to this end that the Supreme Court sought, and the Congress provided, for the creation of a body primarily tasked to protect, defend, safeguard, watch over, provide security, and ensure the safety of the members of the Judiciary and court personnel as well as the halls where they sit.","The Supreme Court called for a legislative act that will create a battalion-size independent armed unit patterned after the United States (U.S.) Marshal Service to secure the judiciary and assist in the administration of justice.[11] In response, Senator Richard Gordon (Senator Gordon) introduced Senate Bill No. 1947 entitled, ""An Act Creating the Office of the Judiciary Marshals, Defining its Functions and Powers, Appropriating Funds Therefor, and for Other Purposes.""

The Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act No. 11691 or the Judiciary Marshals Act shall take effect after fifteen (15) days from its publication in the Official Gazette or two (2) newspapers of general circulation."
"G.R. No. 273136, August 20, 2024","ELISEO MIJARES RIO, JR., AUGUSTO CADELIÑA LAGMAN, AND FRANKLIN FAYLOGA YSAAC, PETITIONERS, VS. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS EN BANC, RESPONDENT.","Before the Court is a Petition for Mandamus[1] under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court filed by petitioners Eliseo Mijares Rio, Jr., Augusto Cadeliña Lagman, and Franklin Fayloga Ysaac (Rio, Jr. et al.) praying that the Court issue a writ of mandamus to compel respondent COMELEC to implement its November 29, 2023 Resolution[2] which stated that it will ""recount the ballots to settle once and for all the substantive issues raised by petitioners, as prayed for in petitioners' Motion dated January 19, 2024 and Reiterative Motion dated February 12, 2024 in EM Case No. [2]3-003.""[3]

The present controversy stemmed from the same factual background as Smartmatic TIM Corporation and Smartmatic Philippines, Inc. v. Commission on Elections En Banc.[4] In 2023, Rio, Jr. et al. and Leonardo Olivera Odoño filed a Petition,[5] Supplemental Petition,[6] and Second Supplemental Petition[7] before the COMELEC En Banc. Among other reliefs, Rio, Jr. et al. prayed that ""[t]he qualifications of [Smartmatic Philippines, Inc. (Smartmatic)] be reviewed by the [Bids and Awards Committee (BAC)] in view of the serious and material irregularities in the transmission and reception of election results in the system which Smartmatic developed and provided for the [May 9, 2022] Elections,""[8] and that the COMELEC En Banc order the BAC to ""disqualify or declare ineligible Smartmatic from participating in the procurement for the 2025 Automated Election System"" if the ""serious and grave irregularities"" are not satisfactorily explained.[9]

On August 10, 2023, the COMELEC En Banc directed its law department to review and submit a recommendation on the petitions filed by Rio, Jr. et al.[10] On August 31, 2023, the COMELEC Law Department submitted its Compliance, opining that there is no legal basis to prohibit Smartmatic from participating in the bidding process.[11]

On October 5, 2023, the COMELEC En Banc set the case for hearing on October 17, 2023.[12] It also required Smartmatic to comment on the Petitions.[13]

On November 29, 2023, the COMELEC En Banc ruled in favor of Rio, Jr. et al. The dispositive portion of its Resolution reads:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Commission (En Banc) hereby RESOLVED to GRANT the Petition. SMARTMATIC PHILIPPINES, INC. is DISQUALIFIED AND DISALLOWED from participating in any public bidding process for elections, in the exercise of its administrative power to decide all matters affecting election [sic] and in pursuit of its constitutional mandate.

FURTHER, the Commission (En Banc) hereby RESOLVES that in the exercise of its administrative power, it may, upon Petitioner's instance, order the conduct of the recount of ballots in areas in every region in the country, the procedure and extent of which to be determined, and at no cost to Petitioner.","The Commission on Elections (COMELEC) may not be compelled by mandamus to exercise its discretion in a certain way, i.e., to grant or deny the opening and recounting of ballot boxes. However, it has a clear legal duty to expeditiously resolve motions pending before it, following its own rules of procedure.","We first resolve the Petition for Mandamus.

A writ of mandamus has the following requisites: (1) the plaintiff has a clear legal right to the act demanded; (2) it must be the duty of the defendant to perform the act because it is mandated by law; (3) the defendant unlawfully neglects the performance of the duty enjoined by law; (4) the act to be performed is ministerial, not discretionary; and (5) there is no appeal or any other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.[31]

In National Press Club of the Philippines v. Commission on Elections,[32] the Court described mandamus and defined ""ministerial duty"" as follows:
Mandamus is an extraordinary writ commanding a person, tribunal, corporation, board, or officer to do an act required to be done, as when they/it unlawfully neglects the performance of an act which the law specifically enjoins as a duty, and there is no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. The duty is ministerial only when its discharge requires neither the exercise of official discretion nor judgment. Mandamus can be awarded only when the petitioner's legal right to the performance of the particular act, which is sought to be compelled, is clear and complete.[33] (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)
In Subrabas v. Abas,[34] the Court explained the distinction between ministerial and discretionary acts, thus:
An act is considered ministerial if ""an officer or tribunal performs in the context of a given set of facts, in a prescribed manner and without regard for the exercise of his or its own judgment, upon the propriety or impropriety of the act done."" In contrast, an act is considered discretionary ""[i]f the law imposes a duty upon a public officer, and gives him [or her] the right to decide how or when the duty shall be performed."" The writ will lie if the tribunal, corporation, board, officer[,] or person unlawfully neglects the performance of an act which the law enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust[,] or station. The writ of mandamus, however, will not issue to compel an official to do anything which is not his [or her] duty to do, or to give to the applicant anything to which he [or she] is not entitled by law.[35] (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)
The Court has also held that only specific legal rights are enforceable by mandamus, which requires that the right sought to be enforced must be certain and clear, and the writ will not issue in cases where the right is doubtful.[36]

In the case at bar, Rio, Jr. et al. simply generalize that ""[a]ll the requisites for the issuance of a writ of mandamus are present in the instant case""[37] yet they fail to identify, much less substantiate, these requisites. Rio, Jr. et al. do not point to any law specifically requiring the conduct of a recount of the physical ballots in the 2022 National and Local Elections, much less prescribing the manner of the recount such that no discretion is left to the COMELEC. Moreover, the dispositive portion of the COMELEC's November 29, 2023 Resolution expressly states that the COMELEC ""may, upon Petitioner's instance, order the conduct of the recount of ballots in areas in every region in the country,""[38] the ""procedure and extent of which [are] to be determined[.]""[39] Thus, contrary to Rio, Jr. et al.'s protestations, the present controversy does not involve a ministerial act on the part of the COMELEC as the recount of physical ballots prayed for by Rio, Jr. et al. requires the exercise of the COMELEC's discretion and judgment.

Rio, Jr. et al. having failed to establish any ministerial duty on the part of the COMELEC and any clear, complete, and specific legal right to a recount as prayed for in their Motion and Reiterative Motion before the COMELEC, their prayer for a writ of mandamus lacks merit.

It bears stressing that the COMELEC En Banc already acted on the Motion and Reiterative Motion on July 3, 2024. Nonetheless, the Court shares the view of Associate Justice Amy C. Lazaro-Javier that the COMELEC was guilty of official inaction when it decided the said Motions way beyond the period prescribed by its own rule that ""any case or matter submitted to or heard by the Commission en banc shall be decided within [30] days from the date it is deemed submitted for decision or resolution.""[40] From the filing of the Motion and Reiterative Motion on January 19, 2024, and February 12, 2024, it took the COMELEC 166 and 142 days, respectively, to resolve the Motions.

Even the COMELEC itself recognized in its Order[41] dated July 3, 2024 that its own rules prescribe a period within which to resolve pending motions before it:
As defined in Section 1, Rule [11] of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure, a motion is an application for an order not included in a decision of the Commission or a Division. Thus, as applications, motions are addressed to sound discretion of the Commission, which discretion will not be interfered with unless it has been abused.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Mandamus is DISMISSED. The Motion for Leave to File and Admit Attached Supplemental Petition dated July 12, 2024 is DENIED, and the attached Supplemental Petition also dated July 12, 2024 is NOTED WITHOUT ACTION."
"G.R. No. 246379, August 19, 2024","COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, PETITIONER, VS. DOHLE SHIPMANAGEMENT PHILIPPINES CORPORATION, RESPONDENT.","On March 31, 2014, Dohle filed an application for refund or issuance of tax credit certificate (TCC) of its unutilized input VAT covering the four quarters of calendar year 2012.[6]

On July 28, 2014, Dohle submitted additional documents in support of its application for refund or issuance of TCC.[7]

There being no action taken by the CIR on Dohle's administrative claim for refund or issuance of TCC, Dohle filed a Petition for Review before the CTA Second Division on December 23, 2014. The case was docketed as CTA Case No. 8960.[8]

In a Decision dated December 16, 2016, the CTA Second Division, partially granted Dohle's petition and ordered the CIR to refund or issue a TCC in favor of Dohle in the amount of PHP 7,196,472.58, representing unutilized excess input VAT attributable to Dohle's zero-rated sales/receipts for the four quarters of calendar year 2012.[9]

The CTA Second Division found that Dohle's judicial claim for refund was timely filed within the 120+30-day periods under Section 112(C) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended (1997 Tax Code). According to the CTA Second Division, the 120-day period begins to run from the date of submission of complete documents supporting the administrative claim.[10]

However, the CTA Second Division found that Dohle fell short of proving its entitlement to the entire amount of its refund claim.[11]

Aggrieved, the CIR moved for reconsideration assailing mainly the probative value of some of the documentary exhibits submitted by Dohle. The CIR insisted that Dohle failed to substantially prove its entitlement to the refund claim.[12]

In its Resolution[13] dated May 22, 2017, the CTA Special Second Division denied the CIR's motion.

The CIR elevated the case to the CTA EB and mainly argued that (1) Dohle's invoices and official receipts failed to comply with the mandatory requirements under the law, and (2) the documentary exhibits presented by Dohle were all hearsay and have no probative value.[14]","Before the Court is the Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] (Petition) filed by petitioner Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR), assailing the Decision[2] dated July 26, 2018 and Resolution[3] dated April 1, 2019 of the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc (CTA EB) in CTA EB No. 1665. The CTA EB affirmed the Decision[4] dated December 16, 2016 of the CTA Second Division in CTA Case No. 8960, which partially granted respondent Dohle Shipmanagement Philippines Corporation's (Dohle) claim for refund in the amount of PHP 7,196,472.58, representing unutilized excess input Value-Added Tax (VAT) attributable to its zero-rated sales for the four quarters of calendar year 2012.[5]","The crux of the controversy in this case is the interpretation of Section 112 of the 1997 Tax Code in the case of Pilipinas Total Gas. For the CIR, Pilipinas Total Gas implies that the 120-day period for the CIR to act on the claim should be counted from the submission of the supporting documents or the lapse of the 30-day period under RMC 49-2003, whichever comes first. On the other hand, for Dohle, from the plain language of Section 112(C) of the 1997 Tax Code the 120-day period for the CIR to act on the administrative claim commences to run only upon submission by the taxpayer of the supporting documents. Thus, a review of the facts and ruling of the Court in Pilipinas Total Gas is imperative in the resolution of the present case.

Interpretation of Section 112 of the 1997 Tax Code in the case of Pilipinas Total Gas
Section 112 of the 1997 Tax Code, as amended, provides:

(A) Zero-Rated or Effectively Zero-Rated Sales. — Any VAT-registered person, whose sales are zero-rated or effectively zero-rated may, within two (2) years after the close of the taxable quarter when the sales were made, apply for the issuance of a tax credit certificate or refund of creditable input tax due or paid attributable to such sales, except transitional input tax, to the extent that such input tax has not been applied against output tax: Provided, however, That in the case of zero-rated sales under Section 106(A)(2)(a)(1), (2) and (b) and Section 108(B)(1) and (2), the acceptable foreign currency exchange proceeds thereof had been duly accounted for in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP): Provided, further, That where the taxpayer is engaged in zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sale and also in taxable or exempt sale of goods or properties or services, and the amount of creditable input tax due or paid cannot be directly and entirely attributed to any one of the transactions, it shall be allocated proportionately on the basis of the volume of sales: Provided, finally, That for a person making sales that are zero-rated under Section 108(B)(6), the input taxes shall be allocated ratably between his zero-rated and non-zero-rated sales.

. . . .

(C) Period within which Refund or Tax Credit of Input Taxes shall be Made. — In proper cases, the Commissioner shall grant a refund or issue the tax credit certificate for creditable input taxes within one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of submission of complete documents in support of the application filed in accordance with Subsection (A) hereof.

In case of full or partial denial of the claim for tax refund or tax credit, or the failure on the part of the Commissioner to act on the application within the period prescribed above, the taxpayer affected may, within thirty (30) days from the receipt of the decision denying the claim or after the expiration of the one hundred twenty day-period, appeal the decision or the unacted claim with the Court of Tax Appeals. (Emphasis supplied)

The law categorically provides that the 120-day period for the CIR to decide the administrative claim for VAT refund runs from the date the taxpayer submits ""complete documents"" in support of its application for refund.

In relation to the foregoing, in Pilipinas Total Gas, the Court was confronted with the issue of ""when should the submission of documents be deemed 'completed' for purposes of determining the running of the 120-day period.""[34]

Pertinent portions of the Court En Banc's ruling in Pilipinas Total Gas are quoted below:","The Judiciary bears the crucial task of upholding the rule of law and preserving the rights and guarantees granted by the Constitution. To ensure the fulfillment of such duty, the members of the Judiciary must be free from any threat that may prevent them from exercising their functions. It is to this end that the Supreme Court sought, and the Congress provided, for the creation of a body primarily tasked to protect, defend, safeguard, watch over, provide security, and ensure the safety of the members of the Judiciary and court personnel as well as the halls where they sit."
"G.R. No. 263887, August 19, 2024","PHILIPPINE PRIMARK PROPERTIES, INC., PETITIONER, VS. CHINA BANKING CORPORATION TRUST AND ASSETS MANAGEMENT GROUP, RESPONDENT.","On May 11, 2018, Primark entered into an Omnibus Notes Facility and Security Agreement (ONFSA) with China Banking Corporation (CBC) and China Bank Savings, Inc. (CBSI) (collectively, the Banks), where the Banks granted Primark a Notes Facility in the maximum aggregate amount of PHP 7 billion. Under the ONFSA, to secure Primark's obligations, the latter assigned all its present and future rights and interests over its receivables arising from its contracts of lease and/or similar contracts with its tenants in favor of CBC-TAMG as its assignee/security trustee. Both Primark and CBC-TAMG informed the tenants about the arrangement.[6]

Aside from the assignment of receivables, the ONFSA also required Primark to provide a Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA). The DSRA must meet a certain maintaining balance (DSRA Maintaining Balance). In the event that Primark is unable to timely pay its loan obligations, CBC-TAMG was authorized to debit from the DSRA such amounts as may be necessary to pay the debt due to the Banks. In turn, within a certain period, Primark must replenish the debited funds to meet the DSRA Maintaining Balance.[7]

Primark was able to make 10 drawdowns under the ONFSA in the total amount of PHP 3,947,000,000.00. Thereafter, it requested CBC and CBSI to waive certain conditions precedent so that Primark may obtain additional borrowings under the ONFSA. It also proposed several amendments to the terms and conditions of the ONFSA. However, the Banks first required Primark to comply with the conditions precedent before the release of additional funds and before any discussion on the ONFSA amendments.[8]

In a Letter[9] dated August 13, 2019, Primark gave notice to CBC that it is abrogating the ONFSA on the ground that it is void ab initio for being a mere credit accommodation by CBC and CBSI to their directors, officers, stockholders, and related interests (DOSRI), in violation of Section 36[10] of the Republic Act No. 8791 or the General Banking Law. Primark also informed CBC-TAMG of the abrogation in a Letter[11] dated September 2, 2019.

Thereafter, on September 4, 2019, Primark failed to pay the interest due on its borrowings amounting to PHP 76,868,808.74. Pursuant to the ONFSA, CBC-TAMG debited the said amount from the DSRA, which then fell below the debt service reserve requirement. Primark likewise failed to cover the shortfall in the DSRA and was unable to meet the DSRA Maintaining Balance required under the ONFSA. Thus, it was declared in default on December 5, 2019.[12]

Meanwhile, on various dates from March 14, 2017, until August 3, 2018, Primark entered into Contracts of Lease[13] with BDO over its properties situated in several locations for the establishment of BDO's branches. On May 22, 2018,[14] August 3, 2018,[15] February 11, 2019,[16] and April 23, 2019,[17] Primark sent notices of Assignment of Receivables to BDO, informing the latter that it entered into a Security Assignment with CBC-TAMG, wherein Primark assigned to CBC-TAMG, as security, all of its receivables arising from the contracts of lease with BDO. Further, Primark stated in the notices that it was authorizing BDO, upon the instruction of CBC-TAMG, to pay and deliver the receivables to the bank account that may be designated by the latter.

BDO religiously paid and delivered the rental payments to Primark on their due dates. However, on February 4, 2020, BDO received a notice from CBC-TAMG denominated as Security Assignment[18] stating, among others:

In accordance with the provisions of the Security Assignment and the Receivable Assignment Notice, we hereby give notice to you that an Acceleration Event has occurred and that the Receivables have been assigned by the Assignor to the Security Trustee for the benefit of the Secured Parties. Thus, you are hereby instructed by the Security Trustee effective immediately upon your receipt of this notice (i) to cease complying with the instructions or demands in respect of the Receivables from the Assignor or any other party other than the Security Trustee; and (ii) not to recognize any attempt by the Assignor to claim or receive the Receivables, or to distribute or deliver to the Assignor or any other party any sum, security or other Property forming part of or arising from the Receivables, other than upon written instruction of the Security Trustee.[19]

On even date, CBC-TAMG also sent Instructions[20] to BDO to: (a) pay or deliver the receivables directly to it when they fall due under the lease agreements; (b) not recognize any attempt by Primark to claim or receive the receivables; (c) cease compliance with instructions from Primark or any party other than CBC-TAMG; and (d) comply with all the instructions of CBC-TAMG in respect of the receivables.[21]

On the next day, February 5, 2020, Primark sent a letter[22] to BDO telling the latter to ignore CBC-TAMG's notices because the Security Assignment was void ab initio. Thus, BDO should still deliver its rental payments to Primark. BDO, in its letter reply to CBC-TAMG dated February 17, 2020,[23] informed the latter that it cannot honor CBC-TAMG's instructions because of the letter that it received from Primark challenging the legality of the assignment.

With the conflicting claims of Primark and CBC-TAMG, BDO wrote a letter to Primark dated April 7, 2020,[24] stating that it will issue checks payable to Primark or CBC-TAMG for its rentals starting in March 2020.

In a letter[25] to BDO dated June 26, 2020, CBC-TAMG reiterated its earlier instruction to deliver the payment of rentals directly to it. For its part, Primark sent demand letters[26] to all the lessee BDO branches, all dated June 30, 2020, demanding the payment of rent and informing the latter that Primark will not recognize any payment made to unauthorized persons.

The foregoing antecedents prompted BDO to institute a Complaint for Interpleader with Prayer for Consignation[27] against Primark and CBC-TAMG before the RTC-57 (the first interpleader case). It prayed that Primark and CBC-TAMG be required to interplead and settle between themselves their rights over the rental payments, and that it be discharged from all its liabilities therefrom. In the meantime, BDO also prayed that it be allowed to consign to the RTC-57 the total amounts of the checks until Primark and CBC-TAMG have determined which between them is the rightful recipient of the rental payments.[28]","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] filed by the petitioner Philippine Primark Properties, Inc. (Primark) assailing the Decision[2] dated April 12, 2022, and Resolution[3] dated October 13, 2022, of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 116479. The CA reversed and set aside the Order[4] dated November 16, 2020, of Branch 57, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Makati City (RTC-57) in Civil Case No. R-MKT-20-01679-SC which: (1) dismissed the Complaint for Interpleader filed by BDO Unibank, Inc. (BDO) against Primark and respondent China Banking Corporation Trust and Assets Management Group (CBC-TAMG); and (2) dismissed CBC-TAMG's cross-claims against Primark and the parties' respective counterclaims.[5]","The Court grants the Petition.

Preliminarily, CBC-TAMG points out that the Petition must be dismissed outright for being non-compliant with Rule 45, Section 4(d) of the Rules of Court. The said provision states:

SECTION 4. Contents of petition. — The petition shall be filed in eighteen (18) copies, with the original copy intended for the court being indicated as such by the petitioner and shall (a) state the full name of the appealing party as the petitioner and the adverse party as respondent, without impleading the lower courts or judges thereof either as petitioners or respondents; (b) indicate the material dates showing when notice of the judgment or final order or resolution subject thereof was received, when a motion for new trial or reconsideration, if any, was filed and when notice of the denial thereof was received; (c) set forth concisely a statement of the matters involved, and the reasons or arguments relied on for the allowance of the petition; (d) be accompanied by a clearly legible duplicate original, or a certified true copy of the judgment or final order or resolution certified by the clerk of court of the court a quo and the requisite number of plain copies thereof, and such material portions of the record as would support the petition; and (e) contain a sworn certification against forum shopping as provided in the last paragraph of section 2, Rule 42. (Emphasis supplied)

In compliance with the Resolution of the Court dated January 11, 2023, Primark submitted certified true copies of the assailed CA Decision and Resolution.[57] Likewise, in its Petition, Primark attached copies of its Motion for Reconsideration filed before the CA and BDO's Motion To Withdraw Complaint filed before the RTC-57. The Court finds these attachments as substantial compliance with Rule 45, Section 4(d) of the Rules of Court that would support the arguments in the Petition.

At any rate, in Cancio v. Performance Foreign Exchange Corp.,[58] the Court held that failure to attach material portions of the record will not necessarily cause the outright dismissal of a petition for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court:

The failure to attach material portions of the record will not necessarily cause the outright dismissal of the petition. While Rule 45, Section 4 of the Rules of Court requires that the petition ""be accompanied by ... such material portions of the record as would support the petition,"" this Court may still give due course if there is substantial compliance with the Rules.[59]

Considering as well that CBC-TAMG, in its Comment to the Petition, also attached copies of the relevant portions of the record, it will serve the higher interest of justice that the case be decided on the merits rather than be dismissed on mere technicality.","WHEREFORE, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is GRANTED. The Decision dated April 12, 2022, and Resolution dated October 13, 2022, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 116479 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The counterclaim and cross-claim of China Banking Corporation-Trust and Asset Management Group in Civil Case No. R-MKT-20-01679-SC are DISMISSED for lack of capacity to sue."
"A.C. No. 11001 (Formerly CBD Case No. 21-6449), August 19, 2024","GRAND PILLAR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT, INC., REPRESENTED BY ITS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, JOSEPHINE F. CHUA, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. NINI D. CRUZ, RESPONDENT.","Sometime in 2008, a complaint for consignation, specific performance, and damages was filed before Branch 74, Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Olongapo City, docketed as Civil Case No. 119-0-2008. The plaintiff in the said case, Josephine Lim (Lim), was represented by Atty. Cruz. Meanwhile, Grand Pillar was one of the defendants.

Upon appeal to the Court of Appeals (CA), the parties eventually executed a compromise agreement. Ensuingly, the CA rendered a Decision (Based on Compromise Agreement),[2] approving and adopting the Compromise Agreement, and declaring the case closed and terminated. Accordingly, an Entry of Judgment[3] was issued.

Among the salient provisions of the Compromise Agreement is that, upon its approval, Lim shall turn over the official receipts evidencing the full amount consigned in the RTC — totaling PHP 8,037,523.00 — to Grand Pillar and authorize the latter to withdraw the said amount. Grand Pillar, on the other hand, shall convey to Lim 10 deeds of conveyance covering the 10 properties which are the subject matter of Civil Case No. 119-0-2008.[4]

Thereupon, Grand Pillar successfully obtained PHP 6,042,753.50, representing the amount actually consigned by Lim to the RTC. In turn, Grand Pillar released four deeds of conveyance representing four properties out of the 10 properties. Thus, there remained a balance of PHP 1,994,769.50, which Lim had to pay Grand Pillar.

For Lim's failure to pay her outstanding obligation despite repeated demands, Grand Pillar was constrained to file a Motion for Execution[5] to implement the provisions of the Compromise Agreement, particularly the payment of the remaining balance Grand Pillar undertook to release the six remaining deeds of conveyance representing six properties, upon receipt of the balance of PHP 1,994,769.50.

In its Order[6] dated June 2, 2014, the RTC merely noted the Motion for Execution filed by Grand Pillar, since a writ of execution was already issued on September 5, 2013. The RTC, nonetheless, directed Lim to pay the remaining balance of PHP 1,994,769.50, and Grand Pillar to release the six deeds of conveyance covering the subject properties.

As it happened, at around 3:00 p.m. of September 11, 2015, a meeting ensued among Grand Pillar's CEO, Josephine F. Chua (CEO Chua); Grand Pillar's counsel, Atty. Ericson Chang Aguila (Atty. Aguila), Atty. Cruz, and Sheriff Cristopher T. Perez (Sheriff Perez), at the RTC's staff room. During the meeting, Atty. Cruz, representing herself as counsel of Lim, tendered to Sheriff Perez Union Bank of the Philippines Manager's Check No. 0000300714 dated September 8, 2014 with a face value of PHP2,000,000.00 and payable to the order of the RTC of Olongapo City, in full settlement of Lim's outstanding obligation PHP1,994,769.50 to Grand Pillar.[7]

When Atty. Aguila asked Atty. Cruz why her client, Lim, issued the manager's check payable to the order of the RTC of Olongapo City, Atty. Cruz replied that it was the way her client wanted the check to be issued.[8]

Considering that the manager's check was issued to the order of the RTC of Olongapo City, Sheriff Perez delivered the same to the concerned RTC for safekeeping. The check was eventually deposited to the RTC's Fiduciary Trust Fund.[9]

Grand Pillar, through its counsel, immediately filed with the RTC an Urgent Motion for Release of Payment[10] praying that an order be issued authorizing Grand Pillar to withdraw the amount of PHP 2 million representing the value of the subject manager's check. Thus, on September 15, 2014, the RTC issued an Order[11] directing the Clerk of Court of the RTC of Olongapo City to release the amount of PHP 2 million to the duly-authorized representative of Grand Pillar.

On September 18, 2014, CEO Chua, along with two other employees of Grand Pillar, and Atty. Aguila, met Atty. Cruz and Sheriff Perez at the RTC to personally deliver to Atty. Cruz the remaining six deeds of conveyance. CEO Chua, Atty. Aguila, the two employees of Grand Pillar, and Beth Rubio, the cashier of the RTC of Olongapo City, then proceeded to the Land Bank of the Philippines, Olongapo City Branch located at Rizal Avenue, East Bajac-Bajac, Olongapo City, to obtain the cash value of the consigned manager's check. CEO Chua successfully obtained the cash value of the manager's check, making her believe that this was the end of Grand Pillar's legal dispute with Lim.[12]

However, to CEO Chua's great surprise and dismay, she received a letter from a certain Gracita Domingo-Agaton (Domingo-Agaton), who averred that Grand Pillar used her Union Bank of the Philippines Manager's Check No. 0000300714 dated September 8, 2014 with a face value of PHP 2 million, purportedly to settle Grand Pillar's obligation to a certain Josephine Lim in relation to Civil Case No. 119-0-2008. Claiming that she was the drawer of the manager's check, Domingo-Agaton demanded Grand Pillar to return the said amount to her; otherwise, she would be constrained to institute the necessary legal action against Grand Pillar and Atty. Cruz.[13]

In her letter[14] dated October 9, 2015, CEO Chua, through Atty. Aguila, claimed good faith in receiving the subject manager's check as settlement for the obligation of Lim, who was represented by Atty. Cruz in Civil Case No. 119-0-2008.

Inevitably, Grand Pillar filed the disbarment complaint against Atty. Cruz, asseverating that had it not been for the assurances and representation of Atty. Cruz that the subject manager's check was Lim's payment for her outstanding obligation to Grand Pillar, the latter would not have obtained the amount covered by the check. It further asserted that after entering into a compromise agreement with Lim, Grand Pillar only envisioned to finally end Civil Case No. 119-0-2008. However, with the receipt of Domingo-Agaton's demand letter, its humble aspiration was blown to smithereens with the looming litigation that it stands to face against Domingo-Agaton, to which Grand Pillar has neither contractual nor extra-contractual dealings in the past. In light of Atty. Cruz's manifest deceitful act of tendering in payment a manager's check which belongs to somebody who is not part of Civil Case No. 119-0-2008, and without said drawer's knowledge or conformity, she violated the Lawyer's Oath and must be meted the ultimate penalty of disbarment.[15]

On February 3, 2016, the Court issued a Resolution requiring Atty. Cruz to file her comment on the complaint.[16] Atty. Cruz, however, failed to comply with the Court's directive. This prompted the Court to issue another Resolution,[17] requiring Atty. Cruz to show cause why she should not be disciplinary dealt with or held in contempt for failure to comply with the February 3, 2016 Resolution and reiterating the order to submit the required comment, both within 10 days from notice.

For Atty. Cruz's repeated failure to comply with the Court's directives, the Court issued anew a Resolution on November 20, 2017, imposing upon her the fine of PHP 1,000.00 payable within 10 days from notice or a penalty of imprisonment for five days if such fine is not paid within the prescribed period. Again, Atty. Cruz was required to submit her comment on the instant complaint.[18]

On June 26, 2019, the Court required Atty. Cruz to comply with the February 3, 2016 Resolution by submitting the required comment.[19] Once more, Atty. Cruz failed to heed the Court's directive.[20]

In the Resolution[21] dated November 11, 2020, this Court dispensed with the comment of Atty. Cruz and referred to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines the subject complaint for investigation, report and recommendation. The case was docketed as CBD No. 21-6449 (Admin Case No. 11001) before the Integrated Bar of the Philippines-Commission on Bar Discipline (IBP-CBD).

The mandatory conference of the case was terminated on account of both parties' failure to appear despite the IBP-CBD's directive. As a consequence, they were directed to submit their respective position papers within a non-extendible period of 10 days, with warning that failure to file their position papers shall be deemed a waiver of their right to submit the same.[22]

For her repeated failure to comply with the processes of the IBP-CBD despite due notice, the IBP-CBD considered Atty. Cruz ""as in default"" and to have waived her right to further participate in the proceedings before the Commission.[23]

In the interregnum, in A.C. No. 11023, Domingo-Agaton v. Cruz,[24] the Court meted the ultimate penalty of disbarment upon Atty. Cruz for her dishonest, deceitful and fraudulent conduct. The Court held among other things, that Atty. Cruz defrauded Domingo-Agaton by misappropriating her Union Bank of the Philippines Manager's Check No. 0000300714 and using it as settlement for the obligation of another client in another case. The Court further ruled that in doing so, she likewise deceived the RTC into believing that Domingo-Agaton's manager's check was issued for Civil Case No. 119-0-2008, to which she was not a party.

Afterwards, Commissioner Donna Ann T. Balboa (Commissioner Balboa) the investigating Commissioner of the IBP-CBD, issued her Report and Recommendation,[25] noting that Atty. Cruz had already been disbarred for her malicious and deceitful means of tendering a manager's check owned by another client, Domingo-Agaton, to use as settlement for the obligation of her client, Lim, in Civil Case No. 119-0-2008. The instant case stemmed from Atty. Cruz's act of securing a manager's check from Domingo-Agaton, when she knew for a fact that Civil Case No. 86-0-2013 which involved Domingo-Agaton had already been dismissed. Instead of returning the check to Domingo-Agaton, Atty. Cruz unlawfully and dishonestly used the subject manager's check to settle Lim's obligation in Civil Case No. 119-0-2008, to the damage, prejudice, and injury of both clients. Accordingly, the IBP-CBD recommended that Atty. Cruz be disbarred.[26]

In the Resolution[27] of the IBP Board of Governors, the recommendation of Commissioner Balboa was modified, thus—","Before the Court is an administrative complaint[1] for disbarment filed by Grand Pillar International Development, Inc. (Grand Pillar), represented by its Chief Executive Officer, Josephine F. Chua (Chua), against respondent Atty. Nini D. Cruz (Atty. Cruz) for malpractice and deceit.
The precursor facts are synthesized as follows:","The Court dismisses the instant disbarment complaint on the ground of res judicata.

Res judicata literally means ""a matter adjudged; a thing judicially acted upon or decided; a thing or matter settled by judgment."" It also refers to the rule that a final judgment or decree on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction is conclusive of the rights of the parties or their privies in all later suits on points and matters determined in the former suit. It rests on the principle that parties should not to be permitted to litigate the same issue more than once; that, when a right or fact has been judicially tried and determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, or an opportunity for such trial has been given, the judgment of the court, so long as it remains unreversed, should be conclusive upon the parties and those in privity with them in law or estate.[28]

Res judicata, as an absolute bar to a subsequent action, requires the following: (1) the judgment sought to bar the new action must be final; (2) the decision must have been rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties; (3) the disposition of the case must be a judgment on the merits; and (4) there must be, as between the first and second action, identity of parties, subject matter, and causes of action. When there is no identity of causes of action, but only an identity of issues, res judicata in the concept of conclusiveness of judgment still applies.[29]

To encapsulate, the present disbarment complaint charges Atty. Cruz with malpractice and deceit for misappropriating the manager's check issued by a former client in Domingo-Agaton, in order to settle the obligation of another client to herein complainant Grand Pillar in a different case.

The Court rules and so holds that res judicata in the concept of ""bar by prior judgment"" applies because all of its elements are present in the case at bench.

There is no dispute that this Court, in the case of Domingo-Agaton, had jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties. Likewise, the decision rendered in the said case was one on the merits and had long become final.

Moreover, the parties, subject matter and causes of action in Domingo-Agaton and the instant case are identical.

First, there is, as between Domingo-Agaton and the present case, identity of parties. The principle of res judicata does not require absolute identity of parties, but requires, at the very least, substantial identity of parties. There is substantial identity of parties when there exists a ""community of interest between a party in the first case and a party in the second case even if the latter was not impleaded in the first case.""[30] The respondent in both cases is Atty. Cruz. In the first case, complainant is Domingo-Agaton, who filed a complaint for grave misconduct against Atty. Cruz on the ground that she misappropriated the manager's check issued by the former to use as settlement for the obligation of another client, Lim, in Civil Case No. 119-0-2008, a case where Domingo-Agaton is a not a party. On the other hand, the complainant in the subject case is Grand Pillar, to whom the same manager's check was presented as payment for the outstanding obligation of her client, Lim, in Civil Case No. 119-0-2008. Clearly, there is community of interests between both complainants in the two cases in order to seek redress for Atty. Cruz's deceitful conduct.

Second, it is undisputed that the same Union Bank of the Philippines Manager's Check No. 0000300714 dated September 8, 2014 was the subject matter in the two cases.

Third, the causes of action in both cases are undoubtedly identical in that they seek the disbarment of Atty. Cruz based on the same set of facts and circumstances which occurred in Domingo-Agaton. To reiterate, the Court already acknowledged the same deplorable act committed by Atty. Cruz in the Domingo-Agaton case.[31] In meting upon her the supreme penalty of disbarment, the Court held—

Respondent was dishonest when she concealed from complainant that Civil Case No. 86-0-2013 had already been dismissed by the RTC on July 31, 2014. She even went to the extent of instructing complainant to purchase the subject manager's check purportedly as bond for the consignation of the subject property. Indeed, respondent deceived complainant when she impressed upon the latter the need for such bond, despite the prior dismissal of Civil Case No. 86-0-2013. Consistent with her dishonest acts, respondent got hold of complainant's manager's check through deceitful assurances. Respondent, then, defrauded complainant by misappropriating the latter's manager's check as settlement or the obligation of another client in another case. In doing so, she likewise deceived the RTC into believing that complainants manager's check was issued for Civil Case No. 119-0-2008, to which complainant was not a party.","ACCORDINGLY, the disbarment complaint against respondent Atty. Nini D. Cruz for malpractice and deceit is DISMISSED on the ground of res judicata.

However, for her repeated defiance of the orders of this Court and the Integrated Bar of the Philippines, which is classified as a less serious offense under Canon VI, Section 34 of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability, she is meted out a FINE in the amount of PHP 50,000.00.

Let a copy of this Decision be furnished to the Office of the Bar Confidant to be appended to the personal record of Atty. Nini D. Cruz as a member of the Bar. Likewise, let copies of the same be served on the Integrated Bar of the Philippines and the Office of the Court Administrator."
"G.R. No. 271209, August 19, 2024","PHILIPPINE HEALTH INSURANCE CORPORATION (PHILHEALTH), PHILHEALTH PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, AND PHILHEALTH REGIONAL OFFICE-NATIONAL CAPITAL REGION, THROUGH ITS VICE PRESIDENT, PETITIONERS, VS. DR. JOSE MARI DEL VALLE GALAURAN, RESPONDENT.","On the basis of various anomalous claims for patients, PhilHealth issued Corporate Personnel Order No. 2018-1802[11] dated August 17, 2018, which authorized certain personnel of the Fact-Finding Investigation and Enforcement Department (FFIED) to conduct hospital spot inspection and claims validation through domiciliary visits within Regions IV-A, NCR, and Rizal from October 1 to 31, 2018, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays.[12]

For this purpose, WellMed Dialysis and Laboratory Center Corporation (WellMed) was among the medical centers subjected to a spot inspection and claims validation.[13] According to a report from the FFIED, WellMed filed anomalous claims for patients who were already dead, and still received out-of-pocket payments from dialysis patients or members without issuing the corresponding receipts for their treatments.[14]

FFIED reported that on November 3, 2016, WellMed filed benefit claims for the out-patient hospitalization and dialysis sessions of PhilHealth member and patient, Bebian Morte Albante[15] (Albante), amounting to PHP 49,400.00 for hemodialysis procedures covering several dates in August and September 2016.[16] However, the records establish that Albante died on July 16, 2016, and was already dead when WellMed filed and processed the benefit claims.[17]

It was alleged that Dr. Galauran certified, in behalf of WellMed, that Albante underwent dialysis sessions after July 16, 2016.[18] For this reason, a Complaint-Affidavit[19] was filed against Dr. Galauran and WellMed.[20] Thus, the FFIED charged Dr. Galauran for the following offenses of HCPs under the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations[21] (RIRR) of NHIA: (1) misrepresentation by false or incorrect information under Section 162; and (2) breach of the warranties of accreditation/performance commitment under Sec. 163.[22]

On July 12, 2019, PhilHealth ordered Dr. Galauran to file a Verified Answer.[23]

In compliance, Dr. Galauran filed his Verified Answer[24] dated August 27, 2019, and denied all the accusations against him.[25] Dr. Galauran argued that: (1) he cannot be held administratively liable because Albante was not his patient; (2) he was not a resident physician nor a consultant at WellMed; (3) on the other hand, he worked as an Associate Medical Doctor at Eaglerock Dialysis and Wellness Center, a direct competitor of WellMed; and (4) he had no participation in the alleged fraudulent claims as he did not sign any document for benefit claims to PhilHealth.[26]

Notwithstanding, PhilHealth sent a Letter[27] dated August 7, 2020 (first assailed Order) informing Dr. Galauran that his accreditation was withdrawn effective from date of notice.[28] The first assailed Order stated that after investigation and on the basis of the administrative cases filed before the Arbitration Office, PhilHealth found sufficient grounds to withdraw Dr. Galauran's accreditation.[29] The charges were summarized in the first assailed","This Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] challenges the Decision[2] dated September 13, 2023, and the Resolution[3] dated December 13, 2023, of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 169097.
Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) is a government-owned or controlled corporation (GOCC) created by virtue of Republic Act No. 7875,[4] as amended by Republic Act No. 9241[5] and Republic Act No. 10606,[6] or the National Health Insurance Act (NHIA).[7]

The PhilHealth President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), and the Vice President of the Regional Office of the National Capital Region (NCR) (Vice President) are officers of PhilHealth, whose decisions were assailed by Dr. Jose Mari Del Valle Galauran[8] (Dr. Galauran) before the appellate court.[9]

On the other hand, Dr. Galauran was a PhilHealth-accredited health care professional (HCP),[10] with a specialization in nephrology.","We affirm.

The Court rules that PhilHealth arbitrarily and unlawfully revoked the accreditation of Dr. Galauran, and did not afford him due process. Consequently, the CA did not gravely abuse its discretion in setting aside the assailed Orders of PhilHealth.

Foremost, We establish the legal framework for the accreditation of a HCP, and its withdrawal and/or revocation by the PhilHealth Board.

PhilHealth is mandated by its institutional law, as amended, to determine the requirements, and issue guidelines for the accreditation of health care providers
We held in jurisprudence that the NHIA, as amended, seeks to prioritize and accelerate the provision of health services to all Filipinos, especially that segment of the population who cannot afford healthcare.[73] In so doing, We emphasized the utmost importance of PhilHealth to public health programs.[74]

PhilHealth's institutional law mandates it to administer the National Health Insurance Program (Program).[75] In pursuit of its mandate, PhilHealth is likewise required to determine the requirements and issue guidelines for the accreditation of health care providers.[76]

Under the NHIA, as amended, a health care provider, who may be an HCP, is defined as any doctor of medicine, nurse, midwife, dentist, or other health care professional or practitioner duly licensed to practice in the Philippines and accredited by PhilHealth.[77]

In its RIRR, PhilHealth defined the term ""accreditation"" as a process to verify the qualifications and capabilities of health care providers for the purpose of conferring upon them the privilege of participating in the Program and assuring the quality of their health care services. Thus, Sec. 3 states:

SECTION 3. Definition of Terms. – For the purposes of this Rules, the terms below shall be defined as follows:

a.
. . . .


b.
Accreditation of Health Care Providers – a process whereby the qualifications and capabilities of health care providers are verified in accordance with the guidelines, standards and procedures set by the Corporation for the purpose of conferring upon them the privilege of participating in the Program and assuring that health care services rendered by them are of the desired and expected quality. Accreditation encompasses licensing or certification, or pre-accreditation survey, as applicable, and their participation in the Program.[78] (Emphasis supplied)
For an HCP or any licensed doctor of medicine, nurse, midwife, dentist, or other health care professional or practitioner to be accredited with PhilHealth, he or she must meet the following requirements:

SECTION 61. Accreditation Requirements for Physicians, Dentists, Nurses, Midwives, Pharmacists and Other Licensed Health Care Professionals. – Physicians dentists; nurses, midwives, pharmacists and other licensed health care professionals shall comply with the following requirements to be accredited:

a.
They must be duly licensed to practice in the Philippines by the PRC;
 	 
b.
They must be members of the Program with qualifying premium contributions;
 	 
c.
They must comply with the provisions set forth in the performance commitment for professionals; and
 	 
d.
They must comply with all other requirements that may be determined by the Corporation.
No accreditation fees shall be imposed by the Corporation for health care professionals and shall not require a certificate of good standing or such other analogous certification for them to be accredited.

Findings on ethical issues by disciplinary bodies of accredited professional organizations of the Professional Regulation Commission (PRC) or specialty societies recognized by the Philippine Medical Association (PMA) in the case of medical specialists, shall be considered in assessing the performance of health care professionals. Suspension of membership in such professional organizations shall be given due consideration in assessing the continued accreditation of such professionals.[79]

Based on the above, Sec. 61 mandates HCPs to be licensed by the Professional Regulation Commission, members of the PhilHealth Program, comply with the performance commitment for professionals and other requirements determined by PhilHealth.

Further, the RIRR enumerates the types of accreditation that a health care provider may undergo. This includes initial accreditation, continuous accreditation, re-accreditation, and reinstatement of accreditation.[80]

Among the types of accreditation, We emphasize the definition of continuous accreditation, and maintain that health care providers enjoy uninterrupted participation until such time that their accreditation is withdrawn by PhilHealth.[81] Thus, Sec. 53 provides:","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED. The Decision dated September 13, 2023, and the Resolution dated December 13, 2023, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 169097 are AFFIRMED."
"G.R. No. 185110, August 19, 2024","PREMIERE DEVELOPMENT BANK,• PETITIONER, VS. SPOUSES ENGRACIO T. CASTAÑEDA•• AND LOURDES E. CASTAÑEDA,••• RESPONDENTS.","The facts are not disputed.

The respondents, Spouses Engracio T. Castañeda (Engracio) and Lourdes E. Castañeda (Lourdes) (collectively, Spouses Castañeda), had an outstanding loan obligation with PDB in the amount of PHP 2.6 million under Promissory Note No. (PN) 717-X[6] (Subject Loan). The maturity date of the Subject Loan was on September 10, 2000. As collateral, Engracio assigned and pledged to PDB a proprietary share in Manila Polo Club (MPC) identified as Proprietary Membership Certificate No. 170 (MPC Certificate No. 170) which was registered under the name of his brother, Constancio T. Castañeda, Jr.[7] (Constancio).

Engracio and Constancio were officers of two corporations. Engracio was the president of Casent Realty and Development Corporation (Casent Realty) and vice-president of Central Surety and Insurance Company, Inc., (Central Surety). Constancio was the president of Central Surety.

These corporations had separate loans with PDB. Casent Realty had a loan of PHP 40 million under PN 235-Z[8] while Central Surety had two loans of PHP 40,898,000 under PN 376-X[9] and PHP 6 million under PN 714-Y.[10] These loans were also secured by separate pledge and real estate mortgage contracts (REM).[11]

Prior to the maturity of the Subject Loan, the parties started renegotiating for its renewal. However, the parties could not agree on the amount of partial payment that Spouses Castañeda should pay on the principal amount;[12] thus, the Subject Loan became due on September 10, 2000. On September 20, 2000, Spouses Castañeda delivered to PDB a Bank of Commerce (BC) check[13] worth PHP 2.6 million in payment of the Subject Loan.

Meanwhile, Central Surety's loan of PHP 6 million under PN 714-Y had become due on August 14, 2000. PDB sent Central Surety a demand letter for payment of the same. Thus, on September 20, 2000, Central Surety also sent to PDB a BC check worth PHP 6 million in full payment of its loan under PN 714-Y.

Initially, PDB refused to accept the check payment of Spouses Castañeda for their personal loan and returned the same to them. On September 29, 2000, Spouses Castañeda, through counsel, sent a letter[14] to PDB, tendering the check with warning that PDB's continued refusal to accept the same would result in consignation of the check with the court.

In a letter[15] dated October 13, 2000, PDB replied to Spouses Castañeda's counsel saying that it could not accept the check as full payment of the Subject Loan as it was insufficient and instead made an application of payments. The letter stated:","This is a case of first impression on the issue of application of payment involving a person who is both a principal debtor of a personal loan and a surety of corporate loans of the same creditor.
Before the Court is a petition for review on certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the Court of Appeals (CA) Decision[2] dated June 25, 2008 in CA-G.R. CV No. 84578, which affirmed with modification the Decision[3] dated January 31, 2005 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 149, Makati City (RTC) in Civil Case No. 01-029, and Resolution[4] promulgated on October 20, 2008 which denied petitioner Premiere Development Bank's (PDB) Motion for Reconsideration[5] dated July 14, 2008 (MR).","He who has various debts of the same kind in favor of one and the same creditor, may declare at the time of making the payment, to which of them the same must be applied. Unless the parties so stipulate, or when the application of payment is made by the party for whose benefit the term has been constituted, application shall not be made as to debts which are not yet due.

If the debtor accepts from the creditor a receipt in which an application of the payment is made, the former cannot complain of the same, unless there is a cause for invalidating the contract. (1172a)

However, the Court finds that Article 1252 does not apply in this case since the PNs executed in favor of PDB have different debtors.

In Magdalena Estates, Inc. v. Rodriquez,[32] the Court held that the rules contained in Article 1252 of the Civil Code apply to a person owing several debts of the same kind to a single creditor.[33] In order for the provision to apply, there must be a single debtor with several debts due to a single creditor.[34]

Here, PDB would want to treat Spouses Castañeda, Central Surety, and Casent Realty as one person as regards their separate loans. In fact, not only did PDB apply the PHP 2.6 million check payment of Spouses Castañeda to the corporate loans of Central Surety and Casent Realty; PDB co-mingled the payments for the PHP 2.6 million personal debt and PHP 6 million corporate debt and distributed the total PHP 8.6 million payment among the four separate debts. In effect, an aliquot portion of Central Surety's payment of PHP 6 million was also applied to Spouses Castañeda's personal loan of PHP 2.6 million. However, this cannot be done because the terms of the PNs clearly indicate whether the debts are personal to Spouses Castañeda or are owed by the corporations. In this regard, it should be added that, contrary to what PDB has asserted, the PNs do not show that Engracio had bound himself solidarily as co-borrower and obligor of the corporations' loans.

As correctly held by the CA, the obligations of the corporations Casent Realty and Central Surety are not the obligations of Spouses Castañeda. It is indeed a basic doctrine in corporation law that corporations have separate and distinct personality from their officers and stockholders. Thus, the payment made by Spouses Castañeda for their personal loan cannot be applied to the corporate loans of Central Surety and Casent Realty. This also applies in the reverse situation to the loan obligations of Central Surety and Casent Realty in that the payment of their corporate loans cannot be applied to the personal debts of Spouses Castañeda.

Simply put, there could be no valid application of payment in this case as Casent Realty and Central Surety have separate and distinct personalities from Engracio and the Spouses Castañeda; hence, each cannot be held liable for the other's obligations.

As previously held in the case of Francisco v. Mallen, Jr.,[35] citing Santos v. NLRC:[36]

""A corporation is a juridical entity with legal personality separate and distinct from those acting for and in its behalf and, in general, from the people comprising it. The rule is that obligations incurred by the corporation, acting through its directors, officers and employees, are its sole liabilities.""[37]

It is settled that a corporation is clothed with a personality separate and distinct from that of the persons composing it. It may not generally be held liable for the personal indebtedness of its stockholders or those of the entities connected with it. Conversely, an officer or stockholder cannot be made to answer for corporate obligations even if he or she should be its president.[38]

Furthermore, even if the Court were to understand PDB's position as an attempt to pierce the veil of corporate fiction, this position is still unwarranted.

For reasons of public policy and in the interest of justice, the corporate veil will justifiably be impaired only when it was used as a shield for fraud, illegality or inequity committed against third persons.[39] Here, there was no showing of any fraud or illegality of any kind. There was no inequity as PDB could have simply applied the PHP 6 million to the corporate loans of Central Surety and accepted the PHP 2.6 million of Spouses Castañeda as full payment for their separate personal loan.

On the other hand, with respect to the waiver executed by Spouses Castañeda in the Subject Loan, the Court finds that PDB's invocation of the same to be misplaced.

At the outset, the Court clarifies that the exception in Article 1252 of the New Civil Code, specifically, the phrase, ""[u]nless the parties so stipulate,"" refers to the application of payments to debts which are not yet due. It does not refer to the debtor's right to specify to which debt should his or her payment be applied, which PDB herein invokes to justify its application of the stipulation on the promissory note.

Nonetheless, the Court recognizes the right of the parties to contract and to agree to stipulations in relation to the application of payment. Thus, contrary to PDB's allegations, the waiver is not rendered inutile and a useless decorative provision on the promissory note as it is considered a contract between the parties.

At any rate, the waiver cannot be applied to the Subject Loan. To recall, the waiver provision states:

In case, I/We have several obligations with the Bank, I/We hereby empower the Bank to apply without [notice] and in any manner it sees fit, any or all of my/our deposits and payments to any of my/our obligations whether due or not. Any such application of deposits or payments shall be conclusive and binding upon me/us.[40] (Emphasis supplied)

Clearly, the obligations being referred to in said proviso refers to the obligations of the borrower and of no one else. It refers to several obligations of the same borrower. As such, payments can be validly applied only to obligations of the same debtor but not to obligations of other persons or entities. Consequently, the waiver does not apply to obligations that properly are for the account of the corporations and not for Spouses Castañeda. Stated simply, this provision only authorizes application of payment if Spouses Castañeda had other outstanding obligations with PDB obtained in their personal capacity.

Even assuming that it may validly invoke the provisions of the waiver, PDB is mandated to exercise its rights under the same in good faith.
Even assuming arguendo that the waiver executed by Spouses Castañeda is applicable to the corporate loans or to any other obligation of either Engracio or Lourdes with PDB in whatever capacity, PDB is still bound to act in good faith in applying the payments of Spouses Castañeda.

Article 1159 of the New Civil Code provides that: ""[o]bligations arising from contracts have the force of law between the contracting parties and should be complied with in good faith."" Article 1315 of the New Civil Code is likewise clear:

Contracts are perfected by mere consent, and from that moment the parties are bound not only to the fulfillment of what has been expressly stipulated but also to all the consequences which, according to their nature, may be in keeping with good faith, usage and law. (1258)

Thus, the application of the provisions of the waiver, as mandated by these articles, should be in keeping with not only the law, but also good faith. PDB should not apply the waiver in a way that would prejudice the rights of Spouses Castañeda; otherwise, the exercise of PDB's right under the waiver would be tantamount to bad faith.

Corollary thereto, while PDB may exercise its right to apply payment to the other obligations of Spouses Castañeda, the same must be done in good faith and only if it would not disadvantage Spouses Castañeda, especially if the debtor has multiple loans with the bank and not all of these loans are due and demandable as of the time of payment.

To illustrate, at the time of Spouses Castañeda's payment on September 20, 2000, Central Surety's loan of PHP 40,898,000.00, covered by PN 376-X was not yet due for another year or until October 10, 2001. Casent Realty's loan of PHP 40 million covered by PN 235-Z was not due until December 28, 2009 or a total of nine years. On the other hand, the personal loan of PHP 2.6 million, covered by the Subject Loan, was already due and demandable.

""Keeping in good faith"" therefore required PDB to apply the payment of Spouses Castañeda to the Subject Loan to result in its full satisfaction, instead of distributing it to other loans that are not yet due and demandable. ""Keeping in good faith"" would also be PDB applying the payment of Spouses Castañeda to the Subject Loan to result in its full satisfaction and applying any excess of the payment to their other obligations.

And the contrary—that is, insisting on applying the payment to loans that are not yet due and demandable, while allowing the Subject Loan to remain delinquent and continue to accumulate interest and other charges, even if the payment is sufficient to fully satisfy the latter—is NOT ""keeping in good faith.""

To rule otherwise would create the absurd and unfair situation where Spouses Castañeda's PHP 2.6 million loan would remain delinquent until all the debts of the Central Surety and Casent Realty would be fully paid. In effect, the personal loan of Spouses Castañeda would be held hostage until such time that the corporate loans of Central Surety and Casent Realty would be extinguished as PDB would have full discretion to apply Spouses Castañeda's loan payments to the corporate loans rather than to their personal loan. Interest payments and charges for the PHP 2.6 million personal loan would continue to accumulate, to the disadvantage and prejudice of Spouses Castañeda. Effectively, the period of Spouses Castenada's loan, which was already due and payable on September 10, 2000, would be extended until the extinguishment of Casent Realty's loan, which had the longest period. The Court cannot countenance such an inequitable situation.","ACCORDINGLY, in view of the foregoing, the Petition is DENIED for lack of merit.

LAZADA E-SERVICES PHIL., INC./ALLAN DAVID ANCHETA, RESPONDENTS.","In April 2016, Lazada hired petitioners as motorcycle riders under similarly worded Independent Contractor Agreements (Agreement), which provided that no employer-employee relationship would exist between them and that the Agreement shall be effective only for a term of one year.[6]

On the one hand, the Agreements of Rogelio, Rey, Jeremiah, and Michael, expired on April 1, 2017, while that of Julius lapsed on April 6, 2017. On the other hand, June's Agreement was discontinued a few days before the end of its one-year term. Likewise, Romeo's Agreement prematurely ended due to his alleged act of reproducing and using independent contractor identification cards in violation of Clause 6 of the Agreement.[7]

Aggrieved by the termination of their contracts, petitioners filed on November 6, 2017, a Complaint[8] for illegal dismissal, money claims, damages, and attorney's fees, against Lazada before the LA docketed as NLRC NCR Case No. 11-16366-17. They asserted that they were regular employees of Lazada, not independent contractors. As such, Lazada unjustly dismissed them without just cause and due process of law; thus, they are entitled to reinstatement and backwages.[9]

For its part, Lazada averred that the terms of its respective Agreements with petitioners negated the existence of an employer-employee relationship. It explained that the Agreements were in the nature of contracts for services governed by the Civil Code of the Philippines. Hence, the regular courts, not the labor tribunals, have jurisdiction over the case.[10]","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assailing the Decision[2] dated March 25, 2021, and the Resolution[3] dated July 30, 2021, of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R.

Serna,[25] citing Montoya v. Transmed,[26] the Court explained the parameters in reviewing a Rule 45 petition involving a labor case, viz.:

As a rule, only questions of law may be raised in a Rule 45 petition. In one case, we discussed the particular parameters of a Rule 45 appeal from the CA's Rule 65 decision on a labor case, as follows:

In a Rule 45 review, we consider the correctness of the assailed CA decision, in contrast with the review for jurisdictional error that we undertake under Rule 65. Furthermore, Rule 45 limits us to the review of questions of law raised against the assailed CA decision. In ruling for legal correctness, we have to view the CA decision in the same context that the petition for certiorari it ruled upon was presented to it; we have to examine the CA decision from the prism of whether it correctly determined the presence or absence of grave abuse of discretion in the NLRC decision before it, not on the basis of whether the NLRC decision on the merits of the case was correct. In other words, we have to be keenly aware that the CA undertook a Rule 65 review, not a review on appeal, of the NLRC decision challenged before it.[27]

The issues of whether: (1) petitioners were independent contractors; (2) their tasks as riders were necessary or desirable in the usual trade or business of Lazada; (3) petitioners were able to satisfy the four-fold test of employment; and (4) they were economically dependent on their work as riders of Lazada, are questions of fact which the Court may not generally dwell on in a Rule 45 petition. Nonetheless, the Court may reevaluate the sufficiency of evidence adduced before the labor tribunals when the judgment of the CA is premised on a misapprehension of facts,[28] such as at bar.

A review of the instant Petition shows that the findings of the labor tribunals and the CA were premised on a misapprehension of facts and are contradicted by the evidence on record and applicable case law. Thus, the Court proceeds to resolve the issues at hand and reexamine the findings of the tribunals a quo.

Regardless of the nomenclature which the parties assign to their agreement, employment contracts are prescribed by law as they are imbued with public interest.[29] Article 1700 of the Civil Code provides:

ARTICLE 1700. The relations between capital and labor are not merely contractual. They are so impressed with public interest that labor contracts must yield to the common good. Therefore, such contracts are subject to the special laws on labor unions, collective bargaining, strikes and lockouts, closed shop, wages, working conditions, hours of labor and similar subjects.

The Court held in Ditiangkin v. Lazada E-Services Philippines, Inc.:[30]

The applicable provisions of the law are deemed incorporated into the contract and the parties cannot exempt themselves from the coverage of labor laws simply by entering into contracts. Thus, regardless of the nomenclature and stipulations of the contract, the employment contract must be read consistent with the social policy of providing protection to labor.[31] (Citations omitted)

Article 295 of the Labor Code provides for the classifications of employment:

ARTICLE 295 [280]. Regular and Casual Employment. — The provisions of written agreement to the contrary notwithstanding and regardless of the oral agreement of the parties, an employment shall be deemed to be regular where the employee has been engaged to perform activities which are usually necessary or desirable in the usual business or trade of the employer, except where the employment has been fixed for a specific project or undertaking the completion or termination of which has been determined at the time of the engagement of the employee or where the work or service to be performed is seasonal in nature and the employment is for the duration of the season.

An employment shall be deemed to be casual if it is not covered by the preceding paragraph: Provided, That any employee who has rendered at least one year of service, whether such service is continuous or broken, shall be considered a regular employee with respect to the activity in which he is employed and his employment shall continue while such activity exists.

Employees who perform activities which are necessary or desirable in the usual business of the employer may be regular, project, or seasonal employees.[32] The case of Ditiangkin is instructive on the matter:

Of the three, project and seasonal employees are generally engaged to perform tasks which only lasts for a specific period and duration. Meanwhile, casual employees are those who perform work which are not usually necessary or desirable for the employer's business.

Activities which are considered usually necessary or desirable in the employer's business generally depends on the industry. There must be a reasonable connection between the work performed by the employee and the usual trade or business of the employer.[33] (Citations omitted)

To determine whether an employer-employee relationship exists, the Court applies the two-tiered test: the four-fold test and the economic dependence test. Under the four-fold test, the following factors must be established: (a) the employer's selection and engagement of the employee; (b) the payment of wages; (c) the power to dismiss; and (d) the power to control the employee's conduct, which extends over the means and methods by which the employee must accomplish the work. The power of control is the most essential factor in the four-fold test and it need not be actually exercised by the employer. It suffices that the employer has the right to wield the power. ""However, not all rules imposed upon a worker indicates the exercise of control by the employer. When rules are intended to serve as general guidelines to accomplish the work, it is not an indicator of control.""[34] Thus, ""[w]hen the control test is insufficient, the economic realities of the employment are considered to get a comprehensive assessment of the true classification of the worker.""[35]

In the case of Francisco v. National Labor Relations Commission,[36] the Court explained the essence of the economic dependence test:

The proper standard of economic dependence is whether the worker is dependent on the alleged employer for his continued employment in that line of business. In the United States, the touchstone of economic reality in analyzing possible employment relationships for purposes of the Federal Labor Standards Act is dependency. By analogy, the benchmark of economic reality in analyzing possible employment relationships for purposes of the Labor Code ought to be the economic dependence of the worker on his employer.[37]

Lazada avers that as petitioners were independent contractors, the four-fold test and the economic dependence test do not apply in the case at bar.

An independent contractor is ""one who carries on a distinct and independent business and undertakes to perform the job . . . on its own account and under one's own responsibility . . . free from the control and direction of the principal in all matters connected with the performance of the work except as to the results thereof.""[38]

Moreover, independent contractors are individuals who possess unique skills and talents which distinguish them from ordinary employees and whose means and methods of work are free from the control of the principal. ""Examples can include a columnist who was hired because of her talent, skill, experience, and feminist standpoint, a basketball referee who has special skills and independent judgment, and a masiador or sentenciador who had expertise in cockfight gambling.""[39]

Moreover, no employer-employee relationship exists between the independent contractor and the principal, and their agreement is governed by the Civil Code. When the status of their relationship is questioned, the employer or principal bears the burden to prove that the worker is an independent contractor rather than an employee.[40]","WHEREFORE, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is GRANTED.

After the death of Jose in 1994, Enrique sought Dulce's permission to stay in the property together with his family[7] and for her to assist him in raising them. She acceded.[8]

On October 14, 1999, the siblings[9] executed a Contract of Usufruct[10] in Dulce's favor, viz.:","This Petition for Review on Certiorari assails the following dispositions of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 169784:
1.
Decision[1] dated September 15, 2022 reversing the grant of the complaint for unlawful detainer filed by petitioner Ma. Dulce C. Fernandez (Dulce), through her attorneys-in-fact,[2] against one of her children, herein respondent Enrique C. Fernandez (Enrique); and


2.
Resolution[3] dated March 3, 2023 denying Dulce's Motion for Reconsideration.","We reverse.

Unlawful detainer is an action to recover possession of real property from one who unlawfully withholds its possession after the termination of his or her right of possession under any contract, express or implied. The defendant's possession in unlawful detainer was originally legal but became illegal due to termination of the right to possess.[107] This action may be filed by one who is not an owner of the property in dispute.[108]

A complaint sufficiently alleges a cause of action for unlawful detainer if it indicates the following:

1. initially, possession of property by the defendant was by contract with or by tolerance of the plaintiff;

2. eventually, such possession became illegal upon notice by the plaintiff to the defendant of the termination of the right of possession;

3. thereafter, the defendant remained in possession of the property and deprived the plaintiff of the enjoyment thereof and

4. within one year from the last demand on the defendant to vacate the property, the plaintiff instituted the complaint for ejectment.[109]

These jurisdictional facts must be alleged in the complaint itself for unlawful detainer. Failure to do so divests the first level court of jurisdiction over the case.[110]

Here, the complaint sufficiently alleged the essential requisites for unlawful detainer, viz.:

. . . .
 	 
2.3
After the death of Jose B. Fernandez in 1994, Enrique sought the permission of Ma. Dulce to allow him and his children, Erika, Amanda, and Enriquito, to stay in the Dasmariñas Village property and asked for her help in the raising of his children. Consequently, Ma. Dulce allowed them to sojourn with her in the said property.
 	 
2.4
Subsequently, the siblings Enrique, Roberto, Jaime and[,] Ma. Elena have agreed to grant their mother, Ma. Dulce the lifetime benefit, unlimited use and access, and exclusive control and possession of the Dasmariñas Village property by virtue of a Contract of Usufruct dated 14 October 1999.
 	 
2.5
With the execution of the Contract of Usufruct, all the rights, save for disposition, were transferred to Ma. Dulce.
 	 
2.6
On 18 September 2000, the fifty percent (50%) share of Ma. Dulce was transferred equally to the siblings Enrique, Roberto, Jaime[,] and Ma. Elena by virtue of a Deed of Absolute Sale dated 18 September 2000, making each sibling's share equal to twenty five percent (25%) of the property in issue.
 	 
2.7
To supplement and further bolster the usufructuary rights of Ma. Dulce[,] the parties herein executed a Memorandum of Agreement dated 18 December 2000, where it was agreed that plaintiff shall have the full control and possession of the Dasmariñas Village property during her lifetime.
 	 
2.8
Despite the transfer of the rights over the beneficial use of the Dasmariñas Village property, including the exclusive right to possess the property, plaintiff Ma. Dulce tolerated defendant's continued stay therein.
 
. . . .
 	 
2.24
Thus, on 12 April 2018, Ma. Dulce executed an irrevocable special power of attorney in favor of Roberto, Jaime[,] and Ma. Elena for the general administration of the Dasmariñas Village property, including the power and authority to file appropriate cases to protect her interest and usufructuary rights.
 
. . . .
 	 
2.26
Concomitant thereto, the said attorneys-in-fact through counsel, wrote a Demand Letter dated 21 May 201812 to defendant enforcing Ma. Dulce's usufructuary rights and requesting him to vacate the Dasmariñas Village property so that their mother can peacefully possess the same.
 	 
2.27
Additionally, Ma. Dulce wrote a letter to all her children, including herein defendant. In the said letter, she categorically declared that she wishes to be the sole resident and occupant of the Dasmariñas Village property, and that defendant and his family should immediately leave and establish their own home elsewhere.


2.28
However, despite receipt and knowledge of the demand letter and Ma. Dulce's letter, defendant refused and continues to refuse to vacate the aforesaid property.[111]
Preliminarily, it is undisputed that the siblings Enrique, Jaime, Roberto, and Ma. Elena (Dulce's children) are the co-owners of the subject property by virtue of: one, the Deed of Absolute Sale dated May 28, 1993 where Jose transferred his 50% share in the subject property to the siblings; and two, the Deed of Absolute Sale dated September 18, 2000 whereby Dulce herself transferred her own 50% share in the subject property to the siblings—making each sibling's share equal to 25% of the property. The complaint thus alleged:

2.2 In 1993, the fifty percent (50%) share of Jose B. Fernandez was transferred equally to the siblings Enrique C. Fernandez, Roberto C. Fernandez (Robert), Jaime C. Fernandez (Jaime) and Ma. Elena C. Fernandez (Ma. Elena) through a Deed of Absolute Sale dated 28 May 1993, with the following proportion:

. . . .

2.6 On 18 September 2000, the fifty percent (50%) share of Ma. Dulce was transferred equally to the siblings Enrique, Roberto, Jaime[,] and Ma. Elena by virtue of a Deed of Absolute Sale dated 18 September 2000, making each sibling's share equal to twenty five percent (25%) of the property in issue.[112]

But as things stand, the co-owners themselves conveyed in favor of their mother (Dulce) full right of possession and use of, as well as access to, the property via the Contract of Usufruct dated October 14, 1999, as supplemented by the Memorandum of Agreement dated December 18, 2000.

Usufruct gives the usufructuary the right to enjoy the property of another with the obligation of preserving its form and substance, unless the title constituting it or the law otherwise provides.[113] As a co-owner, Enrique parted with his right to possess and enjoy the property in favor of Dulce as usufructuary to last during her lifetime. In so doing he only retains the jus disponendi or the power to alienate the same insofar as his undivided share is concerned.[114] As for the memorandum of agreement, the siblings including Enrique himself further authorized Dulce to exercise full control and possession of the property effective and to last during her lifetime.

What then was the effect, if any, of the continuous stay of Enrique and his family on the property to the rights of Dulce as usufructuary thereof? The answer is plain and simple. It did not diminish the rights of Dulce as such and the continuous stay of Enrique and his children on the property was deemed to be by mere tolerance of Dulce. And when Dulce, through her attorneys-in­ fact, demanded for them to vacate the property on May 21, 2018, that tolerance was deemed terminated. From then on, their possession of the property became illegal such that when Dulce filed the complaint for illegal detainer against Enrique on October 22, 2018 well within the one-year period, she did so pursuant to her exclusive right of possession as usufructuary of the property.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated September 15, 2022 and Resolution dated March 3, 2023 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 169784 are REVERSED. The Decision dated July 7, 2021 of Branch 233, Regional Trial Court, Makati City is REINSTATED with MODIFICATION. Respondent Enrique C. Fernandez is ORDERED to:

"G.R. No. 254283, August 19, 2024","ORLANDO RODRIGUEZ AND DARYL RAMA, PETITIONERS, VS. SAN ROQUE METALS, INC. [SRMI], RESPONDENT.","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[2] dated December 19, 2020 filed by Rodriguez and Rama, assailing the Decision[3] and Resolution[4] of the Court of Appeals (CA). The assailed Decision granted the Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 with Prayer for Preliminary Injunction and Temporary Restraining Order filed by SRMI and reversed and set aside the Resolutions[5] of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC). The NLRC had earlier denied the Petition for Extraordinary Remedies[6] filed by SRMI, affirmed the June 30, 2017 Order[7] of Executive Labor Arbiter (ELA) Exequiel M. Dayot III (Dayot), and denied reconsideration.

SRMI filed its Comment on the Petition for Review on Certiorari[8] on October 14, 2021.

Rodriguez and Rama, together with three other complainants, filed a complaint for illegal dismissal against SRMI on March 30, 2011.[9] In a Decision[10] dated January 24, 2012, ELA Henry F. Te dismissed the complaint for illegal dismissal but ordered SRMI to pay Rodriguez, Rama, and Jeffrey Adiong certain sums corresponding to their 13th month pay and service incentive leave.[11]

Rama then executed a Quitclaim and Release with Motion to Dismiss[12] (Quitclaim) dated March 12, 2012. In consideration of the amount of PHP 20,000.00, Rama waived any claim or right of action against SRMI.[13] The other complainants executed similar documents.[14]

On March 27, 2012, SRMI filed a Memorandum of Partial Appeal with the NLRC.[15] Rodriguez and Rama, with the other complainants, also filed a Memorandum of Appeal.[16]

In a Resolution[17] dated December 28, 2012, the NLRC dismissed SRMI's partial appeal and partly granted the appeal of Adiong, Rodriguez, and Rama, declaring them regular employees of SRMI and ordering SRMI to pay them backwages plus allowances and other benefits.[18] This award was without prejudice to the crediting of the sum of PHP 20,000.00 that Rama had received from SRMI pursuant to the Quitclaim, which the NLRC declared invalid.[19] The NLRC denied SRMI's motion for reconsideration in its Resolution[20] dated March 27, 2013.[21]

SRMI filed a petition for certiorari[22] with the CA, seeking the nullification of the NLRC's Resolutions.[23] This petition was docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 05614-MIN.

After SRMI filed its petition for certiorari in CA-G.R. SP No. 05614-MIN, it entered into separate Compromise Agreements with Rodriguez and Rama dated February 3, 2015[24] and April 22, 2015,[25] respectively.[26] These Agreements were also acknowledged by ELA Dayot.[27]

The CA dismissed the petition in its June 24, 2015 Decision.[28] On June 30, 2015, SRMI filed a Manifestation (With Prayer for Dismissal) informing the CA that it had entered into a Compromise Agreement with Rodriguez.[29] On August 20, 2015, SRMI filed a motion for reconsideration, which the CA denied.[30]

On September 9, 2016, SRMI filed a petition for review on certiorari[31] with the Court, arguing, among others, that the CA erred in disregarding the Quitclaim executed by Rama and the Compromise Agreement signed by Rodriguez.[32] This petition was docketed as G.R. No. 226574.

In a Resolution[33] dated October 19, 2016, the Court denied SRMI's petition for review on certiorari for having been filed beyond the reglementary period of 15 days under Rule 45, Section 2, in relation to Rule 56, Section 5(a) of the Rules of Court.[34]

SRMI filed a Manifestation (With Prayer for Dismissal of Claims of Respondents by Reason of Execution of Valid Compromise Agreements)[35] dated February 24, 2017, praying for the dismissal of Rodriguez and Rama's complaints with finality in view of the Compromise Agreements.[36]

SRMI then filed a motion for reconsideration[37] dated March 27, 2017, arguing that its petition for review was filed within the extended period prayed for in its two motions for extension of time to file a petition for review.

In a Resolution[38] dated June 28, 2017, the Court noted and granted SRMI's Manifestation and the withdrawal of appearance of SRMI's previous counsel. The Court also ordered Rodriguez and Rama to comment on SRMI's motion for reconsideration of its October 19, 2016 Resolution.

In compliance with the Court's Resolution, Rodriguez and Rama filed Respondents' Partial Motion for Reconsideration with Comment/Opposition to the Petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration.[39]

SRMI then filed a Comment (To the Respondents' Partial Motion for Reconsideration with Comment/Opposition to the Petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration),[40] again arguing that its liability to Rodriguez and Rama was fully settled with the execution of the Compromise Agreements.[41] In response, Rodriguez and Rama filed a Reply to the Petitioner's Comment.[42]

The Court denied SRMI's motion for reconsideration in its Resolution[43] dated June 3, 2019. It also noted without action SRMI's Manifestation (with Prayer for Dismissal of Claims of Respondents by Reason of Execution of Valid Compromise Agreements) dated February 24, 2017, explaining as follows:

The respondents submit that the amounts received by Rama and Rodriguez served only as partial payments and should not be deemed as full satisfaction for their monetary claims. The Court finds these issues were the subject matter of the Labor Arbiter's order dated June 30, 2017 and the NLRC's resolution dated March 9, 2018. Both the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC deemed the amounts paid under the compromise agreements as advance or partial payments of respondents' total monetary claims.

Considering the foregoing, and given the denial of the instant petition for review on certiorari, no relief can be granted to the petitioner in relation to said compromise agreements.[44] (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)

In the meantime, Rodriguez and Rama, with three other complainants, filed a Motion for the Issuance of Writ of Execution with Prayer for Recomputation of the Judgment Award from the Time the Complainants were Illegally Dismissed from Employment up to the Payment of their Backwages and Separation Pay with the NLRC-RAB XIII, Butuan City.[45] Rodriguez and Rama sought the execution of the NLRC's judgment awards, as affirmed by the CA in CA-G.R. SP No. 05614-MIN.[46]

On June 30, 2017, the NLRC-RAB XIII, through ELA Dayot, issued an Order[47] disposing of Rodriguez and Rama's motion as follows:

WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, respondent SR METALS INC. is hereby ORDERED to pay the complainants their monetary awards as computed, to wit:

1.	JEFFREY ADIONG	
[PHP] 390,214.15
2.	ORLANDO RODRIGUEZ	
235,046.02
3.	DARYL RAMA	
398,786.31
 	 	
[PHP] 1,024,046.48
 	 	
==============
In addition, since complainants are minimum wage earner[s], their monetary awards are not subject to 5% withholding tax pursuant to [Republic Act No.] 9504, BIR Revenue Regulation No. 10-2008 dated July 8, 2008 as restated in NLRC Memorandum Circular No. 90-02, Series of 2013 ([September] 18, 2013).

Accordingly, let a writ of execution be issued for the enforcement and partial satisfaction of [complainants'] backwages, separation pay, and other monetary awards in the amount aforestated.","This controversy should have been long settled with the Court's final and executory ruling in SR Metals, Inc. v. Adiong[1] (docketed as G.R. No. 226574). In that case, the Court expressly stated that no relief could be granted to respondent San Roque Metals, Inc. (SRMI) in relation to certain compromise agreements SRMI had executed with petitioners Orlando Rodriguez (Rodriguez) and Daryl Rama (Rama). Unbeknownst to the Court, however, while G.R. No. 226574 was pending, SRMI also raised the existence of these agreements before the labor tribunals and Court of Appeals during the ongoing execution proceedings, committing willful and deliberate forum shopping that resulted in conflicting rulings and unjustly delayed satisfaction of the judicially approved claims of Rodriguez and Rama. The Court will not countenance such tactics. With this Decision, the Court settles the dispute with finality, leaving only the matter of the forum shopping committed by SRMI and its counsel to be settled.","In this case, this Court fails to see any grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC when it issued the 2012 NLRC Resolution, to justify the reversal or modification of the same. The 2012 NLRC Resolution, which, fortunately, was attached by the Union in its comment to the petition, shows that the NLRC judiciously reviewed all the records and documents presented by the parties, and based its ruling, particularly the amounts yet to be paid by LASURECO, on substantial evidence presented by the parties.[84] (Emphasis supplied; citations omitted)

Here, ELA Dayot stated that Rodriguez and Rama were informed that the amounts they were to receive under the Compromise Agreements were only advance payments, subject to the final disposition of their complaints against SRMI. The ELA held:

Proceeding to the Compromise Settlement dated [March 12, 2012] of complainant-RAMA with the consideration in the amount of [PHP] 20,000.00, this Office finds that the amount shall be treated as partial or an advance payment of his total monetary awards, similarly the amount of [PHP] 30,000.00 received by him in the Compromise Agreement he entered with the respondent on [February 3, 2015], shall also be treated as advance payment. Apparently, complainant-RAMA received a total amount of [PHP] 50,000.00 treated as advance payment.

While that of complainant-RODRIGUEZ, the amount of [PHP] 70,000.00 received by him per Compromise Agreement dated [April 22, 2015] shall likewise be treated as partial payment, as these were made known to the parties during the pre-execution conference that the amount received by the individual complainants shall be without prejudice to the final disposition of the case pending with the Supreme Court.[85] (Emphasis supplied)

It bears emphasis that it was also ELA Dayot who acknowledged the execution of the Compromise Agreements.[86] Accordingly, the ELA's findings as to the true nature of the Compromise Agreements and the parties' intent in signing the Agreements should not be lightly set aside.

In resolving SRMI's Petition for Extraordinary Remedies, the NLRC cited the above findings of the ELA:

As to the compromise agreements, as stated earlier, Executive Labor Arbiter Dayot considered the amount received by the respondents as partial or advance payments of their total monetary awards, as it was made known to the parties during the pre-execution conference that the amounts received by the individual respondents was without prejudice to the final disposition of the case pending with the Supreme Court.[87] (Emphasis supplied)

The NLRC also found that the monetary considerations given to Rodriguez and Rama were unreasonable and declared the Compromise Agreements invalid:

However, the Court has given effect to quitclaims in certain cases, if the employer is able to prove the following requisites: (1) the employee executes a deed of quitclaim voluntarily; (2) there is no fraud or deceit on the part of any of the parties; (3) the consideration of the quitclaim is credible and reasonable; and (4) the contract is not contrary to law, public order, public policy, morals or good customs, or prejudicial to a third person with a right recognized by law.","ACCORDINGLY, the instant Petition is GRANTED. The assailed Decision dated April 30, 2019 and Resolution dated August 25, 2020 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 08711-MIN are REVERSED.

In view of the unjust delay in the resolution of this dispute caused by San Roque Metals, Inc., the case is REMANDED to the Labor Arbiter, who is DIRECTED to RECOMPUTE with dispatch the total monetary awards due to petitioners Orlando Rodriguez and Daryl Rama as provided in the Executive Labor Arbiter's June 30, 2017 Order, incorporating legal interest of 6% per annum from June 30, 2017 until full payment.[98]

San Roque Metals, Inc. and its counsel Atty. Francis U. Ku and Atty. Alyanna R. Chang are directed to SHOW CAUSE, within 10 days from receipt of this Decision, why they should not be held in direct contempt for willful and deliberate forum shopping."

The accusatory portion of the Amended Information states:
That on or about August 30, 2005, in xxxxxxxxxxx and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused Crispin Araneta y Pelaez, Annabelle Oledan y Araneta, Benjamin Olidan y Erlandez, Godofredo Navanes y Lorenzo, Lynfer Bicodo y Baylon, Rogelio Caloring, Rey Alada, PO1 Jose Lonmar Zapatos y Fiel, an active member of the Philippine National Police-Special Action Force (PNP-SAF), PO1 Antonio Castillo y Domingo, likewise an active member of the Philippine National Police-Aviation Security Group (PNP-ASG), and a certain alias ""Henry"" conspiring, confederating and mutually helping one another, with the use of firearms, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously kidnapped AAA[7] (11 years old), BBB (11 years old), CCC (9 years old) and Eulalia Cuevas y Madara and thereafter demanded ransom money in exchange for the release of the four kidnapped victims to the damage and prejudice of the victims who were rescued and the parents of the three children.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[8]
On November 9, 2005, accused Araneta, Godofredo Navanes y Lorenzo (Navanes), Bicodo, and Caloring entered their respective pleas of ""Not Guilty"" to the crime charged.[9]

Likewise, on December 1, 2005, accused-appellant and his wife, accused Annabelle, entered their pleas of ""Not Guilty."" Accused PO1 Zapatos and PO1 Castillo similarly entered their pleas of ""Not Guilty"" to the crime charged.[10]

Accused Alada was never arrested and remains at-large up to the present date.

During the pre-trial on March 9, 2006, the defense admitted the identities of all the accused, the territorial jurisdiction of the RTC, and the minority of three of the private complainants, namely: AAA, BBB, and CCC (collectively, the ABC children). The parties also stipulated that AAA and BBB were only 11 years old, and CCC was only 9 years old at the time of the incident.[11]

Accused PO1 Zapatos and PO1 Castillo confirmed that they were active members of the Philippine National Police (PNP) at the time of the incident.[12]

Trial ensued.","Before the Court is an appeal[1] assailing the Decision[2] dated June 7, 2019 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 06209 which affirmed the Decision[3] dated March 26, 2013, of Branch 225, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Quezon City in Criminal Case No. Q-05-136632 that found Benjamin Olidan y Erlandez (accused-appellant) and his co-accused Crispin Araneta y Pelaez (Araneta), Annabelle Olidan[4] y Araneta (Annabelle), Lynfer Bicodo y Baylon (Bicodo), Rogelio Caloring (Caloring), Rey Alada (Alada), Police Officer I (PO1) Jose Lonmar Zapatos y Fiel (PO1 Zapatos), and PO1 Antonio Castillo y Domingo (PO1 Castillo), guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Kidnapping for Ransom defined under Article 267[5] of the Revised Penal Code.","The appeal is unmeritorious.

At the outset, it must be emphasized that the Court gives high respect to the trial court's evaluation of the testimony of a witness because it has the best opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witness to determine if there is indeed truth to his or her testimony in the witness stand.[64] Considering that the trial judge is in the best position to determine the truthfulness of witnesses, the judge's evaluation of the witnesses' testimonies is given the highest respect.[65]

After a judicious scrutiny of the records, the Court finds no reason to deviate from the uniform factual findings of the RTC and the CA as there is no indication that they overlooked, misunderstood, or misapplied the surrounding facts and circumstances regarding the kidnapping incident. It is settled that findings of the RTC which are factual in nature, and which involve the credibility of witnesses are accorded with respect, if not finality, by the appellate court when no glaring errors, gross misapprehension of facts, and speculative, arbitrary, and unsupported conclusions can be gathered from such findings.[66]

However, the Court modifies the following ruling of the CA: (1) that accused-appellant is liable for only one count of Kidnapping for Ransom; and (2) that Spouses ABC are also entitled to damages.

Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, defines, and prescribes the penalty for the crime of Kidnapping for Ransom, thus:
ARTICLE 267. Kidnapping and serious illegal detention. — Any private individual who shall kidnap or detain another, or in any other manner deprive him of his liberty, shall suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua to death:

1. If the kidnapping or detention shall have lasted more than three days.

2. If it shall have been committed simulating public authority.

3. If any serious physical injuries shall have been inflicted upon the person kidnapped or detained, or if threats to kill him shall have been made.

4. If the person kidnapped or detained shall be a minor, except when the accused is any of the parents, female, or a public officer.

The penalty shall be death where the kidnapping or detention was committed for the purpose of extorting ransom from the victim or any other person, even if none of the circumstances above-mentioned were present in the commission of the offense.

When the victim is killed or dies as a consequence of the detention or is raped, or is subjected to torture or dehumanizing acts, the maximum penalty shall be imposed. (Emphasis supplied)
In prosecuting a case of Kidnapping for Ransom, the following elements must be established: (1) the accused was a private person; (2) he or she kidnapped or detained, or in any manner deprived another of his or her liberty; (3) the kidnapping or detention was illegal; and (4) the victim was kidnapped or detained for ransom.[67]

In People v. Jatulan,[68] the Court discussed the definition of ransom as an element of the crime of Kidnapping for Ransom, thus:
[R]ansom means money, price or consideration paid or demanded for the redemption of a captured person that would release him from captivity. No specific form of ransom is required to consummate the felony of kidnapping for ransom as long as the ransom was intended as a bargaining chip in exchange for the victim's freedom. Whether or not the ransom is actually paid to or received by the perpetrator is of no moment.[69]
The essence of illegal detention is the deprivation of the victim's liberty such that the prosecution must prove actual confinement or restriction of the victim, and that such deprivation was the appellant's intention.[70] Also, if the victim is kidnapped and illegally detained to extort ransom, the duration of his detention is immaterial.[71] It is settled that the curtailment of the victim's liberty need not involve any physical restraint upon the latter's person and it is not necessary that the offender kept the victim in an enclosure or treated him harshly.[72]

In the case, the prosecution established beyond reasonable doubt the existence of all elements of Kidnapping for Ransom. Accused­-appellant and his co-accused are private persons. Even if PO1 Zapatos and PO1 Castillo were members of the PNP during the incident, they were acting in their private capacities when they kidnapped the victims.

The ABC children as well as Eulalia, categorically narrated how they were kidnapped and deprived of their liberty from the time the men boarded the Ford Escape until they were transferred to a Nissan Urvan van and eventually ended up in a safe house which was later discovered to be a water refilling station. Moreover, the victims identified all the persons involved in the kidnapping and the caretakers of the safehouse.

The victims' testimonies were consistent with each other and were corroborated by the statements of Raymund and DDD. Raymund, the family driver, testified as to the circumstances where the armed kidnappers flagged down their car and forcibly boarded it. DDD, on the other hand, testified as to the fact that the kidnappers informed her that her children, including their nanny, were with them and immediately demanded ransom money in the amount of PHP 50,000,000.00, in exchange for her children's freedom. The kidnappers threatened her that if she could not give the money within two days, they would kill her children. Later, she informed them that she only managed to come up with PHP 1,015,000.00. The kidnappers got furious and gave her three hours to produce the amount; otherwise, they would send her the heads of her children. Fortunately for the ABC family, the agents of PNP-PACER successfully rescued the victims from the hands of the kidnappers before the three-hour period expired and eventually arrested all the kidnappers except accused Alada.

At this point, the Court discards accused-appellant's argument that there is no evidence regarding his participation in the kidnapping case. Records disclose that the victims identified accused-appellant as one of the caretakers of the safe house. Simply stated, his participation was necessary for the successful execution of the Kidnapping for Ransom.

Moreover, the prosecution was able to establish beyond reasonable doubt the conspiracy between accused-appellant and his co-accused. The Revised Penal Code provides that conspiracy exists when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it.[73]

In People v. Lababo,[74] the Court reiterated the principles in determining whether a conspiracy exists, thus:
There is conspiracy when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it. Conspiracy is not presumed. Like the physical acts constituting the crime itself, the elements of conspiracy must be proven beyond reasonable doubt. While conspiracy need not be established by direct evidence, for it may be inferred from the conduct of the accused before, during and after the commission of the crime, all taken together, however, the evidence must be strong enough to show the community of criminal design. For conspiracy to exist, it is essential that there must be a conscious design to commit an offense. Conspiracy is the product of intentionality on the part of the cohorts.

It is necessary that a conspirator should have performed some overt act as a direct or indirect contribution to the execution of the crime committed.

"G.R. No. 261612, August 14, 2024","ARSENIO MANAGUELOD Y TANDAYU, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","By Information dated May 30, 2019, Managuelod was charged with violation of Batas Pambansa Blg. 6,[4] in relation to Republic Act No. 7166,[5] the Omnibus Election Code, as amended,[6] and COMELEC Resolution No. 10446, viz.:
That on March 18, 2019, in the City of Tuguegarao, Province of Cagayan, and within the [j]urisdiction of this Honorable Court, the accused ARSENIO MANAGUELOD y TANDAYU, without any authority of law, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously possess a knife, a deadly bladed weapon which is not used by him as necessary tool or instrument for legitimate activity or for his livelihood; that the accused entered the vicinity of the Bed Spacers Hometel Inn located at Leonarda, this city by climbing on the concrete fence of the said hotel and then he again climb[ed] on the railings at the upper portion of the hotel and stood on the railings prompting the manager of the hotel to seek for police assistance, and this resulted [in] his arrest by members of the PNP assigned at the Tuguegarao City Police Station; that as a consequence of his lawful arrest, the police officers conducted search on the sling bag of the accused, and the deadly bladed weapon with holster was recovered from his direct possession, control, and custody; that the accused carried the deadly weapon outside his residence at a time covered by the May 2019 election period without any validly issued COMELEC Exemption to carry and possess the same; that the incident resulted [in] the confiscation of the deadly weapon by the authorities of the law.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[7]
On arraignment, Managuelod pleaded ""not guilty"" to the offense charged.[8]

During trial, the prosecution presented the testimonies of Police Officer I Patrocinio Lappay (PO1 Lappay) and Police Staff Sergeant Edwin Pagulayan (PSSg Pagulayan),[9] while the defense presented Managuelod as its lone witness.[10]","This Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assails the following dispositions of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 44810:
1)
Decision[2] dated December 27, 2021 affirming the conviction of petitioner Arsenio Managuelod y Tandayu (Managuelod) for violation of Batas Pambansa Blg. 6, in relation to Republic Act No. 7166, the Omnibus Election Code, as amended, and Commission on Elections Resolution No. 10446 (COMELEC Resolution No. 10446); and


2)
Resolution[3] dated May 24, 2022 denying Managuelod's Motion for Reconsideration.","Foremost, we emphasize that the Court is not a trier of facts. The issue for resolution here – whether Managuelod illegally possessed a deadly weapon during the election period – is ultimately a question of fact. As a rule, only questions of law may be raised in a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45. One exception, however, is when the lower court had ignored, overlooked, or misconstrued relevant facts, which if taken into consideration will change the outcome of the case,[22] as in this case. 
 
Managuelod was properly charged under Republic Act No. 7166, in relation to the Omnibus Election Code, and COMELEC Resolution No. 10446
 

By Information dated May 30, 2019, Managuelod was charged with violation of Batas Pambansa Blg. 6, in relation to Section 32 of Republic Act No. 7166, the Omnibus Election Code, and COMELEC Resolution No. 10446.

Batas Pambansa Blg. 6 is titled ""An Act Reducing the Penalty for Illegal Possession of Bladed, Pointed or Blunt Weapons, and for Other Purposes, Amending for the Purpose Presidential Decree Numbered Nine.""

Section 1 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 6[23] states:
It is unlawful to carry outside of one's residence any bladed, pointed or blunt weapon such as ""knife"", ""spear"", ""pana"", ""dagger"", ""bolo"", ""barong"", ""kris"", or ""chako"", except where such articles are being used as necessary tools or implements to earn a livelihood or in pursuit of a lawful activity. Any person found guilty thereof shall suffer the penalty of imprisonment of not less than one month nor more than one year or a fine of not less than Two Hundred Pesos nor more than Two Thousand Pesos, or both such imprisonment and fine as the Court may direct.
On the other hand, Presidential Decree No. 9, the law amended by Batas Pambansa Blg. 6, was enacted for the purpose of curtailing ""subversion, rebellion, insurrection, lawless violence, criminally, chaos and public disorder"" by reason of Proclamation No. 1081, the law which proclaimed a state of martial law in the Philippines on September 21, 1972.[24] Batas Pambansa Blg. 6, therefore, is no longer applicable since the rationale for its enactment, i.e., curtailment of public disorder during martial law, has already ceased. Cessante ratione legis cessat ipsa lex. When the reason for the law ceases, the law itself ceases.[25]

Too, in People v. Purisima,[26] taking into consideration the intent and spirit of Presidential Decree No. 9, the Court held that such law is limited to acts of carrying a blunt or bladed weapon with a motivation connected with or related to the afore-quoted desired result of Proclamation No. 1081.

The prosecution, thus, erroneously charged Managuelod with a ""dead law.""

This notwithstanding, Managuelod was charged not only with violation of Batas Pambansa Blg. 6, but also of Section 32 of Republic Act No. 7166, in relation to the Omnibus Election Code.

Section 32 of Republic Act No. 7166, which amended Section 261 of the Omnibus Election Code, provides:
Who May Bear Firearms. - During the election period, no person shall bear, carry or transport firearms or other deadly weapons in public places, including any building, street, park, private vehicle or public conveyance, even if licensed to possess or carry the same, unless authorized in writing by the Commission. The issuance of firearms licenses shall be suspended during the election period.

Only regular members or officers of the Philippine National Police, the Armed Forces of the Philippines and other enforcement agencies of the Government who are duly deputized in writing by the Commission for election duty may be authorized to carry and possess firearms during the election period: Provided, That, when in the possession of firearms, the deputized law enforcement officer must be: (a) in full uniform showing clearly and legibly his name, rank and serial number which shall remain visible at all times; and (b) in the actual performance of his election duty in the specific area designated by the Commission. (Emphasis supplied)
Republic Act No. 7166 does not define the term ""other deadly weapons."" To arrive at its proper meaning, we apply the principles of statutory construction. From the plain, ordinary, and common usage of the root phrase ""deadly weapon,"" the common denominator between firearms and other deadly weapons as used in Section 32 is their ability to cause fatal consequences. Elsewhere, the phrase ""deadly weapon"" is understood as:
A deadly weapon is defined as ""any firearm, or other weapon, device, instrument, material or substance, whether animate or inanimate, which in the manner it is used or is intended to be used is known to be capable of producing death or serious bodily injury.[27] (Emphasis supplied)
Bladed instruments have such common denominator and are included in the phrase ""other deadly weapons"" because they are deadly weapons that are other than firearms.

Notably, the Legislature has long considered bladed instruments as deadly weapons. Act No. 1780, enacted as early as October 12, 1907, provides:
Section 26. It shall be unlawful for any person to carry concealed about his person any bowie knife, dirk, dagger, kris, or other deadly weapon: PROVIDED, That this prohibition shall not apply to firearms in the possession of persons who have secured a license therefor or who are entitled to carry [the] same under the provisions of this Act. (Emphasis supplied)
Generally, when a statute is clear, there is no room for interpretation.[28] In this case, however, it is necessary to clarify what constitutes ""other deadly weapons."" Hence, resort to statutes in pari materia is warranted. The Court explained in Yaphockun, et al. v. Professional Regulation Commission, et al.:[29]
Statutes are in pari materia when they relate to the same person or thing or to the same class of persons or things, or object, or cover the same specific or particular subject matter.

It is axiomatic in statutory construction that a statute must be interpreted, not only to be consistent with itself, but also to harmonize with other laws on the same subject matter, as to form a complete, coherent and intelligible system. The rule is expressed in the maxim, ""interpretare et concordare legibus est optimus interpretandi,"" or every statute must be so construed and harmonized with other statutes as to form a uniform system of jurisprudence.[30]
It is thus beyond cavil that bladed instruments, such as the one allegedly found in Managuelod's possession, are included in the term ""other deadly weapons"" within the purview of Section 32 of Republic Act No. 7166.

Too, Managuelod was charged under COMELEC Resolution No. 10446. The COMELEC, through its quasi-legislative powers, issued such resolution to implement Section 261 of the Omnibus Election Code, as amended by Section 32 of Republic Act No. 7166, during the conduct of the 2019 National and Local Elections. It specified therein that the term ""deadly weapon"" includes bladed instruments, to wit:
1. Deadly Weapon includes bladed instruments, hand grenades or other explosives, except pyrotechnics. Provided, that a bladed instrument is not covered by the prohibition when possession of the bladed instrument is necessary to the occupation of the possessor or when it is used as a tool for legitimate activity.[31] (Emphasis supplied)
In sum, despite the prosecution's mistake in charging Managuelod under Batas Pambansa Blg. 6, he was appropriately charged with violation of Section 32 of Republic Act No. 7166, in relation to the Omnibus Election Code, and COMELEC Resolution No. 10446. ","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is GRANTED. The assailed Decision dated December 27, 2021 and Resolution dated May 24, 2022 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 44810 are REVERSED. Petitioner Arsenio Managuelod y Tandayu is ACQUITTED of violation of Batas Pambansa Blg. 6, in relation to Republic Act No. 7166, the Omnibus Election Code, as amended.

Under Peña's subsequent Motion for Reconsideration,[2] he implores the Court to modify his penalty from imprisonment to community service.","The motion is granted.

Under Republic Act No. 11362 also known as the Community Service Act, the court may, in its discretion, and lieu of service in jail, require that the penalties of arresto menor and arresto mayor be served by the defendant by rendering community service in the place where the crime was committed, and under such terms as the court shall determine, taking into consideration the gravity of the offense and the circumstances of the case.

Section 3 of Republic Act No. 11362 provides:

SECTION 3. Community Service. — Article 88a of Act No. 3815 is hereby inserted to read as follows:

ARTICLE 88a. Community Service — The court in its discretion may, in lieu of service in jail, require that the penalties of arresto menor and arresto mayor be served by the defendant by rendering community service in the place where the crime was committed, under such terms as the court shall determine, taking into consideration the gravity of the offense and the circumstances of the case, which shall be under the supervision of a probation officer: Provided, That the court will prepare an order imposing the community service, specifying the number of hours to be worked and the period within which to complete the service. The order is then referred to the assigned probation officer who shall have responsibility of the defendant. x x x

Community service shall consist of any actual physical activity which inculcates civic consciousness, and is intended towards the improvement of a public work or promotion of a public service.

If the defendant violates the terms of the community service, the court shall order his/her re-arrest and the defendant shall serve the full term of the penalty, as the case may be, in jail, or in the house of the defendant as provided under Article 88. However, if the defendant has fully complied with the terms of the community service, the court shall order the release of the defendant unless detained for some other offense.

The privilege of rendering community service in lieu of service in jail shall be availed of only once.

Here, the trial court's decision was promulgated on June 29, 2016 while Republic Act No. 11362 took effect on August 8, 2019 after due publication. On the other hand, the Guidelines for the Community Service Act under A.M. No. 20-06-14-SC took effect on November 2, 2020.

While generally, laws are prospective in application,[3] penal laws which are favorable to the person guilty of the felony who is not a habitual criminal, as in this case, are given retroactive effect following Article 22 of the Revised Penal Code. It goes without saying, therefore, that the benefits granted under Republic Act No. 11362, being more favorable to Peña, and despite having been enacted three years after the promulgation of judgment in his case, can still be availed by him.

In this regard, A.M. No. 20-06-14-SC or the Guidelines in the Imposition of Community Service as a Penalty in Lieu of Imprisonment, decrees:

Thus, all judges concerned shall observe these guidelines in allowing rendition of community service in lieu of imprisonment in the service of penalty for arresto menor or arresto mayor:

1. After promulgation of judgment or order where the imposable penalty for the crime or offense committed by the accused is arresto menor or arresto mayor, it shall be the court's duty to inform the accused of and announce in open court his/her options within 15 calendar days from date of promulgation, to wit: (a) file an appeal; (2) apply for probation as provided by law; or (3) apply that the penalty be served by rendering community service in the place where the crime was committed. It shall further be explained to the accused that if he/she chooses to appeal the conviction, such resort thereto bars any application for community service or probation.

Due to the unavailability of the foregoing options to Peña before the trial court, the Regional Trial Court, and the Court of Appeals, he may, at the first instance before this Court, validly apply for the conversion of his sentence from imprisonment to community service.

It must be emphasized, however, that the imposition of the penalty of community service is still within the discretion of the court and should not be taken as an unbridled license to commit minor offenses. It is merely a privilege since the offender cannot choose it over imprisonment as a matter of right. Further, in requiring community service, the court shall consider the welfare of the society and the reasonable probability that the person sentenced shall not violate the law while rendering the service. With the enactment of Republic Act No. 11362, apart from the law's objective to improve public work participation and promote public service, it is expected that the State's policy to promote restorative justice and to decongest jails will be achieved.[4]","ACCORDINGLY, the motion is GRANTED. The Court's Resolution dated February 8, 2023 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION.

1.
In Criminal Case No. 14-09861, petitioner Teddy Peña y Romero is found GUILTY of slight physical injuries under Article 266(1) of the Revised Penal Code and is ORDERED to render COMMUNITY SERVICE IN LIEU OF IMPRISONMENT.

"G.R. No. 260013 [Formerly UDK 17349], August 13, 2024","E.L. SANIEL CONSTRUCTION, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON AUDIT AND PNOC SHIPPING AND TRANSPORT CORPORATION (PSTC), RESPONDENTS.","PSTC is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Philippine National Oil Company (PNOC) engaged in the business of marine transport of petroleum products.

E.L. Saniel was awarded the project for the rehabilitation of PSTC Limay Office (Rehabilitation Project) for the bid price of PHP 4,980,000.00 on January 5, 2010.[5] Thereafter, the project for the design and construction of slope protection/riprap at PSTC's Limay Office (Riprap Project) was also awarded to E.L. Saniel for the bid price of PHP 1,350,000.00 on September 22, 2010.[6] Both projects have been fully paid by PSTC.

According to E.L. Saniel, it discovered during the construction of the projects that the terrain where the Limay Office was situated posed a particular condition requiring additional constructions. Thus, E.L. Saniel performed additional works resulting in the following additional billings:
Particulars
Amount
Riprap Project
Riprap and additional works[7]


  PHP 2,412,736.42
Rehabilitation Project
Construction of sewer and drain canal[8]
69,608.97
Revise trusses and roofing[9]
257,829.00
Backfilling and compaction[10]
222,768.00
Total	
PHP 2,962,942.39
E.L. Saniels' billings for the additional works have remained unpaid by PSTC.

On February 7, 2013, the PNOC Board of Directors issued Resolution No. 2111, Series of 2013,[11] which shortened the corporate life of PSTC until March 15, 2013, due to the continuous deterioration of its financial condition. The dissolution, which was approved by the President of the Philippines in a Memorandum dated July 5, 2013, resulted in the cessation of PSTC's business operations.[12]

Accordingly, the PNOC Board created the PSTC Disposal Committee to handle the disposition of PSTC's assets. However, in a letter dated May 19, 2014, Atty. Joseph John M. Literal, Chairman of the PSTC Disposal Committee, directed all suppliers and contractors to file their respective petitions for money claim with the COA for settlement pursuant to Rule VIII, Section 2 of the 2009 COA Revised Rules of Procedure.[13]

On June 23, 2014, PSTC issued a Certification of Non-Payment[14] in the total gross invoice amount of PHP 26,928.88, certifying that only the aforementioned amount is reflected as the outstanding liability in the records and books of PSTC.

Consequently, E.L. Saniel filed a Petition to be Paid Money Claims[15] on November 5, 2014, to demand for the payment of the unpaid principal amount of PHP 2,962,942.39, plus PHP 1,066,659.26 in terms of accrued interest, and attorney's fees of PHP 500,000.00.","Before the Court is a Petition for Certiorari[1] under Rule 64 in relation to Rule 65 of the Rules of Court filed by petitioner E.L. Saniel Construction (E.L. Saniel) assailing Decision No. 2016-397[2] dated December 27, 2016, Resolution No. 2020-294[3] dated January 31, 2020, and the Notice of Finality of Decision No. 2021-072[4] dated May 19, 2021, all issued by the Commission on Audit (COA). The COA denied E.L. Saniel's money claim in the amount of PHP 4,529,601.65 representing failed accountabilities of respondent PNOC Shipping and Transport Corporation (PSTC) for the additional construction works rendered by E.L. Saniel.","The Court resolves to deny the Petition.

Timeliness of the Petition

Respondent COA contends that the assailed COA Resolution No. 2020-294 was received by E.L. Saniel on September 8, 2020, as evidenced by a Philippine Postal Corporation Registry Return Receipt;[39] thus, the filing of the present Petition for Certiorari on September 20, 2021, was made beyond the 30-day reglementary period under the Revised Rules of Court.

On the other hand, E.L. Saniel claims that it received a copy of the assailed COA Decision denying its money claim on May 9, 2017.[40] Thus, it had 30 days or until June 8, 2017, to file the petition for certiorari, unless a motion for reconsideration is filed which shall interrupt the prescriptive period. On May 11, 2017, E.L. Saniel filed a Motion for Reconsideration.

In its Comment dated June 23, 2022,[41] E.L. Saniel admits that while the assailed COA Resolution denying its Motion for Reconsideration may have been sent to its counsel on September 8, 2020, it learned of its issuance and obtained a copy thereof only on September 2, 2021.[42] Accordingly, petitioner avers that it had 28 remaining days, or until September 30, 2021, within which to file the instant Petition for Certiorari; hence, it timely filed the present Petition on September 20, 2021.

The Court finds for respondents.

Under Rule 64, Section 3 of the Rules of Court, a party may file a petition for certiorari within 30 days from notice of the COA's judgment. The filing of a motion for reconsideration or new trial shall interrupt the period. However, when the motion is denied, the aggrieved party may file the petition within the remaining period, which shall not be less than five days in any event, reckoned from the notice of denial. Accordingly, the petition must show when the notice of the assailed judgment or order or resolution was received, when the motion for reconsideration was filed, and when the notice of its denial was received. The rationale for requiring a complete statement of material dates is to determine whether the petition is timely filed.[43]

The Court notes that E.L. Saniel was served a copy of COA Decision No. 2016-397 on January 30, 2017, as shown in the Commission Secretariat Certificate of Service No. 397-16 dated December 27, 2016.[44] What is more, E.L. Saniel failed to state the material date showing when it received the Decision No. 2016-397 in its Motion for Reconsideration.

On this score alone, the COA could have denied E.L. Saniel's Motion for Reconsideration for being filed out of time. Nonetheless, the COA ruled on the merits of E.L. Saniel's money claims in the interest of substantial justice.

Be that as it may, E.L. Saniel had five days from the notice of denial of the motion for reconsideration to file the petition for certiorari.

Case law instructs that when a litigant is represented by counsel, notice to counsel serves as notice to the litigant. In the absence of a notice of withdrawal or substitution of counsel, the court will rightly assume that the counsel of record continues to represent their client. This is so because notice to counsel is an effective notice to the client, while notice to the client and not their counsel is not notice in law. Receipt of notice by the counsel of record is the reckoning point of the reglementary period.[45]

From the preceding discussion, it is clear that E.L. Saniel's period to file the present Petition commenced to run upon receipt by its counsel of record, Atty. Ernesto P. Tabao (Atty. Tabao), of COA Resolution No. 2020-294.[46]

While it is true that the administration of justice and access to legal remedies were severely disrupted by the lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Court finds no compelling reason to justify relaxation of the rules in the present case. The Philippine Postal Corporation Registry Return Receipt shows that Atty. Tabao indeed received the assailed Resolution on September 8, 2020.[47] With only five days remaining to file pursuant to Rule 64, Section 3 of the Rules of Court, the Petition for Certiorari was belatedly filed on September 20, 2021, and thus, the assailed COA issuances had already attained finality.

Verily, E.L. Saniel overlooked procedural rules more than once. The procedural lapses alone warrant the outright dismissal of the instant Petition.

The Court has always tried to maintain a healthy balance between the strict enforcement of procedural laws and the guarantee that every litigant be given the full opportunity for the just and proper disposition of his cause.[48] It must be stressed, however, that ""invocation of substantial justice is not a magical incantation that will automatically compel this Court to suspend procedural rules.""[49]

In view of the foregoing, it is well to point out that with E.L. Saniel's delayed filing of the Petition for Certiorari, the challenged COA Decision has already attained finality and may no longer be reviewed by this Court. When a decision becomes final and executory, the court loses jurisdiction over the case and not even an appellate court will have the power to review the said judgment.[50]

Payment on the basis of quantum meruit

The dismissal of the Petition is likewise warranted for lack of merit.","WHEREFORE, the Petition is DISMISSED. Decision No. 2016-397 dated December 27, 2016, Resolution No. 2020-294 dated January 31, 2020, and the Notice of Finality of Decision dated May 19, 2021, of the Commission on Audit are AFFIRMED."
"G.R. No. 264071, August 13, 2024","BEN D. LADILAD, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS AND MARY GRACE BANDOY, RESPONDENTS.","On June 27, 2013, Mary Grace Bandoy (Bandoy), a graft researcher, filed a Complaint[4] against Ben Ladilad (Ladilad) and Luciana M. Villanueva (Villanueva) for violation of the Omnibus Election Code (OEC), in particular, Section 261, paragraphs (g)[5] and (h),[6] in relation to COMELEC Resolution No. 9581,[7] before the COMELEC, for acts allegedly committed during the election period of the 2013 national, local, and Administrative Region of Muslim Mindanao elections.

Ladilad was the President of Benguet State University (BSU). Villanueva, on the other hand, was the Vice President for Research and Extension (OVPRE), also of BSU.

In such capacities, Ladilad and Villanueva were accused to have caused the illegal detail and transfer within BSU offices of Gretchen Gaye Ablaza (Ablaza) and Frances Noelle[*] Escalera (Escalera), both BSU employees. Ablaza was transferred from the Graduate School Office (GSO) to the OVPRE on March 25, 2013, through a letter dated March 8, 2013, penned by Villanueva, and approved by Ladilad:[8]
March 8, 2013","This is a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 64, in relation to Rule 65, with a prayer for Temporary Restraining Order, Status Quo Ante Order, and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction,[1] assailing the Resolution[2] of the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) En Banc, and the Resolution[3] of the Office of the Regional Election Director-Cordillera Administrative Region (ORED-CAR), in E.O. Case No. 13-261.","The petition is granted.

Ladilad asserts that there was no transfer effected on Escalera and Ablaza,[27] and alleges that the COMELEC incurred inordinate delay in resolving the case.[28]

On the latter issue, Ladilad claims that his right to the speedy disposition of the case was violated when it took the COMELEC almost eight years, or until September 27, 2022, to resolve his and Villanueva's Motion for Reconsideration[29] of the Resolution dated November 4, 2014. Ladilad decries that he was disadvantaged by the uncertainties of the potential criminal case that may be filed against him; that he was forced to live under a cloud of anxiety and suspicion; that his reputation as a former BSU President was besmirched; and that the delay in the resolution of his Motion for Reconsideration impaired his defense in the event of a full-blown trial.[30]

Pursuant to the guidelines laid out in Cagang v. Sandiganbayan (Cagang)[31] in the assessment of the existence of inordinate delays, particularly on how the right against such delays is invoked, We declare that the resolution of this case before the COMELEC was inordinately delayed.

We focus on the third and fifth guidelines as laid out in Cagang:
Third, courts must first determine which party carries the burden of proof. If the right is invoked within the given time periods contained in current Supreme Court resolutions and circulars, and the time periods that will be promulgated by the Office of the Ombudsman, the defense has the burden of proving that the right was justifiably invoked. If the delay occurs beyond the given time period and the right is invoked, the prosecution has the burden of justifying the delay.

If the defense has the burden of proof, it must prove[,] first, whether the case is motivated by malice or clearly only politically motivated and is attended by utter lack of evidence, and second, that the defense did not contribute to the delay.

Once the burden of proof shifts to the prosecution, the prosecution must prove first, that it followed the prescribed procedure in the conduct of preliminary investigation and in the prosecution of the case; second, that the complexity of the issues and the volume of evidence made the delay inevitable; and third, that no prejudice was suffered by the accused as a result of the delay.","ACCORDINGLY, the instant Petition is GRANTED.

"G.R. No. 214042, August 13, 2024","FOUNDATION FOR ECONOMIC FREEDOM, PETITIONER, VS. ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION AND NATIONAL RENEWABLE ENERGY BOARD, RESPONDENTS.","On July 6, 2011, the Energy Regulatory Commission received Department of Energy resolutions approving the final installation targets for each renewable energy technology: 250 megawatts (MW) for biomass, 10 MW for ocean, 250 MW for run-of-river hydropower, 50 MW for solar, and 200 MW for wind.[50] Subsequently, the Energy Regulatory Commission issued the FIT Rules and FIT Guidelines, and provisionally approved the initial FITs.

On April 30, 2014, the Department of Energy issued a certification increasing the installation target for solar renewable energy from 50 MW to 500 MW.[51] When the National Renewable Energy Board received the certification, it endorsed it to the Energy Regulatory Commission.[52] Subsequently, the Energy Regulatory Commission issued Resolution No. 6, Series of 2015, approving a decrease in the solar renewable energy FIT from the 2012 rate of PHP 9.68/kWh to PHP 8.69/kWh.[53]

On Apri1 7, 2015, the Department of Energy issued another certification, this time increasing the installation target for wind renewable energy from 200 MW to 400 MW. The increase was meant to boost power supply.[54] The National Renewable Energy Board again referred the matter to the Energy Regulatory Commission,[55] and the Energy Regulatory Commission issued a Decision that adjusted the wind renewable energy FIT rate from PHP 8.53/kWh to PHP 7.40/kWh.[56] This was also approved in the Energy Regulatory Commission's Resolution No. 14, Series of 2015.[57]

The National Transmission Corporation then subsequently filed applications to collect the FIT Allowance for 2016 to 2018.[58] On December 22, 2015, it filed an application to increase the 2016 FIT Allowance rate to PHP 0.1025/kWh.[59] In its Order dated February 16, 2016, the Energy Regulatory Commission provisionally approved a FIT Allowance rate of PHP 0.1240/kWh.[60]

On December 1, 2016, the National Transmission Corporation requested for provisional authority to collect PHP 0.2291/kWh as the 2017 FIT Allowance rate. The Energy Regulatory Commission approved a FIT Allowance rate of PHP 0.1830/kWh.[61] The following year, on August 30, 2017, the National Transmission Corporation requested for provisional authority to collect PHP 0.2932/kWh as the 2018 FIT Allowance rate.[62]

On December 7, 2017, AGHAM and Palmones filed a Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition with Application for a Temporary Restraining Order and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction[63] with this Court, seeking to nullify:

That on or about the 1st day of February 2012 at about 3:25 [p.m.], more or less, at Cansojong, Talisay City, Cebu, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused, conniving and confederating together and mutually helping each other, armed with a firearm of unknown caliber, with deliberate intent; with intent to kill and with treachery and evident premeditation, did then and there attack, assault and shot one Virginia Lim Sesbreño, with the said firearm, thereby inflicting upon him gunshot wounds, which directly caused his instantaneous death.[6]
Cariño pleaded not guilty to all the charges, while Mahilum remained at large.[7] Trial on the merits then ensued.[8]

The prosecution presented the following witnesses: (1) Rafael Chan, Jr. (Chan), Barangay Councilor of Barangay San Roque, Talisay City;[9] (2) Atty. Raul H. Sesbreño, one of the victim's husband; and (3) Senior Police Officer I Mikie Espina (SPO1 Espina), Philippine National Police (PNP) member assigned at Talisay City Police Office.[10] It also offered the following documentary evidence: (1) Chan's Joint Affidavit;[11] (2) Sesbreno's Complaint Affidavit; (3) death certificates of the victims; (4) SPO1 Espina's Joint Affidavit; (5) Physical Identification Report (trajectory report); (6) pictures of the Isuzu DMAX, the accused, and the five witnesses; and (7) Firearm Identification Report.[12]

The testimonies of Chan and SPO1 Espina narrate the following version of events:

At around 3:25 p.m. on February 1, 2012, Chan and barangay tanods Crisanto Labajo (Labajo), Mario Constantino (Constantino), and Glicerio Icot (Icot)[13] were travelling along SRP Road in Talisay City onboard the barangay multicab driven by Bartolome Teo (Teo). Chan was seated with Labajo on the left side behind the driver, near the multicab's step board; Constantino and Icot were seated on the right side.[14]

At the corner of SRP Road and Rabaya Street, while the multicab temporarily stopped at the rightmost lane beside the sidewalk due to a red light traffic signal, Chan, Labajo, Constantino, Icot, and Teo heard around eight successive gunshots from behind.[15]

Chan turned to his right side and saw two men riding in tandem without helmets on a motorcycle without a plate number.[16] The motorcycle was coming towards their direction. Chan also saw a white Isuzu DMAX pick-up truck about 20 feet away behind them.[17]

Afterwards, the motorcycle stopped behind the barangay multicab, swerved to the sidewalk, and sped off. Chan saw the backrider change the magazine of his gun as their eyes met.[18]

Chan, Labajo, Constantino, Icot, and Teo tried to chase the motorcycle but they retracted upon reaching Evergreen Memorial Park, past Barangay Laray, when the backrider pointed the gun at them. The motorcycle was heading towards Cebu City.[19]

Subsequently, Chan, Labajo, Constantino, Icot, and Teo went back to the junction of SRP Road and Rabaya Street where they found the victims onboard the Isuzu DMAX pick-up.[20] The victims were identified as Ypanto, Sesbreno, and Young (the driver).[21]

Recovered from the crime scene were six empty shells of caliber .45, one deformed slug, one caliber .40 pistol, two magazines, and a cellular phone. The police officers then turned over the six empty shells and slug to the crime laboratory for examination.[22] The ballistic examination revealed that these were from the same firearm.[23]

On February 2, 2012, SPO1 Espina invited Chan and his co-passengers to the police station.[24] Icot gave a description of the backrider for cartographic sketching because Chan arrived late.[25] Then, SPO1 Espina and PO2 Stephen Sefuesca showed the cartographic sketch, together with more than a hundred pictures of arrested persons from the police station's rogue gallery, to Chan and his co-passengers.[26] They pointed to Cariño (Picture No. 11) as the backrider and Mahilum (Picture No. 26) as the driver of the motorcycle.[27]

Chan identified Cariño as the backrider who was only about a meter away from the back of their multicab when he saw him.[28] Cariño was wearing a hat and a pair of Ray Ban sun glasses at that time.[29] Chan said he could not forget Cariño's face because he was a shooter and member of Aqua City Gun Club, same with the victim Young. The next time he saw Cariño was when he was arrested on February 26, 2012 in a separate case for illegal possession of firearm. Cariño was confined then at the hospital for treatment and it was hard to identify him because his face was bloated.[30]

For his part, Cariño denied being involved in the shooting incident that happened in the afternoon of February 1, 2012. He said he did not know who shot the victims and testified that in the early morning of the said date, he was in his house attending to his children. When his mother arrived in the afternoon, Cariño went out to buy cigarette and loitered along the street in Barangay Lagtang, Talisay City. After, he met Mark Ferdinand Bas (Bas), barangay captain of Barangay Lagtang, Talisay City, who just passed by and invited him for a drinking session at 6:00 p.m. Cariño then went to the house of Bas where they had a drinking spree until evening. Cariño said he just learned that he has a case for multiple murder when he was already imprisoned. He also claimed that he does not know Chan and the barangay tanods.[31]

Meanwhile, Bas testified that he was the barangay captain of Barangay Lagtang, Talisay City. He said Cariño is his childhood friend and third degree cousin of his mother. In the afternoon of February 1, 2012, Bas was in his house in corner Krishanta and Lagtang roads, Talisay City when he saw Cariño sitting and smoking in the store at the lower ground of their house at 1:00 p.m. An hour later, Bas and his group started their drinking session; Cariño joined them until past 7:00 p.m.[32]

In a Joint Decision[33] dated November 17, 2017, the Branch 17, Regional Trial Court of Cebu City found Cariño guilty only of homicide instead of murder. It gave credence to the testimony of Chan who identified Cariño as the assailant[34] and disbelieved his denial and alibi for his failure to show the physical impossibility of being at the crime scene.[35] However, it held that the qualifying circumstances of treachery and evident premeditation were not sufficiently proven by the prosecution.[36] The dispositive portion reads:
IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, the Court finds the accused Tommy Cariño a.k.a. Tommy Echavez, GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of three (3) counts of homicide as defined and penalized under Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code and hereby sentences to suffer the indeterminate sentence of EIGHT (8) YEARS of prision mayor as minimum up to FIFTEEN (15) YEARS of reclusion temporal as maximum for each case. He is also ordered to pay the respective heirs of the late Malon Joshua Young, the late Solidad Ypanto and the late Virginia Sesbreño the amounts of FIFTY THOUSAND PESOS (P[HP] 50,000.00) as civil indemnity, another FIFTY THOUSAND PESOS (P[HP] 50,000.00) as moral damages and TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PESOS (P[HP] 25,000.00) as temperate damages for each count.

As regards co-accused Junefer Mahilum who is still at large, these cases are ordered archived.

SO ORDERED.[37] (Emphasis in the original)
Cariño appealed, arguing that the trial court gravely erred in relying on Chan's testimony and in convicting him based on circumstantial evidence.[38] He averred that Chan's testimony was riddled with material inconsistencies[39] and his identification is highly dubious.[40]","An out-of-court identification made through a cartographic sketch based on the description of another person is unreliable, uncertain, impaired with suggestiveness, and insufficient to rebut the presumption of the innocence of the accused.

This Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] seeks to reverse and set aside the: Court of Appeals' (1) Decision,[2] which affirmed with modification the Joint Decision[3] of Branch 17, Regional Trial Court, Cebu City convicting petitioner Tommy Cariño (Cariño) of three counts of homicide; and (2) Resolution[4] denying Cariño's motion for reconsideration.","The Court noted the susceptibility of the human memory to various forms of influence in Nuñez:
The frailty of human memory is a scientific fact. The danger of inordinate reliance on human memory in criminal proceedings, where conviction results in the possible deprivation of liberty, property, and even life, is equally established.
Human memory does not record events like a video recorder. In the first place, human memory is more selective than a video camera. The sensory environment contains a vast amount of information, but the memory process perceives and accurately records only a very small percentage of that information. Second, because the act of remembering is reconstructive, akin to putting puzzle pieces together, human memory can change in dramatic and unexpected ways because of the passage of time or subsequent events, such as exposure to ""postevent"" information like conversations with other witnesses or media reports. Third, memory can also be altered through the reconstruction process. Questioning a witness about what he or she perceived and requiring the witness to reconstruct the experience can cause the witness' memory to change by unconsciously blending the actual fragments of memory of the event with information provided during the memory retrieval process.[85]
The danger of Chan's susceptibility to suggestion is compounded when we consider the swiftness of the incident, which could have provided him a limited opportunity to observe the backrider's facial appearance sufficient to retain it in memory. Chan testified that the backrider was holding a firearm with one hand and changing the magazine with the other; the replaced magazine fell on the backrider's lap and eventually to the ground. His attention on the firearm and the magazine inevitably reduced his ability to pay attention to peripheral details such as the facial features of the backrider. Considering the very brief time when the motorcycle was right behind the multicab as the motorcycle driver was in a haste to escape, Chan's opportunity to observe the face of the backrider was certainly diminished when his attention was centered on the firearm and the magazine.

In Nuñez, the Court discussed the relevance of the presence or absence of a weapon to a witness' attention and consequently to identification accuracy:
A focal point of psychological studies has been the effect of the presence of a weapon on a witness' attentiveness. Since the 1970s, it has been hypothesized that the presence of a weapon captures a witness' attention, thereby reducing his or her attentiveness to other details such as the perpetrator's facial and other identifying features. Research on this has involved an enactment model involving two (2) groups: first, an enactment with a gun; and second, an enactment of the same incident using an implement like a pencil or a syringe as substitute for an actual gun. Both groups are then asked to identify the culprit in a lineup. Results reveal a statistically significant difference in the accuracy of eyewitness identification between the two (2) groups:
[T]he influence of [a weapon focus] variable on an eyewitness's performance can only be estimated post hoc. Yet the data here do offer a rather strong statement: To not consider a weapon's effect on eyewitness performance is to ignore relevant information. The weapon effect does reliably occur, particularly in crimes of short duration in which a threatening weapon is visible. Identification accuracy and feature accuracy of eyewitnesses are likely to be affected, although, as previous research has noted. . . there is not necessarily a concordance between the two.[86]
The foregoing circumstances weaken the reliability of the in-court identification made by Chan, especially when we consider that Chan briefly saw the petitioner at the time of the incident. Two weeks later, Chan saw petitioner again, but he allegedly could not recognize him because his face was bloated. The third time that Chan saw petitioner was during the trial. As held by this Court:
[W]here a photograph has been identified as that of the guilty party, any subsequent corporeal identification of that person may be based not upon the witness's recollection of the features of the guilty party, but upon his recollection of the photograph. Thus, although a witness who is asked to attempt a corporeal identification of a person whose photograph he previously identified may say, ""That's the man that did it,"" what he may actually mean is, ""That's the man whose photograph I identified.""

....

A recognition of this psychological phenomenon leads logically to the conclusion that where a witness has made a photographic identification of a person, his subsequent corporeal identification of that same person is somewhat impaired in value, and its accuracy must be evaluated in light of the fact that he first saw a photograph.[87] (Emphasis in the original)
The Court is unconvinced that the perpetrator's identity was established beyond reasonable doubt. We cannot say that Chan identified the perpetrator based on his own observation and not upon suggestive influences. We are not convinced beyond reasonable doubt that he accurately acquired and retained sufficient information to have properly identified the assailant.

Inasmuch as Chan's identification is tainted with unreliability, corroborative evidence should have been adduced by the prosecution. Curiously, it did not present barangay tanod Icot, who supposedly provided the description for the cartographer. The prosecution rather presented SPO1 Espina, whose testimony was shorn of details and significantly differed with Chan on whether the motorcycle driver was indeed identified in the mug shots. With this unexplained glaring inconsistency, which could have been clarified with the testimony of the other companions of Chan, the Court is not persuaded that the prosecution presented the required quantum of proof.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is GRANTED.

"G.R. No. 270257, August 12, 2024","XXX270257,* PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES AND AAA, RESPONDENTS.","The instant case stemmed from an Information[6] for violation of Section 5(i) of Republic Act No. 9262 filed against XXX270257. The accusatory portion of the Information reads:
That on the 1st day of January 2017, and on the days prior and subsequent thereto, at xxxxxxxxxxx, Municipality of xxxxxxxxxxx, Province of Benguet, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, without any justifiable cause or reason whatsoever, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and knowingly subject his wife [AAA] and their children to mental and emotional anguish, public ridicule or humiliation by abandoning them and living with another woman thereby denying them marital love and affection, and financial support to their children despite being financially capable, to the damage and prejudice of said [AAA] and their children.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[7]
Upon arraignment, XXX270257 entered a plea of ""Not Guilty"" to the charge.

Trial on the merits ensued.","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] filed by petitioner XXX270257 assailing the Decision[2] dated February 8, 2023, and the Resolution[3] dated September 6, 2023, of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-­G.R. CR No. 45361. The CA affirmed the Judgment[4] dated July 3, 2020, of xxxxxxxxxxx, Regional Trial Court (RTC), xxxxxxxxxxx, Benguet in Criminal Case No. 18-CR-12464 that found XXX270257 guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Psychological Violence defined and penalized under Section 5(i)[5] of Republic Act No. 9262, otherwise known as the Anti-Violence against Women and their Children Act.","The Court resolves to deny the petition for failure to sufficiently show that the CA committed reversible error in rendering its assailed dispositions as to warrant the exercise of the Court's discretionary appellate jurisdiction.

The Court adopts the finding of the CA that all the elements of Psychological Violence under Section 5(i) or Republic Act No. 9262 are present. In Dinamling v. People,[28] the Court held:
From the aforequoted Section 5(i), in relation to other sections of RA No. 9262, the elements of the crime are derived as follows:

(1) The offended party is a woman and/or her child or children;

(2) The woman is either the wife or former wife of the offender, or is a woman with whom the offender has or had a sexual or dating relationship, or is a woman with whom such offender has a common child. As for the woman's child or children, they may be legitimate or illegitimate, or living within or without the family abode;

(3) The offender causes on the woman and/or child mental or emotional anguish; and

(4) The anguish is caused through acts of public ridicule or humiliation, repeated verbal and emotional abuse, denial of financial support or custody of minor children or access to the children or similar such acts or omissions.[29] (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)
It is undisputed that AAA is a woman married to XXX270257. Thus, what the Court must resolve now is the presence of the third and fourth elements, i.e., the offender causing on the woman and/or child mental or emotional anguish through acts of public ridicule or humiliation, repeated verbal and emotional abuse, denial of financial support or custody of minor children, or access to the children, or similar such acts or omissions.

Regarding the third element, XXX270257 argues that the element of psychological violence was not proven. He contends that the prosecution failed to effectively adduce a psychological report when it did not stipulate, during the trial, on its presentation as evidence and the psychologist as a witness; the RTC nonetheless favorably considered both.[30]

The argument utterly lacks merit.

In Labrador v. People,[31] the Court categorically held that a psychological evaluation is not indispensable in proving the infliction of psychological violence under Republic Act No. 9262. Thus:
Moreover, petitioner harps on the absence of a psychological evaluation from an expert witness which would show that CCC had indeed suffered mentally and emotionally as a result of his actions. Ineluctably, the absence of such evaluation is inconsequential since it is not an element of the crime of Violation of Section 5 (h) of R.A. No. 9262. Nowhere in the law can such a requirement be inferred. In any event, the law does not actually require proof that the victim became psychologically ill due to the psychological violence done by her abuser.[32] (Citation omitted)
Further, the Court has also categorically held that the victim's testimony in court suffices to prove the element of emotional anguish. In Araza v. People,[33] the Court declared that therein petitioner committed psychological violence upon his wife by committing marital infidelity, which caused the latter emotional anguish and mental suffering. The Court elucidated in this wise:
Psychological violence is an indispensable element of violation of Section 5(i) of R.A. No. 9262. Equally essential is the element of emotional anguish and mental suffering, which are personal to the complainant. Psychological violence is the means employed by the perpetrator, while emotional anguish or mental suffering are the effects caused to or the damage sustained by the offended party. The law does not require proof that the victim became psychologically ill due to the psychological violence done by her abuser. Rather, the law only requires emotional anguish and mental suffering to be proven. To establish emotional anguish or mental suffering, jurisprudence only requires that the testimony of the victim to be presented in court, as such experiences are personal to this party.[34] (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)
Here, the testimony of AAA detailing her emotional ordeal suffices to prove the element of emotional anguish. XXX270257's insistence that a psychological report is indispensable to the prosecution of the violation of Section 5(i) of Republic Act No. 9262 has no basis in law and jurisprudence. As such, it cannot serve to acquit him.

Anent the fourth element of psychological violence, it must be noted that XXX270257 merely denied committing the acts charged. Specifically, he denied cohabiting and having an affair with CCC, who, according to him was a mere acquaintance. He also alleged that he did not have a child with CCC and that he only stood as the father of her child because he wanted a son.[35]

The Court is not persuaded.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is hereby DENIED. The Decision dated February 8, 2023, and Resolution dated September 6, 2023, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 45361 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION:

LIM AND HSIEH HSIU-PING, RESPONDENTS.","Respondent Hsieh Hsiu-Ping (Hsieh) was the registered owner of Unit 8-B in Goldland Tower Condominium covered by Condominium Certificate of Title (CCT) No. 4007-R. However, Hsieh became delinquent in the payment of the association dues amounting to PHP 4,362,208.14. Thus, on August 10, 2011, Goldland caused the annotation of its lien on CCT No. 4007-R.[4]

Meanwhile, due to Hsieh's nonpayment of real estate taxes, the City Treasurer of San Juan City levied the condominium unit. The property was then sold in a public auction to the highest bidder, respondent Edward Lim (Lim), as per Certificate of Sale dated February 9, 2012. There being no redemption made by Hsieh within the one year period provided under the Local Government Code, the City of San Juan issued a deed of conveyance in favor of Lim.[5]

Later, on February 14, 2012, Goldland filed a complaint for foreclosure against Lim and Hsieh with Branch 160, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Pasig City (San Juan City Station).[6] Goldland demanded for payment of the principal sum of PHP 4,362,208.14, representing the unpaid association dues, and in case of default, for foreclosure of the encumbrance over the condominium unit in accordance with Rule 68 of the Rules of Court.[7]

In his Answer, Lim countered that Goldland had no cause of action to judicially foreclose on his newly acquired property because the tax lien, which was already foreclosed by the City of San Juan, was superior to any other encumbrance, including Goldland's supposed lien for the association dues. If at all, the right of Goldland was limited to redeeming the property, which it failed to do. Hence, the issuance of the absolute deed of conveyance in favor of Lim. For this reason, Lim insisted that he bought the condominium unit free from any encumbrance or third party claim. In any case, Goldland cannot recover the assessed amount as it failed to send him an extrajudicial demand, making the filing of the action premature.[8]

During pre-trial, the parties agreed that there was no factual issue to be tried. The only issue for resolution, and for which the parties filed their respective memoranda,[9] was the legal effect of the City Treasurer's public auction on Goldland's lien.

On January 28, 2020, the RTC issued a Decision[10] in favor of Goldland and declared that Hsieh's unpaid association dues are considered a prior lien on the property. This lien annotated on CCT No. 4007-R, attaches to the property itself regardless of the change in ownership. Consequently, Lim is deemed to have assumed the obligation to pay the unpaid assessment when he bought the unit during the tax delinquency sale. The trial court ordered Lim to pay Goldland the assessed amount of PHP 4,362,208.14 plus 6% interests per annum and ""[in] case of failure to pay the aforesaid amount within the time prescribed, let the subject property be sold through public auction and for the disposition of the proceeds thereof in accordance with law.""[11] Because the parties had previously agreed to limit the issue of the case to the effect of the tax sale on Goldland's lien, the RTC no longer ruled on whether demand had duly been made on Lim.[12]

The RTC denied Lim's motion for reconsideration.[13]

In his appeal before the CA, Lim argued that: (1) the foreclosure sale had the effect of extinguishing Goldland's lien on the property, it being ""subordinate"" to the local government's real property tax lien; and (2) Goldland's action was premature for lack of prior demand.[14]

The CA initially affirmed the RTC's Decision. In its Decision dated September 21, 2022,[15] the CA ruled that the unpaid association dues constitute a valid lien on the condominium unit in Goldland's favor. As such, Lim was obligated to settle the unpaid amount after he acquired the property. The CA further declared that the public sale conducted by the local government unit (LGU) only discharged the delinquent taxes, interests, and sale expenses, but Goldland's registered lien remains. Finally, the CA held that the parties can no longer raise the issue of demand as this was not one of the issues contained in the Pre-trial Order which could be considered for resolution.[16]

Acting on Lim's motion for reconsideration, the CA issued the assailed Amended Decision[17] dated March 1, 2023, setting aside its initial Decision.","The line between related legal principles is a fine one, often blurred by every nuanced interpretation it has assumed over time. In this case, the Court sees it fit to untangle the concepts of demand and notice as we probe into the main issue on whether an action for judicial foreclosure can prosper despite the absence of an extrajudicial demand.

Before this Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] filed by petitioner Goldland Tower Condominium Corporation (Goldland), assailing the Amended Decision[2] and the Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA), which dismissed Goldland's action for judicial foreclosure due to the absence of a demand.","The Petition has merit.
 
Demand and notice are two distinct concepts in law
 

In contractual obligations, the determination of whether demand has been made is one of fact.[25] On the other hand, the question of whether a demand is necessary prior to the filing of petitioner's action for judicial foreclosure remains a legal one, considering Goldland's main contention that the assessment annotated as a lien on CCT No. 4007-R is in the nature of a constructive notice which serves as sufficient demand upon respondent Lim.

Petitioner's argument failed to distinguish between the two legal concepts of demand and notice.

Notice, whether actual or constructive, play into a party's allegations of knowledge and good faith. In this jurisdiction, the law affords protection to a party who is acting in good faith.[26] For instance, persons who possess personal property in good faith, i.e., without actual knowledge of a flaw in title or mode of acquisition,[27] hold the equivalent of title over such property until it is legally recovered by the true owner.[28] They may even become the legitimate owners of the personal property after an uninterrupted possession of four years, if they maintain the same lack of knowledge during the entire period.[29]

When constructive, notice creates a legal presumption of knowledge,[30] and thus becomes a matter wholly dictated by law and against which no person can continue to plead ignorance.[31] In such instances, the purpose of the notice is to afford special protection to certain legal systems, or to maintain the feasibility and integrity of specific legal fictions, like the Torrens system of land registration,[32] or the publication of laws in lieu of giving personal notice to every citizen.[33]

On the other hand, demand is always a question of fact[34] because the creditor must prove its due service to and receipt by the debtor for it to have legal effect.[35] Although the law may require the demand to be in a certain form or contain specific matters before it produces the desired legal consequences,[36] there is no such thing as a constructive demand, unlike in notice. Demand, being dependent on its service and receipt, may thus only bind the person who actually receives it. Simply put, notice determines the presence or absence of knowledge and good faith, while demand decides on whether a party has defaulted on a demandable obligation.[37]

Applying these principles, the Court finds it inaccurate for petitioner to insist that the demand on the original owner respondent Hsieh was also a demand on respondent Lim.[38] Petitioner's erroneous view about demand is hinged on Lim's constructive notice, which is an entirely distinct legal concept, as explained above. The constructive notice on the part of Lim is merely a consequence of the annotation of the lien on CCT No. 4007-R, resulting to his assumption of respondent Hsieh's obligation to settle the unpaid dues. This is ordained by Section 59 of Presidential Decree No. 1529 or The Property Registration Decree,[39] which states:
Sec. 59. Carry Over of Encumbrances. — If, at the time of any transfer, subsisting encumbrances or annotations appear in the registration book, they shall be carried over and stated in the new certificate or certificates, except so far as they may be simultaneously released or discharged.
However, we must again stress that the matter on constructive notice has nothing to do and should not be confused with petitioner's demand upon respondent Lim or the lack thereof, for the payment of the assessed amount before respondent Lim is considered in default.

In any case, there can be no question as to the validity and preference of petitioner's lien since it was annotated on CCT No. 4007-R earlier than the tax lien. Precisely, in BIR v. TICO Insurance Co., Inc.,[40] the Court ruled that the prior annotation of a lien creates a preference given that the registration is the operative act that binds the real property. When respondent Lim purchased the condominium unit during the tax sale, it is understood that any lien previously annotated on the CCT subsists. The prior lien is deemed incorporated into and must be carried over to the new title because it is a right in rem that directly subjects the property itself to the fulfillment of the obligation. Truly, petitioner's right cannot be impaired because its lien is inseparable from the property upon which it is imposed, and it subsists notwithstanding a change in ownership of the unit.[41]

Notably, even in its Amended Decision, the CA affirmed the RTC's finding that: (1) petitioner's unpaid assessments against respondent Hsieh, which was duly annotated on CCT No. 4007-R in accordance with the Condominium Act[42] and petitioner's master deed and declaration of restrictions,[43] is a valid lien on the property such that it was deemed assumed by respondent Lim when he acquired it during the public auction;[44] and that (2) Goldland's prior lien survived the LGU's tax sale to cover the delinquent real property taxes.[45]

The only issue on which the CA changed its ruling was on the aspect of demand. In the Amended Decision, the CA ruled that petitioner's complaint failed to allege prior demand on respondent Lim. It then concluded that demand was necessary for a valid foreclosure of the encumbrance on respondent Lim's condominium unit, which then renders petitioner's action for judicial foreclosure dismissible for being premature.[46] The Court rules otherwise.
 
Petitioner's suit against respondent Lim constituted sufficient demand contemplated by law
 

While we agree that petitioner had to demand payment of the unpaid assessments from Lim, we reject the CA's finding that demand was not made, and that petitioner's filing of a complaint was premature.

To recall, petitioner's complaint for judicial foreclosure prayed for the following alternative reliefs: (1) that respondent Lim be ordered to pay the principal sum of PHP 4,362,208.14, and (2) should respondent Lim fail to pay, that the condominium unit be sold at public auction and the proceeds be applied in accordance with Rule 68 of the Rules of Court.[47]","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is GRANTED. The Amended Decision dated March 1, 2023 and the Resolution dated June 21, 2023 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 117711 are REVERSED.

The Court of Appeals' Decision dated September 21, 2022, affirming the Decision dated January 28, 2020 of Branch 160, Regional Trial Court, Pasig City in SCA Case No. 4118 is REINSTATED."
"G.R. No. 266538, August 12, 2024","SPS. ROGELIO D. MINA AND SOTERA S. MINA, PETITIONERS, VS. HENRY B. AQUENDE, RESPONDENT.","In their Complaint,[4] Spouses Mina alleged that they were the registered owners of a house and lot (subject property) located at Lot 11, Pearl Heights, Victoria Homes Subdivision, Tunasan, Muntinlupa City and covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 182759.[5] The declared assessed value of the subject property was PHP 34,430.00.[6]

On November 8, 2017, Muntinlupa City Treasurer Anastacio L. Miñoza (Miñoza) sold the subject property at public auction allegedly for nonpayment of real property taxes. Henry B. Aquende (Aquende) won the auction for a bid price of PHP 58,000.00.

Consequently, Miñoza issued a Certificate of Sale in favor of Aquende. This was subsequently annotated on TCT No. 182759. Likewise, an undated Final Deed of Sale/Conveyance got executed in his favor.[7]

On January 10, 2022, Spouses Mina filed with the Metropolitan Trial Court, Muntinlupa City a complaint for Annulment of Tax Sale titled Sps. Rogelio D. Mina and Sotera S. Mina v. Henry B. Aquende and docketed as Civil Case No. MeTC-7454. The case got raffled to Branch 114.[8]

Spouses Mina then claimed that the tax auction sale was invalid for failure to comply with the legal requirements under Local Government Code, Sections 254, 258, and 260 specifically: (1) the Notice of Tax Delinquency[9] dated August 14, 2017 and Warrant of Levy[10] dated September 7, 2017 were served by registered mail to No. 6 Diwani Street, San Francisco Del Monte, Quezon City, a boarding house where Rogelio resided way back in 1992. The mailed copies of these notices were returned to the City Treasurer with notation: RTS-Moved Out; (2) these notices should have been mailed and served by the City Treasurer to the occupant of the subject property if the delinquent owner could not be located; (3) the twin notices[11] both dated February 28, 2018 of the auction sale and the one-year redemption period of the subject property were also mailed and served at the same address; (4) the notice was not published as required by law nor was the tax delinquency annotated on the subject property's tax declaration; (5) the subject property valued at PHP 900,000.00 was merely auctioned off at PHP 58,000.00, equivalent only to 6% of the zonal value of the subject property; (6) the auction sale was simply unconscionable and amounted to taking of subject property without due process; (7) Aquende never took ownership of the subject property despite the lapse of the alleged redemption period; and (8) as they were forced to litigate to vindicate their rights, they are entitled to attorney's fees of PHP 150,000.00.[12]

In his Answer[13] dated June 29, 2020, Aquende riposted that he did not have any personal knowledge about the allegations in the complaint but maintained that the auction sale was above board. He also alleged that on November 6, 2019, there was a Petition for Application of a New Certificate of Title Upon Expiration of Redemption Period under Property Decree, Section 75 pending between the same parties before the Regional Trial Court, Muntinlupa City. That case involved the same parties and the same issue pertaining to the validity of the tax auction sale. Further, Spouses Mina failed to make an actual deposit with the court of the amount for which the real property was sold, together with interest of 2% per month from the date of sale to the time of the institution of the action. At any rate, he bought the subject property in good faith and for value. Finally, he was also forced to litigate, hence, was entitled to damages, attorney's fees, and cost of suit.

Under Reply[14] dated July 15, 2022, Spouses Mina averred that there was no litis pendentia as they were not aware of any petition filed by Aquende. In any event, the remedies sought in the two cases were different. More, the deposit required under Section 267 of the Local Government Code need not be paid at the same time the complaint is filed. By experience, payment of any deposit required for the filing of the complaint should be contained in a duly issued order of the court. Even then, they were willing to make the deposit once ordered by the trial court. In fact, the Office of the Clerk of Court of the Metropolitan Trial Court, Muntinlupa City advised them that it was better to wait for the order of the Branch 114 to deposit the amount required.","This Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] seeks to reverse the twin dispositions of Branch 207, Regional Trial Court, Muntinlupa City in Civil Case No. 22-091, thus:

1)
Decision[2] dated March 20, 2023 affirming the dismissal by Branch 114, Metropolitan Trial Court, Muntinlupa City of Spouses Rogelio D. Mina (Rogelio) and Sotera S. Mina's (Sotera; collectively referred to as Spouses Mina) Complaint for Annulment of Tax Sale for failure to deposit the amount required under Section 267 of Republic Act No. 7160 (Local Government Code) at the same time the complaint was filed; and


2)
Order[3] dated April 4, 2023 denying Spouses Minas Motion for Reconsideration.","We reverse.

To begin with, the Court takes cognizance of the present Petition for Review on Certiorari directed against the rulings of the Regional Trial Court on a pure question of law as heretofore stated. The resolution of this question rests solely on what the law or the rules provide on the given set of circumstances. To put it in another perspective, the Court ought to look only into whether the trial court correctly applied the law or rules in the case. It does not require the examination of evidence. As held in Daswani v. Banco De Oro,[23] when only questions of law remain to be addressed, a direct recourse to the Court under this remedy is the proper mode of appeal.

The deposit required under Local Government Code, Section 267 is mandatory and jurisdictional but need not be simultaneously paid with the filing of the action
Section 267 of the Local Government Code explicitly ordains that no court shall entertain any action assailing the validity of any auction sale without the taxpayer satisfying the deposit requirement, viz.:

Section 267. Action Assailing Validity of Tax Sale. - No court shall entertain any action assailing the validity of any sale at public auction of real property or rights therein under this Title until the taxpayer shall have deposited with the court the amount for which the real property was sold, together with interest of two percent (2%) per month from the date of sale to the time of the institution of the action. The amount so deposited shall be paid to the purchaser at the auction sale if the deed is declared invalid but it shall be returned to the depositor if the action fails.

Neither shall any court declare a sale at public auction invalid by reason of irregularities or informalities in the proceedings unless the substantive rights of the delinquent owner of the real property or the person having legal interest therein have been impaired. (Emphasis supplied)

In Province of Bataan v. Hon. Remigio M. Escalada, Jr.,[24] the Court decreed that the deposit requirement under Section 267 of the Local Government Code is mandatory and jurisdictional. It nonetheless clarified that the failure to deposit does not necessarily result in the dismissal of the case, albeit for a different reason:

In National Housing Authority v. Iloilo City,[25] We explained that the requirement for a deposit is jurisdictional[26] and is an ""ingenious legal device to guarantee the satisfaction of the tax delinquency, with the local government unit keeping the payment on the bid price no matter the final outcome of the suit to nullify the tax sale.""[27] But the requirement only applies to initiatory actions[28] and does not apply to the government or any of its agencies, especially when it is acknowledged to be tax-exempt.[29] And in the case of Beaumont Holdings Corp. v. Reyes,[30] We clarified that the requirement for a deposit is jurisdictional . . .[31]

The taxpayer in Section 267 refers to the '""declarant of the property in a real property tax declaration, who is generally its owner, and his declared property is realty tax delinquent.""[32] The taxpayer in this case is undoubtedly Sunrise whose properties were levied because of its failure to pay the real property taxes due to the Province. Sunrise filed a petition for injunction against petitioners to declare the auction sale void on the ground that it was not duly notified of it.[33] Sunrise did not refute having any outstanding liability for real property taxes. It is also not part of the government or a tax- exempt entity. That being the case, Sunrise should have made a deposit pursuant to Section 267. Sunrise, however, stated in no uncertain terms that it was unable to deposit the amount required under Section 267 in its June 29, 2005 Notice of Dismissal. It even declared that the RTC did not have jurisdiction over the case.[34]

Nonetheless, Sunrise's failure to pay the deposit required under Section 267 shall not result in the dismissal of the case before Us. The RTC refused to require the payment of the deposit from Sunrise. The dismissal of the case will certainly prejudice Gawtee and Cameron...","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated March 20, 2023 and Order dated April 4, 2023 of Branch 207, Regional Trial Court, Muntinlupa City, in Civil Case No. 22-091, as well as the Order dated August 1, 2022 and Resolution dated September 12, 2022 of Branch 114, Metropolitan Trial Court, Muntinlupa City in Civil Case No. MeTC-7454 are all REVERSED.

The case is REMANDED to Branch 114, Metropolitan Trial Court, Muntinlupa City, which is directed to cause the computation of the total amount of deposit to be paid by petitioners Spouses Rogelio D. Mina and Sotera S. Mina under Section 267 of the Local Government Code and order them to deposit the amount with the court within a reasonable time.

"G.R. No. 248974, August 07, 2024","HEIRS OF TEODORO TULAUAN, REPRESENTED BY TITO TULAUAN, PETITIONERS, VS. MANUEL MATEO;* MAGDALENA MATEO LORENZO, ASSISTED BY HER HUSBAND, JAIME LORENZO; CAMELIA** HOMES, OWNED AND OPERATED BY COMMUNITIES ISABELA, INC.; AND REGISTER OF DEEDS OF ILAGAN AND SANTIAGO, RESPONDENTS.","The present case stemmed from a Complaint[9] for Annulment of Documents, Reconveyance, and Damages, filed by the petitioners Heirs of Teodoro Tulauan (Heirs of Tulauan) against respondents Manuel Mateo (Manuel), Magdalena, Camella Homes, and the Registry of Deeds of Santiago City (collectively, respondents) before the RTC.

The Complaint alleged that Teodoro Tulauan (Teodoro) was the absolute and registered owner of a parcel of land covered by Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. P-1080 and situated in Santiago, Isabel a (now Santiago City) (subject property). Sometime in the early 1950s, Teodoro left Santiago City and resided in Tuguegarao, Cagayan, for security reasons after receiving death threats from armed men. Nonetheless, he continued to visit his property from time to time and still paid the real estate taxes due thereon.[10]

On May 4, 1953, the Registry of Deeds of Isabela (Registry of Deeds) issued Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-4232 covering the subject property in the name of Manuel. The subject property was thereafter divided into four lots — Lot Nos. 938-A-1 to 938-A-4. Thereafter, Lot No. 938-A-4 was further subdivided into four more lots — Lot Nos. 938-A-4-A to 938-A-4-D. Manuel then sold Lot Nos. 938-A-1, 938-A-2, 938-A-3, 938-A-4-B, and 938-A-4-C to different buyers.[11]

On May 30, 1979, the Registry of Deeds issued TCT No. 118858 covering Lot No. 938-A-4-D in the name of Magdalena.[12]

Later on, one of Teodoro's children discovered that the subject property was being developed by a real estate developer. The Heirs of Tulauan inquired with the Registry of Deeds and they discovered that the title to the subject property under the name of Teodoro was cancelled by virtue of a deed of conveyance, the copy of which was burned when the Registry of Deeds was gutted by fire. Upon verification with the Bureau of Lands, the Heirs further found out that sometime in 1981, a certain Lope H. Soriano presented a deed of conveyance transferring the title to the subject property under his name.[13]

The foregoing antecedents prompted the Heirs of Tulauan, represented by Tito Tulauan, to file the Complaint before the RTC averring that the titles under the names of Manuel and Magdalena were fraudulently issued because the transfers of the ownership of the subject property were based on inexistent documents.[14] They prayed, among others, that Magdalena and Mateo's titles and tax declarations covering the subject property be annulled for being fraudulently issued; that the deed of conveyance allegedly executed on May 4, 1953, be declared null and void; that the Heirs of Tulauan be declared as the true owners of the subject property; and that the corresponding title and tax declaration thereto be issued under their names.[15]

In their respective Answers with Counterclaims, Magdalena[16] and the owner of Camella Homes, CII,[17] both moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the Heirs of Tulauan have no cause of action against them. In addition, Magdalena raised the defense that the action for reconveyance was already barred by prescription and/or laches.[18]","This resolves the two separate Motions for Reconsideration filed by respondents Communities Isabela, Inc. (CII)[1] and Magdalena Mateo Lorenzo (Magdalena), assisted by her husband, Jaime Lorenzo,[2] both of which seek for reconsideration and setting aside of the Court's Decision[3] promulgated on September 7, 2022. The Court granted the Petition for Review on Certiorari[4] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court and reversed and set aside the Decision[5] dated July 31, 2018, and the Resolution[6] dated July 15, 2019, of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 107610 which, in turn, upheld the Orders dated September 16, 2014,[7] and June 20, 2016,[8] in Civil Case No. 36-3826 rendered by Branch 36, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Santiago City.","In the Decision[35] dated September 7, 2022, the Court granted the petition as follows:

Let the records of this case be REMANDED to Branch 36, Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Santiago City. The RTC is ordered to continue with the proceedings and decide the case with dispatch.

SO ORDERED.[36]

The Court ruled that while the Heirs of Tulauan used the word ""fraudulent"" in their complaint, a reading of the allegations therein as a whole would show that the action was indeed based on a purported inexistent document. Corollary thereto, following Article 1410 of the New Civil Code which states that the action or defense for the declaration of the inexistence of a contract does not prescribe, the action for reconveyance filed by the Heirs of Tulauan is imprescriptible.[37]

Accordingly, the Court ordered that the case be remanded to the RTC for the conduct of a full-blown trial to settle the factual issues of laches and whether the respondents are innocent purchasers for value and in good faith. Ultimately, these will determine whether an action for reconveyance is still available as a remedy to the Heirs of Tulauan.[38]","FOR THESE REASONS, the Motions for Reconsideration filed by respondents Communities Isabela, Inc. and Magdalena Mateo Lorenzo are GRANTED. The Decision of the Court promulgated on September 7, 2022, is hereby SET ASIDE. The Decision dated July 31, 2018, and the Resolution dated July 15, 2019, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 107610 are AFFIRMED. The complaint for reconveyance filed by petitioners Heirs of Teodoro Tulauan in Civil Case No. 36-3826 filed before Branch 36, Regional Trial Court, Santiago City is DISMISSED for failure to state a cause of action."

Petitioner St. Catherine Realty Corporation (St. Catherine) is a domestic corporation engaged in subdivision development such as the Dizon Estate Subdivision (DES) in San Agustin, San Fernando, Pampanga.

[Angeles] had worked for St. Catherine from March 2001 until June 1, 2010. Throughout his employment; he worked as a driver, marketing staff and later as surveyor/purchaser. On the other hand, [Pacheco] had worked for St. Catherine from August 2006 until June 1, 2010 as landscaper.

Sometime in March 2010, [Angeles and Pacheco] were instructed to canvass the prices of various ornamental plants for landscaping to be planted in DES.

St. Catherine alleged that [Angeles and Pacheco] misrepresented the prices of the ornamental plants which were canvassed at Danbel's Garden as follows:

","Time and again, the Court has explained that under the Labor Code, loss of trust and confidence is a justified cause for dismissal of employees occupying positions of trust and confidence, whether managerial or rank-and-file.

At the outset, it should be emphasized that as a rule, this Court is not a trier of facts and this applies with greater force in labor cases. Hence, factual findings of quasi-judicial bodies like the NLRC, particularly when they coincide with those of the Labor Arbiter and if supported by substantial evidence, are accorded respect and even finality by this Court. But where the findings of the NLRC and the Labor Arbiter are contradictory, as in the present case where the LA and the CA are one in ruling that respondent was illegally dismissed from work while the NLRC ruled otherwise, this Court may delve into the records and examine for itself the questioned findings.[50] (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)

Here, the LA dismissed the complaint[51] of Angeles and Pacheco, while the NLRC ruled that both were illegally dismissed. On the other hand, the CA held that Pacheco was illegally dismissed, while Angeles was not. The labor tribunals and the CA having reached contradictory conclusions, the Court may delve into the records and resolve the factual issues itself.

Under Article 297(c) of the Labor Code,[52] fraud or willful breach by employees of the trust reposed in them by the employer or the latter's duly authorized representative is a just cause for termination of employment. As previously explained by the Court:

The language of Article 282(c) of the Labor Code states that the loss of trust and confidence must be based on willful breach of the trust reposed in the employee by [the] employer. Such breach is willful if it is done intentionally, knowingly, and purposely, without justifiable excuse, as distinguished from an act done carelessly, thoughtlessly, heedlessly[,] or inadvertently. Moreover, it must be based on substantial evidence and not on the employer's whims or caprices or suspicions otherwise, the employee would eternally remain at the mercy of the employer. Loss of confidence must not be indiscriminately used as a shield by the employer against a claim that the dismissal of an employee was arbitrary. And, in order to constitute a just cause for dismissal, the act complained of must be work-related and shows that the employee concerned is unfit to continue working for the employer. In addition, loss of confidence as a just cause for termination of employment is premised on the fact that the employee concerned holds a position of responsibility, trust and confidence or that the employee concerned is entrusted with confidence with respect to delicate matters, such as the handling or care and protection of the property and assets of the employer. The betrayal of this trust is the essence of the offense for which an employee is penalized.[53] (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)

In Colegio San Agustin-Bacolod v. Montaño,[54] the Court laid out the requisites for a valid dismissal on the ground of loss of trust and confidence:

First, the employee must be holding a position of trust; and second, the employer shall sufficiently establish the employee's act that would justify loss of trust and confidence. The act must be characterized as real wherein the facts that brought about the act were clearly established, and that the employee committed the same without any justifiable reason.[55] (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)

To justify a dismissal on this ground, the loss of trust and confidence must be substantial and ""attended by a degree of severity"":

Loss of trust and confidence may be a just cause for termination of employment only upon proof that: (1) the dismissed employee occupied a position of trust and confidence; and (2) the dismissed employee committed ""an act justifying the loss of trust and confidence.""

. . . .

For loss of trust and confidence to be a valid ground for dismissal, it must be substantial, and not arbitrary, whimsical, capricious, and concocted. It demands that a degree of severity attends the employee's breach of trust.[56] (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)

Only substantial evidence is required to justify termination on the ground of loss of trust and confidence.[57] However, the precise degree differs depending on whether the employee occupying a position of trust and confidence is a managerial employee or a rank-and-file employee:

As to the second requisite that there must be an act that would justify the loss of trust and confidence, however, the degree of proof required in proving loss of trust and confidence differs between a managerial employee and a [rank-and-file] employee. The Court already made the distinction between managerial employees and rank-and-file personnel insofar as terminating them on the basis of loss of trust and confidence; thus:

. . . [W]ith respect to rank-and-file personnel, loss of trust and confidence, as ground for valid dismissal, requires proof of involvement in the alleged events in question, and that mere uncorroborated assertions and accusations by the employer will not be sufficient[.][58] (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)

It bears stressing that ""it is not the job title but the nature of the work that the employee is duty-bound to perform which is material in determining whether [the employee] holds a position where greater trust is placed by the employer and from whom greater fidelity to duty is concomitantly expected.""[59]

St. Catherine et al. do not claim that Angeles is a managerial employee. Consequently, his dismissal on the ground of loss of trust and confidence can only be upheld if he was a fiduciary rank-and-file employee.

Fiduciary rank-and-file employees include cashiers, auditors, property custodians, or those who, in the normal exercise of their functions, regularly handle significant amounts of money or property.[60] Whether an employee occupied a position of trust and confidence or was routinely charged with the care and custody of the employer’s money or property, is a factual question.[61]

The LA did not make any factual determination that Angeles regularly handled significant amounts of St. Catherine's money or property, while the CA merely stated that it was ""convinced that [Angeles] occupied a position of trust and confidence,"" as he had ""full control of the information on the prices of goods that he submits to the administration of St. Catherine,"" and ""full control of the means, manner, and terms of the purchase of goods for and in behalf of St. Catherine.""[62] Based on the foregoing, the CA concluded that it is ""safe to assume that [Angeles] is entrusted with confidence with respect to delicate matters such as the handling and protection of the property and assets of St. Catherine.""[63] Absent substantial evidence that Angeles regularly handled significant amounts of St. Catherine's money or property, this assumption is not sufficient to qualify Angeles as a fiduciary rank-and-file employee who could be dismissed for loss of trust and confidence.

Even assuming that Angeles was a fiduciary rank-and-file employee, St. Catherine et al. failed to prove that he committed willful and deliberate acts leading to a loss of trust and confidence.

In an illegal dismissal case, the onus probandi rests on the employer to prove that its dismissal of an employee was for a valid cause.[64]","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition[89] in G.R.

ROXIN GRACE BATOMALAQUE, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.*","In Criminal Case No. II-14654, Batomalaque was charged with violating Section 4(e) in relation to Sections 3(e), 3(h), 4(a), and 10(c) of Republic Act No. 9208. The accusatory portion of the November 13, 2009 Information filed against her reads as follows:

That sometime from the month of November 2008 up to August 2009 in the City of xxxxx, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court; the said accused, by means of deceit and taking advantage of the complaining witness AAA on account of the latter's minority, poverty and lack of education, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously RECRUIT said child or minor for the purpose of sexual exploitation through cyber sexes; that is, by employing him as a cyber-sex model at the accused's residence inside the latter's locked room wherein the child or minor was made to entertain customers over the internet by posing in front of the web camera equipped with video-conferencing facilities; during which the complainant-child or minor was instructed by the accused [to] perform lascivious and sexual acts alone or with other cyber-sex models his age; such as going naked, masturbating, showing his private parts and such other similar sexual exploitations and pornographic performances as the accused and his internet customers would direct him to do after which the accused would give the minor or child [PHP] 100.00; to the damage and prejudice of one AAA.

The offense is qualified by the circumstance of minority of the complaining witness AAA – he being a six-year old child at the time of the commission of the foregoing offense.

Contrary to law.[4]

On the other hand, in Criminal Case No. II-14655, Batomalaque was accused of violating Section 4(e) in relation to Sections 3(a), 3(h), 4(a), and 10(a) of Republic Act No. 9208, in further relation to Section 5(a) of Republic Act No. 8369,[5] and Sections 5 and 7 of Republic Act No. 7610,[6] otherwise known as the Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act. The accusatory portion of the Information states:

That sometime from the month of November 2008 up to August 2009 in the City of xxxxx, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court; the said accused, by means of deceit and taking advantage of the complaining witness BBB on account of the latter's poverty and lack of education, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously RECRUIT said girl for the purpose of sexual exploitation through cyber sexes; that is, by employing her as a cyber-sex model at the accused's residence inside the latter's locked room wherein the said girl was made to entertain customers over the internet by posing in front of the web camera equipped with video­-conferencing facilities; during which the complainant-female was instructed by the accused [to] perform lascivious and sexual acts alone or with other cyber-sex model her age; such as going naked, licking her partner's penis, having sexual intercourse with another female cyber-sex model by licking the latter's vagina, showing her private parts and such other similar sexual exploitations and pornographic performances as the accused and her internet customers would direct her to do after which the accused would give her [PHP] 100.00 to [PHP] 150.00; to the damage and prejudice of one BBB.

Contrary to law.[7] (Emphasis supplied)

Upon arraignment, Batomalaque, assisted by counsel, pleaded not guilty to both charges. Thus, pre-trial ensued, followed by trial on the merits.","This is an appeal under Rule 122 of the Rules of Court, as amended, seeking to reverse and set aside the Decision[1] dated December 14, 2022 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 01628-MIN.
The assailed issuance affirmed the Decision[2] dated April 30, 2015 issued by Branch x of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of xxxxx City, Lanao del Norte in Criminal Case Nos. II-14654 and 11-14655 which, in turn, found accused-appellant Roxin Grace Batomalaque (Batomalaque) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 4(e) of Republic Act No. 9208,[3] otherwise known as the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003.","The appeal is utterly bereft of merit.

I.

The term ""Trafficking in Persons"" is defined under Section 3(a) of Republic Act No. 9208 as follows:

(a) Trafficking in Persons – refers to the recruitment, obtaining, hiring, providing, offering, transportation, transfer, maintaining, harboring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders by means of threat or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the person, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person for the purpose of exploitation which includes at a minimum, the exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs.

The recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of a child for the purpose of exploitation shall also be considered as ""trafficking in persons"" even if it does not involve any of the means set forth in the preceding paragraph.

Based on the foregoing, the elements of Trafficking in Persons are:

(1)
The act of ""recruitment, transportation, transfer or harbouring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders.""
 	 
(2)
The means used which include ""threat or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the person, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another;"" and
 	 
(3)
The purpose of trafficking is exploitation which includes ""exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs.""[38] (Emphasis supplied.)
In the instant case, the RTC and the CA found that the crimes committed by Batomalaque both fall under Sections 4(a) and (e) of Republic Act No. 9208, viz.:

Section 4. Acts of Trafficking in Persons. – It shall be unlawful for any person, natural or juridical, to commit any of the following acts:

(a) To recruit, transport, transfer; harbor, provide, or receive a person by any means, including those done under the pretext of domestic or overseas employment or training or apprenticeship, for the purpose of prostitution, pornography, sexual exploitation, forced labor, slavery, involuntary servitude or debt bondage;

. . . .

(e) To maintain or hire a person to engage in prostitution or pornography;

In addition, under Section 6(a)[39] of the same law, the crime of Trafficking in Persons becomes qualified when the trafficked person is a child. Tangentially, Section 3(b) of this statute defines a child as ""a person below 18 years of age or one who is over 18 but is unable to fully take care of or protect himself/herself from abuse, neglect, cruelty, exploitation, or discrimination because of a physical or mental disability or condition.""[40]

Guided by the foregoing precepts, the Court puts its imprimatur on the findings and conclusions of the courts a quo, albeit with a modification as to the nomenclature of the crime that was committed against BBB.

The Court notes that while the Information in Criminal Case No. II-14654 alleges the minority of AAA as a qualifying circumstance, nothing of that sort was alleged in the Information in Criminal Case No. II-14655. Thus, while the prosecution was able to establish all of the elements of the crime of Qualified Trafficking in Persons under Republic Act No. 9208 in Criminal Case No. II-14654, Batomalaque could only be found guilty of the crime of Trafficking in Persons in Criminal Case No. II-14655.

After all, Batomalaque is still entitled to the constitutional right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusations against her as stated in the Informations to which she was asked to plead prior to trial.[41] She can be convicted only of the crime alleged in the Informations and duly proven during the trial.[42] Accordingly, even though BBB's minority was proven in the course of the trial, Batomalaque cannot be convicted of the crime of Qualified Trafficking in Persons in Criminal Case No. II-14655 because the former's minority was not alleged in the Information in that case.

At any rate, the evidence adduced by the prosecution demonstrate that as against AAA, Batomalaque (a) committed the acts of recruiting, maintaining, and hiring AAA; (b) by means of taking advantage of his vulnerability as a minor; and (c) for the purpose of prostitution or pornography.

On other hand, as against BBB, Batomalaque (a) committed the acts of recruiting, maintaining, and hiring BBB; (b) by means of taking advantage of her vulnerability as a person, or giving payments or benefits to achieve her consent to perform the debased acts in front of an online audience; and (c) for the purpose of prostitution or pornography.","ACCORDINGLY, the appeal is DENIED for lack of merit. The Decision dated December 14, 2022 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 01628-MIN is hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION as follows:

"G.R. No. 219598, August 07, 2024","ARNOLD D. NAVALES, REY C. CHAVEZ, ROSINDO J. ALMONTE, AND ALFONSO E. LAID, PETITIONERS, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","Before the Court are two consolidated Petitions for Review on Certiorari[2] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the Decision[3] and Resolution[4] of the Sandiganbayan that found petitioners Arnold D. Navales (Navales), Rey C. Chavez (Chavez), Rosindo J. Almonte (Almonte), Alfonso E. Laid (Laid), [and William V. Guillen (Guillen)] guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019, as amended.

Petitioners were officials of the Davao City Water District (DCWD). Navales, Chavez, [and Guillen] were members of the Pre-Bidding and Awards Committee-B (PBAC-B), while Almonte was the Division Manager of the DCWD Engineering and Construction Department and Laid, the Assistant General Manager for Administration.[5]

In Board Resolution No. 97-248 adopted on November 21, 1997, the DCWD Board of Directors approved the recommendation of DCWD General Manager Wilfredo A. Carbonquillo (Carbonquillo) to undertake the Cabantian Water Supply System Project with a budgetary cost of PHP 33,200,000.00 and to directly negotiate its initial well drilling phase with Hydrock Wells, Inc. (Hydrock). The phase consisted of the simultaneous drilling of two wells located in Cabantian (the VES 15 Project) and Communal (the VES 21 Project), estimated at PHP 4,000,000.00 each.[6]

On November 24, 1997, the president of Hydrock informed Carbonquillo of the company's willingness to undertake the projects pending DCWD approval to test the availability of water by drilling a pilot hole for electric logging since its crew and equipment were idle.[7]

In Resolution No. 05-97 dated November 25, 1997, the PBAC-B dispensed with the advertisement requirement in the conduct of bidding and instead, invited accredited well drillers to participate in the VES 15 and VES 21 Projects. Of the four drillers invited, only three responded: Hydrock, AMG Drilling, and Drill Mechanics Incorporated (Drill Mechanics). AMG Drilling and Drill Mechanics, however, requested that the projects be implemented on a later date due to unavailability of equipment.[8]

In Resolution No. 06-97 approved on December 16, 1997, the PBAC-B endorsed the matter to the head of the DCWD for approval, with a recommendation to award the project to Hydrock by negotiated contract, taking into account the company's track record, efficiency, and quoted price in relation to the urgency and importance of the projects.[9]

In Resolution No. 98-27 dated February 13, 1998, the DCWD board approved the PBAC-B recommendation and awarded the VES 15 Project at PHP 2,807,100.00 and the VES 21 Project at PHP 2,349,180.00 to Hydrock. On even date, Carbonquillo issued a notice of award to Hydrock.[10]

In 2005, several complaints were filed against petitioners for the following offenses: (1) violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019, for the alleged non-observance of the proper bidding procedure in the VES 21 Project; (2) violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019, for the alleged non-observance of the proper bidding procedure in the VES 15 Project; (3) grave misconduct, grave abuse of authority, dishonesty, and gross negligence in implementing the VES 21 Project; and (3) grave misconduct, grave abuse of authority, dishonesty, and gross negligence in implementing the VES 15 Project.[11] In essence, petitioners were charged with dispensing with the competitive public bidding required by Presidential Decree No. 1594.[12] These complaints proceeded independently.

With respect to the VES 21 Project, an Amended Information was filed against petitioners and several other DCWD officials for violating Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019. The accusatory portion reads:

That sometime in November 1997 to February 1999, and immediately prior or subsequent thereto, in the City of Davao, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the accused WILFREDO A. CARBONILLO, a high-ranking public official, being then the General Manager A, WILFRED GACUS YAMSON and ALFONSO EDEN LAID, both being then Assistant General Manager A, WILLIAM VELASCO GUILLEN, REY CAÑETE CHAVEZ and ARNOLD DOMINGO NAVALES, all being then Department Managers C, and ROSINDO JAPAY ALMONTE, Division Manager C, all of the Davao City Water District (DCWD), Davao City, while in the performance of their official administrative functions as such, conspiring and confederating with each other, acting with evident bad faith and manifest partiality, and committing the offense in relation to office, did then and there willfully, unlawfully[,] and criminally give unwarranted benefit, preference[,] and advantage to Hydrock Wells, Inc., represented by Mr. Roberto Puentespina, with business address at Bolcan Street, Agdao, Davao City by awarding thereto through a negotiated contract, the Well Drilling Project at VES 21 (Alegre's Property) in Communal, Davao City, amounting to Two Million Two Hundred Forty Four Thousand Seven Hundred Eighty Pesos (P2,244,780.00) by passing PBAC-B Resolution No. 05-97 which dispensed with the requirements of open competitive public bidding through advertisement in newspapers of general circulation and by issuing PBAC-B Resolution No. 06-97, to make it appear thereon that there was a failure of public bidding, and to recommend that the project be pursued through a negotiated contract with Hydrock Wells, Incorporated, when all the accused knew fully well that there was no legal basis to declare a failed bidding and to resort to a negotiated contract because no actual open competitive public bidding as required by law was conducted in connection with the awarding of this project, whereupon no three qualified bidders have tendered their respective bids, and that, Hydrock Wells, Inc., was already allowed to start working on the project as early as December 29, 1997 which date was way before the actual completion of the documentation and awarding of the said project considering that the Notice of Award was issued only on February 13, 1998 and the Notice to Proceed was issued only on February 20, 1998.","A violation by public officers of procurement laws will not ipso facto lead to their conviction under Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019, or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act. To convict them for violating the special penal law, the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt not only defects in the procurement, but also all the elements of the crime.[1]","This Court is not unmindful of its rulings that the dismissal of an administrative case does not bar the filing of a criminal prosecution for the same or similar acts subject of the administrative complaint and that the disposition in one case does not inevitably govern the resolution of the other case/s and vice versa. The applicability of these rulings, however, must be distinguished in the present cases.

[. . . .]

[. . .] Unlike in the cases cited by the prosecution, this Court's Decision in the administrative case against Nicolas ruled squarely that he was not guilty of bad faith and gross neglect of duty, which constitute an essential element of the crime under Section 3(e) of [Republic Act] No. 3019. Under the doctrine of stare decisis, such ruling should be applied to the criminal case for violation of Section 3(e), [Republic Act] No. 3019, the facts and evidence being substantially the same.

In fine, absent the element of evident bad faith and gross neglect of duty, not to mention want of proof of manifest partiality on the part of Nicolas, the graft case against him cannot prosper.[35] (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)

In G.R. Nos. 194763–64, the Court categorically ruled that petitioners cannot be held administratively liable for grave misconduct in the absence of evidence establishing corruption, bad faith, or complicity with Carbonquillo in the procurement of the VES 21 Project. Thus:

In the present case, there is no evidence on record that will convincingly establish that petitioners Yamson, Chavez, Navales and Guillen, who were the members of the PBAC-B, conspired or colluded with Carbonquillo and/or each other or with the invited well drillers, or that they schemed to rig the procurement process to favor Hydrock. There is also no evidence showing that they benefited from the procurement of the project. Much less was there any evidence that petitioners Almonte and Laid, who were not even members of the PBAC-B, conspired with their co-petitioners and the other bidding participants in the procurement of the VES 21 Project. Collusion may be determined from the collective acts or omissions of the PBAC-B members and/or contractors before, during and after the bidding process, and the respondents, as complainants, have the burden to prove such collusion by clear and convincing evidence. And while Hydrock eventually benefited from the VES 21 Project, having been awarded the contract, it should be stressed that Hydrock was not the only well driller invited by the PBAC-B to participate in the project. AMG and DMI were likewise invited by the PBAC-B, only that it was Hydrock's acceptable proposal and track record that clinched the award. And even then, the role of the PBAC-B was only to recommend the award of the project to Hydrock. It is DCWD, through its Board of Directors, that has the authority to approve, and has in fact, ultimately decided to award the contract to Hydrock.

What is unmistakable here is that it was Carbonquillo who was predisposed to award the project to Hydrock sans the benefit of any bidding. This is clear from the tenor of his letter to DCWD's Board of Directors already recommending direct negotiation of the project to Hydrock. But to the credit of both the PBAC-B and the Board of Directors, Carbonquillo's recommendation was disregarded, and the PBAC-B proceeded to invite other accredited well drillers. And absent any evidence establishing corruption, bad faith or complicity with Carbonquillo, the petitioners cannot be held liable for grave misconduct or any other grave offense classified under the Civil Service Law. At most, it is only petitioners Yamson, Chavez, Navales and Guillen, as members of the PBAC-B, who should be held individually accountable for their failure to strictly comply with the procurement procedure laid down in [Presidential Decree] No. 1594 and its [Implementing Rules and Regulations], which constitutes Simple Neglect of Duty.[36] (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)

An application of Pahkiat leads to the conclusion that the Court's findings in G.R. Nos. 194763–64 on the administrative charge of grave misconduct may affect the outcome of the present criminal case of graft, the facts and evidence between the two being substantially the same. Specifically, in view of the express ruling that petitioners are not guilty of corruption, bad faith, or gross neglect of duty, which are essential elements of the crime under Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019, the criminal case against them will not prosper in the absence of evidence to establish their guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

That said, even if the Court makes its own assessment of the facts and records of the present criminal case, independent of the findings in the administrative case, petitioners must still be acquitted. Contrary to the conclusions of the Sandiganbayan, the prosecution failed to establish the concurrence of all the essential elements of the crime charged against petitioners. Hence, while the findings of fact of the Sandiganbayan as a trial court are accorded weight and respect, the Court shall not hesitate to reverse the conclusions which are based on a misappreciation of facts relative to applicable law and jurisprudence.[37]

To recall, petitioners were charged with violating Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019, which states:

SECTION 3. Corrupt practices of public officers. — In addition to acts or omissions of public officers already penalized by existing law, the following shall constitute corrupt practices of any public officer and are hereby declared to be unlawful:

. . . .

(e) Causing any undue injury to any party, including the Government, or giving any private party any unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of his official administrative or judicial functions through manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence. This provision shall apply to officers and employees of offices or government corporations charged with the grant of licenses or permits or other concessions.

Accordingly, jurisprudence has laid down the following elements to sustain a conviction under Section 3(e): (1) the offender is a public officer discharging official, administrative, or judicial functions; (2) he or she acted with manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence; and (3) in the discharge of functions, his or her action caused undue injury to any party, including the government, or gave any unwarranted benefits, advantage, or preference.[38]

A judicious review of the case records reveals that while the prosecution established the first element, namely, that petitioners were public officers of the DCWD performing official functions, it failed to prove the presence of the second and third elements beyond reasonable doubt.","FOR THESE REASONS, the Consolidated Petitions for Review on Certiorari are GRANTED. The Decision dated March 26, 2015 and the Resolution dated August 7, 2015 of the Sandiganbayan (Special Third Division) in Criminal Case No. SB-07-CRM-0067, are REVERSED. Petitioners Arnold D. Navales, Rey C. Chavez, Rosindo J. Almonte, Alfonso E. Laid, and William V. Guillen are ACQUITTED for failure of the prosecution to prove their guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[6]
Upon arraignment, Enriquez pleaded not guilty to both charges. Trial ensued.","""The right against unreasonable search and seizure is a facet of the right to privacy, which guards against unreasonable State intrusion into its people's private lives . . . . Thus, [a search warrant's] issuance and subsequent implementation must comply with the necessary requirements for its validity.""[1]

This Court resolves the appeal[2] assailing the Decision[3] of the Court of Appeals affirming with modification the Regional Trial Court's Decision[4] that accused-appellant Lucky Enriquez y Casipi (Enriquez) is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of one count of illegal possession of dangerous drugs, and one count of illegal possession of equipment, instrument, apparatus, and other paraphernalia for dangerous drugs under Sections 11 and 12 of Republic Act No. 9165.","This Court cannot give credence to the prosecution's argument that the sketch attached to the search warrant distinguished the place to be searched. A perusal of the Regional Trial Court's Consolidated Judgment shows that while Search Warrant No. 5368 (2017) was marked by the prosecution as an exhibit during the preliminary conference, the alleged attached sketch map was not included.[52] The Court of Appeals even stated that the ""sketch map is not extant in the record[.]""[53] As such, the courts were unable to verify whether the sketch map was truly attached to the search warrant and if it described the premises to be searched with particularity.

The doubtful existence of the sketch map or its failure to properly identify the premises to be searched is evident in the Regional Trial Court's and the Court of Appeals' recognition that the government agents were only able to locate accused-appellant's house through the confidential informant's assistance.

The Regional Court, in its Consolidated Judgment, stated that:
While the warrant merely states ""Informal Settler's Compound, NIA Road, Barangay Pinyahan, Quezon City,[""] it shall be noted that a sketch of the house was indicated in the Search Warrant. In fact the agents who implemented the search warrant was accompanied by the informant who pinpointed them to the exact location of the house of the accused.[54]
The Court of Appeals, on the other hand, was explicit that the confidential informant's help was vital in leading them to the house:
While the given address may be considered imprecise or non­specific, the agents of the PDEA were able to locate Lucky's house because their informant was with them and the informant knew exactly the location of the premises to be searched. Although the sketch map is not extant in the record, Agent Million nevertheless testified that they were able to locate the house of Lucky through the help of their confidential informant.[55]
The failure to present the sketch map, coupled with the necessity of the confidential informant's assistance, casts serious doubt on whether the address stated in the search warrant met the definiteness or particularity requirement. As such, it is clear that the search warrant issued was so broadly worded that it constituted a general warrant proscribed by the Constitution.[56]

Aside from the search warrant's invalidity, the government agents' execution was tainted with multiple irregularities.","ACCORDINGLY, the appeal is GRANTED. The June 30, 2020 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR H.C. No. 40646 is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Accused-appellant Lucky Enriquez y Casipi is ACQUITTED of the crimes of illegal possession of dangerous drugs and illegal possession of equipment, instrument, apparatus, and other paraphernalia for dangerous drugs under Sections 11 and 12 of Republic Act No. 9165. He is ordered RELEASED from confinement unless he is being held for some other legal grounds.

Agbayani, Jr. (Dr. Agbayani) guilty of reckless imprudence resulting to serious physical injuries and, accordingly, sentenced him to imprisonment of two years of prision correccional minimum.[3] In a Resolution[4] dated June 23, 2021 in G.R. No. 215121, the Court upheld the July 29, 2013 MeTC, Branch 13 Judgment, with modification as to the penalty. The Court's June 23, 2021 Resolution attained finality on March 16, 2022.[5]

A. Antecedents

To put the present issue and the Court's ruling herein in proper perspective, as will be discussed thoroughly below, it is apt to recall the antecedents that led to the present Petition, as culled from the Court's June 23, 2021 Resolution and the case records.

The case before the MeTC

In an Amended Information dated June 11, 2008, Dr. Agbayani was charged with reckless imprudence resulting in serious physical injuries for allegedly using an unsterilized medical instrument in the operation he conducted on the left knee of private complainant Saul Q. Hofileña, Jr. (Saul).[6] The accusatory portion of the Information reads:
That on or about January 5, 2006, in the City of Manila, Philippines, the said accused, being then the surgeon and/or orthopaedist of complainant Saul Q. Hofileña, Jr., did then and there voluntarily but without malice, conduct an operation (arthroscopy) upon said complainant in a reckless manner by using a medical instrument (arthroscope) that was not sterilized without taking the necessary precaution to avoid injury to said complainant, taking into consideration his employment or occupation and degree of intelligence, causing as a consequence of his said carelessness, recklessness, negligence, imprudence[,] and lack of precaution the said complainant to suffer serious physical injuries on his left knee which rendered him incapacitated for work and/or labor for more than thirty (30) days and in fact said complainant had undergone another operation at St. Luke's Hospital, Quezon City on his left knee to remove the infection introduced by the accused and subsequent operation on his right wrist as a result of walking with a cane for a prolonged period of time, to the damage and prejudice of said Saul Q. Hofileña, Jr.[7]
Dr. Agbayani pleaded not guilty to the crime charged. Thereafter, trial on the merits ensued.[8]

The prosecution presented the following witnesses: (1) Saul; (2) Saul's private secretary, Emilie Valdivia (Valdivia); (3) Dr. Debbie P. Dela Fuente (Dr. Dela Fuente), the clinical and anatomic pathologist who signed the Report containing the findings on the infection sustained on Saul's left knee; (4) Elizabeth S. Hofileña (Elizabeth), wife of Saul; and (5) Christine Marie Javelona Pascual (Pascual), the medical technologist who conducted the test and examination of the specimen taken from Saul.[9]

The prosecution likewise submitted the following documentary exhibits: (i) criminal complaint of Saul, Exhibits ""A"" to ""A-7-B""; (ii) Dr. Agbayani's prescription, Exhibit ""B""; (iii) Reply Affidavit of Saul, Exhibit ""C-C-6-B""; (iv) Supplemental Affidavit of Saul, Exhibit ""D"" to ""D-10-B"" with attachments marked and incorporated thereto as Annexes ""A"" to ""WWWW''; (v) Answer of Dr. Agbayani, together with its Annexes, particularly Annex ""G"" thereof, i.e., the sterilization record, Exhibit ""E"" to ""E-1"";[10] (vi) Medical Center Imus Result/the report signed by Pascual, RMT Medical Technologist and Dr. Dela Fuente, Pathologist, Exhibit ""F""; (vii) Affidavit of Valdivia, Exhibit ""G"" to ""G-2-A"" and ""I""; (viii) Supplemental Affidavit of Valdivia, Exhibit ""H"" to ""H-2-A""; (ix) Logbook of Medical Center Imus, Exhibit ""J"" to ""J-1"" and ""K"" to ""K-1""; (x) Check Voucher, Exhibit ""L"" to ""L-7-A""; (xi) Affidavit of Saul's wife, Exhibit ""M"" to ""M-3"" with attached Annex; and (xii) Affidavit of Pascual, Exhibit ""N"" to ""N-A.""[11]

Saul identified the handwritten findings (marked as Exhibits ""B"" and ""B-1"") which show the diagnosis, as well as the signature of Dr. Agbayani signed in front of him. He likewise identified the admission slips (marked as Exhibits ""C,"" ""C-1,"" ""C-2,"" ""C-3,"" and ""C-4"") which show his confinement at the Manila Doctors Hospital. Other documents identified by Saul include: the sterilization record (Annex ""G"" of Dr. Agbayani's Answer which the prosecution adopted as part of its Exhibits ""E"" and ""E-1""),[12] and a copy of the report signed by Pascual, RMT medical technologist and Dr. Dela Fuente, pathologist (marked as Exhibits ""F"" and ""F-1"").[13]

Saul narrated that Dr. Agbayani first diagnosed him with ""ANTERIOR CRUCIATE LIGAMENT"" (ACL), but after the operation, the latter informed him that he does not have ACL, but rather osteoarthritis and advised him to lose weight. Saul relayed that Dr. Agbayani did not give him any written diagnosis and in fact, it was him who presented the MRI result before he was operated on by the latter. Additionally, Saul alleged that after the operation, Dr. Agbayani gave him antibiotics. Soon after, he visited Dr. Agbayani in his office to complain about the infection. Dr. Agbayani explained to him about the arthroscope device and told him that it was very difficult to sterilize the lens thereof which the former inserted in his knee. Saul admitted that there was no written agreement between him and Dr. Agbayani as to the fact that it was the latter who will personally sterilize the instrument. Nonetheless, Saul averred that Dr. Agbayani stated in a general way that ""I'll take care of everything. I'll see to it that everything is okay.""[14]

Meanwhile, Valdivia testified that she is Saul's secretary since 1995. She narrated that she heard the conversation between Dr. Agbayani and the prosecution, including Dr. Agbayani's answers to the latter's questions.[15]

Dr. Dela Fuente, a clinical and anatomic pathologist with eighteen years of experience and a consultant of Medical Center Imus since 2002, testified that when she signed the Report dated February 23, 2006 (marked as Exhibits ""F"" and ""F-1""), she checked the logbook and confirmed the name of the medical technologist who conducted the test. Dr. Dela Fuente explained that staphylococcus, as mentioned on the Report, is an organism found in several parts of the body, some of which are coagulase negative, while others are coagulase positive. The one that causes diseases is the coagulase positive staph aureus. Dr. Dela Fuente explained that coagulase negative staph aureus is not as invasive, but they can be opportunistic infections, but these days, there are so many species that are also invasive, meaning, they cause so much disease. Heavy growth of coagulase negative staph aureus means that a lot of them are growing in the discharge of the patient. Dr. Dela Fuente attested that findings on her report are true and accurate. When asked by the defense counsel, Dr. Dela Fuente admitted that she did not perform the test on the specimen of Saul; rather, it was only the results that were given to her.[16]

For her part, Elizabeth narrated that the wound on Saul's knee where the arthroscope was inserted became infected with a heavy growth of coagulase negative staphylococcus, per the findings of the Medical Center Imus.[17]

Finally, Pascual testified that there was a positive bacterial growth in the wound discharge that she examined that day and that she was not the one who typed the entries in Exhibit ""F"" (Medical Center Imus Result),[18] albeit it was her findings. She admitted that she was not the one who received the sample she analyzed—since that duty belonged to the personnel in charge of the receiving section—but stated that she was certain that the specimen she examined came from Saul.[19]","This resolves the Petition for Habeas Corpus,[1] under Rule 102 of the Rules of Court, filed on September 8, 2023 by Angeli E. Akabane (Angeli), as the common-law spouse of Dr. Benigno A. Agbayani, Jr., seeking the release of the latter from confinement for allegedly having been deprived of his liberty without due process of law and under a void judgment that has not become final and executory.","The Petition is dismissed.
 
The Petition for Habeas Corpus is the wrong remedy
 

A Petition for Habeas Corpus is a proper remedy for a person illegally deprived of liberty. It exists as a speedy and effective remedy to relieve persons from unlawful restraint.[97] Rule 102, Section 1 of the Rules of Court provides the scope of a writ of habeas corpus, this includes ""all cases of illegal confinement or detention by which any person is deprived of his liberty, or by which the rightful custody of any person is withheld from the person entitled thereto."" Case law holds that the ""primary purpose of the writ 'is to inquire into all manner of involuntary restraint as distinguished from voluntary, and to relieve a person therefrom if such restraint is illegal.' 'Any restraint which will preclude freedom of action is sufficient.'""[98]

Conversely, however, ""if it appears that the person alleged to be restrained of his liberty is in the custody of an officer under process issued by a court or judge or by virtue of a judgment or order of a court of record, and that the court or judge had jurisdiction to issue the process, render the judgment, or make the order,"" the writ shall not be allowed nor the discharge of the person shall be authorized. Neither shall the remedy of a petition for habeas corpus authorize the discharge of a person ""convicted of an offense in the Philippines, or of a person suffering imprisonment under lawful judgment.""[99]

Under Rule 102, Section 2 of the Rules of Court, an application for a writ of habeas corpus may be made through a petition filed before the Court or any of its members, the CA or any of its members in instances authorized by law, or the RTC or any of its presiding judges.

In this case, and as shown by the foregoing factual narrations, Dr. Agbayani was charged with and convicted for the crime of reckless imprudence resulting in serious physical injuries by the MeTC, Branch 13 in Criminal Case No. 052772-CN and was, thus, sentenced to suffer imprisonment of two years of prision correccional minimum, in a Judgment dated July 29, 2013. Dr. Agbayani's subsequent appeal from his conviction was dismissed by the RTC Manila on December 23, 2013.

Moreover, as Angeli herself admitted, and as the records show, the dismissal by the RTC Manila of Dr. Agbayani's appeal was already upheld by the Court in the following: (a) Resolution dated June 23, 2021 denying his Petition for Review on Certiorari; (b) Resolution dated March 16, 2022 denying his Motion for Reconsideration and Supplemental Motion for Reconsideration; and (c) Resolution dated October 3, 2022 which denied his Motion to elevate the case to the Court En Banc and noted without action his Second Motion for Reconsideration. The foregoing Court's rulings had already become final and executory for which reason the MeTC, Branch 13 issued the warrant for his arrest resulting in the subsequent restraint of his liberty.

Under Article 365 of the Revised Penal Code, a person found guilty of reckless imprudence shall suffer the penalty of arresto mayor in its maximum period, which ranges from four months and one day to six months, to prision correccional in its medium period, which ranges from two years, four months, and one day to four years and two months. Meanwhile, Batas Pambansa Bilang 129 vests MeTCs with the exclusive original jurisdiction over all offenses punishable with imprisonment not exceeding six years. Verily, the MeTC, Branch 13 which rendered the July 29, 2013 Judgment against Dr. Agbayani and subsequently issued the Warrant of Arrest upon finality of the Court's rulings denying his Petition had jurisdiction to issue the same. Consequently, the Court is hard-pressed to conclude that the imprisonment of Dr. Agbayani or the restraint in his liberty was tainted with any illegality to justify the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.

In simpler terms, the arrest and detention/incarceration of Dr. Agbayani was the result of a process issued by a court or judge or by virtue of a judgment or order of a court of record which has jurisdiction to issue the same. As a person ""convicted of an offense in the Philippines, or of a person suffering imprisonment under lawful judgment,"" Dr. Agbayani is rightfully held under custody for which the remedy of a writ of habeas corpus cannot lie. It must be stressed that the writ of habeas corpus shall not be allowed, nor the discharge of the person shall be authorized when the person alleged to be restrained of his liberty is convicted of an offense in the Philippines and thus, was suffering imprisonment under lawful judgment.

Moreover, since the Court's Resolutions dated June 23, 2021, March 16, 2022, and October 3, 2022 had already become final and executory and therefore immutable, the legal correctness of the RTC Manila's dismissal of Dr. Agbayani's appeal can no longer be assailed even in the present petition for habeas corpus, the same being an extraordinary remedy the primary purpose of which is to inquire into all manner of involuntary restraint—not the legal correctness of a court's decision.
 
Case law settles that once a judgment lapses into finality, it becomes immutable and unalterable. As such, it may no longer be modified or amended by any court in any manner even if the purpose of the modification or amendment is to correct perceived errors of law or fact. This principle, known as the doctrine of immutability of judgment, is a matter of sound public policy, which rests upon the practical consideration that every litigation must come to an end and to avoid delay in the administration of justice. To be sure, the doctrine recognizes several exceptions, namely: (1) the correction of clerical errors; (2) the so-called nunc pro tunc entries which cause no prejudice to any party; (3) void judgments; and (4) whenever circumstances transpire after the finality of the decision rendering its execution unjust and inequitable.[100]

None of the exceptions apply in this case since Angeli essentially asks the Court to revisit the December 23, 2013 Order of the RTC Manila dismissing Dr. Agbayani's appeal on the ground that it was purportedly issued in violation of Dr. Agbayani's due process rights and, hence, is void. Verily, the perceived nullity of the RTC Manila's Order does not entail mere correction of clerical errors or nunc pro tunc entries nor does it present a circumstance that renders the execution of the MeTC, Branch 13 Judgment unjust and inequitable. Lastly, it bears stressing that the legal correctness of the RTC Manila's dismissal of Dr. Agbayani's appeal for failure to file the memorandum of appeal within the extended period has already been decided by the Court with finality. Thus, the Court's June 23, 2021, March 16, 2022, and October 3, 2022 rulings on this issue constitutes res judicata to the present Petition that essentially challenges the validity and legal correctness of the RTC Manila's dismissal of Dr. Agbayani's appeal.
 
The petition for habeas corpus was filed in violation of the principle of hierarchy of courts
 

Finally, the Petition for Habeas Corpus should have been filed before the lower court pursuant to the principle of hierarchy of courts. The hierarchy principle commands that cases must first be brought before the lowest court with jurisdiction, and not before the higher courts. Petitions for habeas corpus fall under the concurrent jurisdiction of the RTC, the CA, and the Court, and hence, should have been filed before the RTC.
 
Supervening events rendered the present petition for habeas corpus moot and academic
 

On October 27, 2023, Angeli, through counsel, informed the Court via Manifestation and Motion,[101] that Dr. Agbayani passed away on October 5, 2023 at the Jose Reyes Memorial Medical Center. A copy of Dr. Agbayani's Death Certificate[102] was attached to said Motion. Nonetheless, Angeli implores the Court to resolve the petition, despite the apparent mootness, since the unwarranted dismissal of the appeal by the RTC Manila in grave violation of Dr. Agbayani's constitutional due process rights, the situation is of an exceptional character and paramount public interest is involved, the constitutional issue raised requires formulation of controlling principles to guide the bench, the bar, the public, and the case is capable of repetition yet evading review. Angeli reiterated the foregoing arguments in her Compliance[103] filed on December 18, 2023.

A case becomes moot and academic when the conflicting issue that may be resolved ceases to exist as a result of supervening events such that a declaration thereon would be of no practical value.[104] A ""moot and academic"" case is one that ceases to present a justiciable controversy over which courts can exercise judicial power. Thus, as a rule, courts decline jurisdiction over such case, or dismiss it on ground of mootness.[105]

The principle on mootness traces its roots from the express constitutional decree that judicial power—with which the Supreme Court (and all other courts that may be established by law) is vested—includes the duty to ""settle actual controversies"" ""involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable.""[106] While judicial power has been expanded under the present Constitution by including the power to ""determine whether or riot there has been a grave abuse of discretion""[107] on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government, it remains that judicial power must be based on an actual case or controversy at whose core is the existence of a right which is legally demandable and enforceable. Without this core element of actual case or controversy, courts have no jurisdiction to act.[108]

Case law defines actual case or controversy as one ""that is appropriate or ripe for determination, not conjectural or anticipatory, lest the decision of the court would amount to an advisory opinion. The power does not extend to hypothetical questions since any attempt at abstraction could only lead to dialectics and barren legal question and to sterile conclusions unrelated to actualities.""[109]

Because the existence of an actual case or controversy is an indispensable requirement in the exercise of judicial power, courts, including the Court, should be very cautious in conducting a review of an otherwise moot petition. Indeed, ""where an issue is moot on its face, the application of any of the exceptions should be subjected to a strict test because it is a deviation from the general rule. The Court should carefully test the exceptions to be applied from the perspectives both of legality and practical effects and show by these standards that the issue absolutely requires to be resolved.""[110] Consequently, any exception that the Court has recognized to the rule on mootness must be justified only by an implied recognition that a continuing controversy exists.

To be sure, case law recognizes exceptions to the mootness doctrine which permit courts to resolve otherwise moot and academic cases. The exceptions include: (i) grave violation of the Constitution; (ii) exceptional character of the situation and paramount public interest; (iii) when the constitutional issue raised requires formulation of controlling principles to guide the bench, the bar, and the public; and (iv) the case is capable of repetition yet evading review.[111]

Applying the foregoing precepts, the Court finds that the present Petition for Habeas Corpus has been rendered moot by the supervening death of Dr. Agbayani thereby precluding the Court from further exercising its judicial power for lack of a justiciable controversy. Further, and contrary to Angeli's argument, none of the exceptions to the mootness principle are present in this case that would justify continued exercise of the Court's jurisdiction.

In this respect, it bears reiterating that the purpose of a petition for habeas corpus is to seek the relief of persons from unlawful restraint. Verily, the supervening death of Dr. Agbayani in this case effectively relieved him from his incarceration, thus, rendering the petition moot and academic. At any rate, as elsewhere discussed in this Resolution, the arrest and detention/incarceration of Dr. Agbayani was lawful, resulting from a process issued by a court or judge or of a judgment or order of a court of record which has jurisdiction to issue the same. As such, the writ of habeas corpus cannot be allowed since Dr. Agbayani was convicted of an offense in the Philippines and thus, was suffering imprisonment under lawful judgment.

All told, the Petition for Habeas Corpus is dismissed for being the wrong remedy and for violation of the hierarchy of court principle. At any rate, the petition is moot and academic.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Habeas Corpus is DISMISSED."
"G.R. No. 259609, August 07, 2024","PAOLO B. DAVANTES, PETITIONER, VS. C.F. SHARP CREW MANAGEMENT INC., CLAUS-PETER OFFEN TANKSCHIFFREEDEREI (GMBH & CO.) KG, AND/OR MIGUEL ROCHA, RESPONDENTS.","Davantes alleged that he had been working with C.F. Sharp Crew Management Inc. (C.F. Sharp) on behalf of its principal, Claus-Peter Offen Tankschiffreederei (GMBH & Co.) KG, for 20 years and had completed all his employment contracts without any health issues.[6]

On May 13, 2017, Davantes was hired as an able seaman on board vessel BSL Elsa for a tour of duty of one month and covered by the Verdi/IMEC-IBF TCC Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). Before deployment, Davantes underwent a Pre-Employment Medical Examination (PEME) wherein he was found fit to work.[7]

On June 24, 2017, the crew members of BSL Elsa were instructed to undertake an emergency drill under the sweltering heat of the sun. According to Davantes, the drill took a toll on him. He was brought to his cabin for rest. While still feeling dazed, Davantes reported for his duty that midnight. At around 3:00 a.m. of June 25, 2017, Davantes felt his heart beating abnormally fast. Thinking that it was merely fatigue, he finished his duty but he already felt suffocated. Davantes waited until 9:00 a.m. of the same day to report his condition. After assessment by the Master, Davantes was disembarked and brought to a shore-­side clinic in Venezuela. Eventually, he was brought to a hospital since his condition deteriorated. At the hospital, Davantes underwent Coronary Bypass Graft surgery. Thereafter, on July 25, 2017, Davantes was repatriated to the Philippines.[8]

Upon arrival, Davantes was referred to Dr. Robert Lim (Dr. Lim) of Cardinal Santos Medical Center. Several tests were conducted and he was observed to have high white blood cell and platelet count and Anterolateral Wall Ischemia. After four months of treatment, Dr. Lim diagnosed Davantes with ""Myocardial Infarction, Coronary Artery Disease, Hypertension."" As such, Davantes was declared unfit to work. Davantes also consulted his physician of choice, Dr. Antonio C. Pascual (Dr. Pascual) of the Philippine Heart Center, who likewise declared him as unfit to work.[9]

On March 7, 2019, Davantes filed a complaint for total and permanent disability benefits, damages, and attorney's fees against C.F. Sharp.[10] On March 14, 2018, Davantes was given a compensation of USD 20,900.00. However, Davantes claims that the amount of USD 20,900.00, which he already received, is grossly inappropriate to the USD 102,308.00 he claims to be entitled pursuant to the CBA.[11]

For their part, C.F. Sharp averred that Davantes was referred to Marine Medical Services for further evaluation and treatment for his ""S/P Myocardial Infarction; Coronary Artery Disease; Hypertension; S/P Coronary Artery Bypass Graft."" After initial examination, Marine Medical Services observed the following: (1) Davantes had chest pain upon waking up on June 26, 2017; (2) Davantes was previously diagnosed with Hypertension by a private doctor in Marikina; and (3) Davantes is a cigarette smoker and occasionally drinks alcohol. Hence, the company-designated physician gave Davantes a final disability grading of Grade 7 for moderate residual or disorder.[12]

Further, C.F. Sharp narrated that Davantes had previously filed a complaint for disability benefits. The said previous complaint was docketed as NLRC-NCR Case No. 03-04582-18, but was dismissed upon motion of both parties and after they have entered into a settlement agreement. By virtue of the settlement agreement between Davantes and C.F. Sharp, the former received the amount of USD 20,900.00 or equivalent to a Grade 7 disability benefit. Accordingly, Davantes executed a Release of All Rights, Pagpapaubaya sa Lahat ng Karapatan, and Affidavit of Claimant, all of which were dated March 14, 2018. On even date, the LA in NLRC-NCR Case No. 03-04582-18 dismissed the case with prejudice.[13]

To their surprise, Davantes filed another complaint. Thus, C.F. Sharp argues that this later complaint should be dismissed on the ground of res judicata. C.F. Sharp also argues that Davantes is not entitled to disability benefits under the CBA because the latter requires the disability to be caused by an accident, which Davantes failed to allege and prove. Lastly, C.F. Sharp claims that there was concealment on the part of Davantes when he did not declare during his PEME that he had a pre-existing illness or condition.[14]","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] assailing the Decision[2] dated October 20, 2021 and Resolution[3] dated March 7, 2022 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R.

(M) 11-000725-19 OFW.[4] The NLRC, in turn, affirmed with modifications the Decision dated August 30, 2019 of the Labor Arbiter (LA) granting petitioner Paolo B. Davantes (Davantes) total and permanent disability benefits in the total amount of USD 98,848.00 based on the Schedule of Disability Compensation in the Verdi/IMEC-IBF TCC Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA).[5]","The Petition has merit.

Preliminarily, the Court notes that the Order dated March 14, 2018 issued by the NLRC dismissed with prejudice a previous claim for disability benefits filed by Davantes.[23] The said dismissal of the previous claim was premised on Davantes's execution of ""Release of All Rights, Pagpapaubaya sa Lahat ng Karapatan, and Affidavit of Claimant,"" all dated March 14, 2018 and issued in favor of respondents.[24]

Quitclaims are generally frowned upon for being contrary to public policy. Nevertheless, the Court has recognized some legitimate waivers that represent a voluntary and reasonable settlement of a worker's claim.[25] In order for a deed of release, waiver or quitclaim pertaining to an existing right to be valid, it must meet the following requirements: (1) that there was no fraud or deceit or coercion on the part of any of the parties; (2) that the consideration for the quitclaim is sufficient and reasonable; and (3) that the contract is not contrary to law, public order, public policy, morals or good customs, or prejudicial to a third person with a right recognized by law.[26]

Here, the Court cannot sustain the validity of the quitclaim. As will be discussed below, there is merit in Davantes's supplication that the settlement amount of USD 20,900.00 is disproportionate to the disability benefits which he should have received.[27]

The following pronouncement of the Court in Manansala v. Marlow Navigation Phils., Inc., et al.[28] is instructive:
As laypersons, seafarers cannot be expected to make completely accurate accounts of their state of health. Unaware of the nuances of medical conditions, they may, in good faith, make statements that turn out to be false. These honest mistakes do not negate compensability for disability arising from pre-existing illnesses shown to be aggravated by their working conditions. However, when a seafarer's proper knowledge of pre­-existing conditions and intent to deceive an employer are established, compensability is negated.[29]
Further explained in Manansala is the conduct of PEME for the seafarers:
Prospective seafarers undergo a pre-employment medical examination (PEME) to determine if they are fit to work. Republic Act No. 8042, as amended, otherwise known as the Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act of 1995, tasks the Department of Health to regulate the operations of clinics conducting PEMEs for migrant workers.

Department of Health Administrative Order No. 2007-0025, which was in effect when petitioner took his PEME, articulated guidelines on PEMEs for seafarers. It identified minimum test requirements, summarized as follows:

As to their source, there are two categories of information obtained in PEMEs. First is information obtained from and colored by the prospective seafarer's opinion, i.e., information on medical history gained from probing questions asked to prospective seafarers and answered by them to the best of their knowledge. Second is information generated by procedures conducted by health professionals.[30]
After the PEME, a prospective seafarer is found either: (1) fit for sea duty; (2) unfit for sea duty; or (3) temporarily unfit for sea duty. While PEME is not an in-depth examination of the actual status of a prospective seafarer's health, it must still fulfill its purpose of ascertaining capacity to safely perform tasks at sea.

Upon finding that the prospective seafarer is fit for sea duty, an employment contract may now be executed.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is GRANTED.

"G.R. No. 263676, August 07, 2024","PEDRO PEQUERO Y NOLLORA, ALIAS ATTY. EPAFRODITO NOLLORA, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","Prosecution's Version of Facts

Sometime in 2005, Ponciano Banjao (Banjao) met Pedro who was supposed to be the lawyer-brother of a security guard named Rolando Pequero (Rolando). It was Pedro who appeared as counsel of Rolando at the Municipal Trial Court (MTC), Taytay, Rizal, and prepared pleadings and signed as ""Atty. Epafrodito Nollora.""[5]

On June 22, 2011, Banjao filed a complaint at the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) – Special Action Unit about this certain Pedro falsely representing himself as a lawyer. Banjao informed Special Investigator Melvin Escurel (SI Escurel) that Pedro had been representing himself publicly as a lawyer and would again appear for a particular case in a trial court in Binangonan, Rizal on October 14, 2011. A team headed by NBI Agent Jerome Bomediano (Agent Bomediano) conducted an entrapment operation on the said date. Pedro was apprehended when he appeared as Atty. Epafrodito Nollora for a particular client at the MTC, where the presiding judge even admonished him for usurpation of authority.[6] SI Escurel then executed a Joint Affidavit of Arrest,[7] which became the basis for the criminal cases against Pedro.

Defense's Version of Facts

Pedro denied the charges against him and averred that he was wrongfully identified as Pedro Pequero y Nollora when in fact he is really Atty. Epafrodito Nollora, without a middle name. Pedro swore that he is truly a lawyer and that a person named Epafrodito Nollora y Ariem is the one who is not a lawyer.[8] It was this Epafrodito Nollora y Ariem, his deceased relative, who had previously used his identity as a lawyer in another case.[9]

Pedro further argued that on the day that he was arrested, he was at the Municipal Assessor's Office of Binangonan, Rizal to pay real property taxes and not for a supposed hearing of a client.[10]","For the Court's consideration is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court filed by Pedro Pequero y Nollora, alias ""Atty. Epafrodito Nollora"" (Pedro) assailing the Court of Appeals' (CA) Decision[2] dated March 23, 2022 and the Resolution[3] dated September 19, 2022 in CA-G.R. CR No. 44373, which dismissed Pedro's Petition for Review under Rule 122 of the Rules of Court and affirmed his conviction for the crimes of: (1) use of illegal alias in violation of Section 1, in relation to Section 5, of Commonwealth Act No. 142, as amended by Republic Act No. 6085; (2) use of fictitious name under Article 178, paragraph 1, of the Revised Penal Code; and (3) usurpation of authority or official functions under Article 177, also of the Revised Penal Code.","The instant Petition for Review on Certiorari is partially meritorious.

It bears stressing at the very outset that the core issue raised in the present petition is a question of fact. Pedro insists that he is really Atty. Epafrodito Nollora. The Court has stressed, in a plethora of cases, that questions of fact, which would require a re-evaluation of the evidence, are inappropriate under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. The jurisdiction of the Court under Rule 45, Section 1 is limited only to errors of law as the Court is not a trier of facts.[25] While there are recognized exceptions to this rule,[26] none of which was established in this case. The Court, therefore, finds no reason to review the findings of fact of the MTC, RTC, and the CA.

The facts established in this case are as follows:

1.
Pedro's registered name at birth is Pedro Pequero y Nollora and not Atty. Epafrodito Nollora.[27]
 	 
2.
Pedro continually and publicly used the alias ""Atty. Epafrodito Nollora"" and represented himself as a lawyer.[28] The prosecution presented several documents at the MTC where he purported himself to be Atty. Epafrodito Nollora who was also the supposed counsel of clients filing the same, thus:
 	 	 

(a)
Notarized Plaridel Bail Bond No. 59270 dated [October 24, 2011];
 	 	 

(b)
Notarized Waiver of Appearance dated [October 24, 2011];
 	 	 

(c)
Notarized Commitment to Renew Bail Bond dated [October 24, 2011];
 	 	 

(d)
Notarized Undertaking dated [October 24, 2011];
 	 	 

(e)
Certificate of Detention of Pedro Pequero dated [October 21, 2011];[29]
 	 
3.
On October 14, 2011, an entrapment operation was conducted by the NBI operatives. He was caught representing as a counsel for a client in a case before the MTC of Binangonan, Rizal.[30]
 	 
4.
Pedro also filed several pleadings at the MTC where he signed as Atty. Epafrodito Nollora.[31] As found by the CA, these are the pleadings filed with the Court wherein Pedro signed as Atty. Epafrodito Nollora:
 	 	 

(a)
Motion for Postponement dated February 24, 2012;
 	 	 

(b)
Reply to the Opposition of the Offended Party to the Accused Motion for Reinvestigation dated [April 2, 2012];
 	 	 

(c)
Motion to Quash dated [August 18, 2012];
 	 	 

(d)
Manifestation and Motion dated [June 19, 2013];
 	 	 

(e)
Motion for reconsideration dated 19 June 2013; and
 	 	 

(f)
Supplemental Manifestation and Motion dated [October 29, 2013].[32]
5. Per Certification of the Office of the Bar Confidant, there is only one Epafrodito Nollora who was admitted to the Philippine Bar, and the said Epafrodito Nollora already died on May 19, 1986.[33]

6. Pedro illegally assumed the identity of the deceased Atty. Epafrodito Nollora and stood as a lawyer for supposed clients.[34]

From the foregoing established facts, the Court agrees with the courts a quo that Pedro is guilty of use of illegal alias under Commonwealth Act No. 142, as amended by Republic Act No. 6085.

Section 1 of Commonwealth Act No. 142, as amended reads:

Section 1. Except as a pseudonym solely for literary, cinema, television, radio or other entertainment purposes and in athletic events where the use of pseudonym is a normally accepted practice, no person shall use any name different from the one with which he was registered at birth in the office of the local civil registry, or with which he was baptized for the first time, or, in case of an alien, with which he was registered in the bureau of immigration upon entry; or such substitute name as may have been authorized by a competent court: Provided, That persons, whose births have not been registered in any local civil registry and who have not been baptized, have one year from the approval of this act within which to register their names in the civil registry of their residence. The name shall comprise the patronymic name and one or two surnames.

In this case, Pedro's alleged alias, ""Atty. Epafrodito Nollora,"" was used not for literary, cinema, television, radio, or entertainment purposes and in athletic events but to represent himself as a lawyer to the prejudice of the believing public. Pedro, likewise, had no authority to use the alias. Records are bereft of any showing that Pedro was legally authorized to use other names than his name registered at birth in the civil registry.[35]

Pedro is also guilty of the crime of use of fictitious name to cause damage.

At the outset, the MTC, the RTC and the CA convicted Pedro of the crime of use of fictitious name to cause damage under Article 178 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Presidential Decree No. 38,[36] which states:

Article 178. Using fictitious name and concealing true name. The penalty of prision correccional shall be imposed upon any person who shall publicly use a fictitious name for the purpose of concealing a crime, evading the execution of a judgment or causing damage.

Any person who conceals his true name and other personal circumstances shall be punished by arresto mayor.

The prosecution was able to establish that Pedro publicly used the name ""Atty. Epafrodito Nollora,"" which is not his real and registered name at birth. Although strictly speaking, it is not a fictitious name as there was a real Atty. Epafrodito Nollora, the real Atty. Nollora had long been dead. By using the name and assuming the identity of the deceased, Pedro was successful in using a fictitious name which caused damage to the public, especially his paying clients who believed that they were being represented by a true and genuine lawyer.

It bears stressing at this point, that the MTC, the RTC, and the CA correctly convicted Pedro of violating the 1st paragraph of the above-quoted provision of the Revised Penal Code (use of fictitious name to cause damage) and imposed upon him the penalty of arresto mayor against Pedro. While it may seem that the courts a quo erred in imposing the penalty of arresto mayor considering that the proper penalty for violating the 1st paragraph of the above-quoted provision is prision correccional, Article 178 of the Revised Penal Code had already been amended by Republic Act No. 10951,[37] particularly Section 29 thereof, viz.:

Section 29. Article 178 of the same Act is hereby amended to read as follows:

Article 178. Using fictitious name and concealing true name. - The penalty of arresto mayor and a fine not to exceed One hundred thousand pesos ([PHP] 100,000.00) shall be imposed upon any person who shall publicly use a fictitious name for the purpose of concealing a crime, evading the execution of a judgment or causing damage.

Any person who conceals his true name and other personal circumstances shall be punished by arresto menor or a fine not to exceed Forty thousand pesos ([PHP] 40,000.00).

Such amendment has retroactive application to the instant case per Section 100,[38] Republic Act No. 10951, as it is favorable to Pedro. While under the first paragraph of Article 178 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Presidential Decree No. 38, (i.e., prior to its amendment by Republic Act No. 10951) any person who is found using a fictitious name to cause damage is to be penalized with a prison term of prision correccional, the penalty imposed by the amendment introduced by Republic Act No. 10951, which is a prison term of arresto mayor is shorter than that of prision correccional. Thus, the latter should be applied as it is favorable to Pedro. Hence, the prison term of arresto mayor imposed by the MTC, as affirmed by the RTC, and the CA is proper. The penalty of fine in the amount of PHP 500.00 is retained.

Anent Pedro's guilt for the crime of usurpation of authority or official functions under Article 177[39] of the Revised Penal Code, the Court finds it necessary to reverse the MTC, RTC, and CA's Decisions, and acquit Pedro of the said crime.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is PARTIALLY GRANTED. The Joint Decision of the Municipal Trial Court in Criminal Case Nos. 11-252, 11-253 and 11-254, as affirmed by the Regional Trial Court and the Court of Appeals in its Decision dated March 23, 2022 and Resolution dated September 19, 2022 in CA-G.R. CR No. 44373, is MODIFIED in that: (i) in Criminal Case No. 11-253 for use of fictitious name, Pedro Pequero y Nollora is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of use of fictitious name (Article 178, Paragraph 1 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 10951) and is hereby sentenced to imprisonment of four months of arresto mayor, including all its accessory penalty as prescribed by law and to pay a FINE of PHP 500.00, with subsidiary imprisonment for nonpayment; and (ii) in Criminal Case No. 11-254 for usurpation of authority or official function, Pedro Pequero y Nollora is ACQUITTED of the crime of usurpation of official functions as defined and penalized under Article 177 of the Revised Penal Code."
"G.R. No. 264746, August 07, 2024","MARCELINA VILLANUEVA, DOING BUSINESS UNDER THE NAME AND STYLE ""VEDGE TRADING"", PETITIONER, VS. COCA-COLA BOTTLERS PHILS., INC., JONATHAN ERASGA, BENJAMIN I. DEQUINA, JR., ALLAN D. EVANGELISTA, AND EUGENIO D. EVANGELISTA, RESPONDENTS.","Coca-Cola is a corporation engaged in the production, manufacture, distribution, and sale of softdrinks and other related products.[7]

On November 26, 2012, Coca-Cola filed with the RTC a Complaint[8] for collection of a sum of money against Marcelina, docketed as Civil Case No. 12-1152.

Coca-Cola averred that it entered into a dealership agreement[9] with Marcelina, who was doing business under the name and style, ""Vedge Trading.""[10] Through the dealership agreement, Vedge Trading was given an exclusive area with a number of outlets where it could distribute or sell Coca-Cola products.[11] Coca-Cola also opened a credit line for Vedge Trading.[12] Thus, Coca-Cola products were delivered to Vedge Trading,[13] subject to the payment term of seven days from billing day.[14] As proof of the delivery of its products, Coca-Cola presented several delivery invoices[15] and a statement of account,[16] among others.

Supposedly, Vedge Trading incurred past due accounts with Coca-Cola for the period of May 23, 2010 to June 21, 2010 in the total amount of PHP 649,316.00, exclusive of interests and penalties.[17] Coca-Cola sent several demand letters[18] to Marcelina, but the outstanding debt remained unpaid.[19] Thus, it filed its Complaint against Marcelina to collect the debt.

Marcelina denied knowledge of any dealership agreement with Coca-Cola.[20] While she admitted that she registered a business in the name of ""V.E.D.G.E. Trading"" with the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI),[21] she asserted that it was her nephews Allan, Dequina, Erasga, and Eugenio, who managed the business. Marcelina thus filed her Third Party Complaint[22] against her nephews, insisting that they are the ones who must be held liable for the delivered yet unpaid products of Coca-Cola.

Marcelina particularly testified[23] that her nephews enticed her to finance and invest in the business of trading, distributing, or selling softdrinks. However, Dequina and Erasga were both sales representatives of Coca-Cola. As such, they were prohibited from engaging in a dealership with Coca-Cola.[24] Marcelina thus agreed to be the registered owner of ""V.E.D.G.E. Trading,"" which stood for her and her nephews' surnames, i.e., Villanueva, Erasga, Dequina, and Evangelista.[25] Resultantly, on August 18, 2009, the DTI issued a Certificate of Business Name Registration[26] to Marcelina as the registered owner of ""V.E.D.G.E. Trading.""

According to Marcelina, she gave her nephews a total of PHP 325,000.00 as capital for the business, but she never received any profits or returns for her investment. She maintained that she had no participation in the business, and that Erasga was the operations manager of Vedge Trading while Allan, Dequina, and Eugenio were the sales representatives. Supposedly, on March 13, 2010, she appeared before Barangay Daniel Fajardo, Las Piñas City[27] and declared before the Barangay Chairperson that from then on, she was ""severing [her] ties and partnership with the Third party defendants.""[28] Further, on December 12, 2012, she executed an Affidavit of No Operation,[29] stating that Vedge Trading ""did not operate since year 2010[.]"" Thus, on December 18, 2012, the City Treasurer of Las Piñas issued a Certification,[30] stating that Vedge Trading ""has ceased its operation and officially retired effective December 18, 2012[.]""

On cross-examination, Marcelina stated that she visited the warehouse of Vedge Trading every afternoon to see what was happening in its operations.[31] She also admitted that Allan, Dequina, and Eugenio were mere employees of Vedge Trading.[32]

Meanwhile, Allan, Dequina, and Eugenio denied liability for the claims of Coca-Cola supposedly because they were mere employees of Vedge Trading.[33] Allan particularly testified that: Erasga and Marcelina put up Vedge Trading in 2009; Erasga was the one who managed the business; Allan sold Coca-Cola products and remitted the proceeds of the sale to Erasga; and he frequently saw Marcelina at the warehouse of Vedge Trading together with Erasga, and that he often heard the two discussing the finances of Vedge Trading.[34] Similarly, Eugenio mentioned that: while he usually remitted to Erasga the payments for the Coca-Cola products that he had sold, he once remitted purchase payments to Marcelina; and Erasga managed the business, but Eugenio often saw him together with Marcelina at the business' bodega or warehouse.[35]

As to Erasga, he did not file his answer to the Third Party Complaint despite service of Summons[36] and Alias Summons.[37] Thus, upon Motion[38] of Marcelina, the RTC issued its Order[39] dated February 6, 2017, declaring Erasga in default.","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] (Petition) under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court seeking a reversal of the Decision[2] dated February 18, 2022, and Resolution[3] dated December 6, 2022 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 112750. The CA reversed the Decision[4] dated December 28, 2018 of Branch 141, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Makati City in Civil Case No. 12-1152 that dismissed the Complaint[5] dated November 15, 2012 (Complaint) for collection of a sum of money filed by respondent Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc. (Coca-Cola) against petitioner Marcelina Villanueva (Marcelina), as well as the Third Party Complaint[6] dated May 6, 2013 (Third Party Complaint) filed by Marcelina against third party defendants Jonathan Erasga (Erasga), Benjamin I. Dequina, Jr. (Dequina), Allan D. Evangelista (Allan), and Eugenio D. Evangelista (Eugenio) (collectively, third party defendants), both on the ground of lack of cause of action.","The Court affirms the CA Decision with modification. Marcelina is liable to Coca-Cola for the entire unpaid obligation. However, the Court finds that Marcelina and Erasga entered into an unregistered partnership; thus, after paying the debt, Marcelina may claim from Erasga the reimbursement of his pro rata share in the debt to Coca-Cola.

Coca-Cola and Vedge Trading entered into a dealership agreement. Thus, Coca-Cola is entitled to collect payments for its delivered yet unpaid products
Marcelina argues that the dealership agreement was not sufficiently proven because the written contract between the parties was never presented in court. The Court disagrees.

While a written dealership agreement between Coca-Cola and Vedge Trading was never presented during trial, the Court finds that the existence and execution of the contract was sufficiently established.

The delivery invoices[62] presented by Coca-Cola uniformly state that the customer, Vedge Trading, agrees that all its ""purchases from [Coca-Cola] shall be paid on the due date."" With the transaction, Vedge Trading was authorized to sell Coca-Cola products to outlets within a defined territory.

The dealership agreement in question is therefore a contract of sale of goods,[63] whereby Coca-Cola, as seller, sold its products in bulk or wholesale to Vedge Trading, for a price certain to be paid at a later date, so that the latter may re-sell the products to other outlets.

Significantly, there is nothing in the Civil Code which requires the contract of sale between Coca-Cola and Vedge Trading to be in written form. Instead, the Court has consistently held that a contract of sale of goods, as in the case at bar, is perfected by mere consent.[64] There is therefore no merit in Marcelina's argument that the non-presentation of the purported written dealership agreement was fatal to Coca-Cola's cause.

The Court is aware that under the Statute of Frauds in Article 1403,[65] paragraph 2(d) of the Civil Code, an agreement for the sale of goods at a price not less than five hundred pesos is unenforceable. However, the Statute of Frauds applies only to executory and not to completed, executed, or partially executed contracts.[66] In this regard, the Court has ruled that when the seller in a contract of sale has complied with its obligation to deliver the goods, the contract is considered partially executed or performed; thus, the Statute of Frauds will not apply.[67]","WHEREFORE, the Decision dated February 18, 2022 and Resolution dated December 6, 2022 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 112750 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION, in that:

The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) failed to act on said administrative claims for refund filed by MGI. Thus, MGI filed various petitions for review before the CTA, docketed as CTA Case Nos. 9119, 9201, 9254 and 9336 on August 18, 2015, November 16, 2015, February 5, 2016, and April 25, 2016, respectively.[10]","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the Decision,[2] dated November 26, 2020, and the Resolution,[3] dated June 2, 2021, of the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) En Banc (EB) in CTA EB No. 2111 (CTA Case Nos. 9119, 9201, 9254, and 9336).

To resolve the foregoing, this Court must re-examine the facts and the evidence offered by MGI in the courts below. It is an accepted doctrine that this Court is not a trier of facts. It is not its function to review, examine, and evaluate or weigh the probative value of the evidence presented.[55]

MGI argues, however, that certain exceptions to this rule exist in this case such that this Court should nonetheless review the CTA's findings of fact. Specifically, MGI argues that the CTA's ruling was tainted with grave abuse of discretion and its judgment was based on a misapprehension of facts.[56]

Thus, MGI asks this Court to make its own appreciation of the documents it submitted to establish its alleged zero-rated sales, particularly Official Receipt No. 0501, which was deemed illegible by the CTA EB.[57] It also reiterates its contention before the CTA EB that it had already established the existence of its zero-rated sales for the first quarter of 2014 in another case decided by the CTA EB, where refund of its input VAT incurred in TY 2012 was granted.[58] Finally, it insists that a DOE Certificate of Endorsement is not necessary to avail of the incentives under Republic Act No. 9513.

The Court disagrees with MGI. It finds no exceptions to the general rule, that this Court will not review findings of fact, obtaining in this case.

MGI alleges that the CTA EB committed grave abuse of discretion in issuing its Decision and that its judgment was based on a misapprehension of facts. However, the Court finds that MGI's Petition failed to support these allegations. It has neither shown that the CTA EB acted capriciously or whimsically in issuing its ruling, nor has it demonstrated that the CTA EB misapprehended the facts of the case. A party filing the petition has the burden of showing convincing evidence that the appeal falls under one of the exceptions. A mere assertion is not sufficient.[59]
 
MGI has complied with the statutory requirements to qualify its transactions for zero-rating	 

The first issue is whether MGI has proven that it is engaged in zero­-rated sales under Republic Act No. 9513 and its IRR, such that it qualifies for VAT zero-rating under Section 108(B)(7) and may claim a refund of input VAT under Section 112(A) of the NIRC.

Section 108(B)(7) of the NIRC reads as follows:
Sec. 108. Value-added Tax on Sale of Services and Use or Lease of Properties. –

. . . .

(B) Transactions Subject to [0%] Rate. — The following services performed in the Philippines by VAT-registered persons shall be subject to [0%] rate:

. . . .

(7) Sale of power or fuel generated through renewable sources of energy such as, but not limited to, biomass, solar, wind, hydropower, geothermal, ocean energy, and other emerging energy sources using technologies such as fuel cells and hydrogen fuels. (Emphasis supplied)
If an entity is engaged in zero-rated transactions, there is no output tax that can be credited against its input tax. Thus, said entity is allowed to obtain a credit/refund of input taxes attributable to zero-rated transactions. Section 112(A) of the NIRC provides as follows:
SEC. 112. Refunds or Tax Credits of Input Tax. —

(A) Zero-rated or Effectively Zero-rated Sales. — Any VAT­-registered person, whose sales are zero-rated or effectively zero-rated may, within two [] years after the close of the taxable quarter when the sales were made, apply for the issuance of a tax credit certificate or refund of creditable input tax due or paid attributable to such sales, except transitional input tax, to the extent that such input tax has not been applied against output tax: Provided, however, [t]hat in the case of zero-rated sales under Section 106(A)(2)(a)(1), (2) and (B) and Section 108(B)(1) and (2), the acceptable foreign currency exchange proceeds thereof had been duly accounted for in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP): Provided, further, [t]hat where the taxpayer is engaged in zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sale and also in taxable or exempt sale of goods or properties or services[] and the amount of creditable input tax due or paid cannot be directly and entirely attributed to any one of the transactions, it shall be allocated proportionately on the basis of the volume of sales. (Emphasis supplied)
As pointed out by the CTA EB, this Court, in the case of San Roque, has broken down the foregoing provision and specified the requirements for a claim for refund/tax credit[60] thereunder to prosper:
To claim refund or tax credit under Section 112(A), petitioner must comply with the following criteria: (1) the taxpayer is VAT registered; (2) the taxpayer is engaged in zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sales; (3) the input taxes are due or paid; (4) the input taxes are not transitional input taxes; (5) the input taxes have not been applied against output taxes during and in the succeeding quarters; (6) the input taxes claimed are attributable to zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sales; (7) for zero-rated sales under Section 106(A)(2)(1) and (2); 106(B); and 108(B)(1) and (2), the acceptable foreign currency exchange proceeds have been duly accounted for in accordance with BSP rules and regulations; (8) where there are both zero-­rated or effectively zero-rated sales and taxable or exempt sales, and the input taxes cannot be directly and entirely attributable to any of these sales, the input taxes shall be proportionately allocated on the basis of sales volume; and (9) the claim is filed within two years after the close of the taxable quarter when such sales were made.[61] (Emphasis supplied)
In question in the present case is whether MGI complied with the second and ninth requirements. The presence of zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sales is critical for the fulfillment of the ninth requirement, as it is from the close of the taxable quarter when such sales were made that the two-­year prescriptive period is reckoned.

As to the second requirement, MGI argues that a Certificate of Endorsement from the DOE is not indispensable for an RE Developer to avail of the incentive of VAT zero-rating under Republic Act No. 9513.[62] MGI contends that Section 15(g) of said law only requires that the taxpayer be certified as an RE Developer by the DOE, and it has complied with this requirement, as evidenced by its Certificate of Registration No. GRESC 2011-01-025.[63] Moreover, a Certificate of Endorsement from the DOE is only required to avail of the incentives under Section 15(b) of Republic Act No. 9513, i.e., duty free importation of RE machinery, equipment, and materials and the sale, transfer, or disposition of such imported capital machinery, equipment, and materials.[64]

Section 15(b) of Republic Act No. 9513 reads as follows:
Sec. 15. Incentives for Renewable Energy Projects and Activities. – RE developers of renewable energy facilities, including hybrid systems, in proportion to and to the extent of the RE component, for both power and non-power applications, as duly certified by the DOE, in consultation with the BOI, shall be entitled to the following incentives:

[. . . .]

(b) Duty-free Importation of RE Machinery, Equipment and Materials – Within the first ten [] years upon the issuance of a certification of an RE developer, the importation of machinery and equipment, and materials and parts thereof, including control and communication equipment, shall not be subject to tariff duties: Provided, however, [t]hat the said machinery, equipment, materials[,] and parts are directly and actually needed and used exclusively in the RE facilities for transformation into energy and delivery of energy to the point of use and covered by shipping documents in the name of the duly registered operator to whom the shipment will be directly delivered by customs authorities: Provided, further, [t]hat endorsement of the DOE is obtained before the importation of such machinery, equipment, materials[,] and parts are made.","FOR THESE REASONS, the instant Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[4]
Upon arraignment, accused-appellant pleaded not guilty to all the charges. Pre-trial and trial then ensued. The prosecution presented the following as witnesses: private complainants Calpito, Cando, Salazar, Untalan, Alicia Zulueta (Zulueta), and Untalan's wife, Leonora Untalan (Leonora). The CA summarized the prosecution's evidence as follows:
On different occasions, private complainants were recruited by [accused-appellant] to work in Guam for a fee.","Before the Court is an ordinary appeal[1] filed by accused-appellant Sonia Valle y Lapurga (accused-appellant) assailing the Decision[2] (CA Decision) dated July 28, 2017 of the Court of Appeals – Manila, Special Fifteenth Division (CA) in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 08412. In the questioned CA Decision, the CA affirmed the Joint Decision[3] dated December 4, 2015 of Branch 27, Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Cabanatuan City, in Criminal Case Nos. 10490 to 10493 and 12468 to 12474, convicting accused-appellant for one (1) count of illegal recruitment in large scale and four (4) counts of estafa.","The appeal is partly meritorious. The Court acquits accused-appellant on the charge of illegal recruitment in large scale but affirms the convictions for estafa.

""To prove illegal recruitment two elements must be shown, namely: (1) the person charged with the crime must have undertaken recruitment activities, or any of the activities enumerated in Article 34 of the Labor Code, as amended; and (2) said person does not have a license or authority to do so.""[17] Both the RTC and the CA found that the said elements are present in this case. The Court, however, disagrees with regard to the presence of the second element.

The Court has previously emphasized that ""non-possession of a license to recruit is an essential ingredient of the crime of illegal recruiting.""[18] A negative fact that is an element of an offense, such as the non-possession of a license, needs to be positively proved by the prosecution.[19] As with all criminal cases, the burden of proof is entirely and solely on the prosecution. ""This is the essence of the presumption of innocence; the accused need not even do anything to establish his [or her] innocence as it is already presumed.""[20] The prosecution in this case, however, failed to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that accused-appellant is a non-licensee.

As noted by the CA, the prosecution did not submit as evidence any certification from the POEA that accused-appellant is not a licensee. In previous cases involving illegal recruitment, the Court has consistently used the POEA certification as evidence of the second element of illegal recruitment.[21] The CA in this case nevertheless upheld the conviction by saying that accused-appellant herself admitted to the lack of certification.[22] The Court notes, however, that accused-appellant's testimony—which was considered by the CA as an admission—was to the effect that her sister's recruitment agency was licensed and that she had no connection with the said agency. Contrary to the CA's understanding, this was not an admission that she herself was not licensed. To recall, her entire defense was that she did not recruit private complainants at all. Therefore, the context of her statement was that it is true that she has a sister who was working at a licensed recruitment agency. It was not, however, an admission that she undertook recruitment activities while not being a licensee.

Hence, there is nothing in the record of this case that supports the second element beyond a reasonable doubt. Accused-appellant must perforce be acquitted of the illegal recruitment charge.

Accused-appellant's acquittal from the illegal recruitment case, however, does not automatically result in her acquittal in the estafa cases.

The crimes of illegal recruitment and estafa, while intertwined in many cases of recruitment, have different elements. The penal law on illegal recruitment was enacted specifically as a deterrent to those who conduct recruitment activities without having been previously vetted by the government. It is the commission of acts considered by the law as recruitment activities without possessing the necessary government license or permit which is the essence of the crime. Thus, in previous cases, the Court classified illegal recruitment as malum prohibitum,[23] where intent to deceive, for instance, is immaterial. As a result, even those who are actually capable of sending workers abroad for employment—if their licenses or permits have already expired—may still be liable for illegal recruitment.

On the other hand, the thrust of estafa under Article 315(2)(a) of the Revised Penal Code is broadly to punish those who use deceit such as false pretenses in order to gain something and to cause damage to another. Thus, the elements of the crime of estafa are as follows:
(a) there must be a false pretense, fraudulent act or fraudulent means;

(b) such false pretense, fraudulent act or fraudulent means must be made or executed prior to or simultaneously with the commission of the fraud;

(c) the offended party must have relied on the false pretense, fraudulent act or fraudulent means, that is, he or she was induced to part with his or her money or property because of the false pretense, fraudulent act or fraudulent means; and

(d) as a result thereof, the offended party suffered damage.[24]
In accused-appellant's case, she made false representations that she had the capability to send private complainants to Guam for work. Because private complainants or their relatives had personal relationships with her—with many of them considering her their ""kumare"" according to their testimonies—private complainants believed and relied on her representations. It was thus accused-appellant's false promises and misrepresentations that caused private complainants to part with their money, as payment for supposed placement and processing fees, which they never recovered from accused-appellant. The representations were false from inception as accused-appellant had absolutely no capacity to place others abroad for purposes of employment. True enough, private complainants were not able to leave for their destination or work there, or even refund the money they gave to accused-appellant because she went into hiding.

Clearly, all the elements of estafa—false pretense which was contemporaneous with the fraud, reliance, and damage capable of pecuniary estimation—are present in this case. Accused-appellant's convictions for estafa committed against Calpito, Caldo, Salazar, and Untalan should thus be affirmed. The penalties to be imposed, however, should be modified in light of the enactment of Republic Act No. 10951.[25]","ACCORDINGLY, the appeal is hereby PARTIALLY GRANTED.

"G.R. No. 260973, August 06, 2024 ","BENJAMIN TOGADO Y PAILAN, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","On May 28, 2014, Judge Cynthia R. Marino Ricablanca of the Regional Trial Court of Santa Cruz, Laguna issued Search Warrant No. 14-948 against Benjamin Togado (Togado).[1]

A portion of the Search Warrant stated:
It appears to the satisfaction of the undersigned Presiding Judge after examining under oath the applicant PO3 Arnel P. Bigata, Chief Intel, Magdalena MPS, Magdalena, Laguna, and his witness that there is probable cause to believe that the crime of Violation of R.A. 10591 (Comprehensive Firearms & Ammunitions [sic] Regulation Act), has been committed and there are good and sufficient reasons to believe that Benjamin Togado, Jr. has in his possession and control/custody unlicensed firearms and ammunitions [sic] which may be found at his residence/premises at Brgy. Buenavista, Magdalena, Laguna, and as shown in the attached sketch, which should be seized and brought to the undersigned, to wit:
a. ONE (1) cal. [.]45 pistol;
b. ONE (1) 9mm pistol;
c. ONE (I) cal. .38 revolver; and
d. Assorted ammunitions [sic].[2]
On May 29, 2014, Senior Inspector Jesus Lintag assigned Police Officer I Mar San Luis (PO1 San Luis), PO1 Marvin Alcantara (PO1 Alcantara), PO3 Emerson Bautista (PO3 Bautista), and PO3 Arnel Bigata (PO3 Bigata; collectively, the search warrant team) to carry out the search. PO3 Bigata was the team leader, while PO1 San Luis and PO1 Alcantara were the searchers.[3]

The search warrant team was first briefed before proceeding to Togado's house.

Upon arrival, the police officers showed the Search Warrant to Togado and explained its contents.[4] A few minutes later, Barangay Kagawad Juan E. Esquibel (Barangay Kagawad Esquibel) also arrived and told the search warrant team to begin the search.[5]
 
When the search warrant team entered the house, Togado ""pointed to the police officers a .45-caliber pistol placed on top of a chair.""[6]

PO1 San Luis inspected the firearm and found that its magazine had five live ammunitions.[7] PO1 San Luis secured the firearm and magazine by placing these items inside a ziplock plastic and marking the plastic with ""MMS-01 5/29/14.""[8]

The rest of the search warrant team did not find any other firearm within the premises.[9]

Thereafter, the search warrant team prepared a Certification of Orderly Search signed by PO3 Bigata as the team leader and Barangay Kagawad Esquibel as witness.[10]

The search warrant team also took photographs and prepared an inventory of the seized items.[11] The inventory was signed by Barangay Kagawad Esquibel as witness, together with PO1 San Luis and PO1 Alcantara as the seizing officers.[12]

The search warrant team informed Togado of his rights as an accused and arrested him.[13]

At the police station, Togado explained that he would use the confiscated firearm whenever he would do his rounds in the barangay (""nagroronda"").[14]

The confiscated firearm was then turned over by PO1 San Luis to PO3 Bautista.[15]

The Firearms and Explosives Office of the Philippine National Police certified that Togado was ""not a registered firearm holder of any kind or caliber per verification.""[16]

Togado was subsequently charged with violation of Section 28 of Republic Act No. 10591 or the Comprehensive Firearms and Ammunition Regulation Act for illegal possession of firearms and ammunition. The Information states:
That on the [sic] May 29, 2014, on or about 6:45 in the evening, at Brgy. Buenavista, Municipality of Magdalena, Province of Laguna, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above­named accused, without being authorized by law, did then and there willfully, unlawfully[,] and feloniously have in his possession, custody[,] and control one (1) cal. 45 pistol with Serial No. 738115, five (5) pieces of live ammunitions for calibre [sic] .45 firearm, one (1) magazine in violation of the aforementioned law.","In cases involving violations of Republic Act No. 10591 or the Comprehensive Firearms and Ammunition Regulation Act, the prosecution should present before the court the exact same firearm that was confiscated from the accused. Further, the prosecution should prove that the integrity of the confiscated firearm was preserved. Otherwise, the accused should be acquitted based on reasonable doubt.","The Court of Appeals did not err in ruling that the Search Warrant was valid, but a review of the records shows that petitioner should be acquitted on reasonable doubt because the evidence was tampered with, and the witness failed to identify with certainty the firearm and live ammunition confiscated from petitioner.

On the validity of the Search Warrant, petitioner argues that there is nothing on record that would prove that the judge personally examined the complainant and the witnesses before issuing the Search Warrant.[51] Petitioner also argues that the address at ""Brgy. Buenavista, Magdalena, Laguna"" does not describe the place to be searched with sufficient particularity.[52]

Ogayon v. People[53] instructs us that ""failure to attach to the records the depositions of the complainant and [their] witnesses and/or the transcript of the judge's examination, though contrary to the Rules, does not by itself nullify the warrant"" because such requirement ""is merely a procedural rule and not a component of the right.""[54] It was further clarified that in the absence of records, ""a warrant may still be upheld if there is evidence in the records that the requisite examination was made and probable cause was based thereon.""[55]

In this case, the Search Warrant itself stated the name of the applicant and that a witness was examined.[56] In addition, PO1 Alcantara testified that before applying for the issuance of a search warrant, he inquired with the Firearms and Explosives Office on whether petitioner is a registered firearm holder.[57]

Moreover, the place to be searched and the items to be seized were described with sufficient particularity. The Search Warrant had a map attached to it, and it also enumerated the firearms to be confiscated.[58]

Hence, there was no error on the part of the Court of Appeals in upholding the validity of the Search Warrant.

II

Nevertheless, we rule that petitioner should be acquitted on reasonable doubt.

To reiterate, the elements of violation of Section 28 of Republic Act No. 10591 are:
(a)
the existence of the subject firearm; and
(b)
the fact that the accused who possessed or owned the same does not have the corresponding license for it.[59]
The first element was not proven because of the prosecution's failure to show that the integrity of the firearm was preserved. Republic Act No. 10591 does not contain any provision on chain of custody and the proper handling of seized firearms and ammunition. However, it should be stressed that the Philippine National Police has an operations manual to guide its members on various matters, including the handling and preservation of the integrity of confiscated firearms. At the very least, the police officers should have followed its internal operations manual.

The 2021 Revised Philippine National Police Operational Procedures is the prevailing manual, but considering that this case involves a Search Warrant that was issued in 2014, we take a look at the 2013 Philippine National Police Operational Procedures Manual.[60] The pertinent provision of the operations manual states:
15.3 Mandatory Examination of Firearm Seized/Confiscated during Police Operation
All firearms, cartridges, and slugs seized, captured or recovered during checkpoints or pursuit operations or in any other police operations including those seized during the service of warrants and, more importantly, those recovered from the crime scene shall immediately be submitted to the local Crime Laboratory (CLO) which shall in turn process it for capturing and cross-matching through the Integrated Ballistics Identification System (IBIS);

The field investigation or investigator-on-case (IOC) shall submit the photo of the firearm and the receipt issued by the local Crime Laboratory Office for the said firearm/cartridges/slugs to the prosecutor or the court;

Should the prosecutor eventually require the physical submission of the firearm, the investigator-on-case shall manifest with the prosecutor or court that a subpoena be issued for the Crime Laboratory which issued the receipt to present the said firearm; and

It is also imperative that the chain of custody be strictly observed and documented and therefore, as much as practicable, it shall be the investigator-on-case (IOC) who shall personally submit the recovered firearms/shells/slugs to the local Crime Laboratory. (Emphasis supplied)
Notably, the provision does not state where the marking should be placed; only that ""the chain of custody be strictly observed and documented."" The phrase may lack specificity, but it is still a directive that a confiscating officer must be able to keep a record of the handling, safekeeping, and preservation of the seized firearm. For confiscated firearms and ammunition, it is more prudent to place the marking on the confiscated item itself, not on the plastic. Law enforcers and courts should remember that the crucial piece of evidence is the confiscated item, not the plastic containing it. Once the confiscated item is marked and placed inside a plastic container, the container should also be sealed in a manner that would indicate whether the plastic has been tampered with.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is GRANTED.

Montejo (Montejo); (2) Acidre; and (3) Victoria. An Waray obtained a total of 541,205 votes or 1.96% of the total votes cast for party-lists, thereby emerging as one of the winners of seats in the House of Representatives (HoR).[5]

Thus, in Resolution No. 0006-13[6] dated May 24, 2013 of COMELEC sitting as the National Board of Canvassers (NBOC), An Waray was one of the 14 party-list groups proclaimed as initial winners, guaranteed with one seat each.

On May 28, 2013, the NBOC issued Resolution No. 0008-13[7] which cancelled the registration of some party-list groups, resulting in the adjustment of the seat allocations. Due to this realignment, An Waray's number of seats was increased to two ""without prejudice to the proclamation of other parties, organizations or coalitions which may later on be established to be entitled to one guaranteed seat and/or additional seat.""[8]

On May 29, 2013, An Waray's second nominee, Acidre, submitted his resignation from the party, citing ""pressing personal reasons.""[9] Consequently, Victoria succeeded as An Waray's second nominee.

On June 5, 2013, the NBOC issued a Certificate of Proclamation (CoP) to An Waray as one of the winning party-lists in the 2013 NLE, entitling its first nominee, Montejo, to sit in the HoR.[10]

On June 26, 2013, Montejo took his oath of office before then House Speaker Feliciano Belmonte, Jr. (Speaker Belmonte).[11] Premised on the tally indicated in NBOC Resolution No. 0008-13, An Waray's second nominee, Victoria, took her oath of office separately on July 13, 2013 before Senator Francis Joseph ""Chiz"" Escudero.[12]

The counsel for An Waray sent a letter to the NBOC requesting for a CoP in favor of its second nominee, Victoria. In its Resolution No. 0018-13[13] dated July 17, 2013, the NBOC merely noted the letter-request.[14]

On July 16, 2013, the COMELEC En Banc accepted Acidre's resignation from An Waray through Minute Resolution No. 13-0085.

In a Decision dated October 22, 2013, the Court in Abang Lingkod Party-List v. COMELEC[15] (Abang Lingkod) reversed COMELEC's cancellation of Abang Lingkod's party-list registration. The Court thus ordered COMELEC to proclaim Abang Lingkod as one of the winning party-list groups during the 2013 NLE.[16]

On August 20, 2014, COMELEC issued NBOC Resolution No. 13-030 (PL)/0004-14 where it declared the final distribution of seats for party-list groups in accordance with the Court's computation in the landmark case of Barangay Association for National Advancement and Transparency (BANAT) v. COMELEC[17] (BANAT). In the said Resolution, An Waray was listed as entitled to only one guaranteed seat.[18]

In the years following the 2013 NLE, An Waray continued to participate in the party-list elections and was able to secure one seat in the HoR in 2016, another seat in 2019, and another seat in 2022.

On May 10, 2019, Pornias, invoking his alleged standing as a registered voter and taxpayer, and Acidre, then a sitting second nominee of Tingog Sinirangan Party-List in the HoR, filed with COMELEC a petition[19] for the cancellation of An Waray's registration pursuant to Section 6 of Republic Act No. 7941[20] or the ""Party-List System Act"". They asserted that Victoria, with the knowledge and consent of An Waray, deliberately took her oath of office as a Member of the 16th Congress not only without having been validly proclaimed by the NBOC, but also when An Waray was finally adjudged to have been legally entitled to one seat only.[21] On this score, Pornias and Acidre submitted a Memorandum dated November 29, 2018 issued by COMELEC Regional Election Director for Region VIII, certifying that, ""[b]ased on the records at hand, this office did not issue any Certificate of Proclamation to Atty. Victoria Isabel G. Noel, 2nd nominee of An Waray Party-List.""[22] They posited that the aforementioned acts constitute a violation of election laws by An Waray and Victoria, thus justifying the cancellation of An Waray's registration under Section 6(5)[23] of Republic Act No. 7941.[24]

In their Joint Verified Answer,[25] An Waray, represented by their then sitting Representative in the HoR, Florencio Gabriel ""Bem"" Noel (Bem), and Victoria, countered that from the time An Waray assumed its second seat through Victoria in 2013, no one ever questioned the same. As such, Victoria was able to discharge her official duties as representative of An Waray, without any interruption in accordance with NBOC Resolution No. 0008-13, which has not been revoked, amended, or vacated by COMELEC.[26] They also averred that the petition failed to present any legal basis in its conclusion that An Waray or Victoria committed any violation of election laws.[27]","Before the Court is a Petition for Certiorari with Urgent Prayer for Preliminary Injunction, Temporary Restraining Order and/or Status Quo Ante Order with Motion for Conduct of Special Raffle[1] (Petition) filed under Rule 64, in relation to Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, which assails the following Resolutions issued by public respondent Commission on Elections (COMELEC) in SPP No. 19-008:
1.
Resolution[2] dated June 2, 2023 of the COMELEC Second Division, granting the petition of private respondents Danilo T. Pornias, Jr. (Pornias) and Jude A. Acidre (Acidre) for cancellation of the registration of petitioner An Waray Party-List (An Waray) as a party-list organization; and


2.
Resolution[3] dated August 14, 2023 of the COMELEC En Banc, denying petitioners An Waray and Victoria Isabel Noel's (Victoria) (collectively, petitioners) motion for reconsideration.","The Petition is dismissed for lack of merit.

At the outset, the Court resolves the issue of jurisdiction. Specifically, An Waray alleges that the HRET has exclusive jurisdiction over the case because Bem and Victoria had already become members of the HoR. Respondents counter that it is COMELEC which has jurisdiction, as clearly and categorically provided in the Constitution and Republic Act No. 7941. The significance of this issue in the present case is that if it is the HRET that has sole jurisdiction, then the same likewise excludes the Court and only after the HRET has decided and such decision has been brought to the Court on petition for review can the Court properly take cognizance of the case.

It is well to mention that the COMELEC-HRET jurisdiction issue is a staple issue raised in virtually every case involving the qualifications or eligibilities of candidates for Congress and the Senate which are filed with these two bodies or with the Court, if the same are resolved after such candidates have already won in the elections. In most of these cases, the underlying issue of whether the candidate has already legally become a Member of the HoR oftentimes becomes the determinant question, the answer to which identifies the body having jurisdiction. Thus, in most of these cases, the controversy and the arguments revolved around the requisites of becoming a Member of the HoR, that is: 1) a valid proclamation, 2) a valid oath of office, and 3) assumption to the office sought.

This is not, however, the determinant issue in this case. That Bem and Victoria became HoR Members and the relevant dates therefor are facts which are not contested. The issue here is whether the cancellation of An Waray's registration falls under the HRET's jurisdiction on account of its effect upon the status of Bem's membership in the HoR and the validity of Victoria's past membership therein. Stated otherwise, the jurisdiction issue here relates more to the nature of the action filed, assuming as a given that petitioner party-list won in the last elections and has a nominee sitting as a Member of the HoR.

COMELEC has the exclusive jurisdiction to rule on the cancellation of An Waray's party-list registration, as it is categorically provided such power to cancel party-list registrations under the law.
Foremost, as jurisdiction is a matter of substantive law, reference to the Constitution or statute is necessary. The main case from which the present certiorari petition stemmed, is a petition for the cancellation of An Waray's party-list registration. Hence, to determine which body possesses jurisdiction over the case, one need only to refer to the law conferring the same.

Jurisdiction over cancellation of party-list registrations is categorically conferred by Section 6 of Republic Act No. 7941 on COMELEC, thus:

SEC. 6. Refusal and/or Cancellation of Registration. – The COMELEC may, motu proprio or upon verified complaint of any interested party, refuse or cancel, after due notice and hearing, the registration of any national, regional or sectoral party, organization or coalition on any of the following grounds:

(1) It is a religious sect or denomination, organization or association organized for religious purposes;

(2) It advocates violence or unlawful means to seek its goal;

(3) It is a foreign party or organization;

(4) It is receiving support from any foreign government, foreign political party, foundation, organization, whether directly or through any of its officers or members or indirectly through third parties for partisan election purposes;

(5) It violates or fails to comply with laws, rules or regulations relating to elections;

(6) It declares untruthful statements in its petition;

(7) It has ceased to exist for at least one (1) year; or

(8) It fails to participate in the last two (2) preceding elections or fails to obtain at least two percentum (2%) of the votes cast under the party­-list system in the two (2) preceding elections for the constituency in which it has registered. (Emphasis supplied)

This power of COMELEC is recognized in the Constitution, as it likewise grants to COMELEC the concomitant power to register party-list organizations. Article IX-C, Section 2 provides:

SECTION 2. The Commission on Elections shall exercise the following powers and functions:

. . . .

(5) Register, after sufficient publication, political parties, organizations, or coalitions which, in addition to other requirements, must present their platform or program of government; and accredit citizens' arms of the Commission on Elections. Religious denominations and sects shall not be registered. Those which seek to achieve their goals through violence or unlawful means, or refuse to uphold and adhere to this Constitution, or which are supported by any foreign government shall likewise be refused registration.

Financial contributions from foreign governments and their agencies to political parties, organizations, coalitions, or candidates related to elections constitute interference in national affairs, and, when accepted, shall be an additional ground for the cancellation of their registration with the Commission, in addition to other penalties that may be prescribed by law. (Emphasis supplied)

The power of COMELEC to register party-lists is echoed in Republic Act No. 7941, which confers upon COMELEC the sole and exclusive jurisdiction to act on petitions for registration of party-lists, after the same is published and after the parties are given due notice and hearing. Needless to say, the discretion of COMELEC when it acts on petitions for registration includes denying such petitions. Republic Act No. 7941 provides:

SEC. 3. Definition of Terms. – (a) The party-list system is a mechanism of proportional representation in the election of representatives to the House of Representatives from national, regional and sectoral parties or organizations or coalitions thereof registered with the Commission on Elections (COMELEC). Component parties or organizations of a coalition may participate independently provided the coalition of which they form part does not participate in the party-list system.

. . . .

SEC. 5. Registration. – Any organized group of persons may register as a party, organization or coalition for purposes of the party-list system by filing with the COMELEC not later than ninety (90) days before the election a petition verified by its president or secretary stating its desire to participate in the party-list system as a national, regional or sectoral party or organization or a coalition of such parties or organizations, attaching thereto its constitution, by-laws, platform or program of government, list of officers, coalition agreement and other relevant information as the COMELEC may require: Provided, That the sectors shall include labor, peasant, fisherfolk, urban poor, indigenous cultural communities, elderly, handicapped, women, youth, veterans, overseas workers, and professionals.

The COMELEC shall publish the petition in at least two (2) national newspapers of general circulation.

The COMELEC shall, after due notice and hearing, resolve the petition within fifteen (15) days from the date it was submitted for decision but in no case not later than sixty (60) days before election.

Clearly, both the Constitution and the statute—Republic Act No. 7941—categorically vest in COMELEC the power and authority to decide on matters relating to an organization's participation in the party-list system—from the grant or denial of its petition for registration as a party, organization or coalition to participate in the party-list elections, to the cancellation of a previously granted registration.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Certiorari is DISMISSED. The Urgent Prayer for Preliminary Injunction, Temporary Restraining Order and/or Status Quo Ante Order with Motion for Conduct of Special Raffle under Rule 64, in relation to Rule 65 of the Rules of Court is likewise DENIED. The assailed Resolution dated June 2, 2023 of the Commission on Elections Second Division and Resolution dated August 14, 2023 of the Commission on Elections En Banc in SPP No. 19-008 are hereby AFFIRMED."
"G.R. No. 265847, August 06, 2024","MA. ZARAH ROSE DE GUZMAN-­LARA, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS AND MANUEL N. MAMBA, RESPONDENTS.","During the May 2022 National and Local Elections (NLE), Lara and Mamba were candidates for the position of Governor of the Province of Cagayan. Mamba was then the incumbent Governor of the said province, having been elected as such during the May 2019 NLE.[4]

Lara filed a Petition[5] dated May 10, 2022, seeking the disqualification of Mamba as a candidate for the position of Governor of the Province of Cagayan in the May 2022 NLE on the grounds of massive vote-buying activities and unlawful disbursement of public funds, in blatant violations of Section 68[6] of the Omnibus Election Code (OEC).[7] In the same Petition, Lara likewise prayed that the COMELEC order and direct the Board of Canvassers to suspend and hold in abeyance the proclamation of Mamba as winner, should the latter receive the highest number of votes in the elections.[8]

Specifically, Lara averred that Mamba used the funds of the provincial government of Cagayan to distribute cash assistance ""ayuda"" to voters under the following programs: (1) ""No Barangay Left Behind;"" (2) ""No Town Left Behind;"" (3) Oplan Tulong sa Barangay;"" (4) and ""Krusada Kontra Korapsyon."" Lara likewise contended that the disbursements were done during the campaign period of March 25 to May 8, 2022.[9]

On May 11, 2022, the Provincial Board of Canvassers proclaimed Mamba as the duly elected Governor for the Province of Cagayan after garnering the highest number of votes legally cast for the said office.[10]

On December 14, 2022, the COMELEC Second Division issued a Resolution[11] granting Lara's Petition for Disqualification and disqualifying Mamba as a candidate for the position of Governor of the Province of Cagayan in the May 2022 NLE:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Petition is GRANTED. Respondent MANUEL N. MAMBA is DISQUALIFIED as a candidate for the position of Governor of the Province of Cagayan in the 09 May 2022 National and Local Elections.

Let the records of the case be forwarded to the Law Department of this Commission for the conduct of preliminary investigation relative to the election offense aspect of this case.

SO ORDERED.[12]
The COMELEC Second Division ruled that the pieces of evidence submitted by Lara were not substantial to disqualify Mamba on the ground of violation of Section 68 of the OEC. It noted that while the pieces of evidence showed that the conduct of cash distribution occurred, Mamba merely implemented the same in his capacity as Governor. Thus, it was not shown that the acts were done for the purpose of influencing, inducing, or corrupting the voters, as required under Section 68 of the OEC.[13]","This Court resolves the Petition for Certiorari[1] filed by Ma. Zarah Rose De Guzman-Lara (Lara), assailing the Resolution[2] of the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) En Banc and praying that the Resolution[3] of the COMELEC Second Division be affirmed. Lara avers that the COMELEC committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in dismissing the Petition for Disqualification she filed against private respondent Manuel N. Mamba (Mamba).","The Petition is meritorious.

To begin with, this Court, not being a trier of facts, shall only step in if there is a showing that the COMELEC En Banc committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. As defined, grave abuse of discretion means ""such capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to an excess or lack of jurisdiction. The abuse of discretion must be so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of a positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law[.]""[24] Thus, if it is sufficiently shown that the COMELEC En Banc exercised its power ""capriciously, arbitrarily, whimsically, or without basis under the law or the Constitution[,]"" this Court is otherwise duty-bound to ""redirect COMELEC's course along constitutional channels.""[25]

To recall, petitioner ascribes grave abuse of discretion on the part of the COMELEC for having ruled in the assailed Resolution that: (1) the Petition to disqualify respondent was filed out of time and must necessarily be dismissed; and (2) the belated filing thereof was in fact an infirmity which divests the COMELEC from jurisdiction to resolve the issues in the Petition for Disqualification.

After a judicious examination of the case, this Court is persuaded that the COMELEC gravely abused its discretion.

On procedural grounds, the COMELEC should have granted due course to the Petition for Disqualification by exercising liberality in the application of its procedural rules.

In dismissing the Petition for Disqualification as having been filed out of time, the COMELEC relied on Section 5, Rule 2, COMELEC Resolution No. 10673,[26] which provides for guidelines on the electronic filing of pleadings before the COMELEC:
SECTION 5. Schedule of Filing through E-mail. – The schedule of filing of verified pleadings, memoranda, comments, briefs, and other submissions through E-mail shall be from Monday to Friday, 8:00 am to 5:00 pm, excluding holidays. E-mails received beyond 5:00 pm shall be considered filed at 8:00 am of the next working day.
 
Where a deadline falls on a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday, official transaction shall be done on the next working day. (Emphasis supplied)
Indeed, a straightforward application of Section 5 reveals the Petition for Disqualification, filed via electronic mail on May 10, 2022, was filed out of time. The time stamp of the electronic mail, a copy of which is attached to the instant Petition, indicates that it was sent on 6:21 p.m. After a few hours, respondent was proclaimed as the winning candidate on May 11, 2022, at 1:39 a.m. Thus, the COMELEC denied the Petition for Disqualification pursuant to Section 5, which instructs that pleadings filed through electronic mail and received beyond 5:00 p.m. are considered filed at 8:00 a.m. of the next working day.

Nevertheless, in stringently applying its procedural rules, the COMELEC clearly lost sight of the peculiar nature of elections cases. After all, ""elections cases are, at all times, invested with public interest which cannot be defeated by mere procedural or technical infirmities.""[27]

Time and again, this Court has chosen to uphold the relaxation of election procedural rules in the interest of substantial justice. In the recent case of Uy v. Commission on Elections,[28] the COMELEC denied the petitioner's motion for reconsideration for being filed a day late, following the rule that any pleading sent through electronic mail beyond 5:00 p.m. would be deemed filed on the following day. Nonetheless, the COMELEC notably resolved the merits of the instant motion, which declared the petitioner as a nuisance candidate. In ruling that the Resolution by the COMELEC denying the motion for reconsideration was tainted with grave abuse of discretion, this Court held:
On April 19, 2022, Frederico received via electronic mail the COMELEC Second Division's Resolution declaring him a nuisance candidate. Frederico had five days from notice to move for reconsideration or until April 24, 2022. Considering that the last day fell on a Sunday, the time shall not run until the next working day. Accordingly, Frederico sent the Motion for Reconsideration through electronic mail on April 25, 2022, at 6:23 p.m. The COMELEC En Banc denied the Motion for being filed a day late following the rule that any pleading sent through electronic mail beyond 5:00 p.m. is deemed filed the following day. Nonetheless, the COMELEC affirmed the finding that Frederico is a nuisance candidate.

On this point, we cannot overemphasize that courts have always tried to maintain a healthy balance between the strict enforcement of procedural laws and the guarantee that every litigant be given the full opportunity for the just disposition of his cause. The Court has allowed several cases to proceed in the broader interest of justice despite procedural defects and lapses. These rulings are in keeping with the principle that rules of procedure are mere tools designed to facilitate the attainment of justice. Specifically, the COMELEC Rules of Procedure provides that '[i]n the interest of justice and in order to obtain speedy disposition of all matters pending before the Commission, these rules and any portion thereof may be suspended by the Commission.' Here, the COMELEC En Banc is deemed to have relaxed its procedures when it resolved the merits of the motion for reconsideration. In any event, the circumstances of the case merit the liberal application of the rules in the interest of substantial justice. The COMELEC received Frederico's Motion only more than an hour past 5:00 p.m. More importantly, the issue of whether Frederico is a nuisance candidate is determinative not only of the proper treatment of his votes but also as to the outcome of the elections. The grave injustice to Frederico is likewise not commensurate with his failure to comply with the rules.[29] (Emphasis supplied)
As in Uy, the issue of respondent's qualifications as a candidate for the position of Governor of the Province of Cagayan is crucial to the outcome of his votes and to the result of the elections. Accordingly, the analogous circumstances in Uy in relation to the instant case justifies a relaxation of the COMELEC rules of procedure in the interest of substantial justice. Verily, this Court finds no reason why the liberal interpretation of procedural rules accorded in Uy should not be applied in this case.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Certiorari is GRANTED. The March 6, 2023 Resolution of the Commission on Elections En Banc in SPA Case No. 22-089 (DC) is ANNULLED and SET ASIDE.

This case is REMANDED to the Commission on Elections En Banc for the proper disposition of Ma. Zarah Rose De Guzman-Lara's Petition for Disqualification against Manuel N. Mamba."
"A.M. No. MTJ-24-023 (Formerly OCA IPI No. 18-2966-MTJ), August 06, 2024","TEDWIN T. UY, COMPLAINANT, VS. PRESIDING JUDGE JORGE EMMANUEL M. LORREDO, METROPOLITAN TRIAL COURT, BRANCH 26, MANILA, RESPONDENT.","This resolves the Complaint-Affidavit[3] filed by Tedwin T. Uy (Tedwin) against Hon. Jorge Emmanuel M. Lorredo (Judge Lorredo) for exhibiting partiality in the administration of justice, conduct unbecoming of a judge, and irregularity in the performance of his official duties.

In his complaint, Tedwin alleged that Judge Lorredo actively participated in the criminal case hearings where the former was a co-accused. The transcribed stenographer's notes show that Judge Lorredo had made more entries, i.e., questions, comments, and manifestations, than the prosecutor and defense's counsels combined. Specifically, Judge Lorredo's entries numbered to 507, while the total of the prosecutor and the defense counsel's only amounted to 356.[4]

Further, Tedwin asserted that Judge Lorredo's statements and questions were not merely clarificatory but were adversarial, intimidating, oppressive, and outright cruel. During the presentation of Tedwin's daughter, Trisha Uy (Trisha), Judge Lorredo asked if she was mentally retarded, under medication, or downright stupid. As such, his statements were offensive, distasteful, inexcusable, and made at the expense of the court's integrity.[5]

Even Tedwin's then newly minted lawyer, Atty. Erly Ecal (Atty. Ecal), became the subject of Judge Lorredo's remarks. The latter kept interrupting her with questions, and intimidated and oppressed her. Further, he repeatedly questioned Atty. Ecal's competency as a lawyer as well as her educational attainment, going so far as to say that Atty. Ecal was ""[k]ulang ang aral.""[6]

Finally, Tedwin pointed out that this Court had previously found Judge Lorredo administratively liable for failing to exercise caution in his speech and in his conduct and admonished him to observe judicial temperament and avoid offensive or intemperate language.[7]

In his Comment,[8] Judge Lorredo asserted that he was merely performing his duty as a judge to ask questions to determine the accused's guilt. As the witnesses were very clever and evasive, he had to phrase his questions in a manner that would lead to the truth. He explained that he asked Trisha whether she was stupid, retarded, or under medication to prevent her from later claiming that these grounds affected her testimony.[9]

In its Report,[10] the Judicial Integrity Board recommended that Judge Lorredo be found guilty of unbecoming conduct and be ordered to pay a fine of PHP 10,000.00 with a stern warning that a repetition of the same or any similar act in the future will be dealt with more severely.[11]

The Judicial Integrity Board agreed that Judge Lorredo was exercising his judicial functions by actively participating in the examination of witnesses, as required by the Judicial Affidavit Rule. It observed that both Tedwin and Trisha gave evasive answers, necessitating Judge Lorredo's intervention.[12]

Nonetheless, Judge Lorredo's manner of asking questions and intemperate language constitute unbecoming conduct of a judge. His use of the words ""stupid,"" ""mentally retarded,"" and ""on medication"" were unnecessary and inappropriate. As a visible representation of the law, judges should conduct themselves in a manner above suspicion and reproach.[13]

The Judicial Integrity Board noted that Judge Lorredo was already sanctioned for his use of intemperate language in a previous administrative case and ordered to pay a fine of PHP 5,000.00 for unbecoming conduct of a judge. Thus, the Judicial Integrity Board recommended the imposition of a PHP 10,000.00 fine in accordance with Rule 140, as further amended by A.M. No. 21-08-09-SC.[14]

The sole issue for this Court's resolution is whether respondent should be held administratively liable for his actions.","Dismissal is the proper penalty for judges who repeatedly fail to meet the exacting standards of those allowed to don the judicial robes. This measure is necessary to ""protect and preserve the image and integrity of the entire judiciary.""[1] As the judicial service ""demands the best possible men and women from the service..., the Court will not hesitate to discipline its members who taint its image in the eyes of the public.""[2]","This Court has not hesitated to dismiss those who repeatedly fail to meet the exacting standards of those allowed to don the judicial robes, evident in the recent cases of Judge Larida v. Atty. Calma[33] and Re: Jose S. Jacinto.[34]

The same situation obtains here. Despite numerous warnings from this Court, the suspension of 30 days, and the imposition of fines that totaled PHP 55,000.00, respondent continues to commit the same offenses, showcasing his propensity to disregard the provisions of the New Code of Judicial Conduct. Further, his refusal to heed the various stern warnings reveals his obstinate attitude and utter disregard for this Court's authority. Evidently, this Court has no other recourse but to dismiss him from service, to ""protect and preserve the image and integrity of the entire judiciary.""[35]

As earlier discussed, respondent violated multiple provisions of the New Code of Judicial Conduct, i.e., Canon 2, Sections 1 and 2; Canon 3, Section 2; Canon 4, Section 1; Canon 5, Section 2; and Canon 6, Section 6. During deliberations Associate Justice Maria Filomena D. Singh correctly pointed out that that these constitute individual counts of unbecoming conduct.

Having been dismissed for the first count, respondent must be penalized for the remaining five counts of unbecoming conduct. Given the circumstances of this case, this Court deems it appropriate to impose upon him the maximum fine of PHP 35,000.00 for the remaining five counts of unbecoming conduct, amounting to a total of PHP 175,000.00.[36] This must be paid in accordance with Rule 140, Section 22.
SECTION 22. Payment of Fines. — When the penalty imposed is a fine, the respondent shall pay it within a period not exceeding three (3) months from the time the decision or resolution is promulgated. If unpaid, such amount may be deducted from the salaries and benefits, including accrued leave credits, due to the respondent. The deduction of unpaid fines from accrued leave credits, which is considered as a form of compensation, is not tantamount to the imposition of the accessory penalty of forfeiture covered under the provisions of this Rule.[37]
As the judicial service ""demands the best possible men and women from the service..., the Court will not hesitate to discipline its members who taint its image in the eyes of the public.""[38]","ACCORDINGLY, Hon. Jorge Emmanuel M. Lorredo, Presiding Judge, Branch 26, Metropolitan Trial Court of Manila is found GUILTY of unbecoming conduct. He is ordered DISMISSED from the service with forfeiture of all retirement benefits, except accrued leave credits, and perpetually disqualified from holding public office in any branch or instrumentality of the government, including government-owned or controlled corporations. He is also hereby ordered to PAY a FINE in the amount of PHP 35,000.00 for five counts of unbecoming conduct or a total of PHP 175,000.00 within a period not exceeding three months from the time this Decision is promulgated."
"G.R. No. 259815 (Formerly UDK 17421), August 05, 2024","MAZY'S CAPITAL, INC., PETITIONER, VS. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, REPRESENTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF NATIONAL DEFENSE, RESPONDENT.","The controversy involves a 46,143-square meter property known as Lot No. 937 (Lot 937 or subject property) located in Cebu City. Lot 937 was part of the Banilad Friar Lands Estate (Friar Lands) which has been the subject of several disputes that have reached the Court through the years.[5] Much like the other Friar Lands cases, the Court is again faced with the issue of who between two contending parties is the rightful owner of the disputed property, the determination of which is best resolved after the Court first exhaustively examines the history of the present case.

Civil Case No. 781:
1938 Expropriation Proceedings

On September 5, 1938, or 86 years ago, the Commonwealth of the Philippines (Commonwealth) filed before the Court of First Instance of Cebu (CFI), an expropriation complaint[6] against various landowners of the Friar Lands, which was docketed as Civil Case No. 781 (Expropriation Case). The purpose of the expropriation was to carry out the development program of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) under the National Defense Act.[7] Among the parcels of land included in the Expropriation Case was Lot 937 which was registered under Transfer Certificate of Transfer (TCT) No. 5306[8] in the name of Eutiquio Uy Godinez[9] (Eutiquio), married to Felisa Sy Cip[10] (Felisa). Lot 937 was provisionally valued at PHP 1,845.72 in the Commonwealth's complaint.[11] As administratrix of Eutiquio's estate, Felisa filed her Answer.[12] In due course, the Commonwealth deposited the amount of PHP 9,500.00 with the Provincial Treasurer of Cebu as provisional value of all the lots to be expropriated.[13] Thereafter, the Commonwealth supposedly took possession of Lot 937.[14]

During the pendency of the proceedings, Felisa filed a motion[15] stating that she found the value of PHP 1,845.72 acceptable as just compensation for Lot 937 and prayed that the Commonwealth, which was already in possession of Lot 937, be ordered to pay her the said amount.[16] The CFI granted Felisa's motion in a Decision Parcial[17] dated April 22, 1939 (1939 Partial Decision). Pursuant thereto, the Commonwealth supposedly paid Felisa the amount of PHP 1,845.72, as evidenced by a Provincial Voucher[18] dated May 25, 1939.

Eventually, the CFI rendered a Decision[19] dated May 14, 1940 (1940 Decision), which set the amount of just compensation for each of the expropriated lots and ordered the government to pay the same. As regards Lot 937, the CFI deemed the same as already resolved based on the 1939 Partial Decision.[20]

World War II broke out in the Philippines in 1941 which ended only in 1945 after the Battle of Manila when the Philippines was liberated from Japanese occupation. The disruption by the war caused several controversies over the legal ownership and possession of the Friar Lands between the Philippine Army and the landowners and possessors thereof. Based on Federated Realty Corporation v. CA,[21] all 18 lots subject of the Expropriation Case were later converted into a national airport in 1947 by virtue of a Presidential Proclamation.[22]

G.L.R.O. Record No. 5988:
1954 Reconstitution of Title Case

On March 12, 1954, a Petition for Judicial Reconstitution of Title[23] was filed with the CFI. The petition was filed by Ramona U. Agustines, a supposed attorney-in-fact of Mariano Godinez (Mariano), Eutiquio's son, and alleged that Mariano inherited the property from Eutiquio and was the registered owner of Lot 937 which was covered by a title before the war; and that due to loss of records, the title number could no longer be determined. The petition claimed that Mariano was in possession of the property and that it was not encumbered, pledged, or sold. The case was docketed as G.L.R.O. Record No. 5988 (Reconstitution Case).

In an Order[24] dated March 1, 1956, the CFI granted the petition after finding that: (1) Mariano was the registered owner of the lot; and (2) both the owner's duplicate and the original copy of a certificate of title covering Lot 937 kept in the office of the Register of Deeds of Cebu had been lost or destroyed during the war. The CFI thus directed the Registry of Deeds of Cebu to issue a reconstituted title in the name of Mariano. Accordingly, Mariano was issued TCT No. RT-6757.

Civil Case No. CEB-19845:
1997 Reivindicatoria Action

On January 27, 1997, Eugenio Amores and Domingo Antigua, supposed attorneys-in-fact of Mariano, filed with Branch 9, RTC, Cebu City, (RTC-Br. 9) a reivindicatoria complaint[25] against the Republic, alleging that Mariano is the absolute and exclusive owner of Lot 937.[26] The case was docketed as Civil Case No. CEB-19845 (Reivindicatoria Case). In the complaint, it is alleged that Mariano was always in possession of the property through his overseer until the early 1990s when the Republic, through the Philippine National Police (PNP), took possession of the same based on the expropriation case notwithstanding the non-payment of just compensation. The PNP allegedly entered the property and constructed buildings and other structures on the property.[27]","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court[1] (Petition) filed by petitioner Mazy's Capital, Inc. (Mazy's) against respondent Republic of the Philippines (Republic), represented by the Department of National Defense (DND), assailing the Decision[2] dated March 20, 2020 and Resolution[3] dated September 30, 2021 issued by the Court of Appeals (CA), Cebu City in CA-G.R. CV No. 05860.[4] The CA reversed the dismissal of the Republic's Complaint for cancellation of reconstituted title and remanded the case to Branch 12, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Cebu City (RTC-Br. 12) for further proceedings.","Before the Court resolves the central issue pointed out earlier, there are several procedural matters which the Court must wade through.

A. RTC's Jurisdiction

Mazy's questions the RTC-Br. 12's jurisdiction, arguing that the Republic's Complaint is actually an action for annulment of judgment under Rule 47 as it seeks to nullify the judgment or order of the CFI that rendered a decision in the Reivindicatoria Case. Mazy's asserts that the RTC-Br. 12 has no jurisdiction as it cannot interfere with, much less annul, the orders or judgments of a co-equal court, owing to the doctrine of judicial stability or non-interference.[126]

The Court is not convinced and will lay to rest any doubts on the RTC­-Br. 12's jurisdiction in this case.

It is basic that jurisdiction over the subject matter of a case is conferred by law and determined by the allegations in the complaint which comprise the ultimate facts constituting the plaintiffs cause of action.[127] The nature of an action and which court has jurisdiction over it are determined based on the allegations and relief sought in the complaint.[128]

In Denila v. Republic,[129] the Court clarified that subject matter jurisdiction is only one of the several aspects of a court's jurisdiction. In order to exercise its powers validly and with binding effect, the court must also have jurisdiction over the issues, which the Court explained in this wise:
Jurisdiction is the basic foundation of judicial proceedings. It is simply defined as the power and authority — conferred by the Constitution or statute — of a court to hear and decide a case. Without jurisdiction, a judgment rendered by a court is null and void and may be attacked anytime. Indeed, a void judgment is no judgment at all — it can neither be the source of any right nor the creator of any obligation; all acts performed pursuant to it and all claims emanating from it have no legal effect.

In adjudication, the concept of jurisdiction has several aspects, namely: (a) jurisdiction over the subject matter; (b) jurisdiction over the parties; (c) jurisdiction over the issues of the case; and (d) in cases involving property, jurisdiction over the res or the thing which is the subject of the litigation. Additionally, a court must also acquire jurisdiction over the remedy in order for it to exercise its powers validly and with binding effect.

... Third, jurisdiction over the issues pertains to a tribunal's power and authority to decide over matters which are either disputed by the parties or simply under consideration. This aspect of jurisdiction is closely tied to jurisdiction over the remedy and over the subject matter which, in turn, is generally determined in the allegations of the initiatory pleading (complaint or petition) and not the result of proof. However, unlike jurisdiction over the subject-matter, jurisdiction over the issues may be conferred by either express or implied consent of the parties.[130] (Emphasis in the original; citations omitted)
From Mazy's arguments, it appears that it is questioning the RTC-Br. 12's exercise of jurisdiction over both the subject matter and the issues raised in this case.

At the time of the filing of the complaint, Batas Pambansa Blg. 129,[131] as amended, granted the RTC with exclusive original jurisdiction—
""(1) In all civil actions in which the subject of the litigation is incapable of pecuniary estimation;

""(2) In all civil actions which involve the title to, or possession of, real property, or any interest therein, where the assessed value of the property involved exceeds [PHP 300,000.00] or for civil actions in Metro Manila, where such value exceeds [PHP 400,000.00] except actions for forcible entry into and unlawful detainer of lands or buildings, original jurisdiction over which is conferred upon the Metropolitan Trial Courts, Municipal Trial Courts, and Municipal Circuit Trial Courts[.][132] (Emphasis supplied)
Before examining the Republic's Complaint, the Court first lays down the applicable legal principles.

In First Sarmiento Property Holdings, Inc. v. Philippine Bank of Communications,[133] the Court en banc ruled that the nature of an action is determined by the principal relief sought in the complaint. The Court distinguished the ""nature of the principal action or remedy"" from its consequences. Thus, an action involving the recovery of a sum of money may not necessarily be capable of pecuniary estimation if it is merely a consequence of a primary relief, such as an action for support or for foreclosure of mortgage, which cannot be estimated in terms of money and are therefore actions that are incapable of pecuniary estimation.[134] Moreover, ""if the primary cause of action is based on a claim of ownership or a claim of legal right to control, possess, dispose, or enjoy such property, the action is a real action involving title to real property.""[135]

Now looking at the Republic's Complaint, it is evident that the Republic essentially alleges that: (1) it is the ""rightful and lawful owner"" of Lot 937, having already expropriated the same and paid the corresponding amount of just compensation in 1939; (2) Mariano did not disclose this fact, among other things, to the CFI in the Reconstitution Case; and (3) such failure amounts to fraud which warrants the nullification of Mariano's TCT No. RT-6757, and all its derivative titles, if any.[136] Notably, the Republic did not pray that title to the property be reconveyed to it. It simply prayed for a judgment:
1. To declare as null and void and to order the cancellation of TCT No. RT-6757 covering Lot 937 in the name of defendant Mariano Godinez, as well as its derivative titles, if any;

2. To order defendant Mariano Godinez or any person in possession of the owner's copy of said TCT No. RT-6757 to surrender the same to the Registrar of Deeds of Cebu City;

3. For the Register of Deeds of Cebu City to cause the cancellation of TCT No. RT-6757 as well as of all its derivative titles, if there are any; and

4. To order defendant Mariano Godinez to pay the costs of suit as well as all the damages suffered by the plaintiff.

Other reliefs just and equitable under the premises are likewise prayed for.[137]
Based on the foregoing allegations, the Court is convinced that the Complaint is one that involves title to real property, not one that is incapable of pecuniary estimation. The principal relief sought is the cancellation of Mariano's title and any of its derivative titles on the ground of fraud supposedly perpetrated in the Reconstitution Case. This theory is premised on the Republic's assertion of ownership over Lot 937.

The next question that comes to fore is whether the assessed value of the subject property falls within the RTC's jurisdiction.

The general rule in real actions is that the complaint must allege the property's assessed value to determine which between the RTCs and the first­-level courts have jurisdiction over the same.[138] Strict compliance with this rule, however, may be relaxed if the assessed value of the property, though not alleged in the complaint, can be identified from the documents annexed to the complaint.[139]

Here, while the assessed value of Lot 937 was not alleged in the Republic's Complaint, the same can be found in the Reivindicatoria Complaint attached as Annex ""P"" thereof,[140] which states that the assessed value of the property is PHP 3,460,730.00.[141] This value places the action within the RTC's jurisdiction.

As to Mazy's argument on judicial stability and non-interference, this also has no merit.","WHEREFORE, the Petition is DENIED for lack of merit. The following are hereby declared NULL and VOID: (a) the Order dated March 1, 1956 issued by the Court of First Instance of Cebu in G.L.R.O. Record No. 5988 (Lot No. 937); (b) the reconstituted Transfer Certificate of Title No. RT-6757 in the name of Mariano Godinez; and (c) the Decision dated April 18, 2002 issued by Branch 9, Regional Trial Court of Cebu City, in Civil Case No. CEB-19845.

The instant case is hereby REMANDED to the Court of Appeals for further proceedings to hear and resolve with reasonable dispatch the issue of whether or not Mazy's Capital, Inc. is an innocent purchaser for value, whether the Republic is guilty of estoppel, and any other defense or claim that the parties may raise which has not yet been disposed of in this Decision, in accordance with this Decision. The Court of Appeals is hereby DIRECTED to cause the raffle of the case for purposes of this remand. Thereafter, the Court of Appeals is DIRECTED to submit to the Court its resolution in a sealed report. The Court of Appeals is tasked to hear and receive evidence, conclude the proceedings, and submit to this Court a report on its findings and recommended conclusions within three (3) months from finality of this Decision."
"G.R. No. 217368*, August 05, 2024","RUBY SHELTER BUILDERS AND REALTY DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION, REPRESENTED BY ITS PRESIDENT, RUBEN SIA, PETITIONER, VS. ROMEO Y. TAN, ROBERTO L. OBIEDO AND ATTY. TOMAS A. REYES, RESPONDENTS.","Petitioner Ruby Shelter Builders and Realty Development Corporation (Ruby Shelter) obtained a loan from respondents Romeo Y. Tan and Roberto L. Obiedo (Tan and Obiedo), which was secured by a Real Estate Mortgage covering five parcels of land with Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) Nos. 29918, 38374, 38376, 39225 and 39232 located at Concepcion Pequeña, Naga City. As of March 2005, Ruby Shelter's outstanding debt amounted to PHP 95,700,620.00. In order to secure an extension for the re-payment of the loan, the parties executed a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) dated March 17, 2005, the pertinent portions of which are hereby reproduced:

1. That the FIRST PARTY is indebted to the SECOND PARTY in the aggregate sum of NINETY[-]FIVE MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED TWENTY PESOS [(PHP 95,700,620.00)], Philippine currency, covered by Real Estate Mortgages over five (5) parcels of land enumerated in paragraph 3 hereof.

2. That because of the FIRST PARTY's corporate offer to simultaneously execute Deeds of Absolute Sale over the properties as provided for and listed in paragraph 3 hereof, the SECOND PARTY here allows the FIRST PARTY to pay the said indebtedness, on or before [December 31, 2005]. Moreover, the SECOND PARTY hereby agrees to condone and/or write off the interests, penalties and surcharges from October 1, 2004 to December 31, 2005, or a total period of fifteen (15) months, amounting to SEVENTY[-]FOUR MILLION SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY[-]EIGHT THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FORTY[-]SEVEN PESOS [(PHP 74,678,647.00)].

3. Upon the execution hereof, and, by way of dacion en pago, the FIRST PARTY shall execute deeds of absolute sale to be uniformly dated January 2, 2006, over the following properties in favor of the SECOND PARTY, with the corresponding purchase prices, thus:

. . . .

4. The FIRST PARTY is here allowed to pay off the indebtedness covered by the Real Estate Mortgage, either by individual lots or the entire five (5) parcels of land as described in the immediately preceding paragraph, provided that the corresponding payment shall consider the earned and accrued interest and penalties, according to the following schedule: for parcel (a), the redemption sum shall be [PHP 25,328,939.00]; for parcel (b) the redemption money shall be [PHP 35,660,800.00]; for parcel (c) the redemption sum shall be [PHP 28,477,600.00]; for parcels (d) and (e) shall be [PHP 6,233,281.00].

5. If and when the FIRST PARTY is able to effect redemption of any of the property listed and enumerated in paragraph 3 hereof, the Deed of Absolute Sale dated [January 02, 2006] for the corresponding parcel of land shall be nullified and will have no force and effect and the SECOND PARTY shall then return the owner's duplicate copy of the certificate of title and shall likewise execute a Deed of Discharge of Mortgage.

6. In the event though that the FIRST PARTY shall not be able to tender any amount for the payment of the indebtedness corresponding to any of the parcel of land, then, the SECOND PARTY is hereby allowed to present the Deeds of Absolute Sale over the properties enumerated in paragraph 3 hereof, for registration with the Office of the Register of Deeds for Naga City so that the corresponding certificates of title in the name of the SECOND PARTY shall then be issued by the said Register of Deeds, after payment of necessary fees and taxes.

7. The parties hereby agree, if only to finally settle everything, to faithfully comply with and abide by their respective covenants; provided that if the FIRST PARTY shall contest, judicially or otherwise, any act, transaction, or event, related to or necessarily connected with this memorandum of agreement as well as the Deeds of Absolute Sale over the properties listed in paragraph 3 hereof, it hereby undertakes to indemnify the SECOND PARTY the amount of not less than TEN MILLION [PHP 10,000,000.00], Philippine currency, as liquidated damages, inclusive of costs and attorney's fees; provided still further that in the event that the FIRST PARTY shall contest the transaction, it shall obligate itself to pay off the condoned interests, surcharges and penalties in the amount of [PHP 55,167,000.00] (as stated in paragraph 2 hereof); provided finally, that should a contest be effected on this agreement, Mr. RUBEN SIA, obligates himself, jointly and severally with the FIRST PARTY, to assume personal obligation to effect the payments of the entire monetary obligations herein cited together with the FIRST PARTY.

8. In the alternative, the FIRST PARTY here agrees to execute deeds of sale over the five parcels of land listed in par. 3 hereof upon the execution of this agreement, in consideration for the receipt of FIVE MILLION PESOS [(PHP 5,000,000.00)] from the SECOND PARTY, in which case, the said sale shall constitute full payment (dacion en pago) and the FIRST PARTY'S entire liability is written off[.][6]

As a result, Ruby Shelter immediately executed separate Deeds of Absolute Sale, all dated January 3, 2006, covering the mortgaged properties in favor of Tan and Obiedo.[7]

On December 27, 2005, Ruby Shelter, through its president Ruben Sia (Sia), wrote a Letter[8] to Tan and Obiedo intimating its intention to redeem the properties and requesting for a meeting to discuss its concerns on the interests, surcharges, and penalties imposed on its original obligation. The parties met, but despite several dialogues, the parties failed to arrive at a mutually acceptable computation of the final amount.

Ruby Shelter claimed that on January 3, 2006, Tan and Obiedo prematurely caused the notarization of the deeds of absolute sale by respondent Atty. Tomas A. Reyes (Atty. Reyes). Tan and Obiedo allegedly made it appear that Sia personally appeared and ratified the instruments before Atty. Reyes.

Aggrieved by the premature notarization, Ruby Shelter filed a Complaint[9] mainly to annul the deeds of absolute sale, against Tan and Obiedo and Atty. Reyes (Tan et al.). Ruby Shelter averred therein that the deeds of sale are null and void for being pactum commissorium.

Tan et al. denied that the MOA constitutes a pactum commissorium and instead argued that Ruby Shelter voluntarily offered to execute the deeds of sale to ask for additional time to pay its outstanding debt and condonation of interest, penalties, and surcharges.

On March 23, 2006, Ruby Shelter filed an Amended Complaint[10] alleging that the titles of the mortgaged properties were already canceled, and new TCTs[11] were issued in the names of Tan and Obiedo.","Not all instances of alienation of mortgaged property by the debtor in favor of the creditor in the event of failure to timely pay the obligation will be declared void for being pactum commissorium. The prohibition does not extend to a mutual agreement between the debtor and the creditor that the property subject of the mortgage is sold to the latter to extinguish the obligation.
Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assailing the Amended Decision[2] of the Court of Appeals (CA), which reversed its earlier Decision[3] rendered on October 20, 2014. In the Amended Decision, the CA affirmed the Decision[4] and Order[5] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) which dismissed petitioner's complaint for annulment of deed of sale and declared that the parties had agreed to novate their earlier real estate mortgage.","The petition fails.

Tan et al. correctly argued that this case deserves outright dismissal for raising factual issues. In a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, the Court's scope of review is limited to questions of law. Factual issues are not within the province of the Court, as it is not a trier of facts[39] and is not required to reassess and recalibrate the oral and documentary evidence anew. The interpretation and construction of contracts are beyond the ambit of a petition for review on certiorari.[40] However, the Court, in exceptional circumstances, has the authority to review, and in proper cases, reverse the findings of the trial courts and appellate courts, viz.:

(1) when the findings are grounded entirely on speculation, surmises or conjectures; (2) when the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible; (3) when there is grave abuse of discretion; (4) when the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts; (5) when the findings of facts are conflicting; (6) when in making its findings the Court of Appeals went beyond the issues of the case, or its findings are contrary to the admissions of both the appellant and the appellee; (7) when the findings are contrary to the trial court; (8) when the findings are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based; (9) when the facts set forth in the petition as well as in the petitioner's main and reply briefs are not disputed by the respondent; (10) when the findings of fact are premised on the supposed absence of evidence and contradicted by the evidence on record; and (11) when the Court of Appeals manifestly overlooked certain relevant facts not disputed by the parties, which, if properly considered, would justify a different conclusion.[41] (Citation omitted)

The rule is settled that findings of the CA are conclusive on the parties and on this Court, and carry even more weight when the appellate court affirms the factual findings of the trial court.[42] The determination of the existence of pactum commissorium is a question of fact as it requires the court to look into contractual stipulations, and the intent of the parties.[43] Since Ruby Shelter raises arguments consisting mainly of factual matters, including questions on whether pactum commissorium is present, and because the findings of the courts a quo are supported by the evidence on record, the Court is not convinced that the instant petition merits exemption from the rule.

Regardless of the procedural defect inherent in this petition, the Court shall proceed to write finis on the substantive issues raised by Ruby Shelter.

The parties agreed to novate the
earlier loan agreement which resulted
in extinguishing the obligation by
way of dacion en pago

Article 1231 of the Civil Code provides the methods by which all civil obligations may be extinguished.[44] One of these modes is novation, which is defined as the extinguishment of an obligation by the substitution or change of the obligation by a subsequent one which terminates it, either by changing its objects or principal conditions, or by substituting a new debtor in place of the old one, or by subrogating a third person to the rights of the creditor.[45]

For novation to exist, the following elements must concur: (1) a previous valid obligation; (2) the agreement of all the parties to the new contract; (3) the extinguishment of the old contract; and (4) the validity of the new one. It is essential that there is consent of all the parties to the substitution, resulting in the extinction of the old obligation and the creation of a valid new one.[46]

As to essence, novation is classified as: (a) objective or real, where there is change in the cause, object or principal conditions of the obligation; (b) subjective or personal, where there is a substitution in the person of the debtor or a subrogation of the third person to the rights of the creditor; or (c) mixed, where there is a combination of objective and subjective novation.[47] As to form, novation may be expressed or implied as provided under Article 1292 of the Civil Code. As to extent, novation may be: (a) extinctive or total, where there is absolute extinguishment of the old obligation; or (b) partial or modified, where there is merely a modification of the old obligation.[48]

To gain proper perspective on the challenges raised by Ruby Shelter, We again quote the pertinent portions of the subject MOA:

1. That the FIRST PARTY is indebted to the SECOND PARTY in the aggregate sum of NINETY[-]FIVE MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED TWENTY PESOS [(PHP 95,700,620.00)], Philippine currency, covered by Real Estate Mortgages over five (5) parcels of land enumerated in paragraph 3 hereof[.]

2. That because of the FIRST PARTY's corporate offer to simultaneously execute Deeds of Absolute Sale over the properties as provided for and listed in paragraph 3 hereof: the SECOND PARTY here allows the FIRST PARTY to pay the said indebtedness, on or before [December 31, 2005]. Moreover, the SECOND PARTY hereby agrees to condone and/or write off the interests, penalties and surcharges from October 1, 2004 to December 31, 2005, or a total period of fifteen (15) months, amounting to SEVENTY[-]FOUR MILLION SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY[-]EIGHT THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FORTY[-]SEVEN PESOS [(PHP 74,678,647.00)].

3. Upon the execution hereof, and, by way of dacion en pago, the FIRST PARTY shall execute deeds of absolute sale to be uniformly dated January 2, 2006, over the following properties in favor of the SECOND PARTY, . . .

. . . .

4. The FIRST PARTY is here allowed to pay off the indebtedness covered by the Real Estate Mortgage, either by individual lots or the entire five (5) parcels of land as described in the immediately preceding paragraph, provided that the corresponding payment shall consider the earned and accrued interest and penalties, according to the following schedule . . .

5. If and when the FIRST PARTY is able to effect redemption of any of the property listed and enumerated in paragraph 3 hereof, the Deed of Absolute Sale dated [January 2, 2006] for the corresponding parcel of land shall be nullified and will have no force and effect and the SECOND PARTY shall then return the owner's duplicate copy of the certificate of title and shall likewise execute a Deed of Discharge of Mortgage.

6. In the event though that the FIRST PARTY shall not be able to tender any amount for the payment of the indebtedness corresponding to any of the parcel of land, then, the SECOND PARTY is hereby allowed to present the Deeds of Absolute Sale over the properties enumerated in paragraph 3 hereof, for registration with the Office of the Register of Deeds for Naga City so that the corresponding certificates of title in the name of the SECOND PARTY shall then be issued by the said Register of Deeds, after payment of [the] necessary fees and taxes.[49]

The parties disagree on how the MOA novated their previous loan agreement. For Ruby Shelter, the stipulations in the MOA merely changed the terms or mode of payment of the principal obligation; the immediate sale of the mortgaged realty only secured the payment of the principal obligation. On the other hand, Tan and Obiedo believe that there was an extinctive novation, in that Ruby Shelter's debt was extinguished by way of dacion en pago.

Both arguments are partially correct. We explain.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DENIED. The February 18, 2015 Amended Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 101180 is AFFIRMED WITH MODIFICATION. Ruby Shelter Builders and Realty Development Corporation, is ORDERED to PAY liquidated damages in the amount of PHP 10,000,000.00 with 6% interest per annum from the date of finality of this Decision until its full satisfaction."
