"G.R. No. 251518, November 27, 2024","DEL MONTE LAND TRANSPORT BUS COMPANY, DON L. MORALES, AND EILEEN FLORES, PETITIONERS, VS. ROMEO M. JARANILLA, MARLON H. GUANTERO, AND JESUS B. DOMANAIS, RESPONDENTS.","This case stemmed from consolidated complaints for illegal dismissal, full backwages, and reinstatement filed by respondents against petitioners. On November 25, 2013, LA Benedict G. Kato (LA Kato) issued a Decision granting the complaints and ruled that respondents were all illegally dismissed from their employment.[5]

DLTB, thereafter, interposed an appeal with the NLRC. On April 23, 2014, the NLRC issued a Decision[6] granting DLTB's appeal. The NLRC dismissed the consolidated complaints. In effect, the LA's Order dated November 25, 2013, was reversed and set aside.

Aggrieved, respondents moved for reconsideration. In its Resolution[7] dated October 31, 2014, the NLRC granted respondents' motion and reinstated the Decision of the LA.

Petitioners, thereafter, filed a Petition for Certiorari with the CA (CA-G.R. SP No. 138339) assailing the October 31, 2014 Resolution of the NLRC.[8] Pending resolution of CA-G.R. SP No. 138339, respondents moved for and secured a Writ of Execution[9] of the LA's November 25, 2013 Order. Pursuant to the said Writ, petitioners issued a check in the amount of PHP 1,189,364.42 as partial payment for the judgment award. Meanwhile, the balance of the judgment award shall be secured from the cash bond posted by petitioners in the amount of PHP 247,080.29.[10]

On March 27, 2015, LA Kato issued an Order[11] releasing to respondents the amounts that were due to them in satisfaction of the judgment award. Based on the Disbursement Vouchers, Jaranilla received the amount of PHP 397,541.02,[12] Guantero received the amount of PHP 387,895.25,[13]and Domanais, received the amount of PHP 403,928.14, all of which are exclusive of tax.[14]

Subsequently, on June 30, 2015, the CA, in CA-G.R. SP No. 138339 granted petitioners' Petition for Certiorari and annulled the October 31, 2014 Resolution of the NLRC.[15] The CA ratiocinated that respondents were legally dismissed from employment and that petitioners complied with the two-notice rule.[16] Essentially, the CA reinstated the April 23, 2014 NLRC Decision resulting in the dismissal of the complaints for supposed unlawful termination from employment by petitioners. On November 24, 2015, the Decision of the CA in CA-G.R. SP No. 138339 became final and executory.[17]

Thereafter, respondents filed before the LA a Motion for Issuance of Alias Writ of Execution.[18] Therein, respondents averred that the amount released to them corresponds to their accrued backwages or reinstatement wages computed only up to November 2014. They further claimed that considering that the NLRC, on motion for reconsideration, reinstated the LA's ruling, they are entitled to reinstatement wages from December 2014 up to the finality of the Decision of the CA reversing the LA's ruling. Accordingly, respondents asked for the issuance of an Alias Writ of Execution for the full satisfaction of their accrued backwages or reinstatement wages.[19]","For the Court's consideration is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court filed by Del Monte Land Transport Bus Company (DLTB), Don L. Morales, and Eileen Flores (collectively, petitioners) assailing the Court of Appeals (CA) Decision[2] promulgated on March 14, 2019, in CA-G.R. SP No. 151070, which affirmed the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC), Quezon City Resolution[3] dated January 30, 2017 in NLRC LAC No. 01-000227-14 (AE-10-16)(4), NLRC NCR CN 08-12004-13, NLRC NCR CN 08-12009-13, and NLRC NCR CN 08-12160-13. In its Resolution, the NLRC dismissed petitioners' appeal and affirmed the Labor Arbiter's (LA's) Order[4] dated August 30, 2016 in NLRC NCR Case No. 08-12004-13, issuing an Alias Writ of Execution in favor of Romeo M. Jaranilla (Jaranilla), Marlon H. Guantero (Guantero), and Jesus B. Domanais (Domanais), (collectively, respondents).","The instant petition is bereft of any merit.

In the instant petition, petitioners averred that the LA erred in granting the Motion for Issuance of Alias Writ of Execution considering that at the time of the filing thereof, respondents are no longer entitled to their accrued wages on account of the finality of the CA Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 138339, which declared respondents as legally dismissed.[32]

Petitioners likewise averred that they are entitled to restitution. They explained that while they admit that the LA's November 25, 2013 Decision is immediately executory, hence, respondents have the right to reinstatement, either actual or in payroll, such right ceased to have any legal effect when the NLRC reversed the LA Decision on April 23, 2014 They also insisted that the reinstatement by the NLRC of the LA Decision on reconsideration is no longer immediately executory. Accordingly, respondents are not entitled to reinstatement from October 31, 2014, when the NLRC reinstated the November 25, 2013 Decision of the LA until the same was reversed by the CA on June 30, 2015.[33]

The Court is not persuaded.","ACCORDINGLY, in view of the foregoing premises, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED. The Court of Appeals Decision dated March 14, 2019, in CA-G.R. SP No. 151070 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. The Labor Arbiter's Order dated August 30, 2016 is MODIFIED in that respondents Romeo M. Jaranilla, Marlon H. Guantero, and Jesus B. Domanais are entitled to reinstatement wages from November 25, 2013 to June 30, 2015. Let an Alias Writ of Execution be ISSUED to such effect.

The Labor Arbiter is further DIRECTED to make a re-computation of the amount of respondents' reinstatement wages for the said period and determine whether the amounts already released to respondents exceed or are less than the amounts that respondents are entitled to. Thereafter, the Labor Arbiter is DIRECTED to collect from petitioners the amount necessary for the full satisfaction of their reinstatement wages or return to petitioners any excess thereof."
"G.R. No. 263047, November 27, 2024","SPOUSES NOEL JOHN M. KAW** AND JOSEPHINE CASERES-KAW,*** PETITIONERS, VS. HEIRS OF MARILYN NODALO, MANUEL S. OLASO, MANUEL S. OLASO III, LEA LIM-TIDMA, NERISSA S. OREJO, ZENAIDA CHIQUILLO, IVY OROLFO, RONNIE GOMEZ, AND GINA NUARIN, RESPONDENTS.","Spouses Kaw are the owners of a parcel of land located in Cagmanaba, Oas, Albay, with an area of 3,040 square meters and designated as Lot F in Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-158628. Lot F is covered by Tax Declaration No. 02-12-012-00000 with an assessed value of PHP 24,830.00.[5]

Spouses Kaw and Ivy Orolfo (Orolfo) were dentists and colleagues.[6] Orolfo introduced Spouses Kaw to the other respondents, who were interested in buying a portion of Lot F. Thus, sometime in February 2014, Spouses Kaw, together with Orolfo, Marilyn Nodalo (Nodalo), Manuel S. Olaso III (Olaso III). Lea Lim-Tidma (Lim-Tidma), Nerissa S. Orejo (Orejo), Zenaida Chiquillo (Chiquillo), Ronnie Gomez (Gomez), and Gina Nuarin (Nuarin) (collectively, respondents), visited Lot F. Spouses Kaw informed respondents that they were only selling the 2,000 square meter undetermined portion of Lot F (subject property) for PHP 1,200,000.00. Josephine then showed respondents a copy of a sketch plan prepared by a geodetic engineer for the right of way. Respondents then offered to purchase the subject property in two equal portions of 1,000 square meters at the purchase price of PHP 600,000.00 each, to be paid in two parts, with PHP 300,000.00 advance payment for each part. The balance shall be payable in six months.[7]

On March 10,2014, the first Deed of Conditional Sale was executed between Spouses Kaw and Nodalo, Olaso III, Lim-Tidma, and Orejo, covering the 1,000 square meters unsegregated and undesignated portion of the subject property. The parties agreed to bind themselves reciprocally to sell and buy said portion in consideration of PHP 600,000.00.[8]

On March 29, 2014, a second Deed of Conditional Sale, with provisions similar to the first deed, was executed between Spouses Kaw and Chiquillo, Orolfo, Gomez, and Nuarin. However, Spouses Kaw received only the amount of PHP 265,000.000, while the remainder of PHP 35,000.00 was paid to Orolfo. Orolfo stated that she acted as an agent in the sale transactions with Spouses Kaw; hence, it was her internal arrangement with Spouses Kaw that the PHP 35,000.00 would serve as her commission.[9]

The First and Second Deeds of Conditional Sale (collectively, Deeds of Conditional Sale) contained uniform provisions, as follows:
a)
Upon the execution of this instrument[,] the Vendees have shall [sic] jointly and severally pay (and in fact, have paid and delivered to) the Vendor the cash sum of THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PESOS ([PHP] 300,000.00), Philippine Currency, as and for INITIAL/DOWN PAYMENT, the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged by the Vendor to their entire satisfaction; Provided that, upon full payment of this initial/ down payment of [PHP] 300,000.00, the vendee shall have the right to enter into/ take beneficial possession and enjoyment or introduce improvements on the above described property even as the same is herein conditionally sold; provide moreover that, in the event of unilateral rescission by the Vendors of the herein sale agreement/transaction, for reasons or causes attributable to the Vendees (such as, but not limited to default in payment of the net balance or subsequent installment payments or violations of the terms of this agreement, among other grounds), the said down payment or any other subsequent advance/ installment payments shall be treated as and for EARNEST MONEY, which the Vendors at their option, may forfeited [sic] in their favor without further recourse or right of reimbursement by the Vendees; and provided finally that, in such event of rescission of the sale transaction/agreement any and all improvements introduced by the Vendees on the premises subject matter herein, agreed to be sold, may be appropriated by and at the option of the Vendors likewise without further recourse expectancy or payment of its value in favor of the Vendees.


b)
The remaining balance of THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PESOS ([PHP] 300,000.00), Philippine Currency, is hereby mutually agreed to be due and payable jointly and severally by the Vendees to the Vendors (their heirs, assigns), ON INSTALLMENT OR IN LUMP SUM within SIX (6) MONTHS from and after the date of the execution of this instrument; provided that, in the event of failure by the Vendee to SEASONABLY AND SATISFACTORILY pay such NET BALANCE ([PHP] 300,000.00), the Vendees shall immediately vacate and peacefully restore the herein sold premises to the Vendors;


c)
Upon full and satisfactory payment by the Vendees to the Vendors of the said net balance of PHP 300,000.00 (or the agreed total consideration of PHP 600,000.00), the Vendors shall forthwith execute and deliver in favor of the Vendees the (Final) Deed of Absolute Sale of the property above described and herein sold, together with its muniments of title;


d)
For all the time that this agreement is in full force and effect, the Vendors, shall not sell, lease or encumber or in any manner dispose of the above described property or any portion thereof, without the prior written consent of the Vendees, nor reciprocally, shall the Vendees assign, transfer, convey or in any manner hypothecate their rights under this agreement to third parties without the prior written consent of the Vendors; any such transaction entered into by either parties herein without the prior written consent of the other as herein provided, shall be null and void as to the offended party, as the case may be;


. . . .


f)
In the meantime, upon execution of this instrument and pending full and satisfactory payment by the Vendees of the said agreed total consideration of the sale, or its outstanding balance (WITH ZERO INTEREST), the Vendees (their heirs or assigns) shall remain in the exclusive beneficial possession and enjoyment of the above described parcel of land, subject of this agreement;[10]
Sometime in the second week of April 2014, Spouses Kaw visited the subject property and were surprised when they saw the following: (1) cottages surrounded by fence; (2) comfort room and an irrigation pump made of concrete materials: (3) eight cottage-like houses and several small cottages and concrete barriers near the seashore; (4) ""DIWATA IMACOTO BEACH RESORT"" signboard; and (5) a destroyed padlock in Spouses Kaw's own cottage. When Spouses Kaw confronted Orolfo, the latter explained that the fence was constructed for their protection, while the cottages were built for their convenience and were not being rented out to other people. However, Spouses Kaw learned from the neighbors that respondents were indeed renting out the cottages for a fee of PHP 500.00 to PHP 1,000.00.[11]

Thus, on September 29, 2015, Spouses Kaw filed with the RTC their Complaint for Rescission of Contract with Prayer for Preliminary Injunction against respondents. The Complaint was docketed by the RTC as Civil Case No. 2833 (Rescission Case).[12]

Spouses Kaw cited paragraph A of the Deeds of Conditional Sale, which states that the contracts may be unilaterally rescinded by the vendors Spouses Kaw in the event that respondents violated any of the terms of the agreements. Supposedly, by converting the subject property into a beach resort and renting out cottages to third persons without the prior written consent of Spouses Kaw, respondents violated paragraph D of the Deeds of Conditional Sale, which states that respondents, as vendees, cannot ""assign, transfer, convey or in any manner hypothecate their rights under [the] agreement to third parties without the prior written consent of the Vendors [Spouses Kaw].""[13]

Spouses Kaw further asserted that respondents violated paragraph A of the Deeds of Conditional Sale by causing, the construction of permanent improvements on the subject property. Purportedly, there were verbal agreements concomitant to the execution of the Deeds of Conditional Sale, wherein respondents agreed that they will only introduce temporary improvements made of light materials in the subject property. Further, after the Deeds of Conditional Sale were executed by the parties, Josephine reminded Orolfo that respondents could only build cottages made of light materials considering that they had not fully paid the contract price and there was no subdivision survey yet. She also told Orolfo not to fence the property pending the resolution of the issue on the right of way with the adjoining owners.[14]

In their Answer, respondents denied that they violated any of the provisions of the Deeds of Conditional Sale. By way of counterclaim, respondents prayed that the RTC order the Spouses Kaw: to accept payment of the balance of the purchase price (balance price) under the Deeds of Conditional Sale; to execute the deeds of absolute sale over the subject property; to surrender all documents necessary for the transfer of title to respondents; and to pay respondents moral damages and costs of suit.[15]

Respondents argued that the operation of a beach resort over the subject property cannot be construed as an assignment, transfer, conveyance, or hypothecation of their rights over the subject property under paragraph D of the Deeds of Conditional Sale. They further maintained that paragraph A of the Deeds did not impose any limitation on the kind of improvements that they may introduce in the subject property.[16]

Respondents also denied any verbal agreement with Spouses Kaw that prohibited them from using the subject property as a beach resort and from constructing permanent improvements thereon. Supposedly, Spouses Kaw were aware that the property was purchased for the purpose of engaging in a beach resort business.[17] During the negotiations for the sale, Spouses Kaw even encouraged respondents to develop the property into a beach resort and suggested the amount of rental fees that they could charge against visitors.[18] Further, Spouses Kaw knew that permanent improvements were being introduced on the subject property as Noel attended the birthday party of Orolfo's daughter while constructions were on-going. Respondents further asserted that they could already fence the portions sold to them because the boundaries have already been identified in the subdivision plan presented by the Spouses Kaw, who even helped them in locating the landmarks or mohon.[19]

Respondents argued that Spouses Kaw merely changed their mind as regards the Deeds of Conditional Sale after Josephine and Nodalo had a heated verbal spat about the improvements on the subject property. Josephine felt disrespected by Nodalo and wanted her to be excluded as a buyer.[20] Purportedly, on several occasions, respondents brought cash as payment for the balance price under the Deeds of Conditional Sale when they went to the Spouses Kaw, but the latter refused to accept their payment.[21] They also made a surprise visit at Josephine's dental clinic to pay the balance price, but Josephine angrily told them that she does not want their money.[22]

Respondents also insisted that the Complaint was filed by Spouses Kaw on September 29, 2015, only as a countersuit to the Consignation Cases previously instituted by some of the respondents against the Spouses Kaw.[23] It turned out that on September 5 and 19, 2014, Nodalo and Chiquillo separately filed with the Municipal Circuit Trial Court (MCTC), Polangui-Libon-Oas, Albay, two Complaints[24] for Consignation against the Spouses Kaw. The MCTC docketed the consignation complaints of Nodalo and Chiquillo as Civil Case No. 1712-P and Civil Case No. 1714-P (collectively, Consignation Cases), respectively. Nodalo and Chiquillo alleged that Spouses Kaw unjustifiably refused to accept payment of the balance price under the Deeds of Conditional Sale. Both respondents averred that they tendered payment of the balance price to Spouses Kaw under the Deeds of Conditional Sale, but the Spouses unjustifiably refused to accept their payment.[25]","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] (Petition) filed by spouses Noel John M. Kaw (Noel) and Josephine Caseres-Kaw (Josephine) (collectively, Spouses Kaw) assailing the Decision[2] dated July 14, 2021, and Resolution[3] dated August 8, 2022, of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 113795 that affirmed with modification as to the award of moral damages, the Decision[4] dated June 3, 2019 of Branch 12, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Ligao City, Albay in Civil Case No. 2833. The RTC dismissed the Complaint for Rescission of Contract with Prayer for Preliminary Injunction filed by Spouses Kaw for lack of merit.","The Petition is denied for lack of merit. The CA correctly ruled that Spouses Kaw failed to establish valid grounds for the rescission of the Deeds of Conditional Sale. However, the Court agrees with Spouses Kaw that Chiquillo and Nodalo committed forum shopping.   
 
The Deeds of Conditional Sale are contracts to sell
 

Preliminarily, the Court notes that the written agreements over the subject property were denominated by the parties as a ""Deed of Conditional Sale."" However, after a careful reading of the terms and conditions of the two agreements in issue, the Court finds that the real intention of the parties is to enter into contracts to sell, not conditional sale. In Nabus v. Sps. Pacson,[50] the Court explained the difference between a contract to sell and a conditional sale in this wise:
A contract to sell as defined hereinabove, may not even be considered as a conditional contract of sale where the seller may likewise reserve title to the property subject of the sale until the fulfillment of a suspensive condition, because in a conditional contract of sale, the first element of consent is present, although it is conditioned upon the happening of a contingent event which may or may not occur. If the suspensive condition is not fulfilled, the perfection of the contract of sale is completely abated. However, if the suspensive condition is fulfilled, the contract of sale is thereby perfected, such that if there had already been previous delivery of the property subject of the sale to the buyer, ownership thereto automatically transfers to the buyer by operation of law without any further act having to be performed by the seller.

In a contract to sell, upon the fulfillment of the suspensive condition which is the full payment of the purchase price, ownership will not automatically transfer to the buyer although the property may have been previously delivered to him. The prospective seller still has to convey title to the prospective buyer by entering into a contract of absolute sale.[51] (Emphasis supplied)
In a contract to sell, the prospective seller reserves title to the subject property despite previous delivery thereof to the prospective buyer. Thus, in a case,[52] the Court held that an agreement denominated as a ""Deed of Conditional Sale"" was, in truth, a contract to sell because the vendor promised to execute a deed of absolute sale only upon the vendee's completion of the payment of the full purchase price. The Court has also held that a contract pertains to an absolute sale if there is no stipulation granting the vendor the right to unilaterally cancel the contract the moment that the vendee fails to pay within a fixed period.[53] Conversely, an agreement is considered a contract to sell if there is a stipulation therein giving the vendor the right to unilaterally rescind the contract the moment that the vendee fails to pay within a fixed period.[54]

In the case at hand, the Deeds of Conditional Sale contain several stipulations on rescission and execution of the deed of absolute sale, to wit: 
a)
. . . provide moreover that, in the event of unilateral rescission by the Vendors of the herein sale agreement/transaction, for reasons or causes attributable to the Vendees (such as, but not limited to default in payment of the net balance or subsequent installment payments or violations of the terms of this agreement, among other grounds), the said down payment or any other subsequent advance/ instalment payments shall be treated as and for EARNEST MONEY, which the Vendors at their option, may forfeited in their favor without further recourse or right of reimbursement by the Vendees; and provided finally that, in such event of rescission of the sale transaction/agreement any and all improvements introduced by the Vendees on the premises subject matter herein, agreed to be sold, may be appropriated by and at the option of the Vendors likewise without further recourse expectancy or payment of its value in favor of the Vendees.


. . . .


c)
Upon full and satisfactory payment by the Vendees to the Vendors of the said net balance of PHP 300,000.00 (or the agreed total consideration of PHP 600,000.00), the Vendors shall forthwith execute and deliver in favor of the Vendees the (Final) Deed of Absolute Sale of the property above described and herein sold, together with its muniments of title[.][55] (Emphasis supplied)
The foregoing supports the conclusion that the Deeds of Conditional Sale are contracts to sell. First, paragraph A of the Deeds grants Spouses Kaw the right to unilaterally rescind the agreements in the event that respondents fail to pay the full purchase price within the period fixed in the contracts. Second, paragraph C of the Deeds expressly state that Spouses Kaw shall execute the Deeds of Absolute Sale only upon full and satisfactory payment of the total consideration for the subject property, even though it had already been delivered to respondents after the initial down payment and pending completion of the full purchase price.   
 
The remedy of rescission was available to Spouses Kaw
 

Given that the Deeds of Conditional Sale are contracts to sell, an issue arises on the availability of the remedy of rescission to Spouses Kaw.

The power to rescind obligations in the event of breach is provided in Article 1191 of the Civil Code, to wit:
ARTICLE 1191. The power to rescind obligations is implied in reciprocal ones, in case one of the obligors should not comply with what is incumbent upon him.

The injured party may choose between the fulfillment and the rescission of the obligation, with the payment of damages in either case. He may also seek rescission, even after he has chosen fulfillment, if the latter should become impossible.

The court shall decree the rescission claimed, unless there be just cause authorizing the fixing of a period.

This is understood to be without prejudice to the rights of third persons who have acquired the thing, in accordance with article 1385 and 1388 and the Mortgage Law.
The remedy of rescission under Article 1191 of the Civil Code in case of breach applies only to reciprocal obligations.[56] The availability of the remedy of a rescission in a contract to sell has been distinguished by the Court in Solid Homes, Inc. v. Sps. Jurado,[57] to wit:
The foregoing characters of a contract to sell are important in order to determine the laws and remedies applicable in case a party does not fulfill his or her obligations under the contract. In Olivarez Realty Corporation v. Castillo, we held that the prospective buyer's failure to fully pay the purchase price in a contract to sell is not a breach of contract under Article 1191 on the right to rescind reciprocal obligations. Citing Nabus, Olivarez held that ""[t]his is because there can be no rescission of an obligation that is still non-existent, the suspensive condition not having happened."" Thus, in case the prospective buyer does not comply, the contract to sell is cancelled and the parties shall stand as if the obligation to sell never existed. When a contract to sell is cancelled, the installments paid for the property are generally ordered reimbursed, especially if possession over the property has not been delivered to the prospective buyer.

The pronouncement in Olivarez should, however, be reconciled with our ruling in Gotesco Properties. Inc. v. Spouses Fajardo, wherein we upheld the buyer's right to rescind the contract to sell for failure of the seller to cause the transfer of the corresponding certificate of title upon full payment of the purchase price. Thus, a contract to sell is susceptible to rescission for substantial and fundamental breaches, as when the seller fails to comply with his obligation to sell the property despite the happening of the suspensive condition, because the power to rescind obligations is implied in reciprocal ones, in case one of the obligors should not comply with what is incumbent upon him. However, instead of rescission of the obligation, the injured party may choose that the contract be actually accomplished by the party bound to fulfill it. Specific performance refers to the remedy of requiring exact performance of a contract it) the specific form in which it was made, or according to the precise terms agreed upon.[58] (Emphasis supplied; citations omitted)
Following Solid Homes, the availability of rescission as a remedy in favor of Spouses Kaw will depend on whether the action is based on respondents' failure to pay the full purchase price within the period fixed by the parties, or whether it is based, on a substantial or fundamental breach of the contracts on grounds other than non-payment of the full purchase price. In the first case, the remedy of rescission is not available because the non-fulfillment of the suspensive condition for failure to pay the full purchase price simply prevents the obligation to sell the subject property from arising, and there can be no rescission of an obligation that is non-existent.[59] In the second case, the remedy of rescission is available because it would involve a substantial breach of a reciprocal obligation, which then authorizes the injured party to demand either rescission or specific performance of the obligation under Article 1191 of the Civil Code.[60]

Upon review of the records, the Court finds that the remedy of rescission was available to Spouses Kaw pursuant to Article 1191 of the Civil Code in relation to paragraph A of the Deeds of Conditional Sale.

As seen above, paragraph A of the Deeds of Conditional Sale expressly authorizes Spouses Kaw, as vendors, to unilaterally rescind the contracts in the event that respondents, as vendees: (1) defaulted in the payment of the balance price or subsequent installment payments therefor; or (2) violated the terms of the said agreements. Although the contracts provide for unilateral rescission in favor of Spouses Kaw, it is settled that judicial validation of such unilateral rescission is necessary, for it is only the final judgment of a court that will conclusively settle whether the action taken was correct in law.[61]

Here, Spouses Kaw instituted the Complaint for Rescission because respondents supposedly violated the terms of the Deeds of Conditional Sale when the latter leased the subject property as part of their beach resort business and introduced permanent improvements thereon. Simply, Spouses Kaw's action was based on a fundamental or substantial breach of obligations other than payment of the purchase price under the Deeds of Conditional Sale. Hence, the remedy of rescission under Article 1191 of the Civil Code was available to Spouses Kaw.   
 
Spouses Kaw failed to prove that respondents violated the terms of the Deeds of Conditional Sale or committed a substantial breach thereof
 

Having resolved the question of whether rescission was available as a remedy to Spouses Kaw, the Court proceeds to rule on the issue of whether the CA erred in finding that respondents did not commit a substantial breach of the agreements as to warrant their rescission.

As a rule, rescission is not permitted for a slight or casual breach of the contract, but only for such breaches that are substantial and fundamental as to defeat the object of the parties in making the agreement.[62] Hence, as correctly pointed out by the RTC and CA, rescission will not be granted in the following: (1) where the breach is only slight or casual; (2) where there has been substantial compliance; and (3) where the court finds valid reason for giving a period of fulfillment of the obligation.[63]

In the case at hand, Spouses Kaw argue that respondents committed a fundamental or substantial breach of the Deeds of Conditional Sale when they (1) introduced permanent improvements on the subject property, contrary to paragraph A of the Deeds regarding improvements and (2) leased cottages located on the subject property to third persons, in violation of paragraph D of the Deeds. The Court disagrees with Spouses Kaw and affirms the CA's finding that respondents did not commit a fundamental or substantial breach of their obligations under the Deeds of Conditional Sale. 
 
A.
Respondents did not violate paragraph A of the Deeds of Conditional Sale when they introduced permanent improvements on the subject property  
   
 
As to the alleged violation of paragraph A of the Deeds of Conditional Sale, Spouses Kaw maintain that there are concomitant verbal agreements concerning the kind of improvements that respondents are allowed to construct on the subject property. Supposedly, these concomitant verbal agreements must be referred to in defining the term ""improvements"" in paragraph A of the Deeds of Conditional Sale. Spouses Kaw assert that the terms of the agreements must be interpreted based on the ""intention of the contracting parties"" which may be determined by looking at all the words used in the contracts in their proper context.[64]

The Court is not persuaded.","WHEREFORE, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED. The Decision dated July 14,2021, and Resolution dated August 8, 2022, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 113795 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION in that:

"G.R. No. 219686, November 27, 2024","GIL APOLINARIO, PETITIONER, VS. HEIRS OF FRANCISCO DE LOS SANTOS, REPRESENTED BY EDWIN DELOS SANTOS, RESPONDENTS.","On July 4, 1998 at around 7:30 a.m., Rico Villahermosa (Rico), the 16-year old son of Teresita Villahermosa (Teresita), was cutting down a banana plant on the side of Maharlika Highway upon the instruction and under the supervision of Apolinario, his school principal. The banana plant fell and hit Francisco De Los Santos (Francisco) who was driving his motorcycle along Maharlika Highway at the time.[5]

As a result, Francisco fell from his motorcycle and unto the cemented highway. He suffered from head injuries and passed away on July 8, 1998, with his death certificate indicating ""post-traumatic brain swelling"" and ""diffuse cerebral contusion"" as his cause of death.[6]

Aggrieved, the Heirs of Francisco filed a complaint for damages against Apolinario and Teresita. They averred that Apolinario was negligent when he instructed Rico to cut down the banana plant situated at the side of the highway without taking the necessary precautions to ensure the safety of passing motorists and pedestrians, and that Rico's and Apolinario's gross negligence was the proximate cause of the injuries and death of Francisco.[7]

The Heirs further averred that due to Francisco's accident and death, they incurred PHP 50,000.00 in hospital and medical expenses and PHP 47,000.00 as funeral expenses, and prayed for the payment of PHP 428,800 as compensation for the loss of expected income of the deceased as member of the Sangguniang Bayan of Sta. Margarita, Samar; PHP 50,000 for moral damages, PHP 20,000 for exemplary damages; PHP 20,000.00 for attorney's fees, and PHP 10,000.00 for the litigation expenses.[8] Anent Francisco's income, respondents alleged that he was earning monthly emoluments of PHP 12,620.00 and expected to receive the same continuously until end the of his term on June 1, 2001.[9]

Elias Udjay (Elias) testified that his son Arnel also attended Barangay Palale Elementary School, and that he was only two arms' length away from Apolinario and Rico at the time of the incident.[10] A teacher called for pintakasi, an event supervised by Apolinario as the head of the teachers.[11] Elias was cutting grass along the school vicinity when he witnessed Apolinario instructing Rico to cut a banana plant just outside the fence of the school and across the highway opposite the school. While Rico was cutting down the plant, it hit Francisco.[12]

Edwin de los Santos (Edwin), the son of the deceased Francisco, testified that at the time of his father's death, Francisco was a member of the Sangguniang Bayan of Sta. Margarita.[13] He also brought with him his father's death certificate.[14]

Rico, who was not impleaded as a defendant but appeared in court as a witness, testified that he was 15 years old at the time of the incident.[15] The day prior to pintakasi, Apolinario conducted a meeting for the activity which his mother attended.[16] His mother told him that the attendees were advised that adult students may join the pintakasi and their parents need not go to school; hence, Rico attended the activity since he was old enough.[17] Rico likewise testified that during the activity, Apolinario instructed him to cut down the banana plant.[18] He crossed the road directly across the school and started cutting the banana plant, and he only saw Francisco when the banana plant was about to fall down.[19] After Francisco was hit at the back of his neck, Apolinario was at the side of the road and did not help Francisco. Afterwards, the police brought Francisco to the hospital. Thereafter, the pintakasi continued and Apolinario still issued orders to the participants.[20]

Teresita prayed for the dismissal of the complaint against her. She averred that her minor son cut down the banana plant on instruction of Apolinario and under his supervision as school principal.[21]

In his defense, Apolinario asserted that: (a) he could not have been supervising and instructing Rico on how to cut the banana plant since he was not present when the incident happened; (b) at the time of the incident, he was 10 meters away supervising the construction of a fence, while Rico was in the actual supervision of two teachers; (c) the incident did not take place on a school day; it was a Saturday, during an activity by parents, teachers, and the adult community of Brgy. Palale, Sta. Margarita, Samar; (d) his co-defendant Teresita should be the one held liable, as she sent Rico to the event without informing the school, parents, teachers, and adult community organization of such fact; (e) assuming that Rico was under the school's control and supervision during the activity, the responsibility attaches only to the teacher-in-charge. Apolinario also filed a counterclaim for the award of moral damages.[22]

For his part, Apolinario testified that he was the principal of Brgy. Palale Elementary School, Sta. Margarita, Samar at the time of the incident, which was a public elementary school and not a school of trade and industry.[23] He did not handle any classes, and the principal's office was not involved in the pintakasi as he did not attend any meeting with regard to the parent-teacher association. The teachers were the ones in charge of supervising the activities. A day before the activity, the teachers informed him that the pintakasi would be held, which involved the teachers and parents of their pupils.[24]

Apolinario asserted that when the late Francisco was hit by the felled banana plant at around 7:30 a.m., he was on his way to the central school. After he entered his office, a parent informed him that a boy was cutting a banana plant, and the trunk of the banana plant fell on Francisco along the highway, causing him to slip. He inspected the place of the incident.[25]","This resolves the Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] assailing the Decision[2] and the Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA), which modified the Regional Trial Court's Decision[4] that granted the Heirs of Francisco De Los Santos' (Heirs) complaint for damages against Gil Apolinario (Apolinario).","The petition is partly granted.

Apolinario, as the teacher-in-charge of Rico at the time of the commission of the latter's tortious act, is vicariously liable for damages


Preliminarily, the trial court's finding of negligence, when affirmed by the CA, is a question of fact that the Court cannot pass upon without going into factual matters touching on the finding of negligence. In petitions for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court, this Court is limited to reviewing only errors of law, not of fact, unless the factual findings complained of are devoid of support by the evidence on record, or the assailed judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts.[38]

Here, the RTC and the CA uniformly held that Apolinario was negligent in directing Rico to cut the plant without observing the degree of care required under the circumstances to prevent the incident leading to Francisco's death, and thus liable for damages. We find no reason to disturb the findings of the RTC and CA. However, considering Apolinario's assertion that it is Teresita and not him who should be held liable for damages for Rico's act, a discussion on the nature and basis of his liability and Teresita's is in order.

A teacher-in-charge's civil liability for quasi-delicts committed by pupils in their custody is anchored in Articles 2176 and 2180 of the Civil Code:
ART. 2176. Whoever by act or omission causes damage to another, there being fault or negligence, is obliged to pay for the damage done. Such fault or negligence, if there is no pre-existing contractual relation between the parties, is called a quasi-delict and is governed by the provisions of this Chapter. (1902a)

ART. 2180. The obligation imposed by article 2176 is demandable not only for one's own acts or omissions, but also for those of persons for whom one is responsible.

. . . .

Lastly, teachers or heads of establishments of arts and trades shall be liable for damages caused by their pupils and students or apprentices, so long as they remain in their custody.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is PARTLY GRANTED. The May 28, 2014 Decision and the June 24, 2015 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA G.R. CV No. 03433 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION.

Petitioner Gil Apolinario is ordered to pay respondent heirs of Francisco de los Santos the following: (a) PHP 250,000.00 as temperate damages; (b) PHP 50,000.00 as civil indemnity; (c) PHP 50,000.00 as moral damages; and (d) PHP 5,000.00 as litigation expenses. Interest at the rate of six percent per annum shall be imposed on all damages awarded from the finality of this Decision until fully paid."
"G.R. No. 271934, November 27, 2024","HEIRS OF AQUILINO RAMOS, REPRESENTED BY WILBUR M. RAMOS, MARILOU G. ILAGAN, LYDIA GALARRITA, BENJAMIN GALARRITA, THE MUNICIPAL ASSESSOR OF ALUBIJID, MISAMIS ORIENTAL, AND PROVINCIAL ASSESSOR OF MISAMIS ORIENTAL, PETITIONERS, VS. PROSALITA BAGARES AND DANTON BAGARES, REPRESENTED BY PROSERFINA GALARRITA, RESPONDENTS.","Respondents alleged that on July 24, 1995, they purchased a 3,000-square meter parcel of land owned by the late Basilia Galarrita-Naguita (Basilia), situated in Lanao, Alubijid, Misamis Oriental, and identified as Lot No. 12020. Said property is a portion of the 7,687-square meter landholdings of Basilia. Basilia also sold a portion of Lot No. 12020, consisting of 3,655 square meter to the Local Government of Alubijid, Misamis Oriental and the remaining portion, consisting of 1,032 square meter to Prosalita.[4]

Subsequently, Aquilino Ramos (Aquilino) filed before the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) a free patent over Lot No. 12020 consisting of 7,687 square meter. Respondents opposed the application and alleged that Aquilino deliberately tampered the Deed of Sale of Unregistered Land he submitted to the Provincial Environment and Natural Resources Office (PENRO) by changing Lot No. 12019 to Lot No. 12020. PENRO denied the free patent filed by Aquilino.[5]

Meanwhile, Marilou, Benjamin, Elyer, and Lydia were buyers of a portion of Lot No. 12020 from Aquilino. The case became the subject of barangay conciliation, but the parties failed to reach an amicable settlement of their dispute.[6] They averred that the portion of land claimed by respondents is not the same portion they owned and possessed since 1978.[7]

On June 14, 2004, petitioners argued that their predecessor-in-interest did not tamper with the Deed. Further, they maintained that after Aquilino bought the subject property, he and the rest of them lived in the subject property until he sold some portions of it.[8]","Before the Court are consolidated Petitions for Review on Certiorari[1] assailing the Decision[2] dated May 31, 2023, of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 06149-MIN filed by the following: (1) the Heirs of Aquilino Ramos, represented by Wilbur M. Ramos (Wilbur), Marilou G. Ilagan (Marilou), Lydia Galarrita (Lydia), and Benjamin Galarrita (Benjamin); and (2) Marilou, Benjamin, and Elyer Galarrita (Elyer) (collectively, petitioners).

The CA affirmed the Decision[3] dated March 19, 2019, of Branch 44, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Initao, Misamis Oriental in Civil Case No. 2004-487 which granted the complaint for Declaration of Nullity of Tampered Deed of Sale of Unregistered Land filed by Prosalita Galarrita Bagares (Prosalita) and Danton Bagares (Danton), represented by Proserfina Galarrita (Proserfina) (collectively, respondents).","It is settled that a Rule 45 petition should only raise questions of law as the Court is not a trier of fact.[20] ""A question of law arises when there is doubt as to what the law is on a certain state of facts, while there is a question of fact when the doubt arises as to the truth or falsity of the alleged facts.""[21]

In the case, the following issues raised are factual matters that are beyond the scope of an appeal by certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court: (1) whether the deed of sale of Lot No. 12020 is null and void for having been tampered with; (2) whether prescription has already set in in favor of petitioners; and (3) whether petitioners are buyers in good faith.

In any case, even if the consolidated petitions are given due course, they must still fail for petitioners' failure to prove that the CA erred in affirming the ruling of the RTC in favor of respondents. As aptly observed by the CA:
In the present case, the findings of the DENR that Aquilino Ramos deliberately tampered his free patent application for Lot No. 12020 carries great weight and should be accorded respect, more so, when Aquilino Ramos failed to rebut such findings. There being no controversion, the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties applies favorably to the DENR. This means that the DENR's findings has become conclusive...

Aside from the findings of the DENR, the Court notes that Aquilino Ramos admitted during the barangay proceedings that he tampered [with] the deed of sale attached in his free patent application to Lot No. 12020. The admission by Aquilino Ramos qualifies as a judicial admission. Since such statement is judicial admission, it does not require proof according to Section 4, Rule 129 of the Rules of Court, which provides:
SEC. 4. Judicial admissions.  An admission, verbal or written, made by a party in the course of the proceedings in the same case, does not require proof. The admission may be contradicted only by showing that it was made through palpable mistake or that no such admission was made.
Since there is judicial admission that the deed of sale was tampered [with], then there is no question that the Deed of Sale of Unregistered Land selling Lot 12020 is void. Consequently, the Deed of Sale of Unregistered Land selling Lot 12020 did not transfer ownership of the land to appellants, as Aquilino Ramos had no title or interest to transfer.[22] (Citations omitted)
Indeed, ""the trial court's findings of fact are entitled to great weight and will not be disturbed on appeal.""[23] ""The rule finds an even more stringent application where the findings are sustained by the CA.""[24]

Here, the Court finds no cogent reason to overturn the finding of the RTC, as affirmed by the CA, that the subject Deed of Sale is void for having been tampered with by Aquilino Ramos.

Moreover, there is no merit in the argument of the Heirs of Aquilino Ramos in G.R. No. 271934 that they acquired ownership of the subject property by prescription.

""Prescription is a mode of acquiring ownership through the lapse of time and under certain conditions.""[25] It may either be ordinary or extraordinary.[26] ""Ordinary acquisitive prescription requires possession of things in good faith and with just title for a period of ten years, while extraordinary acquisitive prescription requires uninterrupted adverse possession of thirty years, without need of title or of good faith.""[27] As correctly observed by the CA:
In the case at bar, ordinary acquisitive prescription is unavailing as it demands that the possession be ""in good faith and with just title,"" and there is no evidence on record to prove [the Heirs of Aquilino Ramos'] ""good faith.""

Likewise, [the Heirs of Aquilino Ramos'] adverse possession of the land fell short of the requirements for extraordinary acquisitive prescription to set in. The records show that the subject land is an unregistered land. When the [Heirs of Aquilino Ramos] filed the instant case on April 15, 2004, [they] were in possession of the land for only 26 years counted from the time of the alleged start of their possession in 1978. Obviously, it fell short of the required 30 years of uninterrupted adverse possession without just title and good faith.[28] (Citations omitted)
The Court likewise rejects the contention of Marilou, Benjamin, and Elyer in G.R. No. 272834 that they are buyers in good faith because they had no notice that the seller did not have the capacity to sell the subject property. The records show that Marilou, Benjamin, Elyer, and Lydia bought the property when it was still an unregistered land. Jurisprudence dictates that ""[t]he defense of having purchased the property in good faith may be availed of only where registered land is involved and the buyer had relied in good faith on the clear title of the registered owner.""[29]

Finally, the Court notes the following infirmities in the petition which further warrant the consolidated petitions' denial:

In G.R. No. 271934, the Petition lacks: (a) a statement of material date of receipt of the assailed CA Decision; and (b) the proof of service thereof to the adverse parties and the CA.

In G.R. No. 272834, the timeliness of the motion for extension to file a petition for review on certiorari could not be determined due to an illegible postal mark. The Petition also lacks: (a) the proof of service thereof to the adverse parties and the CA; (b) a verified declaration of electronic submission of the filed soft copy of the petition as required under the Rules on E-Filing (A.M. No. 10-3-7-SC and the Efficient Use of Paper Rule (A.M. No. 11-9-4-SC); and (c) a statement of material date of filing of the motion for reconsideration of the assailed CA Decision.

Moreover, the jurat of the verification and certification of non-forum shopping lacks affiant's current identification document issued by an official agency bearing the photograph and signature of the individual in violation of Rule II, Sections 2, 6, and 12 of the 2004 Rules of Notarial Practice, as amended by A.M. No. 02-8-13-SC dated February 19, 2008. The verification and certification of non-forum shopping, too, was signed by Benjamin without proof of authority to sign for and on behalf of Marilou and Elyer.

All told, the Court resolves to deny the instant petitions for: first, raising factual issues; second, being procedurally defective; and third, failure of petitioners to show that the CA committed any reversible error as to warrant the Court's exercise of its discretionary appellate jurisdiction.

However, the Court finds it proper to delete the award of attorney's fees, in line with prevailing jurisprudence.","ACCORDINGLY, the consolidated petitions are DENIED. The Decision dated May 31, 2023, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 06149-MIN is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION, in that the award of attorney's fees is DELETED."
"G.R. No. 261323, November 27, 2024","CAPTAIN RAMON R. VERGA, JR., PETITIONER, VS. HARBOR STAR SHIPPING SERVICES, INC., RESPONDENT.","Harbor Star is a domestic corporation duly incorporated in accordance with the laws of the Republic of the Philippines.[6] It is primarily engaged in the business of providing harbor assistance, towing services, salvage, repairs, dry dock, and other related services to foreign and domestic sea-going vessels.[7]

On the other hand, Verga was a shareholder of Davao Tugboat and Allied Services, Inc. (DATASI) and Davtug Multi-Purpose Cooperative (DAVTUG) which are both engaged in businesses similar to Harbor Star's.[8] Particularly, DATASI was a domestic corporation involved in the tug and towage business in the district port of Davao.[9] It was managed by Verga and two other pilots, Captain Vicente Lagura (Lagura) and Captain Edgardo Alaan (Alaan).[10] In the course of its business, DATASI's principal shareholders organized a cooperative, DAVTUG, on March 7, 2006 to acquire more tugboats under the benefit of Republic Act No. 9520,[11] or the Philippine Cooperative Code of 2008. According to Verga, DATASI has been dominating the tugboat business in Davao as early as 2006.[12]

On several occasions between November 2006 to May 2008, Harbor Star wrote to DATASI, requesting business meetings for the parties to collaborate and work synergistically despite being competitors in the tugboat and towage business.[13] Notably, Harbor Star proposed several schemes through which it and DATASI may jointly conduct tugboat operations in Davao, including, among others, merger, partnership, and a joint venture with assignment of area operations.[14]

Harbor Star alleged that sometime during the second semester of 2008, it eventually persuaded Verga, as well as Lagura and Alaan, to sell their shares of stock in DATASI, with the understanding that after the final audit of the books of the two entities, and after receipt of more than 50% of the agreed valuation of the shares, they will comply with their obligation to execute the pertinent documents for the transfer of their shares of stock in DATASI to Harbor Star.[15] Supposedly, the parties agreed in principle to the PHP 6,000,000.00 valuation of Verga's shares, which shall be adjusted depending on the outcome of the final audit.[16] Although a Memorandum of Agreement[17] was prepared by Harbor Star in connection with the transaction, the draft was not executed by the parties and their agreement was not reduced in writing.[18]

Thereafter, from September 2008 to July 2009, Harbor Star made several installment payments to Verga, for a total amount of PHP 4,000,000.00.[19]

Later, in 2012, Harbor Star found out that after its initial payment to Verga, the latter divested his shares in DATASI, thereby making it impossible for him to transfer his DATASI shares to Harbor Star.[20] In a Letter[21] dated February 21, 2012, Harbor Star demanded Verga to return the sums of money that he received as payment for his shares in DATASI. Instead of returning the money, Verga demanded an additional amount of PHP 2,000,000.00 from Harbor Star for the latter to purportedly complete the payment of the PHP 6,000,000.00 due under their agreement.[22]

Thus, on April 12, 2012, Harbor Star filed a Complaint against Verga, praying that he be ordered to return the PHP 4,000,000.00 that he received from Harbor Star.[23] It averred that: one, it orally entered into an agreement for the sale of Verga's shares in DATASI and DAVTUG; and two, by divesting his interests in DATASI, Verga made it impossible for him to comply with his obligation to transfer his DATASI shares to Harbor Star. Thus, Harbor Star argued that Verga should return the sums of money that he received for the said shares.

In his defense, Verga denied the purported oral contract of sale over his DATASI and DAVTUG shares to Harbor Star. He narrated that there were several negotiations for Harbor Star to buyout the shares of the members of DAVTUG. However, Harbor Star spread a rumor among the cooperative members that Verga, Lagura, and Alaan will receive commissions from the buyouts, resulting in dissension among the members. Harbor Star then took advantage of the situation and tricked Verga, Lagura, and Alaan to resign from DAVTUG and DATASI in exchange for PHP 6,000,000.00. Supposedly, their resignation will serve as a marketing tool for Harbor Star to entice ship owners and agents to avail themselves of Harbor Star's services instead of DATASI's and DAVTUG's.[24]

Verga further alleged that in pursuit of their agreement, he resigned from DAVTUG on July 11, 2009, after he received a total of PHP 4,000,000.00 from Harbor Star.[25] However, Harbor Star reneged on its obligation by refusing to pay the remaining PHP 2,000,000.00 balance of the resignation incentive. He thus filed his counterclaim against Harbor Star in the amount of PHP 2,000,000.00, representing the unpaid balance of the resignation incentive.

Finally, Verga argued that Harbor Star could not have validly entered into an oral contract for the acquisition of his DATASI and DAVTUG shares in the absence of the approval of a majority of the board of directors (Board) of Harbor Star and ratification by the shareholders representing at least 2/3 of the outstanding capital stock of the corporation, in accordance with Section 42[26] of Batas Pambansa Blg. 68,[27] or the Corporation Code.[28] He insisted that the alleged agreement with Harbor Star for the sale of his DATASI and DAVTUG shares was unenforceable under the Statute of Frauds,[29] as provided in Article 1403(2)(d)[30] of the Civil Code.","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] (Petition) under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assailing the Decision[2] dated October 28, 2021, and the Resolution[3] dated June 6, 2022, of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 109255. The CA denied the appeal of petitioner Captain Ramon R. Verga, Jr. (Verga) and affirmed with modification the Decision[4] dated November 17, 2016, of Branch 66, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Makati City in Civil Case No. 12-298 that granted the Complaint for Sum of Money and Damages (Complaint) filed by respondent Harbor Star Shipping Services, Inc. (Harbor Star) against Verga.

In its Resolution, the CA denied the Motion for Reconsideration[5] of Verga for lack of merit.","The Petition is denied for lack of merit.

The Petition raises factual issues that are beyond the scope of a Rule 45 proceeding.[66] It is not the function of the Court to analyze or weigh all over again the evidence already considered and ruled upon by the RTC and the CA.[67] While there are recognized exceptions[68] to the rule, Verga has not shown that any of the exceptions apply to the present case.

At any rate, the Court finds no reversible error in the challenged rulings of the CA.
 
I.
The records establish that the parties entered into a contract of sale over Vergas DATASI shares to Harbor Star
 

The CA determined that there is a preponderance of evidence showing that the parties entered into an oral contract to sell Verga's shares in DATASI and DAVTUG, and that Harbor Star made partial payments for the shares in the total amount of PHP 4,000,000.00. Given that Verga divested his interest in DATASI, the CA held that Verga made it legally impossible for him to transfer and deliver the DATASI shares to Harbor Star, thereby making him liable to return the money that he received from Harbor Star.[69]

Verga imputes error to the CA's conclusion upon the argument that he received PHP 4,000,000.00 from Harbor Star as incentive for him to resign from DATASI and DAVTUG and not as partial payment for his shareholdings.[70]

The Court partially agrees with the CA that based on the evidence on record, the parties entered into a contract for the buyout of Verga's shares. However, the Court finds that the agreement is an oral contract of sale, not a contract to sell. Further, the subject matter of the agreement pertained only to Verga's shares in DATASI and not in DAVTUG, given that the vouchers[71] evidencing Harbor Star's payment of PHP 4,000,000.00 to Verga referred only to the DATASI shares. The draft memorandum of agreement[72] attached to the record also indicates a sale of Verga's DATASI shares to Harbor Star.

Although the CA's finding as regards the nature of the contract between the parties as an oral contract to sell and not a contract of sale was unassigned, the Court finds it proper to review the same in determining the appropriate remedies available to Harbor Star.
 
A.
The sum of money that Harbor Star paid to Verga was for the latter's shareholdings in DATASI
 

Article 1371 of the Civil Code states that ""[i]n order to judge the intention of the contracting parties, their contemporaneous and subsequent acts shall be principally considered."" Otherwise said, the decisive factor in determining the nature of a contract is the intention of the parties, as shown by their conduct, words, actions and deeds prior to, during, and immediately after the execution of the agreement.[73] As explained by the Court in Javier v. Court of Appeals:[74]
It is settled that the previous and simultaneous and subsequent acts of the parties are properly cognizable indicia of their true intention. Where the parties to a contract have given it a practical construction by their conduct as by acts in partial performance, such construction may be considered by the court in construing the contract, determining its meaning and ascertaining the mutual intention of the parties at the time of contracting. The parties' practical construction of their contract has been characterized as a clue or index to, or as evidence of, their intention or meaning and as an important, significant, convincing, persuasive, or influential factor in determining the proper construction of the agreement.[75]
The previous, contemporaneous, and subsequent acts of the parties demonstrate that they entered into a contract of sale, wherein Verga, as seller, sold his DATASI shares to Harbor Star, as buyer, in exchange for a sum of money. The parties' conduct does not support Verga's contention that Harbor Star paid him PHP 4,000,000.00 only as an incentive for him to resign from DATASI and DAVTUG.

First, Verga testified that before he received a total of PHP 4,000,000.00 from Harbor Star supposedly as incentive for his resignation from DATASI and DAVTUG, Harbor Star presented to him a draft memorandum of agreement[76] to reflect its intention.[77] However, a reading of the draft memorandum reveals that it pertains to the sale of Verga's DATASI shares to Harbor Star, not to an agreement for Verga to resign from DAVTUG in exchange for a sum of money:
The First Party [Harbor Star] acknowledges that the Second Party [Verga] is a stockholder of the present exclusive provider of pilotage services in Davao City. The Second Party [Verga] undertakes to protect the interests of the First Party [Harbor Star] to enable it to recover its investments in the tugboats.

2. CONSIDERATION  In consideration for this Agreement, the Second Party [Verga] hereby sells all his interests in the tug company (DATASI) in the amount of PESOS: SIX MILLION (Php6,000,000), ONE MILLION PESOS (Php1,000,000) of which is hereby acknowledged by the Second Party as having been received by him as Advance Payment.[78] (Italics supplied)
Although the draft memorandum of agreement was not signed by the parties, it still provides an insight into the intent behind Harbor Star's payment of PHP 4,000,000.00 to Verga. Verily, the Court has considered prior drafts of an agreement to discover the intent of the contracting parties and the circumstances surrounding their contract.[79]

Second, as correctly pointed out by the lower courts, several of the payment vouchers issued by Harbor Star indicate that the sums of money that it remitted to Verga referred to payments for his DATASI shares.[80] The Court particularly notes that one of the voucher receipts signed by Verga states that that he received PHP 250,000.00 from Harbor Star as ""Partial Payment for DATASI Shares[.]""[81]

Notably, the Memorandum of Agreement and payment vouchers indicate that the subject of the agreement between the parties pertained only to Verga's shareholdings in DATASI and not in DAVTUG. Hence, in contrast to the lower courts' conclusions, the Court finds that the PHP 4,000,000.00 that Harbor Star paid to Verga was only for the latter's shares in DATASI, not DAVTUG.

Despite the payment vouchers, Verga denies receiving the money as payment for his DATASI shares because, allegedly, when he signed the receipt, it was blank and did not indicate the purpose for the payment. He avers that the phrase ""Partial Payment for DATASI Shares"" was merely intercalated.[82]

The Court cannot lend credence to Verga's insistence that the vouchers were intercalated because of the elementary principle that forgery or falsification is never presumed and must be proven by clear, positive, and convincing evidence.[83] Significantly, neither the RTC nor the CA made any finding of forgery as to the vouchers. Besides, as pointed out by the RTC, Verga's allegation lacks credibility because the voucher[84] itself states that the amount of PHP 250,000.00 was being remitted to him as partial payment for his DATASI shares, yet he did not refute the contents of the voucher.[85]

Third, prior to the oral contract of sale, the letters exchanged between Harbor Star and DATASI representatives reveal the former's intention to enter into a merger or partnership with DATASI.[86] The acquisition of Verga's shares in DATASI is more consistent with Harbor Star's previous offers of merger or partnership.

Finally, as pointed out by Harbor Star, Verga's resignation from DAVTUG does not appear to have been prompted by the PHP 4,000,000.00 that he received from Harbor Star. Based on the Letter[87] dated July 11, 2009, that Verga signed, he resigned from DAVTUG after the other members refused to buyout his shares in the cooperative:
Last July 5, 2009 we offered to sell our shares to the cooperative or its members with a request that we be informed by July 10, 2009. We have not been favored with a reply. We view this as a refusal to buy our shares as determined by the auditor.

HEIRS OF MELANIA ROXAS, NAMELY: MANUEL A. ROXAS, MARIA ROSARIO ROXAS-URETA, ALEXANDER A. ROXAS, SALOME ROXAS-PANTALEON, PAUL GERARDO ROXAS, ELAINE ROXAS GAMBOA, MA. IMELDA ROXAS-CRUZ, AND DAVID ANTHONY ROXAS, RESPONDENTS.","Antonio Roxas (Antonio) and Melania Roxas (Melania) are the parents of Ferdinand, Manuel A. Roxas (Manuel), Maria Rosario Roxas-Ureta (Maria), Alexander A. Roxas (Alexander), Salome Roxas-Pantaleon (Salome), Paul Gerardo Roxas (Paul), Elaine Roxas-Gamboa (Elaine), Ma. Imelda Roxas-Cruz (Imelda), David Anthony Roxas (David), Conrado A. Roxas (Conrado), and Jesus A. Roxas (Jesus).[5]

In 1970, Melania's cousin Felicisma Garcia, married to Alfonso Garcia, executed a Deed of Absolute Sale (DOAS) in favor of Ferdinand over a 500-square-meter parcel of land located at Loakan, Baguio City (subject lot). Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-16657 was thereafter issued in Ferdinand's name. Melania built a house on the subject lot which the family used as a vacation house and residence of some of their children.[6]

From 1990 to 1995, Melania rented out a portion of the subject property to Alfredo Sison (Alfredo). In 1991, Paul started residing on the subject property together with his family.[7]

Antonio died on April 1, 1995. Subsequently, Ferdinand died on September 18, 2004, while Melania died on January 1, 2011.[8]

On November 11, 2014, Manuel, Maria, Alexander, Salome, Paul, Elaine, Imelda, and David (collectively, the Heirs of Melania) filed a Complaint[9] for the declaration of nullity of the DOAS and the cancellation of TCT No. T-16657. They alleged that it was Melania who purchased the subject lot, but she placed it in Ferdinand's name to protect the interests of her children in view of the existence of Antonio's illegitimate children. Ferdinand was 19 years old and still studying at the time of the sale. The house that Melania had built is declared in her name. Ferdinand never questioned his sibling's use of the subject property. The Heirs of Melania filed the complaint because the Heirs of Ferdinand sought to take over the subject property after Melania's death. The latter filed an unlawful detainer case against Paul before Branch 1, Municipal Trial Court in Cities, Baguio City. Jesus approved of the Complaint but did not join his siblings because he resides abroad. As for Conrado, his relationship with the Heirs of Melania is strained because he wants them to change their religion.[10]

The Heirs of Ferdinand countered that Ferdinand is the true owner of the subject lot. Antonio and Melania gave him the money to pay for the subject lot as they were overjoyed that he was about to graduate from college. Melania constructed the house with the permission of Ferdinand. Similarly, Ferdinand allowed Melania to rent out the property and keep the proceeds from it. Ferdinand also allowed Paul to reside on the subject property on the condition that he would vacate upon being asked to do so. When he asked Paul to leave, Melania pleaded with him to allow his brother to stay at least while she was still alive. Ferdinand paid the real property tax for the subject lot.[11]

The Heirs of Ferdinand averred that in 1988, Antonio and Melania transferred their assets to their family corporation, Mel-Rox Realty Inc. (Mel-Rox). After Antonio died, Mel-Rox gave the former's illegitimate children their share in his inheritance. Angela explained that Antonio's illegitimate children had their claim annotated on the titles of the properties registered under Mel-Rox. Thus, Mel-Rox paid Antonio's illegitimate children their claim on the estate of Antonio.[12] This prompted the legitimate children of Antonio and Melania to also ask for their share. On March 7, 1997, Melania, Conrado, Ferdinand, Elaine, and Imelda, as officers of Mel-Rox, executed a document entitled ""Donation/Gifts of Real Property and its Cash Equivalents to the Roxas Children from Mr. and Mrs. Antonio and Melania Roxas""[13] (Donation Document). Ferdinand's siblings were either given money or property. He did not receive anything as the subject property was already given to him.[14]

After Ferdinand died, the Heirs of Ferdinand met with some of the Heirs of Melania regarding the subject property as it was Ferdinand's wish for them to take over and improve it. They wanted to take possession of the subject property, but the Heirs of Melania told them that they could only do so after Melania's death. But even after Melania's death, Paul stayed on the subject property. Hence, they filed an ejectment case against him.[15]","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court filed by the heirs of Ferdinand A. Roxas (Ferdinand), namely: Angela Margarita T. Roxas (Angela), Dyan Paula T. Roxas (Dyan), Michael Jude T. Roxas (Michael), and Maria Katrina T. Roxas (Katrina) (collectively, the Heirs of Ferdinand), assailing the Decision[2] dated February 13, 2020, and the Resolution[3] dated September 29, 2020, of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 109260. The CA reversed the Decision[4] dated January 19, 2017, of Branch 5, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Baguio City, First Judicial Region in Civil Case No. 8146-R.","Considering the varying findings of the RTC and the CA, the Court deems it proper to give due course to the arguments raised by the Heirs of Ferdinand, albeit they involve factual issues.[36]

The Court grants the Petition.

Article 1448 of the Civil Code states:
ARTICLE 1448. There is an implied trust when property is sold, and the legal estate is granted to one party but the price is paid by another for the purpose of having the beneficial interest of the property. The former is the trustee, while the latter is the beneficiary. However, if the person to whom the title is conveyed is a child, legitimate or illegitimate, of the one paying the price of the sale, no trust is implied by law, it being disputably presumed that there is a gift in favor of the child.
The implied trust under Article 1448 is called a purchase money resulting trust, which has the following elements: (a) an actual payment of money, property or services, or an equivalent, constituting valuable consideration; and (b) such consideration must be furnished by the alleged beneficiary of a resulting trust. The party alleging the existence of the trust bears the burden of proving it.[37]

Notably, the last sentence of Article 1448 states that if the title is conveyed to a child of the one paying the price of the sale, the disputable presumption is that there is a gift in favor of the child. There being no question that Ferdinand is the child of Melania, and that Melania paid the purchase price for the subject lot, there is a disputable presumption that Melania intended to donate the subject lot to Ferdinand.

Being a disputable presumption, it may be overturned by contrary evidence. In Tong v. Go Tiat Kun,[38] the Court held that the presumption was overturned because of several factors. First, the child under whose name the property was titled did not prove that he had the means to pay for it. Second, the parent and his other children always had possession of the property. Third, the property remained undivided even though it was registered in the name of one child. The surviving heirs of the child under whose name it was titled only claimed ownership after the death of said child. Fourth, the surviving heirs of the child admitted that their predecessor-in-interest did not send any letter claiming ownership over the property and that they had their own residence. Finally, the parent paid the real property taxes.[39]

The Court disagrees with the CA that the Heirs of Melania successfully overturned the presumption in favor of Ferdinand.

Ferdinand admittedly did not pay for the subject lot. In addition, the subject lot was not divided. But the similarities with Tong end there. It was Ferdinand and his heirs who paid for the real property taxes on the subject lot.[40] Melania also consistently asked Ferdinand to permit Paul to stay in the subject lot and the house she had built. This showed that she respected Ferdinand as the owner of the subject lot. More, the Heirs of Ferdinand are in possession of TCT No. T-16657.

Melania's act of building a house on the subject lot, paying the taxes for said house,[41] and renting out a portion thereof,[42] do not negate her donative intent. As explained by Associate Justice Alfredo Benjamin S. Caguioa (Associate Justice Caguioa), ""these actions pertain only to the exercise of the right to the possession, use, and fruits of the lot.""[43]

Having settled that the presumption under Article 1448 stands, it must be determined if the donation should still comply with the formal requirements under the Civil Code. These requirements would depend on whether the property donated is movable or immovable.

In the Answer of the Heirs of Ferdinand before the RTC, they stated that what was given by Melania to Ferdinand was the money to purchase the subject lot.[44] Therefore, the applicable provision is Article 748 of the Civil Code, which states that ""[i]f the value of the personal property donated exceeds five thousand pesos, the donation and the acceptance shall be made in writing. Otherwise, the donation shall be void."" The DOAS states that the purchase price for the subject lot is exactly PHP 5,000.00;[45] hence, the donation need not be made in writing.

In any event, Associate Justice Caguioa astutely observed that ""it would be illogical for the law to require the presumed donation to still comply with the formal requisites because otherwise, there would be no need for the presumption.""[46] The presumption under Article 1448 is necessary precisely because the parent chose an unconventional mode in donating property to their child. The presumption under Article 1448 should not be overturned due to the failure to comply with the formal requisites under Articles 748 or 749 of the Civil Code but should instead be based on proof that the parent did not intend to donate the property to the child.

Accordingly, the Court agrees with the RTC that the complaint of the Heirs of Melania should be dismissed. However, the Court cannot sustain the award of attorney's fees for lack of factual and legal bases under Article 2208 of the Civil Code.","WHEREFORE, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is GRANTED.

"G.R. No. 252944, November 27, 2024","COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, PETITIONER, VS. PACIFIC HUB CORPORATION,* RESPONDENT.","In 2008, Pacific Hub sent a letter[8] to BIR, indicating its willingness to pay its unremitted taxes for years 2005 and 2006 but requested for abatement of penalties, surcharges, and interests due to continued financial losses. This was later followed by the filing sometime in 2010 of its Application for Abatement or Cancellation of Tax, Penalties and/or Interest,[9] as well as the payment of the basic deficiency withholding tax on compensation, expanded withholding tax, and value-added tax in the total amount of PHP 15,480,231.11.[10]

Pacific Hub eventually received the Notice of Denial dated January 10, 2014, rejecting its application for abatement. It also received the Warrant of Distraint and/or Levy dated September 12, 2014, enforcing the collection of the increments incident to its deficiency withholding tax on compensation and expanded withholding tax in the aggregate amount of PHP 13,792,867.56.[11]

Inevitably, Pacific Hub filed its Petition for Review[12] before the CTA seeking to annul and set aside the Notice of Denial and the Warrant of Distraint and/or Levy for having been irregularly issued in violation of its right to due process.[13]

In refutation, CIR contended that the CTA had no jurisdiction over the case as there was no final decision on a disputed assessment to be reviewed.[14] Moreover, the power to grant or deny a request for abatement is completely discretionary on the part of the CIR, hence, beyond the ambit of the CTA's appellate jurisdiction.[15] In any case, the exercise of this power was not attended by grave abuse of discretion.[16]

Ensuingly, the CTA Third Division rendered its Decision[17] annulling both the Notice of Denial and the Warrant of Distraint and/or Levy. The CTA held that it had jurisdiction over the case under its ""other matters"" jurisdiction.[18] It found that the Warrant of Distraint and/or Levy was void for having been issued without the benefit of a prior assessment issued against Pacific Hub.[19] In the same vein, the Notice of Denial was void for failing to state the reasons for the denial of the application, in contravention of the requirements under Revenue Regulations No. 13-2001.[20] Withal, the CTA clarified that the voiding of the Notice of Denial does not mean that Pacific Hub is readily entitled to its request for abatement. This matter is still left to the best discretion of the CIR.[21]

With its bid for reconsideration[22] having been rebuffed by the CTA Third Division,[23] the CIR filed its Petition for Review[24] before the CTA En Banc.

In the impugned Decision, the CTA En Banc affirmed the rulings of the CTA Third Division.[25] It reverberated that the CTA has jurisdiction to review the Notice of Denial issued by the CIR.[26] While the courts may not generally interfere with discretionary functions, such as the grant or denial of an application for abatement, it may do so when the exercise thereof is attended by grave abuse of discretion,[27] as in this case. Since the Notice of Denial bore no indication as to the reason why Pacific Hub's application was denied, the CIR clearly contravened the requirements under Revenue Regulations No. 13-2001.[28] Similarly, the Warrant of Distraint and/or Levy was also void for being issued without a prior assessment, thereby contravening Pacific Hub's right to due process.[29]

Unyielding, the CIR sought reconsideration but was again brushed aside by the CTA En Banc through the oppugned Resolution.

Now, before this Court, the CIR resolutely asseverates that the CTA En Banc erred in holding that: (1) the CTA had jurisdiction to review the Notice of Denial; (2) the Notice of Denial was not issued in accordance with BIR regulations; and (3) the Warrant of Distraint and/or Levy was not validly issued.","This Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] seeks to overturn the Decision[2] and the Resolution[3] of the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) sitting en banc which affirmed the nullity of the Warrant of Distraint and/or Levy[4] dated September 12, 2014 and the Notice of Denial[5] dated January 10, 2014 issued by petitioner Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) against respondent Pacific Hub Corporation (Pacific Hub), and which denied the subsequent motion for reconsideration[6] filed by CIR, in CTA EB No. 1837.","The Petition is devoid of merit.

The first issue raised by CIR calls for a clarification on the extent of the ""other matters"" jurisdiction of the CTA and whether this can extend to reviewing the CIR's exercise of its power to grant or deny applications for abatement or cancellation of taxes, penalties, and interests. The CIR argues that it has sole discretion on this matter and the CTA's act of assuming jurisdiction over the case encroaches upon the prerogatives of the executive department in violation of the principle of separation of powers.[30]

This argument fails to persuade.

The CTA's ""other matters"" jurisdiction in relation to the CIR is enshrined in Section 7(a)(1) of Republic Act No. 1125,[31] as amended by Republic Act No. 9282:[32]
SEC. 7. Jurisdiction.  The CTA shall exercise:

(a) Exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review by appeal, as herein provided:

(1) Decisions of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue in cases involving disputed assessments, refunds of internal revenue taxes, fees or other charges, penalties in relation thereto, or other matters arising under the National Internal Revenue Code or other laws administered by the Bureau of Internal Revenue[.](Emphasis supplied)
In Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Hambrecht & Quist Philippines, Inc.,[33] the Court had occasion to elucidate that the term ""other matters"" is virtually unbridled save for the qualifying phrase that immediately follows:
Plainly, the assailed CTA En Banc Decision was correct in declaring that there was nothing in the foregoing provision upon which petitioner's theory with regard to the parameters of the term ""other matters"" can be supported or even deduced. What is rather clearly apparent, however, is that the term ""other matters"" is limited only by the qualifying phrase that follows it.

Thus, on the strength of such observation, we have previously ruled that the appellate jurisdiction of the CTA is not limited to cases which involve decisions of the CIR on matters relating to assessments or refunds. The second part of the provision covers other cases that arise out of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) or related laws administered by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR).[34] (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)
Indeed, a plain reading of the provision yields the inevitable conclusion that the CTA has the power to review not only matters arising or incidental to tax assessments or refunds, but also to any case arising from the application of the provisions of the Tax Code or other tax laws that are administered by the BIR. In fact, the Court has affirmed the CTA's ""other matters"" jurisdiction over cases involving: (a) the determination of whether the right of the CIR to collect the validly assessed tax has prescribed;[35] (b) cases seeking the cancellation and withdrawal of a warrant of distraint and/or levy;[36] (c) cases seeking a determination of the validity of waivers of the statute of limitations as well as the proper availment of tax amnesty;[37] and (d) cases on the proper exercise of the CIR's power to compromise delinquent accounts and to grant an informer's reward.[38]

From the foregoing, it becomes evident that the determination of whether the CIR has properly exercised the powers granted to it by the Tax Code may likewise fall under the CTA's ""other matters"" jurisdiction. However, does this also apply to the exercise of a power that is purely discretionary on the part of the CIR, such as the power to abate or cancel taxes, penalties, or interests?

The Court answers in the affirmative.

It bears accentuating that the Court had already impliedly recognized the CTA's jurisdiction to review the CIR's denial of an application for abatement in Qatar Airways Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue,[39] albeit therein petitioner's case was ultimately dismissed for its failure to timely file its judicial petition before the CTA.

All the same, applicable laws and jurisprudence support the foregoing interpretation of the CTA's ""other matters"" jurisdiction.

The power to abate or cancel a tax liability is vested in the CIR under Section 204(B) of the Tax Code:
Section 204. Authority of the Commissioner to Compromise, Abate and Refund or Credit Taxes.  The Commissioner may 

. . . .

(B) Abate or cancel a tax liability, when:

(1) The tax or any portion thereof appears to be unjustly or excessively assessed; or

(2) The administration and collection costs involved do not justify the collection of the amount due.
The Court recognizes that this power to abate or cancel a tax liability is purely discretionary on the part of the CIR given that it is ""a power or right conferred upon them by law of acting officially, under certain circumstances, according to the dictates of their own judgments and consciences, uncontrolled by the judgments or consciences of others.""[40]

While the courts may generally not interfere in an administrative agency's exercise of a purely administrative or discretionary power, this rule admits of exceptions such as when ""the issuing authority has gone beyond its statutory authority, has exercised unconstitutional powers or has clearly acted arbitrarily and without regard to his duty or with grave abuse of discretion.""[41]

This flows from the reigning principle that the judicial power conferred by the 1987 Constitution on the Supreme Court and all other lower courts, including the CTA, necessarily carries with it the power to ""determine if any government branch or instrumentality has acted beyond the scope of its powers, such that there is grave abuse of discretion.""[42]

The Court has long settled that the CTA has the authority to issue writs of certiorari to review whether the acts or omissions of certain agencies are attended by grave abuse of discretion.[43] The Court has likewise declared that this authority is inherent in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction.[44]

Invariably, it is this very same rationale which the Court applied in PNOC v. Court of Appeals[45] to hold that the exercise of the CIR's discretionary power to enter into a compromise is subject to the CTA's power of judicial review. The Court pronounced that the ""[CIR] would have to exercise his discretion within the parameters set by the law, and in case he abuses his discretion, the CTA may correct such abuse if the matter is appealed to them.""[46]

By parity of reasoning, the exercise of the CIR's discretionary power to abate or cancel taxes, penalties, and interests, if attended by grave abuse of discretion, is properly appealable to the CTA under its ""other matters"" jurisdiction, as was done in this case.

Having resolved that the CTA correctly assumed jurisdiction over the case at bench, the Court delves into the second issue on whether the Notice of Denial was indeed issued with grave abuse of discretion. Specifically, in denying Pacific Hub's application, did the CIR exercise its power in an arbitrary or despotic manner to the point that it amounted to an evasion of a positive duty or a refusal to act in contemplation of law?[47]

To this, the Court again answers in the affirmative.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED. The November 8, 2019 Decision and the June 26, 2020 Resolution of the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc in CTA EB No. 1837 are AFFIRMED.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[9]
In a separate Information, petitioner was charged with violation of Section 5(b) of Republic Act No. 7610, committed against his daughter, AAA. The accusatory portion of the Information states:
Criminal Case No. 12-CR-8990

That sometime in the month of March 2012, at xxxxxxxxxxx, Municipality of xxxxxxxxxxx, Province of Benguet, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named [petitioner], who is the biological father of the offended party, with grave abuse of authority, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously commit an act of sexual abuse against [his] daughter. AAA, a minor, who was seven (7) years old at the time of the commission of the crime, by letting her hold his penis while inserting his finger in her vagina against her will and consent which deeds debase, degrade and demean the intrinsic worth and dignity of the said AAA as a human being, to her great damage, prejudice and mental anguish.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[10]
Upon arraignment, petitioner entered pleas of ""Not Guilty"" to both charges.[11]

Trial ensued.[12]

Petitioner and CCC have been common-law partners since 2003. They have a child, AAA, who was born on xxxxxxxxxxx.[13] According to CCC, petitioner had been hurting her, both physically and verbally. At one point, he almost threw a liquefied petroleum gas [LPG] tank at her; he also slapped and chased her with a bolo when he would come home drunk. He even threatened to chop her body into pieces. One day, she left their residence and went to xxxxxxxxxxx, Benguet to work; she left petitioner with their daughter, AAA.[14]

In 2010, petitioner and AAA followed CCC in xxxxxxxxxxx, Benguet. There, she and petitioner agreed on AAAs custody. However, whenever AAA was in her custody, petitioner would often cause trouble in her boarding house. He would forcibly open the door of the boarding house, or utter abusive words.[15]

In 2012, petitioner went to CCCs boarding house to ask for money and convince her that they get back together; she refused. One day, AAA told CCC that petitioner sexually abused her; the first incident happened when she was about seven years old. According to AAA, every time petitioner got drunk, he would make her hold his penis and touch her vagina. Later, they went to the police station where CCC informed Police Officer II Dexter Gosgos (PO2 Gosgos) that petitioner was ""creating trouble"" in the boarding house. PO2 Gosgos then invited petitioner to the police station for investigation.[16]

Meanwhile, AAA narrated that when her parents separated, she and petitioner stayed in xxxxxxxxxxx, Benguet. In March 2012, petitioner touched her vagina while she was in bed. Sometimes, he would pull her hands and made her touch his penis. One time, petitioner slapped her when she did not reveal where her mother, CCC was staying.[17]

On June 12, 2012, Dr. Michelle Payagen (Dr. Payagen) conducted a physical examination on AAA and observed swelling on her right cheek. According to Dr. Payagen, the swelling could have been secondary to injury or caused by trauma by a blunt force.[18]

Despite the opportunity, petitioner failed to secure the services of a lawyer and present his own evidence.[19]","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] filed by BBB255466 (petitioner) which assails the Decision[2] dated March 3, 2020, and the Resolution[3] dated January 8, 2021, of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R.

DUREZA, IN HIS CAPACITY AS SECRETARY OF THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENTIAL ADVISER ON THE PEACE PROCESS; BANGSAMORO TRANSITION COMMISSION; AND MORO ISLAMIC LIBERATION FRONT, RESPONDENTS.","In the September 9, 2024 Decision, this Court denied the consolidated Petitions seeking to declare as unconstitutional the Bangsamoro Organic Law and prevent the conduct of a plebiscite to ratify it. Unanimously declaring the inclusion of the Province of Sulu in BARMM as unconstitutional, this Court upheld the validity of the remaining provisions of the statute.

The dispositive portion of the assailed Decision reads:
ACCORDINGLY, the application for the issuance of a temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction in G.R. Nos. 242255 and 243246, and the Motion for Inhibition in G.R. No. 243246 are DENIED for lack of merit.

The Petition in G.R. No. 242255 is PARTIALLY GRANTED. Republic Act No. 11054, in so far as it includes petitioner Province of Sulu in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, is declared VOID for being UNCONSTITUTIONAL. The Province of Sulu shall not be part of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.

The remaining provisions of Republic Act No. 11054, otherwise known as the Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, based on the challenges raised in these petitions, are NOT UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

This Decision is immediately executory.","The result of the plebiscite is clear. The people of Sulu voted against ratifying the Bangsamoro Organic Law. This Court cannot override the will of the people expressed through the votes cast. It cannot trivialize that reality.

The creation of an autonomous region must be based on the independent will of the people in each province or city, honoring their choice rather than imposing the collective decision of others. To treat the entire autonomous region as one geographic area not only overrides the right of each province and city for self-determination, but also undermines the distinct historical, cultural, and political characteristics that make them Bangsamoro.

This Court resolves the Motions for Partial Reconsideration seeking to reverse and set aside the September 9, 2024 En Banc Decision[1] in so far as it voids the inclusion of petitioner Province of Sulu in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) created by Republic Act No. 11054, also known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law.","The Court was not confronted with the proper interpretation of history. Rather, it was confronted with the results of a plebiscite that was a product of that history. It was a plebiscite that also made history.

In arriving at its conclusions, nowhere did this Court denigrate, diminish nor marginalize the contribution of the Tausug of Sulu. Rather, it recognizes their collective voice of self-determination expressed through the plebiscite.

Every revolution must eventually contend with being able to convince all its people of the political arrangements it wins. After all, the essence of every democratic uprising is to empower its people. Even revolutionaries must eventually respect the results of a free, fair, and honest plebiscite or election.

The claim that BARMM is not BARMM without Sulu oversimplifies the Bangsamoro identity to a single thread, overlooking the many voices that collectively define the region. The Bangsamoro Autonomous Region is a vibrant tapestry of diverse ethnic communities and indigenous peoples, each contributing to its unique identity. While the Province of Sulu has its place in the history of the Bangsamoro struggle, BARMM also represents the interests of other groups in the region. The exclusion of the Province of Sulu, based on its own people's vote, does not erase the Bangsamoro identity, but rather, reinforces the need for an autonomous region that respects the democratic choices of its diverse constituencies.

Not being part of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region does not reduce the identity of the Tausug as Bangsamoro as much as a Filipino's choice to reside abroad does not diminish their Filipino identity. It simply is a choice not to join the current political arrangement. Should the Tausugs in Sulu wish to rejoin, there are peaceful, legal processes allowed by the Constitution for them to do so.

As to claims that the Court decided without understanding the context of the people of Mindanao, we remind them:

It is this Supreme Court that has sought ways and means to recognize Shari'ah. It is this Supreme Court that visited the Province of Tawi-Tawi and paid respects to the first mosque established in our country, the Sheikh Karimul Makhdum Mosque in Tubig Indangan, Simunul. It is this Supreme Court that entered ground zero in the Islamic City of Marawi during the pandemic. It is also this Supreme Court that has taken over the special Shari'ah bar examinations, introducing reforms to start integrating Shari'ah practice into the legal profession. It is this Supreme Court that included Shari'ah and inclusivity of all in its goal to achieve access to justice as articulated in the Strategic Plan for Judicial Innovations 2022-2027.

The unanimous decision of this Court is a challenge to the leaders of the Bangsamoro. It is a challenge as well to those who insist in a dogmatic reading of what identity means for all peoples. Reforms must occur while accepting the dynamism of the Constitution. Lobbying for better laws, better administration in the autonomous region, better institutions, and further integration of Shari'ah into our legal system may cause a lot of debate but they can be done patiently and peacefully.

Insisting on a static interpretation of history is not the clear path to a just and lasting peace. Accepting the self-determined will of a people in a plebiscite required by the Constitution will.","ACCORDINGLY, the Motions for Partial Reconsideration of the following are DENIED with FINALITY for lack of merit:
The Office of the Solicitor General, BARMM Chief Minister Ahod B. Ebrahim, through the Bangsamoro Attorney General's Office, and Atty. Algamar A. Latiph, filed on October 1, 2024;

Atty. Laisa Masuhud Alamia, filed on October 8, 2024; and

Don Mustapha Arbison Loong, Atty. Nazir Hatab Ynawat, Adzfar H. Usman, Nasser Arbison Loong and Mhavejekamar L. Marrack, filed on October 18, 2024.
The Decision dated September 9, 2024 of this Court is AFFIRMED.

In the interest of justice and equity, this Court applies the doctrine of operative fact to recognize and give legal effect to all acts performed prior to the declaration of unconstitutionality of the inclusion of the Province of Sulu in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.

This Decision is FINAL AND IMMEDIATELY EXECUTORY. No further pleadings will be entertained."
"G.R. No. 263811, November 26, 2024","COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, PETITIONER, VS. FORT 1 GLOBAL CITY CENTER, INC., RESPONDENT.","For the taxable year 2009, the BIR issued a Preliminary Assessment Notice[6] (PAN) dated January 24, 2012, finding FGCCI liable for deficiency income tax, value-added tax (VAT), withholding tax (WT), and documentary stamp tax (DST). FGCCI contested these findings, but the BIR issued a Final Assessment Notice[7] (FAN) as a response. After FGCCI filed its protest to the FAN,[8] the BIR issued a Final Decision on Disputed Assessment[9] (FDDA) dated October 13, 2016, informing FGCCI that it is liable to pay deficiency taxes amounting to PHP 1,598,860,663.45 for the taxable year 2009.

On the other hand, for the taxable year 2012, the BIR issued a PAN[10] dated February 3, 2016, and a FAN[11] dated March 15, 2016, for deficiency income tax and VAT totaling PHP 134,099,378.74. FGCCI filed its protest to the FAN on April 1, 2016, but the BIR did not act on the protest.

Hence, FGCCI filed two separate Petitions for Review on Certiorari before the CTA to question: (a) the CIR's inaction to its protest for the taxable year 2012 and (b) the FDDA for the taxable year 2009. The two cases were eventually consolidated.[12]

FGCCI argued that the assessments were invalid because the notices were served to the wrong address. Specifically, the Letter of Authority (LOA), PAN, FAN, and FDDA for the taxable year 2009 were delivered to 30th Street, Bonifacio Blvd., Global City, Taguig,[13] while the LOA, PAN, and FAN for the taxable year 2012 were served at 32nd Street, comer Boni Avenue.[14] However, the principal address of FGCCI in its 2016 General Information Sheet (GIS) is Unit 2C-B, FPS Building, 1st Avenue, comer 30th Street, Global City, Taguig.[15] According to FGCCI, it got copies of the BIR notices because an uninterested third person received them and informed FGCCI. FGCCI added that the BIR notices were not served on persons authorized by FGCCI. In their testimony before the CTA, the Revenue Officers failed to identify the position or affiliation of the persons to whom the letters and assessments were served.

For his part, the CIR alleged that the LOA, PAN, and FAN for taxable years 2009 and 2012 were properly served to FGCCI, as evidenced by the ""stamped received"" annotation on BIR's copies.[16] Besides, even assuming that these documents were served to the wrong address and persons, FGCCI is deemed to have received them because it responded and duly protested the assessments.[17]","In this petition,[1] the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) seeks to reverse and set aside the Decision[2] dated November 10, 2021, and Resolution[3] dated October 7, 2022, of the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) En Banc in CTA EB No. 2233 that affirmed the CTA 2nd Division Decision[4] dated September 24, 2019 and Resolution[5] dated January 23, 2020 in CTA Case Nos. 9490 and 9503. The CTA cancelled the deficiency tax assessments issued by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) against Fort 1 Global City Center, Inc. (FGCCI) for taxable years 2009 and 2012 on the ground of void assessment as FGCCI did not receive the assessment notices.","Preliminarily, We discuss the procedural lapse that occurred in this case.
 
The CIR admits that it has filed the present petition out of time  one day after the deadline.[38] The late filing was due to heavy work and close proximity of due dates. Yet, a heavy workload is relative and often self-­serving.[39] A heavy workload, standing alone, is hardly a compelling or meritorious reason to allow extensions of time to file pleadings.[40] Besides, We have consistently held that the need to comply with reglementary periods to file appeals is an adjunct of the basic principle that the right to appeal is merely vested by statute. Thus, anyone who appeals must diligently comply with the governing rules.[41] This Court has not shied away from dismissing appeals and petitions non-observant of the Rules of Court.[42]

The rule, however, is not without exception. Procedural rules are merely designed to facilitate the proper adjudication of cases. If the rigid application of the rules of procedure tends to obstruct the dispensation of justice, they can be relaxed.[43]

After carefully reviewing the facts and law of the case and considering the amount of deficiency taxes involved, which, when collected, will devolve into the government's coffers, We deem it proper to take cognizance of the present case. We held in Thenamaris Philippines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals:[44]
[W]e recognized that although procedural rules ought to be strictly enforced by courts in order to impart stability in the legal system, we have, nonetheless, relaxed the rigid application of the rules of procedure in several cases to afford the parties the opportunity to fully ventilate their cases on the merits. This is because the ends of justice would be better served if the parties were given the chance to argue their causes and defenses. We are likewise constantly reminded that the general objective of procedure is to facilitate the application of justice to the opposing claims of the competing parties and always be guided by the principle that procedure must not hinder but, rather, promote the administration of justice.[45]
However, the Petition must still be denied. ","ACCORDINGLY, the petition is DISMISSED. The Court of Tax Appeals En Banc Decision dated November 10, 2021 and Resolution dated October 7, 2022 in Court of Tax Appeals En Banc No. 2233 are AFFIRMED. The deficiency tax assessments issued against Fort 1 Global City Center, Inc., for taxable years 2009 and 2012 are declared VOID and CANCELLED."

""HONEY SWEET"" A.K.A. ""SWEET SWEET"", ACCUSED-APPELLANTS.","That on September 19, 2014 until September 22, 2014 at xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring, confederating, and helping each other, well-knowing that offended parties, [BBB270174][4] (9 years old) and [AAA270174] (12 years old), are minors, did then and there recruit, transport, transfer, and harbor, provide or receive the minor victims and thereafter kept, chained, and detained them inside a rented house in xxxxxxx, of this City, for purposes of prostitution, pornography, and sexual exploitation [through] the following acts[,] to wit: on September 19, 2014, accused by inducement and successfully recruited, transported, transferred, and harbored said minor victims taking advantage of their young age by bringing them to a rented house in xxxxxxx of this City, but upon reaching the area, victims were made to drink liquor, and were thereafter tied at the hands, neck, and feet with the use of a chain and cloth; on September 20 to September 22, 2014, accused CARME ANN ALVAREZ and PETER GERALD SCULLY, subjected both victims to sexual exploitation by making them lick the vagina of CARME ANN ALVAREZ, making them lick each other's vagina, making them perform a blow-job on PETER GERALD SCULLY, and the latter inserting his fingers into the vagina of [AAA270174], and forcing [BBB270174] to insert her fingers into the vagina of CARME ANN ALVAREZ; further, that on September 20, 2014, accused photographed, and documented through the use of a laptop, the sexual acts they committed on the victims, thus, subjecting them not only to sexual exploitation, but also to pornography, to their damage and great prejudice.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[5]
Upon arraignment, Scully and Alvarez pleaded not guilty to the charges.[6]

Pre-trial subsequently ensued. During the pre-trial, Scully and Alvarez admitted that they were the people named and charged in the Informations. However, they both denied their respective aliases. Additionally, the prosecution produced the certificates of live birth of the two minor victims, but the defense denied their minority, and remarked that the birth certificates were belatedly registered. Further, the defense denied that Scully and Alvarez were in xxxxxxxxxxxxxx during the alleged dates of the crimes.[7]

Trial on the merits commenced.

To establish Scully and Alvarez's guilt, the prosecution presented the two victims, AAA270174 and BBB270174, Social Worker Rosevic Alisbo (RSW Alisbo), Center Social Worker Katherine Callanta (CSW Callanta), Police Officer II Barcy Gaabucayan (PO2 Gaabucayan), Police Officer I Jennifer Husayan (PO1 Husayan), PO1 Madonna Dayo (PO1 Dayo), Dr. Sarah Pingol (Dr. Pingol), and Dr. Rosemarie Gunato (Dr. Gunato).

The records show that on September 19, 2014, AAA270174 and BBB270174 (collectively, girls) were in a mall in xxxxxxxxxxx when Alvarez approached them. She asked the victims if they knew a certain Analin, but they responded in the negative.[8]

AAA270174 and BBB270174 went to another mall. Alvarez followed them, and asked them if they were hungry, but the girls did not reply. Alvarez, however, still bought them hotdogs, which they ate. Afterwards, Alvarez coaxed the girls to come with her on the pretext that she will provide them with their needs and wants. Consequently, the girls eventually agreed. Thus, Alvarez immediately flagged down a taxi, which she and the girls boarded.[9]

Upon arriving at a house in xxxxxxx Subdivision, AAA270174 and BBB270174 saw an almost naked Scully busy on his laptop. Upon seeing them, Scully introduced himself to the girls, and asked for their names.[10]

Alvarez, however, immediately instructed them to undress. The girls initially refused, but Alvarez insisted that whoever was older should remove their clothes first. After much prodding, AAA270174 and BBB270174 reluctantly removed their dresses and their underwear. Alvarez then proceeded to feed the girls some snacks, and even bathed them. Afterwards, both Scully and Alvarez instructed AAA270174 and BBB270174 to remove their towels and spread their legs, while they took photos.[11]

On the evening of September 19, 2024, Scully gave AAA270174 and BBB270174 some biscuits and alcoholic beverages. The girls managed to drink several bottles each, making them drunk and disoriented.[12] BBB270174 even ended up vomiting.[13]

AAA270174 and BBB270174 promptly fell asleep. However, they woke up to discover that Scully and Alvarez were bounding and gagging them with the use of cloth and rope. The girls were then stripped naked with chains around their neck, while Scully and Alvarez also took photos of them. AAA270174 and BBB270174 were eventually untied, and Scully and Alvarez instructed them to watch a pornographic film.[14]

On September 20, 2014, Alvarez instructed AAA270174 and BBB270174 to dig a hole on the ground floor of the house with the use of a shovel, all while the girls were still naked with chains around their necks. This digging occurred every morning until the girls' escape on September 23, 2014.[15]

In the evening of the same day, AAA270174 and BBB270174 were again stripped naked by Scully and Alvarez, and they took pictures of the girls. Alvarez then tied BBB270174's hands and feet on the bed, in a position that spread her legs apart. AAA270174 was then told to pour oil all over her body. Alvarez then instructed AAA270174 to lick BBB270174's vagina. AAA270174 initially refused, but Alvarez pushed her. Scully likewise licked BBB270174's vagina. When BBB270174 was untied, AAA270174 was then instructed that it was her turn to be tied and bound, with her legs apart. Alvarez also instructed BBB270174 to lick AAA270174's vagina.[16]

Alvarez gave the girls further instructions to perform oral sex on Scully. Further, they were taught to perform sexy poses and ordered to spread their legs apart, while Scully and Alvarez recorded the explicit acts.[17]

After the ordeal, Scully and Alvarez had sex with each other in front of AAA270174 and BBB270174, while the girls recorded them. During their sexual intercourse, Scully directed AAA270174 to sit on his face, so he can lick her vagina while having sex with Alvarez. AAA270174 did as she was told and BBB270174 held the camera and took the video.[18]

On September 21, 2014, AAA270174 and BBB270174 were made to wear bras with foam and t-back panties. Alvarez applied make up on them and ordered them to dance while she took a video of them. She instructed them to spread their legs apart as she took photos of their genitalia. She also commanded them to turn around so that she could take photos of their buttocks. Scully likewise took their photos while he was naked.[19]

After the photoshoot, Scully and Alvarez instructed AAA270174 and BBB270174 to play a game using an eggplant tied to the chains around their necks and an egg. The tip of the chain was connected to the eggplant and the egg was on the floor. The girls were made to push the egg on the floor using the eggplant, and to push the egg towards the finish line. They had to push the egg for a distance of about three meters, while Scully and Alvarez were cheering and laughing.[20]

At night, AAA270174 and BBB270174 were made to watch pornography again. BBB270174, who was beside Scully and Alvarez on the bed, was ordered to suck Scully's penis. Scully then took BBB270174's hand and inserted it in Alvarez's vagina, while BBB270174 made a slow push and pull motion. Unsatisfied, Scully inserted BBB270174's entire arm and commanded her to speed up the push and pull motions. BBB270174 was then told to lick Alvarez's vagina, which she did despite her disgust. Scully then inserted his fingers into Alvarez's vagina.[21]

On September 22, 2014, AAA270174 and BBB270174 were again made to watch pornography while naked. This time, it was AAA270174 who was beside Scully and Alvarez. While on the bed, Scully began touching AAA270174, and inserted his thumb, and then his four fingers into the latter's vagina. AAA270174 cried and screamed for help, but to no avail because Alvarez pinned her down. Alvarez further instructed BBB270174 to hold AAA270174 down, which she obeyed out of fear. Thus, despite AAA270174's protests, Scully continued inserting his fingers in and out of her vagina while she sobbed. To lessen the noise, Alvarez took a pillow and placed it on AAA270174's face. The girls were then directed to perform oral sex on Scully's penis.[22]

Throughout these days, there were several instances when Scully and Alvarez had sex in front of AAA270174 and BBB270174. They often made the girls watch and even instructed them to take videos.[23]

On September 23, 2014, Scully and Alvarez placed the girls inside a room and left the house. Consequently, AAA270174 and BBB270174 were able to check the kitchen door. The girls realized that it was not locked. Thus, they were able to escape the house by carefully passing Scully and Alvarez's dog and then climbing the fence. The girls successfully escaped, and they were able to reach AAA270174's sister and father, who saw them wearing provocative clothing with chains around their neck. Thus, they were immediately brought to the police station.[24]

While at the police station, AAA270174 and BBB270174 were interviewed. They were able to pinpoint the house where they were held captive. Upon their arrival near the location of the house, the police officers waited for Scully and Alvarez's arrival. A taxi stopped near the house and the girls were able to positively identify Alvarez.[25] Immediately, PO2 Gaabucayan[26] and PO1 Husayan[27] arrested Alvarez.

The police then brought AAA270174 and BBB270174 to continue their interview with the assistance of social workers. The girls were then assisted by PO1 Dayo and brought to the xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Medical Center (xxxxxxxx) for medical examination.[28]

Dr. Fatmah B. Mangondato of the xxxxxx conducted the girls' medical examination and issued corresponding Living Case Reports. AAA270174's genital examination showed that there was ""6 o'clock and 9 o'clock erythematous hymenal laceration"" and there was redness and trauma on the vaginal hymen. BBB270174's genital examination, on the other hand, revealed ""erythamatous intact hymen,"" which means that there was redness in the tissue of her hymen, which was, however, intact.[29]

AAA270174 and BBB270174 underwent psychological counseling. Dr. Gonato, the psychologist who monitored the girls for several years, noted that both of them continued to show signs of trauma, such as forms of flashbacks, discontinued sleeping, loss of appetite, loss of interest in activities, fearfulness, and sadness.[30]","This Court resolves the Appeal[1] filed by Peter Gerald Scully a.k.a. ""Peter Russell"" a.k.a ""Peter Riddel"" (Scully) and Carme Ann Alvarez a.k.a. ""Honey Sweet"" a.k.a. ""Sweet Sweet"" (Alvarez) assailing the Decision[2] of the Court of Appeals (CA), which affirmed the Decision[3] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) that found them guilty beyond reasonable doubt of qualified trafficking in persons.

Scully and Alvarez were charged with the crimes of qualified trafficking of persons and five counts of rape by sexual assault. The cases were filed in 2014. However, the Hall of Justice in xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx was ravaged by fire. Thus, the records of the case had to be reconstituted. The accusatory portion of the reproduced Information reads:
[FC CRIMINAL CASE NO. 2014-471-R]","Preliminarily, accused-appellants bewail that the RTC violated their constitutional right to be heard when they were unable to present their defenses to the charges against them. Further, they cry foul over the fact that their lawyer was prohibited to present on the additional dates set by the RTC for the prosecution to present its witnesses. They also assail the fact that the prosecution was given a chance to conduct a marathon hearing on dates that were not agreed upon during the pre-trial, despite their manifestation that they do not have any legal representation willing to defend their cause.[37]

Accused-appellants attribute their failure to present their defense due to the negligence of their counsel and emphasize their constitutional right to competent and independent counsel during the trial. They argue that the actions of their previous counsels constituted such wanton, palpable, and gross negligence that resulted to the deprivation of their right to be heard and their right to a competent counsel.[38]

Time and again, jurisprudence has emphasized the general rule that a client is bound by the acts, even mistakes of his counsel in the realm of procedural technique. The exception to this rule is when the negligence of the counsel is so gross, reckless, and inexcusable that the client is deprived of their day in court.[39]

As correctly found by the CA, and as extensively discussed in the RTC Decision, the RTC was mindful of accused-appellants' right to due process and right to counsel. This Court takes note of the following excerpt from the RTC Decision, as echoed by the CA Decision:
To put the history of these cases in proper perspective, a narration of the factual events in respect of the hearings of these cases is imperative.

. . . .

When these cases were called on May 6, 2015, accused Carme Ann Alvarez was represented by Atty. Jonathan Hilarion Maagad of the Public Attorney's Office. Accused Scully, however, appeared without counsel, and he said that he had already hired lawyers but they were unable to appear on that day. The cases[,] therefore[,] were set for his arraignment on June 2, 2015.

Accused Alvarez was already arraigned prior to the fire on January 30, 2015 that burned the Hall of Justice of xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx including the records of the cases.

When these cases were called on June 2, 2015 for his arraignment, Scully said to the court that he had engaged the services of Attys. Boycillo and Gumahad[, but] said counsels[,] however[,] were not present in court. This court[,] thus[,] reset the arraignment on June 16, 2015, and informed Scully that if on said date he would still have no counsel, the court would appoint a counsel for him.

On June 16, 2015, Scully was arraigned in these six (6) cases with the assistance of Atty. Alejandro Jose C. Pallugna, and he pleaded not guilty to all of them. On said date[,] accused Alvarez was re-arraigned with the assistance of Atty. Maagad, and she pleaded not guilty to all the cases.

On June 24, 2015, Atty. Alejandrino Jose C. Pallugna, as counsel for Scully[,] filed [an] Urgent Motion to Declare the [a]ccused Peter Scully Not the Most Guilty of the Offenses Charged, and Qualified to be Discharged as a State Witness. The prosecution vehemently objected to the foregoing motion and Atty. Maagad, counsel for Alvarez, also opposed the motion. . . . This court denied Scully's motion in an [O]rder dated August 17, 2015[.]

. . . .

When the cases were called for [Pre-Trial Conference] on August 18, 2015, Atty. Pallugna as counsel for Scully, and Atty. Maagad as counsel for Alvarez manifested in open court that their clients wanted that the Judicial Affidavit Rule be applied in these cases. Because of these manifestations, the court reset the pre-trial conference and ordered the parties to submit the affidavits of the accused and their witnesses within the prescribed period. The pre-trial conference was [reset] on September 24, 2015.

On September 23, 2015, Atty. Pallugna filed [an] Urgent Motion for Production and Examination of Object Evidence from the Prosecution with Prayer for Extension of Time to File Judicial Affidavits of Defense Witnesses. Atty. Maagad also filed [a] Motion for [E]xtension to [F]ile [J]udicial [A]ffidavits of Alvarez. Considering these motions, the court [reset] the pre-trial conference on November 24, 2015.

When these cases were called on November 24, 2015, Atty. Maagad withdrew his appearance as counsel for Alvarez. Afterwards, Atty. Pallugna entered his appearance as counsel for Alvarez. Atty. Pallugna was now counsel for Scully and Alvarez. Atty. Pallugna then moved that the pre-trial conference be postponed on the ground that he [still had] to prepare the affidavits of Alvarez and her witnesses. The prosecution objected saying that the accused were engaging in dilatory tactics. This court, however, to avoid any charge of miscarriage of justice, granted the motion, and reset the pre-trial conference on December 8, 2015.

When these cases were called on December 8, 2015, this court received from Atty. Pallugna his motion to postpone the hearing moments before the cases were called. The ground was that Atty. Pallugna had a hearing in Branch 21, Santiago City, Isabela. The prosecution opposed the motion. The court issued an [O]rder dated December 8, 2015 requiring Atty. Pallugna to explain in writing why he should not be cited for contempt of court for his failure to appear at the pre-trial conference. The pre-trial conference was reset on December 16, 2015 and the two accused were ordered to hire another lawyer, and they were informed that the pre-trial would proceed with or without their counsels.

When these cases were called on December 16, 2015, Atty. Pallugna was present, but accused Scully and Alvarez were not present. Atty. Pallugna said that Scully was sick. With respect to Alvarez, there was no information why she was not present Atty. Pallugna moved that the pre-trial conference be postponed on the ground that accused Scully was sick. The public prosecutors objected because it was their impression that [the] accused were delaying the cases. To obviate any accusation that the accused were denied due process, the court granted the motion, but it required Scully to submit to the court a medical certificate showing that he was so sick that he could not appear at the hearing. . . . The pre-trial was then set on March 2, 2016.

. . . .

Before March 2, 2016, specifically on February 23, 2016, instead of filing the affidavits, Atty. Pallugna filed [a] Motion to Withdraw as Counsel for [defendant Peter Gerard Scully praying that he be allowed to withdraw as counsel for Scully and Alvarez on the ground of irreconcilable differences. When these case were called on March 2, 2016, this court asked Scully and Alvarez regarding the withdrawal of Atty. Pallugna, and they confirmed the same and they expressed their conformity. The prosecution manifested that the withdrawal of the counsel would delay the cases. This court, to avoid any complaint of denial of due process, allowed the two accused to hire another lawyer, and thus postponed the hearing. The court in its [O]rder issued on March 2, 2016 [and] granted Atty. Pallugna's motion to withdraw but warned the accused that if the new counsel of the accused would not be present at the hearing on May 11, 2016, the court would proceed with the pre-trial conference.

Before May 11, 2016, however, specifically on May 4, 2016, Atty. Pallugna, to the amazement of the court, filed [an] [E]ntry of Appearance as Collaborating Counsels for Accused Peter Gerald Scully and Carme Ann Alvarez. When these cases were called on May 11, 2016, Attys. Enrique Malicay and Ernesto Bongado, Jr. entered their appearances as counsels for Scully and Alvarez. On the other hand, Atty. Jerome Jarales entered his appearance as collaborating counsel for Alvarez. [Understandably], the court was confused. When Atty. Pallugna entered or re-entered his appearance as collaborating counsel for the two accused, the accused had no counsel yet, so with whom was Atty. Pallugna collaborating[.]

On June 10, 2016, Atty. Malicay filed [a] Motion to Withdraw praying that he be allowed to withdraw his appearance as counsel of Scully.

When these cases were called for pre-trial conference on June 27, 2016, accused Scully and Alvarez were present. Attys. Gumahad, Bongado, and Phillip Nelson Carpio entered their appearances as counsel for Scully and Alvarez. Accused [A]lvarez stated [in] open court that her counsels were the same as the counsels of Scully. Alvarez said that Atty. Jarales was not her counsel. She[,] therefore[,] was deemed to have terminated the services of Atty. Jarales. The pre-trial conference] was held. The [O]rder issued after the conference stated, among others, that the prosecution would call to the witness chair the two minor offended parties, namely, [BBB270174] and [AAA270174]. Also the prosecution and the defense agreed, upon the insistence of the new counsels of the accused, that the rule on judicial affidavit would no longer govern the trial of the cases. . . . The court then set the cases for trial for the reception of the prosecution's evidence. Several dates were agreed upon.

When these cases were called for the reception of its evidence on September 20, 2016, the prosecution called to the witness stand Rosevic Alisbo. When the direct examination was finished, it was already 12:00 o'clock noon[sic]. The defense moved that the trial be reset for the cross-examination of the witness because the cross would be long. The court reset the trial.

On October 2, 2016, Atty. Ernesto N. Bongado, Jr. filed [a] Motion to Withdraw Appearance as Counsel praying that he be relieved as one of the counsels for Scully and Alvarez.

When these cases were called on November 22, 2016, for the cross examination of prosecution witness Alisbo, another counsel, Atty. Bember Apepe entered his appearance as collaborating counsel of the two accused. The counsels of the two accused agreed that Atty. Apepe would be the lead counsel in the trial of these cases. The defense cross examined Alisbo, and after the examination, the counsels agreed to call these cases again on December 13, 2016, as previously agreed upon, for the continuation of prosecution's evidence.

When these cases were called on December 13, 2016, the prosecution . . . was ready to call to the witness chair one of the two minor offended parties, namely, [AAA270174]. The defense counsels were agitated and objected to the presentation of [AAA270174] because they claimed that the agreement was that the prosecution would call to the witness chair the other minor offended party, namely, [BBB270174]. The defense counsels argued that they were prepared for trial in respect of [BBB270174] but not [AAA270174]. If [AAA270174] would be allowed to testify, the defense counsels said that it would be a case of ""ambush"" as there were not prepared for trial with respect of [AAA270174]. . . . To [obviate] any complaint of railroading the trial and violation of due process, the court did not proceed with the trial, but the court set the cases for trial the following day, i. e., on October 4, 2016.

At today's trial, the minor offended party, [AAA270174], testified on direct examination. Accused Alvarez and Scully were present. The three counsels mentioned above, namely, Attys. Apepe, Gumahad, and Carpio, were present. The private offended party finished her direct testimony. The accused is warned that the trial scheduled after this date will proceed with or without their counsel. Place on record that the counsels of the accused stated that the termination of their services includes all cases involving the two accused. . . . However, as stated above, the court informed the counsels that they would continue as counsels for Scully and Alvarez until these two accused could hire another lawyer.

WHEREFORE, let these . . . cases be set for the cross-examination by the defense of witness, [AAA270174], on January 16, 2017 at 8:30 in the morning. The prosecution is ordered to present its other witnesses on January 17, 18, and 19, 2017 at 8:30 in the morning. Accused Scully and Alvarez are ordered to hire the services of another lawyer prior to the said dates. The accused and Attys. Apepe, Gumahad, and Carpio are informed in open court that the TSN of the direct testimony of [AAA270174] will be available before January 16, 2017, and they are ordered to obtain their copies of the TSN before said date so that they cannot use as an excuse for the postponement of the cross-examination the non-availability of the TSN. The parties are warned that the court will not anymore allow the postponement of the trial.

The dates agreed upon by the prosecution and the defense stated in the pre-trial order of this Court dated June 27, 2016 for the reception of prosecution's evidence shall remain as additional dates. Attys. Apepe, Gumahad, and Carpio are ordered to represent Scully and Alvarez and said lawyers are hereby reminded of their duties as lawyers. The accused are hereby informed that the trial of these six cases will proceed on January 16, 17, 18, and 19, 2017 even if they will not or cannot hire new lawyer or lawyers.

. . . .

[T]he other minor offended party, [BBB270174], was scheduled to testify on January 31, 2017. This date was agreed upon during the pre-trial conference on June 27, 2016, and was stated in the pre-trial order also dated June 27, 2016. The prosecution called to the witness stand [BBB270174]. After her direct examination, the court asked the two accused whether they want to cross-examine the witness. The[y] said that they wanted to cross-examine the witness, but they had no counsel. To give the accused time to look for lawyer so they could cross-examine the minor, this court scheduled the trial for the cross-examination of the minor on February 14, 2017[.]

. . . .

[W]hen these cases were called on February 14, 2017 for the cross-examination of [BBB270174] by the accused, Atty. Pallugna . . . entered his appearance as counsel of the two accused. The record shows that this is the third time that he entered and re-entered his appearance as counsel of the accused. Instead of conducting cross-examination of the minor witness, Atty. Pallugna orally moved to inhibit the presiding judge. The cross-examination was necessarily postponed. The motion has the effect of delaying the proceeding in these cases. The strategy to delay is not unobvious.

. . . .

Because the Motion for Reconsideration of the [O]rder denying the [M]otion for [I]nhibition was denied, the defense filed [a] Petition for Certiorari with the Court of Appeals on March 27, 2017. . . . and since there was no restraining order issued by the appellate court ten days after the Petition for Certiorari was filed, this court continued in the trial of these cases. These cases were then called for trial on April 18, 2017 for the purpose of the cross-examination of the minor offended party, [BBB270174], Atty. Pallugna filed motion for the postponement of the trial scheduled on the said date. This court in an order issued on the same day denied the motion and deemed the defense to have waived its right to cross-examine the minor offended party.

The prosecution then continued presenting its witnesses. It called to the witness chair PO1 Madona Dayo on May 23, 2017; PO1 Madona Lutian Dayo on May 30, 2017; Dr. Fatmah B. Mangondato, and SPO2 Elaine Sagario on June 20, 2017; and Rosemarie Gomato on June 27, 2017. Atty. Pallugna was present as counsel of Scully and Alvarez during these trials.

. . . .

This court then set these cases for the reception of the evidence for the defense on August 22, and 29, 2017 in an order dated June 27, 2017. Atty. Pallugna filed urgent motion for postponement of the trial on August 22, 2017, which was denied. Considering however that these cases were also scheduled for the reception of defense evidence on August 29, 2017 and September 5, 2017, this court scheduled these cases for trial on said dates with a warning that if Atty. Pallugna would be absent on said dates, this court would appoint a lawyer from the Public Attorney's Office to represent Scully and Alvarez. When these cases were called on August 29, 2017, Atty. Pallugna appeared in court but moved for the postponement of the trial on the ground that he was not prepared. This court denied the motion in the [O]rder dated August 29, 2017. When these cases were called on September 5, 2017, Atty. Pallugna was present, but he moved for the postponement of the trial on the ground stated in open court. The motion was denied in an [O]rder dated September 5, 2017. In the said [O]rder of September 5, 2017, the defense was deemed to have waived its right to adduce evidence, and it was ordered to submit its offer of exhibits within ten days. The records do not show that the defense filed its offer of exhibits.[40] (Emphasis supplied)
As can be inferred from the abovequoted portion of the RTC Decision, the defense caused several delays of the case for various reasons. In this case, the RTC need not have allowed the case to continually drag upon the defense's requests. As can be gleaned from the records, to avoid any charge of miscarriage of justice and denial of due process, the RTC liberally allowed accused-appellants and their counsels numerous postponements of the trial with sufficient appraisal of the schedule of hearing dates for their presentation of evidence. However, the hearings were repeatedly postponed at their instance. In view of the foregoing, the accused-appellants are deemed to have waived their right to present evidence, and the facts of this case do not constitute a deprivation of accused-appellant's constitutional rights.","ACCORDINGLY, the Appeal is DENIED. The March 30, 2022 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 02140-MIN is AFFIRMED. Accused-appellants Peter Gerald Scully a.k.a. ""Peter Russell"" a.k.a. ""Peter Riddel"" and Carme Ann Alvarez a.k.a. ""Honey Sweet"" a.k.a. ""Sweet Sweet"" are GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of qualified trafficking in persons under Section 4(a), in relation to Section 6(a), and penalized under Section 10(c) of Republic Act No. 9208, as amended by Republic Act No. 10364, and are SENTENCED to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and to each PAY a fine of PHP 5,000,000.00. Further, accused-appellants are ORDERED to PAY, jointly and severally, each of the minor victims, AAA270174 and BBB270174, PHP 500,000.00 as moral damages, and PHP 100,000.00 as exemplary damages, subject to a legal interest of 6% per annum from finality of this Decision until full payment."
