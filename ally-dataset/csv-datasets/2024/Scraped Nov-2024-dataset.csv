"G.R. No. 251518, November 27, 2024","DEL MONTE LAND TRANSPORT BUS COMPANY, DON L. MORALES, AND EILEEN FLORES, PETITIONERS, VS. ROMEO M. JARANILLA, MARLON H. GUANTERO, AND JESUS B. DOMANAIS, RESPONDENTS.","Respondents filed consolidated complaints for illegal dismissal, full backwages, and reinstatement against petitioners. On November 25, 2013, Labor Arbiter Benedict G. Kato issued a Decision granting the complaints and ruled respondents were illegally dismissed. Petitioners appealed to the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC), which on April 23, 2014, reversed the Labor Arbiter’s Decision and dismissed the complaints. Respondents moved for reconsideration; on October 31, 2014, the NLRC reinstated the Labor Arbiter’s Decision. Petitioners filed a Petition for Certiorari with the Court of Appeals (CA) under CA-G.R. SP No. 138339. Pending resolution, respondents secured a Writ of Execution; petitioners partially paid judgment awards. On June 30, 2015, the CA granted petitioners’ Petition for Certiorari, annulled the NLRC’s October 31, 2014 Resolution, and reinstated the NLRC’s April 23, 2014 Decision that respondents were legally dismissed. Respondents filed a Motion for Issuance of Alias Writ of Execution for reinstatement wages covering periods before and after the NLRC’s reversal and reinstatement of the Labor Arbiter ruling. Labor Arbiter Irene Castro De Quiroz granted the motion on August 30, 2016, ordering reinstatement wages from November 25, 2013 to April 23, 2014, and from October 31, 2014 to June 30, 2015. Petitioners appealed to the NLRC, which on January 30, 2017, dismissed the appeal, affirming respondents’ entitlement to reinstatement wages for the specified periods. Petitioners’ Motion for Reconsideration was denied. Petitioners filed a Petition for Certiorari with the CA, which on March 14, 2019, dismissed the petition and affirmed the NLRC decision.","The Supreme Court ruled that respondents are entitled to reinstatement wages for the entire period from November 25, 2013 (Labor Arbiter Decision) until June 30, 2015 (final reversal by the Court of Appeals). The Court modified the Labor Arbiter Order, NLRC, and CA rulings to include the period from April 23, 2014 to October 31, 2014 (when the NLRC had initially reversed the Labor Arbiter Decision but later reinstated it on reconsideration). The Court emphasized that the reinstatement aspect of the Labor Arbiter’s Decision is immediately executory pending appeal, as supported by Article 229 of the Labor Code and relevant jurisprudence."," The instant petition is bereft of any merit.

In the instant petition, petitioners averred that the LA erred in granting the Motion for Issuance of Alias Writ of Execution considering that at the time of the filing thereof, respondents are no longer entitled to their accrued wages on account of the finality of the CA Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 138339, which declared respondents as legally dismissed.[32]

Petitioners likewise averred that they are entitled to restitution. They explained that while they admit that the LA's November 25, 2013 Decision is immediately executory, hence, respondents have the right to reinstatement, either actual or in payroll, such right ceased to have any legal effect when the NLRC reversed the LA Decision on April 23, 2014 They also insisted that the reinstatement by the NLRC of the LA Decision on reconsideration is no longer immediately executory. Accordingly, respondents are not entitled to reinstatement from October 31, 2014, when the NLRC reinstated the November 25, 2013 Decision of the LA until the same was reversed by the CA on June 30, 2015.[33]

The Court is not persuaded. ","ACCORDINGLY, in view of the foregoing premises, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED. The Court of Appeals Decision dated March 14, 2019, in CA-G.R. SP No. 151070 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. The Labor Arbiter's Order dated August 30, 2016 is MODIFIED in that respondents Romeo M. Jaranilla, Marlon H. Guantero, and Jesus B. Domanais are entitled to reinstatement wages from November 25, 2013 to June 30, 2015. Let an Alias Writ of Execution be ISSUED to such effect. "

OLASO III, LEA LIM-TIDMA, NERISSA S. OREJO, ZENAIDA CHIQUILLO, IVY OROLFO, RONNIE GOMEZ, AND GINA NUARIN, RESPONDENTS.","Spouses Kaw are the owners of a parcel of land located in Cagmanaba, Oas, Albay, with an area of 3,040 square meters designated as Lot F in Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-158628. The lot is covered by Tax Declaration No. 02-12-012-00000 with an assessed value of PHP 24,830.00. Spouses Kaw and Ivy Orolfo were dentists and colleagues. Orolfo introduced Spouses Kaw to the other respondents, who were interested in buying a portion of Lot F. In February 2014, Spouses Kaw, Orolfo, and respondents visited Lot F. Spouses Kaw informed respondents they were selling only the 2,000 square meter undetermined portion of Lot F (the subject property) for PHP 1,200,000.00. Respondents offered to purchase the subject property in two equal portions of 1,000 square meters at PHP 600,000.00 each, to be paid in two parts, with PHP 300,000.00 advance payment for each part and the balance payable in six months.

On March 10, 2014, the first Deed of Conditional Sale was executed between Spouses Kaw and Nodalo, Olaso III, Lim-Tidma, and Orejo, covering 1,000 square meters of the subject property for PHP 600,000.00. On March 29, 2014, a second Deed of Conditional Sale, with similar provisions, was executed between Spouses Kaw and Chiquillo, Orolfo, Gomez, and Nuarin. Spouses Kaw received PHP 265,000.00, while the remainder of PHP 35,000.00 was paid to Orolfo, who stated she acted as an agent and the PHP 35,000.00 was her commission.

The Deeds of Conditional Sale contained uniform provisions, including paragraph A, which allowed Spouses Kaw to unilaterally rescind the contracts if respondents violated any terms, and paragraph D, which prohibited respondents from assigning, transferring, conveying, or hypothecating their rights without prior written consent from Spouses Kaw.

In April 2014, Spouses Kaw visited the property and found cottages surrounded by a fence, concrete comfort room and irrigation pump, several cottage-like houses, a ""DIWATA IMACOTO BEACH RESORT"" signboard, and a destroyed padlock on Spouses Kaw's cottage. Spouses Kaw confronted Orolfo, who explained the fence was for protection.

Spouses Kaw filed a Complaint for Rescission of Contract with Prayer for Preliminary Injunction on September 29, 2015, docketed as Civil Case No. 2833 (Rescission Case). They alleged respondents violated the Deeds of Conditional Sale by converting the property into a beach resort and renting out cottages without prior written consent and by constructing permanent improvements, contrary to verbal agreements limiting improvements to temporary light materials.

Respondents denied violating the agreements and argued that operating a beach resort was not an assignment or transfer of rights and that there were no verbal agreements limiting improvements. They claimed Spouses Kaw were aware the property was for a beach resort business. Respondents counterclaimed for Spouses Kaw to accept payment of the balance price, execute deeds of absolute sale, surrender documents for title transfer, and pay moral damages and costs.

The Regional Trial Court (RTC) dismissed Spouses Kaw’s Complaint for Rescission for lack of merit. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the RTC decision with modification on the award of moral damages. Spouses Kaw filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari before the Supreme Court.","The Supreme Court denied the Petition for Review on Certiorari for lack of merit. The Court held that Spouses Kaw failed to establish valid grounds for rescission of the Deeds of Conditional Sale. The Court found that the Deeds of Conditional Sale were contracts to sell, not conditional sales, and rescission is only available for substantial and fundamental breaches, which Spouses Kaw failed to prove.","The Court ruled that the Complaint for Rescission filed by Spouses Kaw was properly dismissed for lack of merit. The Deeds of Conditional Sale are contracts to sell, and respondents did not commit fundamental breaches warranting rescission. The Parol Evidence Rule prevents reliance on alleged verbal agreements to alter written contracts.","WHEREFORE, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED. The Decision dated July 14,2021, and Resolution dated August 8, 2022, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 113795 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION in that:

"G.R. No. 219686, November 27, 2024","GIL APOLINARIO, PETITIONER,
VS.
HEIRS OF FRANCISCO DE LOS SANTOS, REPRESENTED BY EDWIN DELOS SANTOS, RESPONDENTS.","On July 4, 1998, at around 7:30 a.m., Rico Villahermosa, a 16-year-old minor and son of Teresita Villahermosa, was cutting down a banana plant on the side of Maharlika Highway under the instruction and supervision of Gil Apolinario, his school principal. The banana plant fell and struck Francisco De Los Santos, who was driving his motorcycle along the highway. Francisco fell from his motorcycle onto the cemented highway, suffered head injuries, and died on July 8, 1998, with the death certificate citing ""post-traumatic brain swelling"" and ""diffuse cerebral contusion"" as causes of death.

The heirs of Francisco filed a complaint for damages against Apolinario and Teresita, alleging negligence on Apolinario’s part for instructing Rico to cut the banana plant without taking necessary safety precautions. They claimed that the negligence of Rico and Apolinario was the proximate cause of Francisco’s injuries and death. The heirs sought damages for hospital and medical expenses, funeral expenses, loss of expected income as a member of the Sangguniang Bayan of Sta. Margarita, Samar, moral damages, exemplary damages, attorney's fees, and litigation expenses.

Elias Udjay testified that his son was near Apolinario and Rico during the incident. Edwin de los Santos, son of the deceased, testified about his father’s membership in the Sangguniang Bayan. Rico, who was a witness but not a defendant, testified he was 15 years old at the time.

Teresita prayed for dismissal of the complaint against her, stating that Rico acted under Apolinario’s supervision. Apolinario denied liability, asserting he was not present at the time of the incident, was supervising another activity 10 meters away, and that the incident occurred on a Saturday during a community activity. He argued that if liable, only the teacher-in-charge should be held responsible and that Teresita should be liable for sending Rico without informing the school.

The trial court held Apolinario liable for damages, awarding PHP 428,880.00 for loss of earning capacity based on judicial notice of Francisco’s monthly salary as a Sangguniang Bayan member. The Court of Appeals affirmed negligence but deleted exemplary damages and attorney’s fees. Apolinario’s motion for reconsideration was denied, prompting this petition.","The Supreme Court affirmed the findings of the RTC and CA that the Deed of Sale was tampered with and is therefore void, and that Aquilino Ramos had no title or interest in the subject property to transfer ownership. The Court upheld the denial of petitioners’ claim of ownership by prescription, noting their possession did not satisfy the requisites for extraordinary acquisitive prescription.

The Court noted procedural infirmities in the petitions, including lack of material dates and proof of service, and deficiencies in verification and certification of non-forum shopping. The Court also deleted the award of attorney’s fees based on prevailing jurisprudence, emphasizing that attorney’s fees are awarded only in specific instances under Article 2208 of the Civil Code.","The Court ruled that Apolinario is liable for damages due to negligence under quasi-delict for instructing and supervising the minor Rico who caused the injury and death of Francisco. Teresita is not liable as she was not a party and the child was under the school’s custody. The award for loss of earning capacity was deleted due to lack of evidence, replaced with temperate damages. Other damages were affirmed.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is PARTLY GRANTED. The May 28, 2014 Decision and the June 24, 2015 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA G.R. CV No. 03433 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION.

Petitioner Gil Apolinario is ordered to pay respondent heirs of Francisco de los Santos the following: (a) PHP 250,000.00 as temperate damages; (b) PHP 50,000.00 as civil indemnity; (c) PHP 50,000.00 as moral damages; and (d) PHP 5,000.00 as litigation expenses.

VS.
PROSALITA BAGARES AND DANTON BAGARES, REPRESENTED BY PROSERFINA GALARRITA, RESPONDENTS.","Respondents alleged that on July 24, 1995, they purchased a 3,000-square meter parcel of land owned by the late Basilia Galarrita-Naguita, situated in Lanao, Alubijid, Misamis Oriental, identified as Lot No. 12020. This property was a portion of the 7,687-square meter landholdings of Basilia. Basilia also sold portions of Lot No. 12020 to the Local Government of Alubijid and to Prosalita. Subsequently, Aquilino Ramos filed a free patent application over the entire Lot No. 12020 before the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR). Respondents opposed the application, alleging that Aquilino tampered with the Deed of Sale he submitted by changing the lot number from 12019 to 12020. The Provincial Environment and Natural Resources Office (PENRO) denied the free patent filed by Aquilino.

Marilou, Benjamin, Elyer, and Lydia were buyers of portions of Lot No. 12020 from Aquilino. The dispute was brought to barangay conciliation but failed to settle. Petitioners argued their predecessor-in-interest did not tamper with the deed and maintained that after Aquilino bought the property, he and they lived on it until portions were sold.

The Regional Trial Court (RTC) ruled in favor of respondents, finding convincing proof that the Deed of Sale was tampered with. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the RTC decision, giving weight to the DENR findings and Aquilino's admission during barangay conciliation that he tampered with the deed. The CA also rejected petitioners’ claim of ownership by prescription, ruling their adverse possession fell short of the requirements for extraordinary acquisitive prescription.

Petitioners filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari before the Supreme Court.","The Supreme Court affirmed the findings of the RTC and CA that the Deed of Sale was tampered with and is therefore void, and that Aquilino Ramos had no title or interest in the subject property to transfer ownership. The Court upheld the denial of petitioners’ claim of ownership by prescription, noting their possession did not satisfy the requisites for extraordinary acquisitive prescription.","The Court denied the consolidated Petitions for Review on Certiorari. It ruled that the Deed of Sale is void due to tampering, petitioners failed to prove ownership by prescription, and procedural defects in the petitions warranted dismissal.

"G.R. No. 261323, November 27, 2024","CAPTAIN RAMON R. VERGA, JR., PETITIONER,
VS.
HARBOR STAR SHIPPING SERVICES, INC., RESPONDENT.","Harbor Star Shipping Services, Inc. (Harbor Star) is a domestic corporation engaged primarily in harbor assistance, towing services, salvage, repairs, dry dock, and related services to sea-going vessels. Captain Ramon R. Verga, Jr. (Verga) was a shareholder of Davao Tugboat and Allied Services, Inc. (DATASI) and Davtug Multi-Purpose Cooperative (DAVTUG), both operating in the same business sector as Harbor Star.

Between November 2006 and May 2008, Harbor Star sought to collaborate with DATASI despite being competitors, proposing various business arrangements including merger, partnership, and joint ventures. In the second half of 2008, Harbor Star persuaded Verga and two others to sell their shares in DATASI, with the understanding that after final audit and receipt of more than 50% of the agreed valuation, they would execute documents transferring their shares to Harbor Star.

From September 2008 to July 2009, Harbor Star made installment payments totaling PHP 4,000,000.00 to Verga. In 2012, Harbor Star discovered that Verga had divested his DATASI shares after receiving payments, making transfer impossible. Harbor Star filed a complaint on April 12, 2012, seeking the return of the PHP 4,000,000.00 paid.

Verga denied the existence of an oral contract to sell his DATASI and DAVTUG shares to Harbor Star. He alleged that the payments were incentives for his resignation from DATASI and DAVTUG, intended as a marketing strategy for Harbor Star. Verga also argued that Harbor Star lacked board approval for the transaction, violating Section 42 of the Corporation Code.

The Regional Trial Court (RTC) ruled in favor of Harbor Star, finding the oral contract valid and ordering Verga to return the PHP 4,000,000.00. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the RTC decision but reduced the attorney’s fees awarded to Harbor Star.","The Supreme Court denied Verga’s petition for review on certiorari for lack of merit. The Court agreed with the CA that the parties entered into an oral contract for the sale of Verga’s DATASI shares, partially executed by Harbor Star’s payments. The Court found the contract was perfected by consent, and Verga’s divestment of his shares made performance impossible, justifying Harbor Star’s claim for return of payments.

The Court rejected Verga’s argument on lack of board approval under Section 42 of the Corporation Code, ruling that since Harbor Star and DATASI are competitors in the same business, only board approval was necessary, which was duly obtained.

The Court upheld the award of attorney’s fees to Harbor Star, citing Article 2208 of the Civil Code, as Harbor Star was forced to litigate due to Verga’s refusal to comply with valid claims.

The Court modified the award of legal interest on the returned amount, correcting the period and rate applied by the CA based on prevailing jurisprudence.","The Court ruled that an oral contract of sale was valid and partially executed between Harbor Star and Verga for Verga’s DATASI shares. Verga’s failure to transfer shares after divesting them constituted breach, requiring return of payments. Board approval requirements were satisfied. Attorney’s fees awarded were justified. Legal interest on the monetary award was corrected.","The petition filed by Captain Ramon R. Verga, Jr. is DENIED. The Decision dated October 28, 2021, and Resolution dated June 6, 2022, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 109255 are AFFIRMED with modification on the award of legal interest."

HEIRS OF MELANIA ROXAS, NAMELY: MANUEL A. ROXAS, MARIA ROSARIO ROXAS-URETA, ALEXANDER A. ROXAS, SALOME ROXAS-PANTALEON, PAUL GERARDO ROXAS, ELAINE ROXAS GAMBOA, MA. IMELDA ROXAS-CRUZ, AND DAVID ANTHONY ROXAS, RESPONDENTS.","Antonio Roxas and Melania Roxas are the parents of Ferdinand, Manuel A. Roxas, Maria Rosario Roxas-Ureta, Alexander A. Roxas, Salome Roxas-Pantaleon, Paul Gerardo Roxas, Elaine Roxas-Gamboa, Ma. Imelda Roxas-Cruz, David Anthony Roxas, Conrado A. Roxas, and Jesus A. Roxas.

In 1970, Melania’s cousin Felicisma Garcia, married to Alfonso Garcia, executed a Deed of Absolute Sale (DOAS) in favor of Ferdinand over a 500-square-meter parcel of land located at Loakan, Baguio City (the subject lot). Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-16657 was thereafter issued in Ferdinand’s name. Melania built a house on the subject lot which the family used as a vacation house and residence of some of their children.

From 1990 to 1995, Melania rented out a portion of the subject property to Alfredo Sison. In 1991, Paul started residing on the subject property together with his family.

Antonio died on April 1, 1995. Subsequently, Ferdinand died on September 18, 2004, while Melania died on January 1, 2011.

On November 11, 2014, Manuel, Maria, Alexander, Salome, Paul, Elaine, Imelda, and David (the Heirs of Melania) filed a Complaint for declaration of nullity of the DOAS and cancellation of TCT No. T-16657. They alleged that Melania purchased the subject lot but placed it in Ferdinand’s name to protect the interests of her children given the existence of Antonio’s illegitimate children. Ferdinand was 19 years old and still studying at the time of the sale. The house Melania built is declared in her name. The Heirs of Melania filed the complaint because the Heirs of Ferdinand sought to take over the subject property after Melania’s death.

The Heirs of Ferdinand countered that Ferdinand is the true owner of the subject lot. Antonio and Melania gave him the money to pay for the subject lot as they were overjoyed that he was about to graduate from college. Melania constructed the house with Ferdinand’s permission. Ferdinand allowed Melania to rent out the property and keep the proceeds. Ferdinand also allowed Paul to reside on the subject property on the condition he would vacate upon request. When Ferdinand asked Paul to leave, Melania pleaded to allow Paul to stay while she was alive. Ferdinand paid the real property tax for the subject lot.

The Heirs of Ferdinand averred that in 1988, Antonio and Melania transferred their assets to their family corporation, Mel-Rox Realty Inc. After Antonio’s death, Mel-Rox gave Antonio’s illegitimate children their share in his inheritance, annotated on titles of properties registered under Mel-Rox. Mel-Rox paid Antonio’s illegitimate children their claim on Antonio’s estate.

After Ferdinand died, the Heirs of Ferdinand met with some Heirs of Melania regarding the subject property as it was Ferdinand’s wish for them to take over and improve it. They wanted possession, but the Heirs of Melania said they could only do so after Melania’s death. Even after Melania’s death, Paul stayed on the property. Hence, they filed an ejectment case against him.

The Regional Trial Court (RTC) ruled in favor of the Heirs of Ferdinand, dismissing the complaint of the Heirs of Melania and ordering the payment of attorney’s fees.

The Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the RTC decision, ruling that Ferdinand was merely holding the subject lot in trust for Melania, cancelled TCT No. T-16657, and ordered issuance of a new title in Melania’s name as part of her estate.

The Heirs of Ferdinand filed a Motion for Reconsideration which was denied, prompting the present Petition for Review on Certiorari.","The Supreme Court granted the Petition. The Court held that under Article 1448 of the Civil Code, when the price of a sale is paid by one person but the title is conveyed to another, a trust is presumed in favor of the former. However, if the title is conveyed to a child of the one paying the price, a disputable presumption arises that there is a gift in favor of the child.

Since Ferdinand is the child of Melania, and Melania paid the purchase price, the presumption is that Melania intended to donate the subject lot to Ferdinand. This presumption was not successfully overturned by the Heirs of Melania.

The Court found that Melania’s acts of building a house on the lot, paying taxes, and allowing use by other siblings did not negate Ferdinand’s ownership.

The Court agreed with the RTC that the complaint of the Heirs of Melania should be dismissed. However, the Court deleted the award of attorney’s fees for lack of factual and legal bases.","The Court ruled that Ferdinand was the true owner of the subject lot, and the presumption of donation under Article 1448 stands. The Heirs of Melania failed to prove that Ferdinand held the lot in trust for Melania.","The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals Decision dated February 13, 2020, and reinstated the RTC Decision dated January 19, 2017, dismissing the complaint filed by the Heirs of Melania. The award of attorney’s fees was deleted."

VS.
PACIFIC HUB CORPORATION, RESPONDENT.","From taxable years 2005 to 2006, Pacific Hub Corporation (Pacific Hub) filed its tax returns for withholding tax on compensation, expanded withholding tax, and value-added tax. However, it did not remit the full amounts declared to the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR). The total taxes declared amounted to PHP 30,985,617.52, but only PHP 15,505,386.41 was remitted, leaving a difference of PHP 15,480,231.11.

In 2008, Pacific Hub sent a letter to the BIR expressing willingness to pay the unremitted taxes for 2005 and 2006 but requested abatement of penalties, surcharges, and interests due to financial losses. Subsequently, in 2010, Pacific Hub filed an Application for Abatement or Cancellation of Tax, Penalties, and/or Interest and paid the basic deficiency tax of PHP 15,480,231.11.

Pacific Hub received a Notice of Denial dated January 10, 2014, rejecting its application for abatement. It also received a Warrant of Distraint and/or Levy dated September 12, 2014, enforcing collection of increments related to its deficiency withholding tax in the amount of PHP 13,792,867.56.

Pacific Hub filed a Petition for Review before the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) seeking to annul and set aside the Notice of Denial and the Warrant of Distraint and/or Levy, arguing these were irregularly issued and violated its right to due process.

The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) contended that the CTA lacked jurisdiction because there was no final decision on a disputed assessment and that the power to grant or deny abatement is discretionary and beyond the CTA’s jurisdiction. The CIR also argued that the exercise of this power was not attended by grave abuse of discretion.

The CTA Third Division rendered a Decision annulling both the Notice of Denial and the Warrant of Distraint and/or Levy, holding it had jurisdiction under its ""other matters"" jurisdiction. The CTA found the Warrant void for lack of prior assessment and the Notice of Denial void for failure to state reasons, violating Revenue Regulations No. 13-2001. The CTA clarified that the cancellation of the Notice of Denial does not entitle Pacific Hub to abatement, which remains at the CIR’s discretion.

The CIR’s motion for reconsideration was denied. The CIR then filed a Petition for Review before the CTA En Banc.

The CTA En Banc affirmed the Third Division’s rulings, holding that the CTA has jurisdiction to review the CIR’s denial of abatement applications when attended by grave abuse of discretion. The Notice of Denial was void for failure to comply with regulatory requirements, and the Warrant was void for lack of prior assessment, violating due process.

The CIR sought reconsideration before the CTA En Banc, which was denied.","The Supreme Court denied the CIR’s petition for certiorari, ruling that the CTA correctly assumed jurisdiction over the case under its ""other matters"" jurisdiction as provided by Section 7(a)(1) of Republic Act No. 1125, as amended by RA 9282.

The Court held that while the power to abate or cancel tax liabilities is discretionary under Section 204(B) of the Tax Code, the exercise of such power is reviewable by the CTA when attended by grave abuse of discretion.

The Court found that the CIR’s denial of Pacific Hub’s application was arbitrary and without due process, as it failed to state reasons as required by Revenue Regulations No. 13-2001.

The Court also ruled that the Warrant of Distraint and/or Levy was invalidly issued without a prior final assessment, violating Pacific Hub’s right to due process.

The Court emphasized that the cancellation of the Notice of Denial and Warrant does not automatically grant Pacific Hub’s application for abatement, which remains within the CIR’s discretion.","The Court affirmed the CTA En Banc Decision and Resolution, holding that:

    The CTA has jurisdiction to review the CIR’s denial of applications for abatement or cancellation of taxes, penalties, and interests under its ""other matters"" jurisdiction.

    The CIR’s denial of Pacific Hub’s application was issued with grave abuse of discretion for failure to comply with regulatory requirements.

    The Warrant of Distraint and/or Levy was void for being issued without a prior final assessment.

    The CIR’s exercise of discretion is subject to judicial review when there is grave abuse of discretion.","The Supreme Court DENIED the Petition for Review on Certiorari filed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. The Decision dated August 23, 2022, and Resolution dated February 23, 2023, of the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc in CTA EB No. 1837 are AFFIRMED."

PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","Petitioner and CCC have been common-law partners since 2003 and have a child, AAA. In 2010, petitioner and AAA followed CCC to Benguet, where they agreed on AAA’s custody. Petitioner often caused trouble in CCC’s boarding house, forcibly opening doors and uttering abusive words. In 2012, petitioner went to CCC’s boarding house to ask for money and to reconcile, which CCC refused. AAA disclosed to CCC that petitioner sexually abused her starting when she was seven years old. AAA narrated that petitioner, when drunk, made her hold his penis and touch her vagina. Petitioner also slapped AAA when she did not reveal CCC’s whereabouts. A physical examination on AAA showed swelling on her right cheek, possibly caused by trauma.

Petitioner was charged with psychological violence under Section 5(i) of Republic Act No. 9262 against CCC, and with Acts of Lasciviousness under Article 336 of the Revised Penal Code in relation to Section 5(b) of Republic Act No. 7610 against AAA.

The Regional Trial Court (RTC) found petitioner guilty of the charges. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the conviction with modification as to the penalty. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court.","The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction of petitioner for psychological violence under Section 5(i) of Republic Act No. 9262 committed against CCC, and for Acts of Lasciviousness under Article 336 of the Revised Penal Code in relation to Section 5(b) of Republic Act No. 7610 committed against AAA. The Court held that the prosecution sufficiently established the elements of psychological violence and lascivious acts. The Court noted that the determination of mental anguish and suffering is a question of fact, which the Court of Appeals properly resolved. The Court also found that AAA was seven years old at the time of the sexual abuse, satisfying the age requirement under the law.

The Court imposed an indeterminate penalty for psychological violence and a penalty of 12 years and one day to 14 years imprisonment for Acts of Lasciviousness. The Court also imposed fines and awarded civil, moral, and exemplary damages to the victim.",The Court ruled that petitioner is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of psychological violence against CCC and Acts of Lasciviousness against AAA. The factual findings of the lower courts were affirmed. The Court emphasized that the acts committed by petitioner caused mental and emotional anguish to CCC and sexual abuse to AAA.,"The Supreme Court DENIED the petition and AFFIRMED the Decision dated March 3, 2020, and the Resolution dated January 8, 2021, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

MORO ISLAMIC LIBERATION FRONT, RESPONDENTS.","The people of the Province of Sulu voted against ratifying the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) in the plebiscite. The Supreme Court ruled that the creation of an autonomous region must be based on the independent will of the people in each province or city, respecting their choice rather than imposing a collective decision. Treating the entire autonomous region as one geographic area overrides the right of each province and city for self-determination and undermines their distinct historical, cultural, and political characteristics.

The Court denied motions for partial reconsideration seeking to reverse the September 9, 2024 Decision that declared the inclusion of the Province of Sulu in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) as unconstitutional, while upholding the validity of the remaining provisions of the Bangsamoro Organic Law.

Petitioners and intervenors argued that excluding Sulu undermines the Bangsamoro identity and autonomy. Respondents contended that treating the former ARMM provinces and cities as one geographic area is valid under the Constitution and ARMM organic law.

The Court emphasized that the Constitution allows provinces, cities, and geographic areas to decide whether to be included in the autonomous region, and the ""No"" vote of Sulu was a clear expression of its rejection of inclusion in BARMM.

The Court applied the doctrine of operative fact, recognizing that acts performed in good faith under the assumption that Sulu was part of BARMM shall not be summarily nullified. It acknowledged the significant effects of Sulu's inclusion in BARMM prior to the ruling.

The Court reaffirmed respect for the democratic will of the people of Sulu and the importance of honoring their self-determination expressed through the plebiscite.","The Supreme Court denied the Motions for Partial Reconsideration with finality. It upheld the ruling that the inclusion of the Province of Sulu in BARMM is unconstitutional due to the failure to respect the independent will of its people as expressed in the plebiscite.

The Court clarified that the term ""geographic areas"" in the Constitution refers to smaller units than provinces or cities and does not justify treating the entire ARMM as a single voting unit.",The Court ruled that the inclusion of the Province of Sulu in BARMM without its consent violates the Constitution. The plebiscite results must be respected as an expression of the people's right to self-determination. The doctrine of operative fact applies to preserve acts done in good faith during the period of Sulu's inclusion in BARMM.,"The Court resolved the Motions for Partial Reconsideration seeking to reverse and set aside the September 9, 2024 Decision insofar as it voids the inclusion of the Province of Sulu in BARMM. The Motions are DENIED with finality."

VS.
FORT 1 GLOBAL CITY CENTER, INC., RESPONDENT.","For the taxable year 2009, the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) issued a Preliminary Assessment Notice (PAN) dated January 24, 2012, finding Fort 1 Global City Center, Inc. (FGCCI) liable for deficiency income tax, value-added tax (VAT), withholding tax (WT), and documentary stamp tax (DST). FGCCI contested these findings, but the BIR issued a Final Assessment Notice (FAN) as a response. After FGCCI filed its protest to the FAN, the BIR issued a Final Decision on Disputed Assessment (FDDA) dated October 13, 2016, informing FGCCI that it is liable to pay deficiency taxes amounting to PHP 1,598,860,663.45 for the taxable year 2009.

For the taxable year 2012, the BIR issued a PAN dated February 3, 2016, and a FAN dated March 15, 2016, for deficiency income tax and VAT totaling PHP 134,099,378.74. FGCCI filed its protest to the FAN on April 1, 2016, but the BIR did not act on the protest.

FGCCI filed two separate Petitions for Review on Certiorari before the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) to question (a) the CIR's inaction on its protest for 2012 and (b) the FDDA for 2009. The two cases were consolidated.

FGCCI argued that the assessments were invalid because the notices were served to the wrong address. Specifically, the Letter of Authority (LOA), PAN, FAN, and FDDA for 2009 were delivered to 30th Street, Bonifacio Blvd., Global City, Taguig, while the LOA, PAN, and FAN for 2012 were served at 32nd Street, corner Boni Avenue. FGCCI’s principal address in its 2016 General Information Sheet (GIS) was Unit 2C-B, FPS Building, 1st Avenue, corner 30th Street, Global City, Taguig. FGCCI claimed that the BIR notices were not served on persons authorized by FGCCI and that an uninterested third person received the notices.

The CIR alleged that the LOA, PAN, and FAN for both taxable years were properly served to FGCCI, as evidenced by the ""stamped received"" annotation on BIR's copies. Even assuming the documents were served to the wrong address or persons, FGCCI was deemed to have received them because it responded and protested the assessments.

The CTA Division ruled in favor of FGCCI, holding that under Revenue Regulation (RR) No. 12-99, the BIR must send notices by registered mail or personal service to the taxpayer or authorized representatives, indicating their name, signature, designation, authority, and date of receipt. The CTA found that the BIR failed to prove that the addresses to which the notices were sent were FGCCI’s registered or known addresses, and the notices did not indicate the designation or authority of the persons who received them. The CTA emphasized that FGCCI’s filing of protest does not cure the violation of due process.

The CTA Division denied the BIR’s Motion for Reconsideration and cancelled the PAN and FAN for taxable years 2009 and 2012, including the FDDA for 2009.

On appeal, the CTA En Banc discussed that the GIS is not proper evidence of the taxpayer’s registered address; the BIR Certificate of Registration is the proper basis. The CTA En Banc held that FGCCI’s right to due process was not violated because FGCCI protested the assessments and did not present evidence of the uninterested third person who allegedly received the notices.

However, the CTA En Banc did not garner the required votes to reverse the CTA Division decision, thus affirming it by operation of law.

The CIR filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari with the Supreme Court, which was filed one day late. The CIR filed a Motion for Extension of Time, which was granted, but the petition was filed beyond the extended deadline. The CIR filed a Motion to Admit the petition out of time, citing heavy workload.

FGCCI opposed the Motion to Admit, arguing that heavy workload is not sufficient justification.","The Supreme Court took cognizance of the case despite the late filing, emphasizing that procedural rules should not obstruct justice. However, the Court agreed with the CTA Division that the tax assessments for taxable years 2009 and 2012 must be cancelled due to the BIR’s failure to comply with proper service rules under Section 228 of the National Internal Revenue Code and relevant Revenue Regulations.

The Court ruled that FGCCI’s filing of protests does not bar it from raising due process issues regarding improper service. The BIR’s failure to indicate the authority or designation of persons receiving the notices violated due process, rendering the assessments void.

The Court noted that the CIR’s claim that FGCCI received the notices through an uninterested third person was unsubstantiated.

The Court dissented in part, agreeing that the 2012 assessment is void but holding that the 2009 assessment is valid due to FGCCI’s actual receipt and protest of the notices.","The Supreme Court affirmed the cancellation of the deficiency tax assessments for taxable years 2009 and 2012 due to improper service violating due process. The Court held that the BIR must strictly comply with service requirements, and failure to do so invalidates the assessment.","The Supreme Court DENIED the Petition for Review on Certiorari filed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. The Decision dated November 10, 2021, and Resolution dated October 7, 2022, of the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc in CTA EB No. 2233 are AFFIRMED."

""SWEET SWEET"", ACCUSED-APPELLANTS.","Scully and Alvarez were charged with qualified trafficking of persons and five counts of rape by sexual assault. The cases were filed in 2014, but the Hall of Justice where the case was filed was destroyed by fire, necessitating the reconstitution of records. The accused admitted being the persons named in the Information but denied their aliases and the minority of the victims.

On September 19, 2014, Alvarez approached two minor girls, AAA270174 (12 years old) and BBB270174 (9 years old), at a mall and coaxed them to come with her under the pretext of providing for their needs. Alvarez and the girls took a taxi to a house where Scully was present. Alvarez instructed the girls to undress despite their initial refusal, bathed them, and took photos of them in compromising positions.

Over several days, the girls were given alcoholic beverages until intoxicated, bound and gagged with chains around their necks, stripped naked, and forced to perform sexual acts on each other and on Scully and Alvarez. The accused took photos and videos of these acts. The girls were also forced to watch pornography and perform sexual acts on Scully.

On September 23, 2014, the girls escaped when Scully and Alvarez left the house. They were found by family members and brought to the police, who conducted interviews and medical examinations. The medical reports showed evidence of sexual abuse and trauma.

The accused-appellants claimed their constitutional right to due process was violated as they were not allowed to present their defense fully, citing negligence of their counsel. They also denied the elements of qualified trafficking, arguing the acts were for their own lust and no pornographic materials involving the minors were produced.

The trial court and Court of Appeals found the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt, relying on the credible testimonies of the victims and witnesses, and medical evidence.","The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction of Scully and Alvarez for qualified trafficking in persons under Republic Act No. 9208, as amended. The Court found that the prosecution sufficiently proved all elements of the crime, including recruitment, harboring, and exploitation of minors for sexual purposes, accompanied by photographic and video evidence.

The Court held that the accused-appellants' denial and claims of due process violations were unavailing. The negligence of counsel did not amount to deprivation of the right to be heard. The testimonies of the minor victims were accorded full weight and credibility.

The Court sentenced the accused-appellants to life imprisonment and a fine of PHP 5,000,000.00 each. Moral and exemplary damages were also awarded.",The Court ruled that the accused-appellants were guilty beyond reasonable doubt of qualified trafficking in persons.

VS.
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","Petitioner Romeo Ilao was charged with illegal possession of firearms in violation of Section 1 of Republic Act No. 8294. On April 12, 2007, police officers, with petitioner present, executed a search warrant at a house described as ""inside his house at Brgy. Binukawan, Bagac, Bataan,"" where firearms and ammunition were seized. Ilao was arrested and charged. The prosecution presented evidence including inventory of seized firearms and a certification from the Philippine National Police Firearms and Explosives Office that petitioner did not have a license to possess the firearms.

Petitioner argued that the search warrant was invalid because it failed to particularly describe the place to be searched, as there were many houses in the barangay and the warrant only stated ""inside his house at Brgy. Binukawan, Bagac, Bataan."" He also claimed he was not the owner or in possession of the house searched, citing testimony from the barangay chair that the house belonged to another person, Dodoy Canto. Petitioner maintained that he was only inside the house for a meeting.

The trial court found petitioner guilty beyond reasonable doubt. The Court of Appeals affirmed, noting the prosecution proved the two elements of illegal possession of firearms: existence of firearms and lack of license by petitioner. The appellate court was not convinced by petitioner’s claim that he did not own the house, especially since he did not protest the search and arrest. The Court of Appeals also observed that petitioner filed and then withdrew a motion to avail of probation, which it considered an implied admission of guilt.

Petitioner moved for reconsideration, which was denied. He then filed a Petition for Review before the Supreme Court.","The Supreme Court ruled that search warrants must particularly describe the place to be searched, and only those places described may be searched. The description ""inside his house at Brgy. Binukawan, Bagac, Bataan"" was insufficient because the barangay has many houses and residents, making it impossible to identify the place with reasonable certainty. The Court noted that petitioner presented credible evidence negating ownership of the house searched, which prevailed over the bare testimonies of police officers.

Because the search warrant and its execution were defective, the Court ruled that all items seized are inadmissible as evidence. The Court emphasized that the determination of the place to be searched cannot be left to the discretion of the implementing police officers.

The Court affirmed the constitutional protection against unreasonable searches and seizures under Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution, which requires particularity in search warrants.","The Court ruled that the search warrant was invalid for failure to particularly describe the place to be searched, rendering the search illegal and the seized evidence inadmissible. The Court found that petitioner’s evidence negating ownership of the searched house was credible and that the prosecution failed to prove lawful possession of the house.",The Supreme Court set aside the conviction of Romeo Ilao for illegal possession of firearms due to the invalid search warrant and illegal search. The Court ordered immediate implementation of this decision.
"A.C. No. 11478, November 26, 2024","A.C. No. 11478, November 26, 2024","Respondent Atty. Christopher S. Ruiz was found guilty of violating the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice in a Decision dated September 5, 2017. He was suspended from the practice of law for one year and perpetually disqualified from being commissioned as a notary public. The complaint arose from his notarization of a Notice of Loss/Affidavit of Loss and a Release of Mortgage in Cebu City without requiring competent evidence of identity of the supposed executors and without their consent or knowledge. The notarial register entries were improperly accomplished, with incomplete jurat and missing details such as competent evidence of identity, date, time, and type of notarial act. Respondent shifted blame to his secretary for errors in the notarial register.

The Court held that these acts constituted negligence and dishonesty, justifying the penalties imposed. Respondent’s suspension from the practice of law started on October 9, 2017, and expired on October 9, 2018. His suspension was lifted on August 14, 2019, but his perpetual disqualification as notary public remained.

On August 11, 2022, respondent filed a Petition praying for recall of the perpetual disqualification order, claiming he has endured consequences beyond what was prescribed and demonstrated remorse through social and civic works. He attached certifications and photos of volunteer activities.

The Office of the Bar Confidant (OBC) recommended denying the petition, noting respondent’s continued practice of law during suspension (as a legal consultant), his negligence, and shifting of blame to his secretary, which cast doubt on his fitness as a notary public.","The Supreme Court granted the Petition for recall of the perpetual disqualification. The Court applied the clemency guidelines set forth in Nuñez v. Ricafort, which allow for judicial clemency after a period (usually five years) and upon showing remorse, compliance with prior disciplinary orders, and fitness to practice.

The Court found that respondent’s period of disqualification (four years and ten months) was close enough to the five-year guideline and that he showed remorse and reformation, supported by certifications from the Integrated Bar of the Philippines, community organizations, and ecclesiastical groups. The Court emphasized a forward-looking approach focusing on redemption rather than solely on past infractions.

The Court noted that violations of notarial rules are serious offenses when attended by bad faith, but respondent’s case involved negligence without bad faith.","The Court ruled that respondent’s petition for recall of perpetual disqualification as a notary public has prima facie merit and granted the petition, allowing respondent to apply for commission as a notary public again.",The Court GRANTED the Petition of Atty.

VS.
COURT OF APPEALS AND PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENTS.","Joel Pancho Bigcas was a duly elected barangay kagawad and chair of the Council of Environment and Natural Resources of the Sangguniang Barangay of Lacson, Calinan, Davao City. Lorlene Gonzales applied for an earth moving permit with the City Environment and Natural Resources Office, which required a resolution from the barangay approving her application.

During the barangay session, Bigcas volunteered to verify information at City Hall regarding the certification issued by the City Planning Development Coordinator. He asked Lorlene for PHP 200.00 as fare money to expedite processing. Lorlene gave the amount, thinking it was a common barangay practice.

Later, the barangay denied Lorlene's application after Bigcas showed documents indicating the request was not viable as it was actually a quarry application. Lorlene asked the barangay chairperson if it was their practice to ask for money for expenses; the chairperson denied such practice.

Bigcas later tried to return the PHP 200.00 to Lorlene, who refused to receive it, insisting he did not ask for a loan but for money. Bigcas then approached Lorlene's sons to return the money, but they also refused.

Testimonies from Lorlene, her sons, and the barangay secretary corroborated these events. Bigcas admitted he accepted the money as a loan to end Lorlene's insistence and harassment but maintained he could not help expedite the application.

The Regional Trial Court convicted Bigcas of violating Section 3(c) of Republic Act No. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act) and sentenced him to suffer the indeterminate penalty of six years and one month to seven years imprisonment and perpetual disqualification from public office.

Bigcas appealed to the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the conviction. Bigcas filed a motion for reconsideration, which the Court of Appeals dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, noting that the Sandiganbayan has exclusive jurisdiction over cases involving RA 3019 violations.

Bigcas filed a Rule 65 petition for certiorari before the Supreme Court, seeking to nullify the Court of Appeals’ dispositions and to have his appeal properly decided on the merits.","The Supreme Court ruled that a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 is the proper remedy against the Court of Appeals’ dismissal of the appeal for lack of jurisdiction based on grave abuse of discretion.

The Court recognized the peculiar circumstances of the case, including the timely filing of the Notice of Appeal by Bigcas, the erroneous designation of the Court of Appeals as the appellate court by his counsel, and the trial court’s failure to transmit the records to the proper court (Sandiganbayan).

The Court emphasized that the liberty of the accused should not be prejudiced by the errors of counsel, the trial court, or the Court of Appeals. It cited precedents where the Court relaxed procedural rules in the interest of substantial justice, especially when the accused’s liberty is at stake.

The Court decided to resolve the case on the merits instead of remanding it, to avoid further delay, given that the case had been pending for over ten years.

The Court proceeded to review the evidence and found Bigcas guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Section 3(c) of RA 3019. The elements of the offense were established: Bigcas, a public officer, requested and received money from Lorlene in connection with her application for a government permit.",The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction of Joel Pancho Bigcas for violation of Section 3(c) of RA 3019. The Court imposed the penalty of imprisonment and perpetual disqualification from public office.,"The petition for certiorari is DENIED.

SUGAR REGULATORY ADMINISTRATION, REPRESENTED BY ITS ADMINISTRATOR AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS, GOVERNANCE COMMISSION FOR GOVERNMENT OWNED AND CONTROLLED CORPORATIONS, REPRESENTED BY ITS CHAIRMAN AND BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS, AND DEPARTMENT OF BUDGET AND MANAGEMENT, REPRESENTED BY ITS DEPARTMENT SECRETARY, RESPONDENTS.","Petitioners are 75 former officials and employees of the Sugar Regulatory Administration (SRA) who availed of the Early Retirement Incentive Program (ERIP) offered under the SRA’s Organizational Strengthening Rationalization Plan (RATPLAN), pursuant to Executive Order No. 203, series of 2016, and related laws and issuances. They were separated and retired effective August 1, 2016.

The SRA’s RATPLAN was approved by the Governance Commission for GOCCs (GCG) under Memorandum Order No. 2016-05, which required the SRA to adopt and offer retirement and separation packages to affected personnel using incentives provided under EO No. 203. The SRA implemented the RATPLAN and invited employees to avail of the ERIP.

Despite their separation, petitioners’ retirement benefits under the ERIP were withheld following a directive from the GCG pending the issuance of implementing guidelines required under EO No. 203. The Department of Budget and Management (DBM) also did not approve the supplemental budget for the ERIP benefits due to the absence of these guidelines.

Petitioners filed a complaint for illegal dismissal before the Civil Service Commission (CSC), alleging that the non-release of their ERIP benefits and their removal from the payroll constituted illegal dismissal. The CSC dismissed the complaint for lack of merit, ruling that petitioners voluntarily availed of the ERIP and were not illegally dismissed. The CSC declared that petitioners may file their claims with the proper forum and directed the SRA to facilitate payment of their ERIP benefits.

Petitioners followed up with letters requesting release of their benefits, but the SRA did not act. Some petitioners filed a complaint before the Office of the Ombudsman for non-compliance with the CSC decision.

The GCG clarified that the suspension of the ERIP implementation under EO No. 36, series of 2017, and its implementing rules, revoked the authority to release ERIP benefits. The GCG advised petitioners to raise their concerns with the Office of the President (OP).

Petitioners filed a Petition for Mandamus before the Supreme Court to compel the respondents to release their ERIP benefits pursuant to the CSC decision.","The Supreme Court took cognizance of the petition and noted the factual and legal background, including the suspension of the ERIP under EO No. 36, series of 2017, and the absence of implementing guidelines.

The Court recognized that petitioners have a clear and unmistakable right to their retirement benefits once they have separated from service under the ERIP. The respondents have a corresponding duty to release such benefits unless valid legal impediments exist.

The Court observed that the suspension of the ERIP and the absence of implementing guidelines created a legal impediment to the release of benefits, which respondents cited as justification for non-payment.

The Court emphasized that mandamus will lie only if petitioners’ right is clear and the duty of respondents is ministerial and not dependent on the exercise of discretion.

The Court considered the CSC’s ruling that petitioners were not illegally dismissed and that they may pursue their claims with the proper forum.","The Supreme Court ruled that while petitioners have a right to their ERIP benefits, the respondents’ failure to release these benefits is due to valid legal impediments, including the suspension of the ERIP and lack of implementing guidelines.

The Court held that mandamus is not the proper remedy to compel payment under these circumstances, as the respondents’ duty is not purely ministerial.","The Supreme Court DENIED the Petition for Mandamus filed by petitioners Dominador T. Villanueva, Jr., Edmundo L. Yasay, Edgardo M. Adalia, et al. The Court directed the parties to pursue their claims through the proper administrative and judicial remedies."

PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","The petitioner, XXX260547, was charged with violation of Section 5(i) of Republic Act No. 9262 (Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act of 2004) for acts constituting psychological abuse against his wife, AAA260547. The Information alleged that from August 2014 to the present, the petitioner willfully committed acts likely to cause psychological abuse by leaving his wife to live with another woman, Melinda, and by neglecting to provide support for their two children, to the damage and prejudice of AAA260547.

At trial, the prosecution presented witnesses including AAA260547, the barangay captain Angelito Catubig, and CCC260547. AAA260547 testified about the petitioner’s infidelity, his living with Melinda, and the emotional pain she suffered. The defense presented petitioner and CCC260547 as witnesses, with petitioner admitting to having a child with Melinda and ceasing support to AAA260547 and their children due to loss of trust.

The Regional Trial Court (RTC) found the petitioner guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Section 5(i) of RA 9262, sentencing him to an indeterminate penalty of four years and two months to eight years and one day imprisonment, a fine of PHP 100,000, and mandatory psychological counseling.

The petitioner appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA), arguing that the Information was defective for failing to allege that AAA260547 or their children suffered mental or emotional anguish, that the acts charged did not constitute psychological abuse, and that the prosecution failed to prove repeated marital infidelity.

The CA affirmed the RTC decision, finding that the petitioner’s extra-marital affair caused mental and emotional anguish to AAA260547.

The petitioner filed a Petition for Review before the Supreme Court.","The Supreme Court granted the petition, ruling that the Information was defective because it failed to allege that AAA260547 or their children suffered mental or emotional anguish, an essential element of the offense. The Court held that the Information must specifically state the nature of the psychological abuse and the resulting mental or emotional anguish to inform the accused properly and allow preparation of defense.

The Court emphasized that allegations of “damage and prejudice” are too general and do not satisfy the specificity required by law. The constitutional right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation requires a sufficient Information.

Accordingly, the Court reversed the conviction and ordered the immediate entry of judgment of acquittal.","The Court ruled that the Information was insufficient for failing to allege mental or emotional anguish suffered by the victim, thus violating the petitioner’s right to due process. The conviction was reversed.","The Supreme Court GRANTED the Petition for Review and REVERSED and SET ASIDE the Decision of the Court of Appeals and the RTC, ordering the immediate entry of judgment of acquittal in favor of XXX260547."

The prosecution presented witnesses including the victim (AAA), his teacher (CCC), a psychologist (Ghia C. Dagondon), and a medical doctor (Dr. Arden O. Mangubat). The victim testified that Ryan twisted his arm, slapped his face, punched his head multiple times, pulled his hair, lifted and threw him to the ground, and threatened him and others with violence. The teacher and experts corroborated the victim’s testimony, noting physical injuries and psychological trauma.

Ryan denied the charges, claiming he only intervened to separate his son and the victim during a fight and that he acted without intent to harm or demean the child.

The Regional Trial Court found Ryan guilty beyond reasonable doubt and sentenced him to an indeterminate penalty of 4 years, 9 months, and 11 days to 6 years, 8 months, and 1 day imprisonment, plus moral damages of PHP 20,000 with legal interest, and costs.

The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction, emphasizing the cruelty and excessive nature of Ryan’s acts and the resulting trauma to the child.

Ryan filed a petition for review before the Supreme Court.","The Supreme Court denied the petition, ruling that the issue is factual and the lower courts properly found Ryan guilty. The Court emphasized that physical maltreatment and threats inflicted on a child, especially in public, are intrinsically cruel and excessive, impairing the child’s dignity and right to a safe environment.

Sucgang-Perez underwent psychological evaluation with Dr. Arnulfo V. Lopez, but later discovered that Dr. Lopez’s professional fee was only partially paid by Atty. Sore-Romano despite prior agreement. Communication with Atty. Sore-Romano became difficult, with little to no updates on the case. Litigation support staff and other lawyers in the firm informed Sucgang-Perez of delays, disorganized pleadings, and that other clients had similar complaints. Sucgang-Perez demanded refund and termination of services. Atty. Sore-Romano eventually filed the petition, but it was dismissed due to procedural defects. Sucgang-Perez filed a complaint with the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP), alleging negligence, abandonment of case, failure to update client, improper handling of client’s money, and breach of professional duties. Atty. Sore-Romano failed to comply with IBP orders to file answers and attend mandatory conferences. The IBP Commission on Bar Discipline recommended suspension.","The Supreme Court found Atty. Sore-Romano negligent in handling the case, causing dismissal on technical grounds. She violated duties to keep the client informed, perform competently, and properly handle client money. She willfully disobeyed IBP orders. Multiple violations from independent acts warranted separate penalties. Two aggravating circumstances were present, and no mitigating circumstances were found. The Court suspended Atty. Sore-Romano from the practice of law for five years and imposed a fine totaling PHP 810,000. The Court ordered partial refund of the acceptance fee to Sucgang-Perez. The lawyer-client relationship is fiduciary in nature, and breach thereof is serious. The decision was to be appended to Atty. Sore-Romano’s personal record and disseminated to relevant bodies.","Atty. Ma. Aurora Paredes Sore-Romano is suspended from the practice of law for five years and fined PHP 810,000. She is ordered to refund part of the acceptance fee to Maria Charisse Ann Sucgang-Perez.","The Supreme Court suspended Atty. Sore-Romano for five years, imposed fines, and ordered refund of part of the client’s fees. The disciplinary records are to be maintained and disseminated accordingly."

VS.
ALBERTO R. DAVID, UTILITY WORKER I, MUNICIPAL CIRCUIT TRIAL COURT, ALCALA-BAUTISTA, ALCALA, PANGASINAN, RESPONDENT.","Under her verified Letter-Complaint dated January 16, 2023, Michelle C. Soloria charged respondent Alberto R. David, Utility Worker I, Municipal Circuit Trial Court, Alcala-Bautista, Alcala, Pangasinan with gross immorality, prejudicial conduct that gravely besmirches or taints the reputation of the service, and vulgar and unbecoming conduct under Sections 14(i), 14(1), and 16(a) of Rule 140 of the Rules of Court, as amended by A.M. No. 21-08-09-SC.

Soloria claimed that she started a relationship with David in 2017 while he was still legally married to his wife with whom he has a child. They decided to live together in 2018 and had a daughter. David became employed as a utility worker at the Municipal Circuit Trial Court, Alcala-Bautista. David became selfish and refused to give financial support to Soloria and their daughter except on the condition that she would pay him back. David's child with his wife could not read and write despite being 17 years old due to lack of educational support from David. David's wife provided financial support to her and her daughter. Soloria caught David womanizing in 2022 and later found out he was cohabiting with a second mistress. David's work allegedly suffered due to his womanizing; he was caught sleeping during office hours but his officemates did not complain because he was related to the presiding judge. Soloria left David in December 2022 after confirming his cohabitation with another woman since October 2022.

In his Comment dated February 17, 2023, David admitted he was legally married, that Soloria was not his wife, and that he had moved on to another mistress. He denied neglecting his children, claiming he raised his first child with family help. He denied failing to support his child with Soloria, despite her being ""difficult to talk to at times."" He admitted to taking a nap once during office hours. He denied being related to the presiding judge and said he only calls her ""auntie"" as a sign of respect. He and Soloria agreed to part ways amicably once he found someone else.

In her Reply dated February 20, 2023, Soloria maintained that David was not a good provider; the money he gave was insufficient even for groceries. David's child with his wife said David asked for reimbursement when asked for something. David's aunt took care of his child because he was inattentive. David's officemates expressed concern about his work performance, and David admitted to being called out for mistakes. Soloria felt slighted when David left her for another woman.

The Judicial Integrity Board – Office of the Executive Director (JIB-OED), by Report and Recommendation dated January 24, 2024, found David guilty of gross immorality. The JIB-OED held that the charge was proved by substantial evidence. David did not deny being married and having an affair with Soloria, nor leaving Soloria for another mistress. The JIB-OED recommended dismissal from service with forfeiture of all benefits except accrued leave credits and perpetual disqualification from government service.

The Judicial Integrity Board (JIB), in its Report dated June 25, 2024, adopted and approved the JIB-OED's findings and recommendations.","The Supreme Court adopted and approved the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations of the JIB with modification. The Court emphasized its jurisdiction over administrative matters involving judicial employees and its power to discipline them motu proprio or through verified complaints.

The Court found David guilty of gross immorality for maintaining illicit relationships with at least two persons other than his legal spouse. Immoral acts are those violating basic norms of decency and morality, and gross immorality is reprehensible to a high degree. The Court stressed that employees of the Judiciary must maintain the highest standards of honesty, integrity, morality, and decency in both professional and private conduct.

David's failure to provide adequate support to his children was not proven. The Court found no basis to hold him administratively liable for neglect or failure to support.

Regarding allegations of tardiness and poor work performance, the Court found no proof of habitual tardiness but held David liable for sleeping during office hours, which constitutes vulgar and unbecoming conduct.

Under Rule 140 of the Rules of Court, gross immorality is punishable by dismissal from service, forfeiture of benefits except accrued leave credits, and perpetual disqualification from government service. The Court found aggravating circumstances and lack of remorse, justifying the maximum penalty.",The Court found Alberto R. David guilty of gross immorality and vulgar and unbecoming conduct. He is dismissed from service with forfeiture of all benefits except accrued leave credits and perpetually disqualified from re-employment in any government branch or instrumentality.,"The Supreme Court ordered the dismissal of Alberto R. David from government service, forfeiture of benefits except accrued leave credits, and perpetual disqualification from government employment."

VS.
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","The case arose from an Information dated July 4, 2016, charging the petitioners and Tomas Alburo Riveral with violation of Section 65(a)(2) of Republic Act No. 9184 (The Government Procurement Reform Act). The accused public officers, occupying various managerial positions in the Cebu Port Authority (CPA), were charged with willfully, unlawfully, and criminally delaying without justifiable cause the opening of bids for the procurement of Janitorial/Support Services for CY 2011 of CPA beyond the prescribed period by postponing the scheduled opening of bids from May 18, 2011, to June 9, 2011. The postponement was allegedly due to queries from media and port stakeholders, which under law may be raised only by prospective bidders before the deadline for submission of bids.

On April 27, 2011, CPA published the Invitation to Bid with a deadline of May 18, 2011. On May 18, 2011, CPA Commissioner Riveral requested postponement due to queries from media and port stakeholders, which was approved by CPA General Manager Villamor and transmitted to the CPA-BAC, which then postponed the bid opening. A Supplemental Bid Bulletin rescheduled the opening to June 9, 2011. The opening proceeded on June 9, 2011, except for one bidder whose bid was opened on June 24, 2011.

A complaint was filed before the Office of the Ombudsman, which found probable cause and filed the Information before the Sandiganbayan. Riveral and petitioners filed Motions to Quash; Riveral’s was granted, petitioners’ denied. Petitioners argued that Sandiganbayan lacked jurisdiction due to their salary grade and that the RTC had exclusive jurisdiction. The prosecution’s Motion for Partial Reconsideration was denied.","The Sandiganbayan ruled that Riveral merely requested postponement, which was approved by Villamor, and since Villamor was not indicted, Riveral’s Information was quashed. The denial of petitioners’ Motion to Quash was affirmed to allow trial to determine facts.","The Supreme Court held that the Sandiganbayan has jurisdiction over the petitioners as public officials under Section 4 of P.D. No. 1606, regardless of salary grade. The charge of delay without justifiable cause in the opening of bids suffices to establish jurisdiction in Sandiganbayan. The factual justification for postponement is a matter for trial, not for quashal. There was no grave abuse of discretion in denying the Motion to Quash.",The petition lacks merit. The Sandiganbayan did not commit grave abuse of discretion in denying the Motion to Quash filed by the petitioners.

THE ESTATE OF THE LATE SPOUSES NARCISO AND OFELIA FERRERAS, REPRESENTED BY ITS SPECIAL ADMINISTRATOR, DANILO S. FERRERAS, RESPONDENT.","The case involves the petitioners’ claim as buyers in good faith and for value with a complete chain of registered titles in their favor. The Court of Appeals (CA) found that the petitioners were buyers in bad faith due to irregularities in the chain of certificates of title (TCTs) involved, particularly the “laundering” or questionable annotations and cancellations in the titles originating from the Spouses Ferreras to Pinpin and then to petitioners.

The Pinpin TCTs were found to have been improperly “laundered,” with annotations disappearing to make the titles appear “clean,” despite originating from cancelled Spouses Ferreras TCTs due to a sham deed of sale executed by the deceased Spouses Ferreras in favor of Pinpin.

The Court noted suspicious annotations, questionable affidavits of loss, and irregular decisions purportedly issued by a certain RTC judge allowing issuance of duplicate titles. The presence of these annotations should have alerted petitioners to investigate further before dealing with the properties.

The Court discussed the principles of the Torrens system, particularly the “mirror,” “curtain,” and “insurance” doctrines, emphasizing that the Torrens certificate is a reflection of the register but the register itself must be inquired into, especially when suspicious circumstances exist.

The Court underscored that constructive notice applies to all registrations affecting the property and that persons dealing with registered land have a duty of diligent inquiry, especially when anomalies appear.

Petitioners’ failure to inquire into the register and suspicious facts surrounding the titles and transactions negated their claim of good faith.","The Court affirmed the CA’s finding that petitioners are not innocent purchasers for value entitled to protection under the Torrens system. The Court held that reliance solely on the face of the certificate of title without further inquiry, especially under suspicious circumstances, is insufficient.

The Court clarified the proper application of the Torrens system principles, emphasizing the need for inquiry into the register and the application of constructive notice.",The Court ruled that petitioners are buyers in bad faith and are not entitled to protection as innocent purchasers under the Torrens system.,The petition is denied. The petitioners’ claim as buyers in good faith and for value is rejected due to their failure to exercise due diligence in investigating the chain of title and suspicious circumstances surrounding the subject properties.

MONICO BADILLO, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","In an Information dated September 17, 2008, Badillo was charged with murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code for stabbing Joseph Olbes on September 14, 2008, at Barangay San Juan, Irosin, Sorsogon. The prosecution presented witnesses Salvador Fernandez, Jomel Escasinas, and Marilou Olbes, who testified to witnessing or confirming the stabbing and the victim’s death. A post-mortem examination confirmed death due to multiple stab wounds.

Badillo denied the charges and claimed an alibi, stating he was in Batuan, Masbate, assisting his daughter at the time of the stabbing. His alibi was supported by cousins Felipe Basig and Emilio Badillo, who testified that Badillo was at Emilio’s house during the incident.

The Regional Trial Court (RTC) found Badillo guilty beyond reasonable doubt of murder, sentencing him to reclusion perpetua and awarding damages to the victim’s heirs. The RTC credited the prosecution witnesses’ positive identification and qualified the offense with treachery. The defense witnesses’ testimonies were viewed with skepticism.

The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the conviction but downgraded the offense to homicide, ruling that treachery was not sufficiently proven.

Badillo filed a Notice of Appeal to the Supreme Court, which treated it as a petition for review on certiorari.","The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction for homicide. It gave great weight to the RTC and CA’s factual findings, especially the credibility of prosecution witnesses. The Court rejected Badillo’s claims of inconsistent testimonies and delayed reporting, holding these did not impair credibility.

Respondents Borja and Regulado were incumbent members of the Board of Directors of Camarines Sur Electric Cooperative II (CASURECO II). Borja filed his certificate of candidacy for mayor, and Regulado for municipal councilor in the 2013 elections. They challenged the memorandum before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Naga City, seeking to declare Section 2 unconstitutional for contravening election laws and the will of the electorate.

The RTC granted a preliminary injunction in favor of Borja but not Regulado. The RTC later struck down Section 2 of Memorandum No. 2012-016, holding that it expanded the law and was void.

On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) dismissed the case as moot and academic due to the expiration of the officials’ terms but ruled that the memorandum was unconstitutional for contravening the NEA’s charter under Presidential Decree No. 269.

The NEA filed a petition for certiorari before the Supreme Court to assert the validity of Section 2.","The Supreme Court affirmed that the case is moot and academic, but applied the exception for issues capable of repetition yet evading review, as the memorandum’s limited duration and the possibility of recurrence satisfy the criteria.

The Court clarified that electric cooperatives are private, non-stock, non-profit membership corporations engaged in public service but are not government agencies or government-owned or controlled corporations (GOCCs). Their officers are private individuals elected from the membership and board.

The Court ruled that the ""ipso facto resignation"" rule under the Omnibus Election Code applies only to public appointive officials and employees of GOCCs, not to officers of electric cooperatives.

The Court further held that Section 2 of Memorandum No. 2012-016 unlawfully amended or expanded the law by deeming officers automatically resigned upon filing candidacy, exceeding NEA’s authority.",The Court declared Section 2 of Memorandum No. 2012-016 unconstitutional and void for being ultra vires and inconsistent with the NEA’s charter and election laws.,The petition is denied. The Court upheld the decision of the Court of Appeals declaring Section 2 of Memorandum No. 2012-016 unconstitutional and affirmed the dismissal of NEA’s petition.
"G.R. No. 261627, November 13, 2024","GODOFREDO V. ARQUIZA, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","Petitioner Godofredo V. Arquiza was charged with libel under Article 353 of the Revised Penal Code, as penalized under Article 355. The libelous statements were contained in a Petition to Deny Due Course or Cancel the Certificate of Nomination of Party List Nominees filed before the COMELEC against Francisco G. Datol, Jr., a nominee of the Senior Citizen Party-List to Congress. The petition alleged that Datol had a string of criminal cases indicating a propensity to commit illegal acts and labeled him a fugitive from justice. Datol claimed these imputations were malicious, defamatory, and caused him dishonor and prejudice. The petition was filed in a quasi-judicial proceeding before the COMELEC. The Regional Trial Court (RTC) convicted Arquiza of libel, sentencing him to imprisonment and a fine, and awarding moral damages to Datol. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the conviction, rejecting the claim that the statements were privileged communications. Arquiza filed a petition for review before the Supreme Court, arguing that the statements were absolutely privileged as they were made in the course of quasi-judicial proceedings and that the burden was on Datol to prove the criminal cases were not against him but a namesake.","The Supreme Court ruled that absolute immunity from suit applies not only to statements made in judicial proceedings but also to those made in quasi-judicial proceedings and steps necessarily preliminary thereto, provided the proceedings afford procedural protections similar to judicial proceedings, the statements are relevant to the proceedings, and are communicated only to those with a duty to perform with respect to the document or legally required to be served. The Court applied a four-fold test to determine the applicability of absolute privilege in quasi-judicial proceedings. It found that the statements in the Petition to Deny Due Course satisfied these requirements and were therefore covered by absolute privilege.","The Supreme Court acquitted petitioner Godofredo V. Arquiza of the crime of libel, holding that his statements in the Petition to Deny Due Course were absolutely privileged communications made in the course of quasi-judicial proceedings before the COMELEC. The Court relaxed procedural rules to consider the petition on its merits despite some procedural defects.","Petitioner Godofredo V. Arquiza was acquitted of libel charges. The Court reversed the RTC and CA decisions convicting him, recognizing absolute privilege for statements made in quasi-judicial proceedings under the conditions outlined."

AGCAOILI, JR., AND ATTY. MARK S. OLIVEROS, RESPONDENTS.","This disciplinary action arose from allegations of irregular notarization of various documents involved in criminal complaints for plunder and violations of Republic Act No. 3019 and other laws, including malversation through falsification of documents. The documents were allegedly notarized by respondents Atty. Editha P. Talaboc, Atty. Delfin R. Agcaoili, Jr., and Atty. Mark S. Oliveros, or their names and notarial details were used without their knowledge or consent. The Office of the Ombudsman (OMB) found that the notarizations were irregular and recommended disciplinary action for violation of the rules on notarial practice, asserting that the respondents allowed the use of their notarial seals, stamps, and registers for a fee or retainer. The respondents denied the charges, with Atty. Agcaoili submitting an answer and averring that his notarial paraphernalia were kept securely and that forged signatures were made by others, including Ben Hur Luy. Atty. Talaboc failed to file a position paper despite several motions for extension, and Atty. Oliveros did not file any pleading or motion to contradict the charges. The Integrated Bar of the Philippines Commission on Bar Discipline (IBP-CBD) investigated and recommended findings of guilt for violation of the Notarial Rules. The respondents were accused of negligence in safekeeping their notarial details and failure to comply with IBP directives.","The Supreme Court reviewed the records and set aside the findings and recommendation of the IBP. The Court found that the OMB failed to discharge its burden of proof to show that respondents consented to the use of their signatures, notarial seals, and notarial registers in return for a fee. There was no sufficient proof that respondents received money or that their notarial registers were used knowingly by them. Deficiencies and irregularities in the notarial details cast doubt on the validity of the notarial commissions. The Court recognized that notaries are not immune from identity theft and that others could have used the respondents' names and requested notarial stamps and seals be made in their names without their knowledge. The Court noted that in previous cases, lawyers were penalized only when negligence was proven, such as allowing secretaries full access to notarial paraphernalia. The Court also noted that respondent Atty. Agcaoili was previously penalized in another case. However, the Court found that respondents Talaboc and Oliveros failed to comply with IBP directives, did not file answers, and did not attend mandatory conferences, which constitutes violation of Canon III, Section 2 of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability (CPRA).","The Court acquitted respondents of the charges of irregular notarization due to insufficient proof of their knowledge or consent to the alleged acts. However, the Court found respondents Atty. Talaboc and Atty. Oliveros guilty of violation of Canon III, Section 2 of the CPRA for their failure to comply with IBP directives and imposed penalties accordingly. Atty. Talaboc was suspended from the practice of law for six months due to this being her third instance of non-compliance, an aggravating circumstance. Atty. Oliveros was found guilty of the same violation but with mitigating circumstances as this was his first offense.","The Supreme Court set aside the IBP's findings of guilt for irregular notarization against respondents and acquitted them of administrative liability for such acts. The Court imposed a six-month suspension on respondent Atty. Editha P. Talaboc and a lesser penalty on respondent Atty. Mark S. Oliveros for their failure to comply with IBP directives during the disciplinary proceedings. The Court ordered the Office of the Court Administrator to remind judges to comply with rules on notarial practice and tasked Executive Judges and relevant bodies to investigate the circumstances surrounding the notarial services rendered in respondents' names.

"G.R. No. 265223, November 13, 2024","NOE R. PAGARAO, JR. AND REBECCA CABALLA, PETITIONERS, VS. IMMACULADA T. TRINIDAD, RESPONDENT.","Respondent Immaculada T. Trinidad is the owner of a parcel of land in Cainta, Rizal, covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 616372. In February 2015, petitioners Noe R. Pagarao, Jr. and Rebecca Caballa occupied the property and constructed a modest structure used as their residence and place of business. In 2018, Trinidad discovered their occupation and verbally demanded they vacate. Pagarao and Caballa asked to continue possession and offered to purchase the property for PHP 2.5 million. Trinidad agreed, subject to a written contract to sell, and accepted a partial payment of PHP 300,000 as proof of intent. Later, Pagarao and Caballa refused to sign the contract to sell prepared by Trinidad. Trinidad then demanded they vacate via letter, which was ignored. On April 1, 2019, Trinidad filed a complaint for unlawful detainer before the Municipal Trial Court (MTC).

The MTC ruled in favor of Trinidad, finding that Pagarao and Caballa's possession was initially lawful based on the agreement to enter into a contract to sell but became unlawful upon their refusal to vacate when demanded. The Regional Trial Court (RTC) affirmed the MTC decision. Pagarao and Caballa filed a petition for review with the Court of Appeals (CA), which denied the petition, ruling that their possession ripened into lawful possession upon the agreement to purchase.

Pagarao and Caballa sought reconsideration, which was denied, and then filed a petition for review on certiorari before the Supreme Court. They argued that if their possession was unlawful from the beginning, unlawful detainer was not the proper remedy and the complaint should be dismissed.","The Supreme Court reviewed the case and ruled that unlawful detainer is a summary action to recover possession of real property and requires that the defendant's initial possession be lawful, either by contract or tolerance of the owner. If the initial possession was unlawful, the proper remedy is an action for forcible entry, not unlawful detainer. The Court emphasized that tolerance must be present from the start of possession; subsequent tolerance cannot convert an unlawful entry into lawful possession for purposes of unlawful detainer.

In this case, Trinidad disavowed knowledge of how Pagarao and Caballa initially entered the property, indicating no initial tolerance. The agreement to enter into a contract to sell did not transfer ownership or right to possess because ownership remains with the seller until full payment is made. Thus, Pagarao and Caballa's possession was unlawful from the start and only later tolerated by Trinidad.","The Supreme Court held that the courts a quo erred in ruling that unlawful detainer was the proper remedy. Since initial possession was unlawful, the complaint for unlawful detainer lacked cause of action. The Court reversed and set aside the decisions of the Court of Appeals, RTC, and MTC, and dismissed the complaint for unlawful detainer.","The complaint for unlawful detainer filed by Immaculada T. Trinidad against Noe R. Pagarao, Jr. and Rebecca Caballa was dismissed for lack of cause of action. The Supreme Court ruled that the proper remedy for Trinidad is an action for forcible entry, not unlawful detainer, given the unlawful nature of the initial possession by Pagarao and Caballa."
"G.R. No. 259992, November 11, 2024","DEPARTMENT OF BUDGET AND MANAGEMENT PROCUREMENT SERVICE, PETITIONER, VS. JAC AUTOMOBILE INTERNATIONAL PHILIPPINES, INC., RESPONDENT.","The Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) intended to procure 6-wheeler and 10-wheeler dump trucks as farm equipment and engaged the Department of Budget and Management - Procurement Service (DBM-PS) as its procurement agent through a Memorandum of Agreement. The DBM-PS posted invitations to bid for two public bidding projects: PB No. 14-122 for 61 units of 6-wheeler dump trucks with an approved budget of PHP 274,500,000.00, and PB No. 15-018-2 for 29 units of 6-wheeler dump trucks and 40 units of 10-wheeler dump trucks with approved budgets of PHP 130,500,000.00 and PHP 220,000,000.00 respectively. Respondent JAC Automobile International Philippines, Inc. participated in the bidding alongside other joint ventures (JV of Ad Lib-Hubei-Muli-Lift, China Dong Feng Motor Distributors, Inc., JV of Autocirculo Corporation and Man Automotive Concessionaires Corporation).

The Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) conducted pre-qualification and post-qualification evaluations. Respondent’s bid was found to be the lowest calculated responsive bid after other bidders were post-disqualified for various deficiencies such as differences in signatures, lack of documentary support, failure to establish proof of completed contracts, and failure to comply with manufacturer certification requirements. Consequently, on July 24, 2015, the BAC issued Notices of Lowest Calculated Responsive Bid to respondent for both bidding projects.

On September 4, 2015, Executive Director Jose Tomas C. Syquia (ED Syquia), acting as Head of the Procuring Entity (HOPE), issued Notices of Cancellation for PB Nos. 14-122 and 15-018-2 (Lot No. 1), stating that the projects were not economically and financially feasible, reasoning that the government would spend more due to procedural deficiencies rather than technical capability. Despite this, ED Syquia issued a Notice of Award in favor of respondent for PB No. 15-018-2 (Lot No. 2) on September 7, 2015, which respondent accepted.

Respondent filed a complaint against petitioner alleging grave abuse of discretion in issuing the Notices of Cancellation, arguing that there was no significant change in economic conditions, no determination that the projects were unnecessary, and no showing that funding was withheld or reduced.

The Regional Trial Court (RTC) denied respondent’s motions for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction but eventually ruled on April 5, 2018, that ED Syquia acted with grave abuse of discretion in issuing the Notices of Cancellation. The RTC declared the cancellations null and void and ordered the DBM-PS to proceed with awarding the contract to respondent. The RTC also ruled that ED Syquia should have declared a failure of bidding under the proper procedure instead of issuing cancellation notices.

Petitioner appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA), which on July 23, 2021, affirmed the RTC decision, holding that ED Syquia was the HOPE, that the grounds for cancellation did not fall under the justifiable grounds under the 2009 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of Republic Act No. 9184, and that issuing the cancellation notices without proper grounds constituted grave abuse of discretion causing unfairness and injustice to respondent. The CA denied petitioner’s motion for reconsideration on March 23, 2022.

Petitioner filed a petition for certiorari before the Supreme Court.","The Supreme Court agreed with the RTC and CA that ED Syquia, as HOPE, had the authority to issue the Notices of Cancellation but acted with grave abuse of discretion because he failed to clearly show the existence of justifiable grounds under Article XI, Section 41 of Republic Act No. 9184 and its 2009 Revised IRR. The Court emphasized that the discretion to accept or reject bids is vested in government agencies but must be exercised with explanation and justification.

The Court found that ED Syquia’s grounds for cancellation-(1) that the BAC failed to exhaust clarification procedures during post-qualification, and (2) that the projects were not economically and financially viable because the government would spend more-were unsupported by evidence. The BAC had complied with required procedures and properly disqualified other bidders. ED Syquia’s conclusion was a sweeping statement without explanation or proof.

The Court also clarified that while the HOPE may declare failure of bidding, the proper procedure under the circumstances was not followed. However, the main issue was the lack of justifiable grounds for cancellation.","The Court agreed that resort to certiorari was proper since the notices of cancellation were issued by the HOPE, not the BAC, making the protest mechanism ineffective.","The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals and Regional Trial Court decisions declaring the Notices of Cancellation issued by ED Syquia null and void for grave abuse of discretion. The Court ordered the Department of Budget and Management Procurement Service to proceed with awarding the contracts to JAC Automobile International Philippines, Inc. The petition for certiorari filed by the Department of Budget and Management Procurement Service was denied."

After the effectivity of Presidential Decree No. 27, the land was placed under the Operation Land Transfer Program for distribution to qualified tenant-farmers. Demetrio Tellez was identified as a qualified beneficiary of his tenanted portion of Vivencio's property. Demetrio’s successors-in-interest, petitioners Ernesto and Jovino Tellez, were issued four emancipation patents on July 15, 1988 covering their respective tenanted portions.

Two cases arose concerning the subject property. In Civil Case No. C-38, Vivencio sued Jovino, and the Regional Trial Court (RTC) upheld the validity and binding effect of an Amicable Settlement executed by Jovino on September 17, 1992, wherein Jovino surrendered tenancy rights over the subject property to Vivencio for monetary consideration (First RTC Decision). In Civil Case No. C-83, Vivencio sued Ernesto and others for recovery of possession, and the RTC ordered them to vacate the property in Vivencio's favor based on Jovino’s surrender (Second RTC Decision). The Tellezes’ motion to reopen the case was denied, and the Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the finality of the Second RTC Decision.

Ernesto and Jovino then filed a complaint for recovery of possession and injunction against spouses Jose and Jovita Joson (Vivencio’s heirs) before the Provincial Agrarian Reform Adjudicator (PARAD), asserting ownership by virtue of their emancipation patents. PARAD dismissed the complaint citing res judicata based on the RTC decisions. The Tellezes elevated the case to the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB), which reversed PARAD and ruled that Ernesto and Jovino are rightful owners with incontrovertible possession rights. The DARAB held that Jovino’s surrender through the Amicable Settlement violated Section 27 of RA No. 6657 and DAR Administrative Order 08-95, which prohibit transfer of lands awarded to farmer-beneficiaries within 10 years. However, the DARAB ruled Jovino could not revert to farmer-beneficiary status due to the violation and ordered the transfer of Jovino’s tenanted portion to the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) for availability to other qualified beneficiaries.

Spouses Joson filed a Petition for Review under Rule 43 before the CA. The CA reversed and set aside the DARAB ruling, holding that res judicata barred the petitioners’ complaint because the First and Second RTC Decisions had attained finality declaring spouses Joson as having the better right of possession. Petitioners’ motion for reconsideration was denied by the CA.","The Supreme Court found the petition meritorious. It held that the principle of res judicata requires a final judgment on the merits by a court with jurisdiction, with identity of parties, subject matter, and causes of action. The Court explained the doctrine’s two concepts: bar by prior judgment and conclusiveness of judgment. The Court was not convinced that res judicata barred the petitioners’ complaint because the Amicable Settlement, which formed the basis of the RTC decisions, was null and void for violating Section 27 of RA No. 6657 and DAR AO 08-95 prohibiting transfer of lands awarded to farmer-beneficiaries within 10 years. Therefore, the First RTC Decision upholding the Amicable Settlement was void and could not bar the petitioners’ claims.

The Court set aside the DARAB order for transfer proceedings regarding Jovino’s tenanted portion. It clarified that the invalidity of the Amicable Settlement does not prejudice spouses Joson’s right to recover the money paid to Jovino in a separate action.","The Supreme Court ruled in favor of petitioners Ernesto and Jovino Tellez. It declared that the Amicable Settlement executed by Jovino surrendering tenancy rights was null and void for violating agrarian laws. Consequently, the prior RTC decisions based on the Amicable Settlement cannot bar the petitioners’ claim by res judicata. The Court set aside the CA ruling that dismissed petitioners’ complaint and the DARAB’s order for transfer action. The Court emphasized the protection of farmer-beneficiaries’ rights under PD 27 and RA 6657.",The petition was granted. The Court reversed the CA decision that dismissed the complaint on grounds of res judicata and set aside the DARAB order for transfer proceedings. The Amicable Settlement was declared void for violating agrarian reform laws. The petitioners’ rights as farmer-beneficiaries with valid emancipation patents were upheld. The ruling preserves petitioners’ right to possession of their tenanted portions and invalidates the prior surrender to Vivencio. The Court allowed spouses Joson to seek recovery of monetary consideration paid to Jovino in a separate case.
"G.R. No. 272145, November 11, 2024","METROPOLITAN BANK AND TRUST COMPANY [FORMERLY ASIAN BANK CORPORATION], PETITIONER, VS. SPOUSES RODOLFO ANTONINO AND ROSA MARINA ANTONINO, RESPONDENTS.","From August 21, 1996 to January 20, 1997, spouses Rodolfo and Rosa Marina Antonino successively obtained 12 loans by way of credit accommodation from Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company (Metrobank), evidenced by corresponding Promissory Notes. To secure the PHP 16,000,000.00 loan obtained on October 9, 1996 (covered by Promissory Note No. RR-1096-6822), the Antoninos executed a Real Estate Mortgage (REM) over their 1,167 square-meter property in Ayala Alabang, Muntinlupa.

The other credit accommodations were secured by a Continuing Pledge Agreement with the Antoninos’ 42,375 Philippine Commercial and International Bank (PCIB) shares of stocks, which were subsequently increased via amendments to cover increased credit accommodations and additional pledged shares, with total pledged shares valued at more than PHP 38,000,000.00.

The Antoninos defaulted on their loans, prompting Metrobank to foreclose the REM. At the public auction sale of the mortgaged property, Metrobank emerged as the winning bidder with a bid of PHP 25,674,000.00. The foreclosure sale proceeds were applied to the expenses of the sale and to the Antoninos’ unsecured outstanding obligations to Metrobank, purportedly by virtue of the dragnet clause contained in the REM contract.

Metrobank filed a Complaint against the Antoninos for the payment of the balance of PHP 12,386,356.00 on the October 9, 1996 loan, which had ballooned to PHP 18,626,917.86 due to interests and penalties at the time of foreclosure. The Complaint attached a Statement of Account showing that the claim was limited to the balance of the October 9, 1996 loan, as the other three obligations had been satisfied by the foreclosure sale proceeds.

In defense, the Antoninos admitted obtaining 12 different and independent loans. They argued that Metrobank erred in applying the foreclosure sale proceeds to pay off other loan obligations under Promissory Note Nos. 0996-6664, 0896-6605, and 1096-6835, asserting that the REM was limited to securing only the October 9, 1996 loan. They also claimed that the foreclosure sale proceeds were more than enough to satisfy the October 9, 1996 loan, and that the other loans had been fully settled from the proceeds of the sale of their pledged PCIB shares of stock.

The Antoninos further alleged that Metrobank fraudulently sold their pledged PCIB shares without their written authorization and at a price lower than market value, accusing Metrobank of forging their signatures on the authorization letter used for the sale.

By way of counterclaim, the Antoninos prayed for accounting and reimbursement of the proceeds from the sale of the pledged PCIB shares and other reliefs.","The Regional Trial Court (RTC) limited its ruling to the issue concerning the REM and its application solely to the October 9, 1996 loan, refraining from ruling on the counterclaim regarding the PCIB shares. The RTC denied the Antoninos’ claim for moral and exemplary damages but awarded attorney’s fees.

The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the RTC decision but dismissed the Antoninos’ appeal due to failure to file an appellants’ brief.

The Supreme Court was tasked with resolving whether the REM’s application was limited only to the October 9, 1996 loan.","The Supreme Court held that the REM contract was limited in its application to securing the October 9, 1996 loan only. The Court explained that while the REM contained a dragnet clause intending to cover future obligations, the contract and the promissory notes were contracts of adhesion, limiting the Antoninos’ role to affixing signatures without negotiation.

The Court found that the other loans were secured by the Continuing Pledge Agreement, not the REM, and that Metrobank erroneously applied the foreclosure sale proceeds of the REM to other loan obligations not covered by the REM.

Regarding the imposition of legal interest on the balance of the foreclosure sale proceeds, the Court found Metrobank obligated to return the excess amount with proper interest.

As to the Antoninos’ counterclaim for accounting and reimbursement of the proceeds from the sale of the pledged PCIB shares, the Court ruled that this involved questions of fact beyond its review power in a Rule 45 petition.","The Supreme Court denied the petitions, affirming that the REM was limited to securing only the October 9, 1996 loan. Metrobank erred in applying the foreclosure sale proceeds to other loan obligations not secured by the REM. The Antoninos were entitled to the return of any excess proceeds with legal interest. The Court refrained from ruling on the counterclaim concerning the alleged illegal sale of pledged shares due to factual issues outside its jurisdiction in the present appeal."
"G.R. No. 267580, November 11, 2024","CATALINO E. FAJARDO, GEORGE T. PRUDENCIO, NORBERTO L. GUBIAN, JAYSON R. SANGUYO, GAUDIOSO A. BACSAL, JR., IRENEO L. LOYOLA, DANTON B. NUEVO, JR., JOEY M. CALIMLIM, JUANITO M. SOROSORO, JR., AND JHOEMAR G. FAJARDO, PETITIONERS, VS. SAN MIGUEL FOODS, INC. (B MEG PLANT 1) AND NASARIO SARCEDA, JR., OPERATIONS MANAGER, RESPONDENTS."," Between 2005 and 2006, petitioners Fajardo et al. were engaged by Bataan Mariveles Port Services Corporation as laborers assigned at B-MEG Plant 1 of San Miguel Foods Inc. (SMFI) in Mariveles, Bataan. In 2008, they were absorbed by Hua Tong Far East Inc. but continued their assignments at SMFI's B-MEG Plant 1. On June 18, 2019, SMFI informed Hua Tong it would not renew their business relationship after the agreement's expiration at year-end, leading to the dismissal of Fajardo et al. on December 31, 2019.

On January 19, 2021, Fajardo et al. filed a case for illegal dismissal with the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC), claiming SMFI was their real employer and Hua Tong a labor-only contractor, seeking reinstatement, back wages, regularization, and other claims.

On October 25, 2021, the Labor Arbiter dismissed their complaint, declaring SMFI and Hua Tong engaged in legitimate toll feedmilling excluded from Department Order No. 174 coverage or, alternatively, Hua Tong as a legitimate contractor. The complaint for illegal dismissal was dismissed for lack of employer-employee relationship. However, Hua Tong was ordered to pay separation pay and nominal damages to petitioners. The Labor Arbiter also awarded attorney’s fees and denied other money claims.

Fajardo et al. appealed to the NLRC, which on July 21, 2022, denied the appeal and affirmed the Labor Arbiter's decision. Their motion for reconsideration was denied on September 30, 2022, with receipt on October 11, 2022, starting the 60-day period to file a certiorari petition with the Court of Appeals (CA).

On December 5, 2022, petitioners filed a Motion for Extension of Time to file their petition for certiorari, citing abandonment by their former counsel, Atty. Geneses R. Abot, who failed to prepare the petition despite prior assurances and payment. They sought an additional 30 days until January 10, 2023, to file the petition, which they eventually filed through new counsel on January 10, 2023.

The CA denied the Motion for Extension of Time on January 16, 2023, reasoning petitioners did not exert enough effort to secure new counsel or meet the deadline, resulting in dismissal of their petition. Their Motion for Reconsideration was denied on May 26, 2023.","The Supreme Court granted the petition for certiorari, finding merit in petitioners’ claim that their former counsel abandoned them without notice after receiving payment, constituting a compelling circumstance justifying extension of time. The Court held that strict application of rules should not frustrate justice, especially for minimum wage workers unfamiliar with procedural intricacies who relied in good faith on their counsel. The Court emphasized the balance between speedy disposition and the right to be heard.",The Court reversed and set aside the CA resolutions denying the Motion for Extension of Time and dismissing the petition. The case was reinstated with instructions for the CA to process and resolve the petition with deliberate dispatch. The Court also referred Atty. Geneses R. Abot to the Commission on Bar Discipline for investigation of possible administrative liability for abandonment of clients.,"The petition for review on certiorari was granted. The CA resolutions dated January 16, 2023, and May 26, 2023, were reversed and set aside. The petition for certiorari was reinstated for further proceedings. The Court directed investigation into the former counsel’s alleged abandonment."
"G.R. No. 270870, November 11, 2024","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. XXX270870 AND YYY270870, ACCUSED-APPELLANTS.","The accused-appellants, XXX270870 and YYY270870, along with a John Doe, were charged with four counts of qualified trafficking in persons under Section 4(a), in relation to Section 6(a) of Republic Act No. 9208, as amended by RA No. 10364. The victim, AAA270870, was a minor girl born on January 22, 2002, who was exploited and sexually abused by the accused through a series of incidents starting December 2013 when she was 11 years old.

The prosecution presented testimonies from AAA270870 and her sister BBB270870, including sworn statements and certificates of live birth. The victim recounted four separate incidents where XXX270870 and YYY270870 conspired to recruit, hire, and deliver her to foreign men for sexual exploitation and prostitution for money. The incidents involved taking photographs under false pretenses, delivering AAA270870 to a foreigner named Tom and another named Charles, forcing sexual acts, and making the victim and other children drink a white-colored liquid. The accused derived profits from these acts, and the victim was threatened and instructed not to disclose the abuse.

The defense denied the allegations, with XXX270870 and her daughters testifying that they knew the victim’s family and denied involvement in trafficking or sexual exploitation. YYY270870 also denied knowledge of the charges and the victim.","The trial court found the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of qualified trafficking in persons. The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction and increased the award of moral damages to PHP 500,000.00 with 6% legal interest per annum.","The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, holding that all elements of qualified trafficking were proven. The Court emphasized that the trial court is in the best position to assess witness credibility and that the victim’s behavior and delay in reporting did not diminish her credibility. The Court imposed the penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of PHP 2,000,000.00 on each accused-appellant. All monetary awards shall earn legal interest at 6% per annum from the finality of the decision until full payment.","ACCORDINGLY, the appeal is DISMISSED. The Decision dated October 11, 2021 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 13004 is AFFIRMED."
