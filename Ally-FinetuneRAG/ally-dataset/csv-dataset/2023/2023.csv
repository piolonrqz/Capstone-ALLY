A.C. No. 12878,"TOMAS G. TAN, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. DENNIS C. PANGAN, RESPONDENT.","In June 2013, Tomas G. Tan hired Atty. Dennis C. Pangan as collaborating counsel in Civil Case No. 02-299 before the Regional Trial Court of Makati City, Branch 66. Atty. Pangan assured Tan that he could secure a favorable decision and was paid a professional fee of ₱2,050,000.00, under an agreement that provided a money-back guarantee if the result was unfavorable. On December 5, 2014, the RTC rendered an adverse decision against Tan. In compliance with their agreement, Atty. Pangan issued a check worth ₱2,000,000.00, postdated April 30, 2016, but when Tan presented it for encashment, it was dishonored due to insufficient funds. Despite repeated demands, Atty. Pangan failed to return the money. This prompted Tan to file a criminal case for estafa and an administrative complaint for violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility.

In his defense, Atty. Pangan denied wrongdoing, claiming that he had performed his duties within the bounds of law and that Tan had prematurely terminated his services before he could file an appeal. He argued that he was willing to refund the money but sought to deduct compensation on a quantum meruit basis for the work he had already performed. He also denied receiving the demand letter, claiming it was sent to his old address.","The Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) found that Atty. Pangan’s issuance of a worthless check constituted a violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility, particularly Canon 1 and Rule 1.01, which prohibit unlawful, dishonest, immoral, or deceitful conduct. The IBP initially recommended a two-year suspension, later modified by the IBP Board of Governors to one year. When the case reached the Supreme Court, it affirmed that Atty. Pangan indeed violated his lawyer’s oath and the CPR by engaging in dishonest and immoral conduct. The Court also took judicial notice of his three prior disciplinary offenses within four years, showing a pattern of unethical behavior and disregard for the standards of the legal profession.","The Supreme Court ruled that issuing a bouncing check is an act of gross misconduct that reflects a lack of honesty, moral integrity, and fitness to remain in the legal profession. The Court emphasized that a lawyer’s word must be as good as his bond, and conduct that undermines public confidence in lawyers damages the legal system itself. Given his repeated offenses and previous suspensions, the Court found that Atty. Pangan had shown an unrepentant disregard for the ethical standards of his profession. The Court thus held that he had forfeited his privilege to practice law and must face the ultimate penalty of disbarment.

Additionally, the Court ordered Atty. Pangan to return the ₱2,050,000.00 he had received from Tan as part of his professional engagement, with 6% interest per annum from the finality of the decision until full payment. The Court explained that the amount was intrinsically linked to his professional services, and restitution was within the Court’s disciplinary authority.","Atty. Dennis C. Pangan was found GUILTY of grave misconduct and violation of the Lawyer’s Oath and the Code of Professional Responsibility. He was DISBARRED and his name was ordered stricken from the Roll of Attorneys. He was also directed to return ₱2,050,000.00 to complainant Tomas G. Tan, with 6% annual interest from the finality of judgment until full payment, and to submit proof of payment within ten days after settlement."
A.C. No. 13132,"TEODORA ALTOBANO-RUIZ, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTYS. WILFREDO A. RUIZ, CHERRY ANNE DELA CRUZ, AND FRANCISCO S. BENEDICTO, III, RESPONDENTS.","Complainant Teodora Altobano-Ruiz filed a disbarment complaint before the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP)–Commission on Bar Discipline (CBD) against Attys. Wilfredo A. Ruiz, Cherry Anne Dela Cruz, and Francisco S. Benedicto III, alleging multiple violations of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR). She accused the respondents of conspiring to harass her through various legal and personal acts.

Complainant narrated that she filed a case for violation of Republic Act No. 9262 (Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act) against her husband, Atty. Wilfredo Ruiz, and secured a Permanent Protection Order (PPO) from the Regional Trial Court (RTC) Branch 162 of Pasig City on September 10, 2008. The PPO prohibited Atty. Ruiz from committing further acts of violence, harassment, or communication with her and their children, excluded him from their residence, granted custody of their minor child to her, and directed him to provide 50% of his income as financial support. Despite the PPO becoming final and executory on March 4, 2013, and a writ of execution issued on February 27, 2015, Atty. Ruiz allegedly refused to provide support and attempted to conceal his assets through a “Memorandum of Agreement with Undertaking (MAU)” executed with his mistress, Radelia C. Sy, to place his properties under another person’s name and exclude his son from any financial share.

Complainant also alleged that her former lawyer, Atty. Cherry Anne Dela Cruz, mishandled her cases, including the Anti-VAWC case, the petition for nullity of marriage filed by Atty. Ruiz, and an estafa case against her. She claimed that Atty. Dela Cruz colluded with Atty. Ruiz and failed to enforce the PPO or file necessary pleadings, thus compromising her interests. Furthermore, Atty. Francisco S. Benedicto III, a colleague and later law partner of Atty. Ruiz, was said to have aided in these acts by helping Atty. Ruiz evade legal responsibility and conceal his whereabouts.

In defense, Atty. Wilfredo Ruiz argued that the disbarment complaint was a form of harassment and retaliation for the adultery cases he filed against complainant. He admitted that he did not provide support but justified his actions by claiming that the complainant was unfaithful and that their child, Jarren, was not his biological son. He insisted that his refusal to provide support was lawful and that the PPO should have already been revoked since the complainant allegedly failed to have it executed in time.

Atty. Cherry Anne Dela Cruz, for her part, denied all accusations, calling them baseless and malicious. She maintained that she properly handled the Anti-VAWC case, even obtaining a favorable judgment for the complainant. She clarified that her attorney-client relationship ended in 2008 and that she was never officially engaged for the later cases, including the estafa charge.

Meanwhile, Atty. Francisco Benedicto III denied any wrongdoing, emphasizing that he merely acted as counsel for Atty. Ruiz in a professional capacity and did not engage in any deceptive or unethical act.

After investigation, the IBP–CBD, through Commissioner Juan Orendain P. Buted, recommended the disbarment of Atty. Ruiz for willfully disobeying the lawful orders of the court and violating several provisions of the CPR. The Commission found that Atty. Ruiz refused to provide court-ordered support, used false addresses to evade execution, and cohabited with another woman while concealing assets through the MAU. His conduct was deemed dishonest, deceitful, and immoral, rendering him unfit to practice law.

As for Atty. Dela Cruz and Atty. Benedicto, the Commission found no substantial evidence of conspiracy or misconduct, concluding that they merely performed their legal duties. Accordingly, it recommended that the complaint against them be dismissed.

The IBP Board of Governors (BOG) initially adopted the findings and affirmed the disbarment of Atty. Ruiz in December 2018. However, upon his motion for reconsideration, Atty. Ruiz claimed that the MAU was fabricated and that he had already reconciled with the complainant, even presenting a motion to revoke the PPO filed by her in 2018, indicating that he was once again providing financial support.

Considering this, the IBP-BOG issued an Extended Resolution on October 3, 2020, modifying the penalty from disbarment to one (1) year suspension. The Board recognized that while Atty. Ruiz’s conduct was wrongful, his eventual compliance and the complainant’s motion to revoke the PPO justified a lesser penalty. The Board nonetheless maintained that he had indeed engaged in deceitful behavior and moral misconduct, though not grave enough to merit disbarment.

Ultimately, the findings of the IBP and the defenses of the respondents became the basis for the Supreme Court’s final decision disbarring Atty. Wilfredo Ruiz while clearing Attys. Dela Cruz and Benedicto III of liability.","In this administrative case, the Supreme Court found that respondent Atty. Wilfredo A. Ruiz had violated multiple provisions of the Code of Professional Responsibility due to his willful refusal to provide financial support to his wife, complainant Teodora Altobano-Ruiz, and their children, despite a final and executory Permanent Protection Order (PPO) issued by the Regional Trial Court. The Court noted that Atty. Ruiz not only failed to comply with the lawful court orders but also attempted to conceal his assets and income by entering into an immoral and illegal “Memorandum of Agreement with Undertaking” with his mistress, Radelia C. Sy, to place his properties under another person’s name and deliberately exclude his minor child from financial support. His acts showed a deliberate intent to evade the law and moral depravity inconsistent with the integrity expected of a lawyer.

The Court emphasized that membership in the Philippine Bar is a privilege, not a right, and that lawyers are bound to maintain good moral character and respect for the rule of law at all times. A lawyer who disobeys court orders and engages in deceitful acts to frustrate justice demonstrates unfitness to remain in the legal profession. Consequently, the Supreme Court ruled that Atty. Wilfredo A. Ruiz be DISBARRED and ordered that his name be stricken from the Roll of Attorneys.

Meanwhile, the complaints against Atty. Cherry Anne Dela Cruz and Atty. Francisco S. Benedicto III were dismissed for lack of sufficient evidence. The Court found that the complainant failed to prove that these two respondents had conspired with Atty. Ruiz or committed any act constituting gross misconduct or violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility.

In summary, the Supreme Court disbarred Atty. Ruiz for his grave misconduct, moral unfitness, and disobedience of lawful court orders, while clearing Atty. Dela Cruz and Atty. Benedicto III of administrative liability.","Membership in the Bar is a privilege burdened with conditions. As a privilege bestowed by law through the Supreme Court, membership in the Bar can be withdrawn where circumstances concretely show the lawyer's lack of essential qualifications required of them,[68] including good moral character.

Indeed, good moral character is not only a condition precedent for admission to the legal profession, but it must also remain intact to maintain one's good standing in this exclusive and honored fraternity. There is perhaps no profession after that of the sacred ministry in which a high-toned morality is more imperative than that of law.[69]

A high sense of morality, honesty, and fair dealing is expected and required of members of the Bar. They must conduct themselves with great propriety, and their behavior must be beyond reproach anywhere and at all times.[70] The Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR), which respondent vowed to uphold, clearly affirms this kind of conduct.[71]

Here, complainant accused respondents of conniving through their synchronized acts of harassment which supposedly prejudiced her and her child. These acts mainly consisted of hiding the whereabouts of Atty. Ruiz so he could continuously evade giving support to their child and maintain his illicit affair. She therefore charged them with violations of the CPR, viz.:

Rule 1.01 - A lawyer shall not engage in unlawful, dishonest, immoral or deceitful conduct.

Rule 1.02 - A lawyer shall not counsel or abet activities aimed at defiance of the law or at lessening confidence in the legal system.

Rule 19.01 - A lawyer shall employ only fair and honest means to attain the lawful objectives of his client and shall not present, participate in presenting or threaten to present unfounded criminal charges to obtain an improper advantage in any case or proceeding.

In disbarment proceedings, the complainant bears the burden of proof to satisfactorily prove the allegations in his or her complaint. The quantum of proof necessary for a finding of guilt is substantial evidence, i.e., that amount of relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. The basic rule is that mere allegation is not evidence and is not equivalent to proof. Charges based on mere suspicion and speculation likewise cannot be given credence.[72]

Here, complainant alleged conspiracy among respondents for their so called synchronized acts of harassment, but Investigating Commissioner Buted opined that complainant failed to establish the same by substantial evidence. According to him, Atty. Dela Cruz merely performed her duty as complainant's counsel, while Atty. Benedicto, too, simply acted as counsel for Atty. Ruiz in their respective cases.

Going now to Atty. Ruiz, he was charged with violation of the CPR for committing these acts: (1) he methodically provided false addresses to evade service of court processes, having used five (5) different addresses throughout the proceedings where he was not found in any of them;[73] (2) he executed a MAU with his alleged mistress Radelia with the intention of placing his earnings beyond complainant's reach – an arrangement obviously intended to deprive Jarren of his right to receive support from his father;[74] and (3) he refused to provide support for complainant and their child Jarren, which should have been given as soon as the trial court's ruling had become final.[75]

The IBP Investigating Commissioner recommended his disbarment which the IBP-BOG initially adopted. The IBP-BOG, however, later modified its recommendation by reducing the penalty to one (1) year suspension. It accepted his defense that he had not been defiant of the trial court's orders since the trial court itself even lifted the PPO issued against him.

We agree with the Investigating Commissioner and the IBP-BOG's factual findings and initial recommendation of the disbarment of Atty. Ruiz. We also agree that there was no conspiracy among respondents, for complainant merely alleged the same without providing sufficient evidence of the same weight and substance.

Atty. Ruiz committed multiple immoral, deceitful, and dishonest acts.
The facts pertaining to the Permanent Protection Order (PPO) issued by the trial court and the obligation of Atty. Ruiz to give support to his minor child Jarren are borne in G.R. No. 231619 entitled Wilfredo A. Ruiz v. AAA (November 15, 2021), thus:

AAA applied for a protection order against her husband, Wilfredo Ruiz (Wilfredo), alleging physical, emotional, and economic abuse committed against her during their marriage.

On September 10, 2008, the Regional Trial Court granted AAA a Permanent Protection Order.

x x x x

As Wilfredo no longer appealed this Decision, it became final and executory on January 30, 2013.

On July 16, 2013, AAA filed a Motion for Execution on Support (Motion for Execution), alleging that Wilfredo still has not complied with the portion of the Permanent Protection Order pertaining to support despite the Decision being final and executory.

Wilfredo opposed this, arguing that the Permanent Protection Order has already been revoked by operation of law. He claimed that AAA no longer needed protection as she was already cohabiting with another man. He added that a petition to nullify their marriage was already pending.

On April 22, 2014, the Regional Trial Court issued an Order granting AAA's Motion for Execution and maintaining that the Permanent Protection Order shall be in force and effect.

x x x x

On February 27, 2015, the Regional Trial Court issued a Writ of Execution.

Wilfredo moved to stay or quash the Writ, but the Regional Trial Court denied this and even his subsequent Motion for Reconsideration.

In its October 3, 2016 Decision, the Court of Appeals affirmed the Regional Trial Court's ruling. It first ruled that AAA's Motion for Execution was timely filed within the five-year period under Rule 39, Section 6 of the Rules of Court. As Wilfredo did not deny failing to provide support after the Permanent Protection Order had already been issued, the Court of Appeals found that he may not ignore the Writ of Execution. (Emphasis supplied)

The Court thus made the following ruling relevant to the obligation of Atty. Ruiz to give support to the child:

Final and executory judgments are immutable and unalterable. They may no longer be amended by any court even to correct errors of law or fact. The doctrine of immutability of judgment ensures that all judicial controversies are determined with finality and shall not go on indefinitely.

x x x x

This Court notes that most of the reliefs granted under the Permanent Protection Order does not depend on whether a marriage between petitioner and respondent subsists. Respondent may still be entitled to the other reliefs even if she is no longer petitioner's wife, because the determining factor in the grant of the relief is whether the offended party was subjected to physical, sexual, psychological, or economic abuse. Thus, under Section 16 of Republic Act No. 9262, even if the charge against a respondent has been dismissed, a permanent protection order shall still be granted ""as long as there is no clear showing that the act from which the order might arise did not exist."" It also does not depend on the subsistence of a marriage between the parties.

x x x x

Respondent likewise alleged that petitioner filed the adultery case against her and continues to work with his mistress to harass her. This allegation presents the possibility that, contrary to petitioner's contention, the harm he committed against respondent has not ceased. x x x

x x x x

Thus, it cannot be assumed that respondent is already living in peace and free from the infliction of harm against her.

In any case, the adultery case filed against respondent does not affect her entitlement to the reliefs, especially since she has not been found guilty of the crime charged.

Furthermore, the grant of support in the Permanent Protection Order pertains to respondent and her children with petitioner. Thus, while petitioner is no longer obligated to legally support respondent because their marriage was nullified, his obligation to provide support to his minor child CCC does not cease even if care and custody are no longer with respondent. Neither does it depend on petitioner's relationship with respondent.

x x x x

Thus, as their father, petitioner still has the obligation to support CCC and even their other child [BBB], if still studying and unemployed.

WHEREFORE, the Petition is PARTIALLY GRANTED. The October 3, 2016 Decision and May 23, 2017 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 143344 is MODIFIED. The Writ of Execution issued by the Regional Trial Court on February 27, 2015 shall remain VALID as to all reliefs granted under the Permanent Protection Order, except as to the grant of legal support in favor of respondent AAA.

Respondent shall no longer be entitled to legal support from the time of the finality of the Decision declaring her marriage with petitioner void.

Petitioner shall likewise be liable for 6% interest for any delinquent support from the time of the issuance of the Permanent Protection Order, in accordance with Nacar v. Gallery Frames.

SO ORDERED. (Emphases and underscoring supplied; citations omitted)","The decision of the Supreme Court in Altobano-Ruiz v. Ruiz (A.C. No. 12229, June 26, 2023) is that Atty. Wilfredo A. Ruiz was found guilty of multiple violations of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR) — specifically for economic and emotional abuse, gross immorality, deceit, and misuse of court processes — and was therefore DISBARRED from the practice of law.

The Court ruled that Atty. Ruiz:

Committed economic abuse by refusing to provide financial support to his legitimate child despite a standing Permanent Protection Order (PPO) and several court directives.

Engaged in immoral conduct by maintaining an extramarital affair with his mistress, Radelia, and entering into an illegal “Memorandum of Agreement of Understanding” that deprived his legitimate child of support.

Abused legal processes by repeatedly using fake addresses to evade service of court orders and delay execution for eight years.

Violated multiple rules of the CPR, namely:

Rules 1.01, 1.02, and 7.03 – for committing economic and emotional abuse and immoral conduct;

Rules 10.01 and 10.03 – for deceit, falsehood, and misuse of legal knowledge to evade justice;

Rule 12.04 – for unduly delaying execution and abusing court processes.

As a result, the Supreme Court ordered his disbarment and directed that his name be stricken off the Roll of Attorneys.

Meanwhile, the complaints against Attys. Cherry Anne Dela Cruz and Francisco S. Benedicto III were dismissed for lack of merit, as they were merely performing their professional duties as counsel and were not proven to have participated in any wrongdoing."
A.M. No. P-21-027 (Formerly OCA-IPI No. 17-4769-P),"PRESIDING JUDGE LORNA B. SANTIAGO-AVILA, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, BRANCH 36, GENERAL SANTOS CITY, SOUTH COTABATO, COMPLAINANT, VS. JUANITO B. NARISMA, JR. PROCESS SERVER, RTC BRANCH 36, GENERAL SANTOS CITY, SOUTH COTABATO, RESPONDENT.","The Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) received an Investigation and Recommendation[1] from Executive Judge Adelbert S. Santillan (Judge Santillan) detailing his findings and submissions after conducting a formal investigation on the Administrative Complaint[2] filed by Honorable Lorna B. Santiago-Avila (Judge Santiago-Avila), Presiding Judge of Branch 36, Regional Trial Court (RTC) of General Santos City, South Cotabato against Juanita B. Narisma, Jr. (Narisma), Process Server of the same court.
Facts

On July 6, 2017, then Court Stenographer Nenita Paderes (Paderes) reported to Judge Santiago-Avila that a certain Eddie Cantoja[3] (Cantoja) was pretending to be the latter's long-time driver, and was extorting money from court litigants with the help of a court insider. The complainant was a certain Shirley Chan[4] (Shirley) whose daughter, Christine Madison Chan (Christine), had a pending petition for bail before the RTC. Although initially hesitant to divulge the court insider, Paderes eventually named Narisma who is also known as ""Jun"".[5]

The following day, Shirley met with Judge Santiago-Avila at the courtroom and the latter was surprised when the former revealed that sometime in November 2016, Cantoja introduced himself as Judge Santiago-Avila's driver and bodyguard. In fact, Cantoja assured Shirley that he can help process a favorable resolution for her daughter, who has a pending petition for bail with the assistance of a certain Jun. In turn, the person named Jun, who turned out to be Narisma, committed to talk to Judge Santiago-Avila for the release of the affirmative resolution within the month.[6]

In view of Shirley's disclosure, Judge Santiago-Avila recalled that in the second week of November 2016, Narisma went to her chambers and asked if Christine, who was then in detention, can be released within the month, alleging that Christine's family was hoping for an early discharge. Judge Santiago-Avila simply replied that the bail hearings were still on-going. Then again, in December 2016, Narisma made a similar query to Judge Santiago-Avila who gave him the same reply.[7]

As narrated by Judge Santiago-Avila, in one of the bail hearings, Shirley recounted that Narisma accosted and warned her not to enter the courtroom as he will personally facilitate Christine's release. She just needed to wait for Cantoja's call. Not long after, Cantoja called and informed her that Judge Santiago-Avila was demanding PHP 200,000.00 in exchange of an affirmative court resolution.[8]

Eventually, on June 9, 2017, the RTC issued a Resolution[9] granting Christine's petition for bail. However, Shirley's misery was only made worse when Cantoja made incessant demands for the payment of PHP 200,000.00 and, should she fail, Christine will be detained again as Cantoja and Narisma were allegedly in contact with Judge Santiago-Avila.[10]

Surprised by Shirley's revelations, Judge Santiago-Avila had her accompanied to the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI). There, an entrapment operation against Cantoja and his cohorts was planned.[11]

After several attempts, Cantoja was finally arrested on July 12, 2017 upon receipt of the marked money from Shirley.[12] Among those seized from Cantoja was his cellular phone that contained several text messages from mobile number 0943-063-0794, which was verified to belong to Narisma.[13] Subsequently, two criminal informations were filed against Cantoja and Narisma for robbery and for violation of Section 7(d) of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 6713, otherwise known as the ""Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees.""[14]

Consequently, Judge Santiago-Avila issued Memorandum Order No. 2017-13 dated July 18, 2017, temporarily relieving Narisma of his duties as process server pending the criminal investigation against the latter.[15]

On September 29, 2017, criminal informations were filed against Narisma and Cantoja for robbery and violation of R.A. No. 6713.

Corollary, Judge Santiago-Avila also instituted an administrative complaint[16] for grave misconduct against Narisma and requested that if the charges against the latter were to be investigated, the same be referred to a judge whose jurisdiction was outside General Santos City to deter Narisma from seeking succor to judges whom he claimed to be closely acquainted with.

In the 1st Indorsement[17] issued by the OCA, it directed Narisma to file his Comment on the complaint.

In his Comment,[18] Narisma denied the accusations against him and claimed that he was merely a process server and was not in a position to influence anyone to expedite the resolution and disposition of cases, much more demand money in exchange for it. Narisma divulged that Shirley was currently incarcerated for drugs violation and Christine was even back in jail for her involvement in another drug-related transaction.

Narisma added that he had been in government service for 25 years and had not been charged of any administrative complaint. Thus, he prayed for a quick resolution of the present administrative matter because his salary had been put on hold since May 2018.

Subsequently, the Court issued a Resolution[19] which referred the matter to the Executive Judge of the RTC of Polomolok, South Cotabato, for investigation, report, and recommendation.

In his Report and Recommendation,[20] Judge Santillan made the following observation:

In fine, more than sufficient evidence inexorably linked Narisma to Cantoja in the shakedown of [Shirley]. His actuations constitute grave misconduct when he abused his position as process server by conniving with Cantoja in compelling [Shirley] to cough up Php200,000.00 in exchange for a favorable resolution on Madison's petition for bail. Indeed, as the text messages proved, Narisma gave the impression not only to [Shirley] but to other detainees that court resolutions and orders can be bought for a price. Worse, it was made to believe that Judge Santiago-Avila was asking for the amount. This is an unforgivable transgression that undermines people's faith in the judiciary.[21]

Subsequent thereto, this Court issued a Resolution,[22] which recommended to redocket the case as a regular administrative matter. The case was thereafter referred to the Judicial Integrity Board (JIB), which had jurisdiction to act, among others, over complaints for violation of Code of Conduct for Court Personnel and Civil Service rules against court personnel and employees.

In its Report,[23] the JIB agreed with the findings of Judge Santillan upon making the following evaluation:

In this case, respondent's misconduct was substantially proven after the investigation conducted by Judge Santillan; the arrest of Cantoja through the entrapment operation of the NBI and the evidence obtained thereat; and the subsequent filing of criminal informations for robbery and violation of R.A. No. 6713 involving respondent. Moreover, respondent's misconduct was clearly attended by a corrupt purpose, which, as an element of grave misconduct, consists in the act of an official or fiduciary person who unlawfully and wrongfully uses his station or character to procure some benefit for himself or for another person, contrary to duty and the rights of others.

x x x x

At the outset, it should be stressed that respondent's administrative liability is based on his collusion with Cantoja in extorting money from Shirley in exchange for a favorable resolution on Madison's petition for bail. Thus, it is irrelevant whether or not he has the ability to influence a judge. In fact, Judge Santillan's investigation actually supports respondent's claim, i.e., that he did not influence complainant in granting Madison's petition for bail. It appears that respondent used his familiarity with complainant to get an inside track on how she would rule on Madison's petition for bail. He then uses his position and knowledge of court processes to maximize the use of that information by colluding with Cantoja in inducing Shirley to pay P200,000.00 in exchange for Madison's release on bail. Indeed, while respondent could not have influenced complainant to rule in favor of Madison, he used her name to make it appear that she herself was asking for the money. Moreover, Judge Santillan also found that the extortion attempt on Shirley may not have been an isolated incident as the established communications between respondent and Cantoja showed that there are other cases where they continued with their extortion activities.

x x x x

While it is true that as a rule, respondent's alleged twenty-five (25) years of unblemished service may be considered as a mitigating circumstance in his favor under Section (19)(1)(b) of Rule 140, as further amended by A.M. No. 21-08-09-SC, the Board finds that it is offset by the fact that he took advantage of his familiarity with court processes and his official relations with complainant, being the court's process server, which facilitated the commission of the offense and therefore, the same should be considered as an aggravating circumstance under Section 19(2)(b) thereof.[24]","The Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) received an Investigation and Recommendation[1] from Executive Judge Adelbert S. Santillan (Judge Santillan) detailing his findings and submissions after conducting a formal investigation on the Administrative Complaint[2] filed by Honorable Lorna B. Santiago-Avila (Judge Santiago-Avila), Presiding Judge of Branch 36, Regional Trial Court (RTC) of General Santos City, South Cotabato against Juanita B. Narisma, Jr. (Narisma), Process Server of the same court.","The findings and recommendation of the JIB are well-taken. Firstly, it is worthy to emphasize that Narisma's separation from service brought about by his absences without leave and his subsequent dropping from the rolls did not render this administrative case moot and academic. As explained in Pagano v. Nazarro, Jr.,[25] a case becomes moot and academic only when there is no more actual controversy between the parties or no useful purpose can be served in passing upon the merits of the case. Even if the most severe of administrative sanctions—that of separation from the service—may no longer be imposed on the erring employee, there are other penalties which may be imposed on him/her if he/she is later found guilty of administrative offenses charged against him/her, namely, the disqualification to hold any government office and the forfeiture of benefits.[26]

Following this perspective, we shall now deal with Narisma's administrative liability.

In Dela Rama v. Patricia D. De Leon,[27] this Court defined misconduct as a transgression of some established and definite rule of action, more particularly, unlawful behavior or gross negligence by a public officer or employee. To warrant dismissal from the service, the conduct must be so grave, serious, important, weighty, momentous, and not trifling. The misconduct must imply wrongful intention and not mere error of judgment.[28]

In administrative cases, only substantial evidence is required—or that amount of relevant evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion—to bring about a finding of culpability for the offense charged.

In the present case, substantial evidence exists that Narisma attempted to extort money from Shirley under the pretense that he will facilitate the grant of Christine's petition for bail. Narisma's act is a clear violation of Section 2, Canon I and Section 2 (e), Canon III of the Code of Conduct for Court Personnel, which reads as follows:

CANON I
FIDELITY TO DUTY

x x x x
Section 2. Court personnel shall not solicit or accept any gift, favor or benefit based on any or explicit or implicit understanding that such gift, favor or benefit shall influence their official actions.

x x x x

CANON III

Section 2. Court personnel shall not:

x x x x
(e) Solicit or accept any gift, loan, gratuity, discount, favor, hospitality or service under circumstances from which it could reasonably be inferred that a major purpose of the donor is to influence the court personnel in performing official duties.

This Court has consistently held that the act of soliciting and/or receiving money from litigants for personal gain constitutes Grave Misconduct, for which the court employee guilty thereof should be held administratively liable.[29]

In Garciso v. Oca,[30] a process server was the subject of an entrapment operation conducted by the NBI where he solicited the amount of PHP 150,000.00 from a person ""in exchange for the assistance he could extend towards the withdrawal by the [Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency] of its non-existent application for search warrant, or the denial of the non-existent application for search warrant.""[31] This Court ruled that such extortion amounted to grave misconduct[32] and imposed the penalty of dismissal from the service, forfeiture of all benefits except accrued leave credits, with prejudice to reemployment in any branch or instrumentality of the Government.[33]

In Hidalgo v. Magtibay,[34] a process server was likewise charged and found liable of gross misconduct and dismissed from the service for being implicated in an extortion activity uncovered by an entrapment operation, after demanding PHP 2,000.00 from the representative of an insurance company to facilitate the release from detention of a person with a case pending in a different branch of the same trial court.[35] The process server was found to have ordered the representative to hand over money to a jail officer, and then walked away before the representative handed over the money to the jail officer.[36] This Court ruled that the process server had knowledge of the offer of money as the NBI agents witnessed how he asked the representative to hand over the grease money to the jail officer.[37] Verily, this Court, citing the recommendation of the OCA, did not rule out the involvement of a process server in an extortion activity, despite not having ""any authority to deal in matters involving the release of an accused:""

The OCA, in its memorandum dated August 3, 2004, gave its own assessment and recommendation of the case:

x x x x

Although not criminally liable, respondent may be held administratively liable. Administratively, respondent Magtibay is not entirely without fault. He has himself to blame for his implication in the extortion activity of Bienvenido M. Precilla. If indeed, there was intention on his part to assist complainant Hidalgo, he should have referred her to the Branch Clerk of Court of RTC, Branch 6, Tanauan City, and not to Bienvenido Precilla who was merely a jail officer detailed at that branch. Neither he nor accused Precilla has any authority to deal in matters involving the release of an accused. (Emphasis supplied)

x x x x

After a thorough review of the records, we agree with the findings of the OCA[.][38]

All things considered, Narisma's act of asking money from Shirley in exchange of a favorable court issuance show a willful disregard of the rules, for which he should be held accountable for Grave Misconduct.

In Judaya v. Balbona,[39] this Court explained that grave misconduct is classified as a grave offense punishable by dismissal from the service even for the first offense. The penalty of dismissal from the service carries with it the following administrative disabilities: (a) cancellation of civil service eligibility; (b) forfeiture of retirement and other benefits, except accrued leave credits, if any; and (c) perpetual disqualification from reemployment in any government agency or instrumentality, including any government-owned and controlled corporation or government financial institution.[40] Here, since Narisma had been earlier dropped from the rolls, the penalty of dismissal from the service could no longer be imposed. Nevertheless, such penalty should be enforced in its full course by imposing the administrative disabilities upon him.

We wish to emphasize that those belonging in the Judiciary, from the justices down to the lowliest worker, serve as sentinels of justice. Any act of impropriety on their part immeasurably affects the honor and dignity of the Judiciary and the people's confidence in it.[41] The Institution demands the best possible individuals in the service[42] and it had never and will never tolerate nor condone any conduct which would violate the norms of public accountability, and diminish, or even tend to diminish, the faith of the people in the justice system.[43] This Court will not hesitate to rid its ranks of undesirables who undermine its efforts towards an effective and efficient administration of justice, thus tainting its image in the eyes of the public.[44]","WHEREFORE, Juanito B. Narisma, Jr., former Process Server of Branch 36, Regional Trial Court of General Santos City, South Cotabato, is GUILTY of Grave Misconduct and would have been DISMISSED from the service, had he not been earlier dropped from the rolls. Accordingly, his civil service eligibility is hereby CANCELLED, his retirement and other benefits, except accrued leave credits, are FORFEITED, and he is PERPETUALLY DISQUALIFIED from reemployment in any government agency or instrumentality, including any government-owned and controlled corporation or government financial institution.

A.C. No. 10612 (Formerly CBD Case No. 17-5384),"ATTY. NORA M. SALUDARES, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. REYNALDO SALUDARES, RESPONDENT","Complainant and respondent were married on February 7, 1987. However, despite being lawfully married, respondent admitted to having an affair with a former classmate in high school.[6] To bolster her accusations, complainant narrated as follows:

(1)	
During a family recollection in April of 2014, respondent allegedly confessed having an affair with a lady friend even before he and complainant got married, and that the affair bore a child which they agreed to have aborted. Upon hearing respondent's confession, complainant retorted that she had suspected the affair all along because of the nights when respondent would leave complainant alone, despite her being pregnant. Complainant further recalled several instances when somebody would call complainant and say ''pahiram ng asawa mo sandali."" According to complainant, respondent did not refute these allegations;[7]
 	


(2)	
In the early part of May 2014, complainant saw a picture of a woman displayed in the wallpaper of respondent's mobile phone. When complainant asked respondent about the woman's identity, respondent replied that the woman is a friend and former classmate in high school whom he reconnected with during their recent homecoming;[8]
 	


(3)	
Complainant found a compilation of profile pictures of the same woman in a separate and exclusive folder in respondent's Facebook feed. The folder includes childhood and travel pictures;
 	


(4)	
Complainant read and saved a copy of a series of text message exchanges between respondent and the same lady friend which indicated that they had likely nurtured an illicit relationship;

(5)	
When complainant confronted respondent about the series of messages, respondent admitted in front of their children that the woman is his girlfriend, and even quipped ""disente"" and ""maraming pera 'yon.""[14]
 	


(6)	
During one confrontation, respondent showed no remorse for his actions, and treated his extra-marital affair as if it is morally acceptable, and stated ""Ano masama sa ginagawa ko? Maghihiwalay naman tayo;[15]""
 	


(7)	
Respondent offered to clarify his relationship with the woman, stating that, ""She is my girlfriend, she is not my mistress. There is no mistress for me;""[16]
 	


(8)	
Respondent went to the United States of America to allegedly visit his friend and same woman on July 3 to 18, 2014. On August 8, 2014, complainant found posted on Facebook pictures of respondent and the woman smiling closely beside each other,[17] respondent with his arm wrapped around the woman's shoulder, and respondent and the woman holding hands with interlocking fingers.[18]
 	


(9)	
Respondent made it known to complainant that he will move out of their conjugal home in September or October 2014, or as soon as the turn­over of their condominium unit is completed. When complainant told respondent to not bring in prostitutes, respondent replied ""kasama ko [siya] sa condo pag nandito siya sa Pilipinas. She is my new wife.""[19]

Complainant posited that respondent's repeated admissions of infidelity prove that respondent is engaging in grossly immoral acts in violation of the code of ethics of lawyers.[20]

Respondent denied all the allegations of immorality and wrongdoings against him.[21] The exchange of messages between him and his former high school classmate are merely messages between friends and expressions of endearment that were taken out of context.[22]

To counter the accusation of gross immorality against him, respondent narrated that he was once invited to speak during the celebration of Elementary Day. According to respondent, he would not have been invited by the town mayor and school officials if he was perceived to be an immoral person.[23]

On February 24, 2015, complainant filed a motion to withdraw the Complaint because the case has greatly affected their children.[24]

On June 17, 2015, this Court issued a Resolution[25] stating, among others, ""to consider the instant administrative case CLOSED and TERMINATED.""[26]

Subsequently, complainant filed a Motion for Reconsideration praying that the Court set aside the Resolution dated June 17, 2015 terminating the administrative case and to adjudge respondent guilty of gross immorality, or to refer the case to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) for proper investigation and recommendation.[27]

Thus, the Court, on November 28, 2016 issued a Resolution[28] granting complainant's Motion to Re-Open the Case. On April 26, 2017, We referred the case to the IBP for investigation, report and recommendation.

Report and Recommendation of the IBP

On May 24, 2018, the Investigating Commissioner of the Commission on Bar Discipline (IBP-CBD), recommended the termination of the complaint.[29] Noting that the parties executed a Compromise Agreement to settle the civil case between them, and the complainant likewise executed an Affidavit of Desistance seeking the dismissal of the criminal case she filed against herein respondent, and considering the prayer of the parties herein to reinstate the ruling of the Court terminating this disbarment case, which the Investigating Commissioner found to be meritorious, the Investigating Commissioner thus recommended the instant case to be considered closed and terminated.

In a Resolution dated December 15, 2019, the IBP Board of Governors adopted and approved the Report and Recommendation of the Investigating Commissioner to consider the case closed and terminated, finding the same to be fully supported by the evidence on record and the applicable laws and rules, and for failure to substantiate the complaint.[30]","Possession of good moral character is a core qualification for members of the bar.[1] ""It is expected that every lawyer, being an officer of the Court, must not only be in fact of good moral character, but must also be seen to be of good moral character and leading lives in accordance with the highest moral standards of the community.""[2] Time and again this Court has reminded the members of the legal profession that ""one of the qualifications required of a candidate for admission to the bar is the possession of good moral character, and, when one who has already been admitted to the bar clearly shows, by a series of acts, that he[/she] does not follow such moral principles as should govern the conduct of an upright person, x x x it is the duty of the court, as guardian of the interests of society, as well as of the preservation of the ideal standard of professional conduct, to make use of its powers to deprive him[/her] of his professional attributes which he[/she] so unworthily abused.""[3]

This is a disbarment Complaint/Petition[4] filed by Atty. Nora Malubay Saludares (complainant) against her husband, Atty. Reynaldo Lagda Saludares (respondent), accusing the latter of gross immorality.

Complainant charged respondent with gross immorality for allegedly carrying an illicit and immoral relationship notwithstanding their subsisting marriage.[5]","We disagree with the recommendation of the IBP Board of Governors to dismiss the charge of immorality against respondent. There is substantial evidence showing that respondent did have an illicit relationship with his former high school classmate.

This Court notes that the parties have been embroiled in no less five different cases, i.e., (1) Petition for Disbarment before the Court; (2) Civil Case for Declaration of Nullity of Marriage; (3) Administrative Case before the Ombudsman for Gross Immorality; (4) Petition for Issuance of Protection Order; and (5) Criminal Case for the Violation of Republic Act No. 9262, all involving similar, if not identical allegations, of disrespect to the sanctity of marriage amounting to gross immorality.

Telling of the existence of an illicit relationship between respondent and his paramour are their pictures and exchange of messages which illustrate affection towards one another. They referred to one another as ""hon"" or ""Honey;""[31] they exchanged playful ""tsupmm"" conveying kiss sounds to signify giving kisses to each other; they would so casually tell each other ""Miss you,"" ""Miss you too,"" ""Love you, Honey,"" and would even talk about being discreet about their relationship. The veracity of these conversations was backed by the affidavit executed by respondent and complainant's daughter, admitting that she was the one who took pictures of these exchanges.

Respondent even admitted that the woman is his ""girlfriend,"" despite being already married to complainant; he even displayed the woman in his cellphone's wallpaper; and boasted in front of his children that the woman is ""disente"" and ""maraming pera."" Worse, respondent showed no shame nor remorse for his actions, even stating, ""Ano masama sa ginagawa ko? Maghihiwalay naman na tayo"" and ""She is my girlfriend, she is not my mistress."" Evidence has been offered showing that respondent, at some instances, introduced the woman as his ""new wife.""

Administrative cases against members of the legal profession are sui generis, and are not affected by the result of any civil or criminal case.[32] It does not even depend on the existence of a complainant to allow the continuation of the proceedings. The primary objective in disciplinary proceedings against lawyers is public interest. The fundamental inquiry revolves around the finding as to whether the lawyer is still a fit person to be allowed to practice law.[33]

Respondent is liable for violating the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR):
CANON 1

Rule 1.01 – A lawyer shall not engage in unlawful, dishonest, immoral or deceitful conduct.

CANON 7

Rule 7.03 – A lawyer shall not engage in conduct that adversely reflects on his fitness to practice law, nor shall he, whether in public or private life, behave in a scandalous manner to the discredit of the legal profession.
It has been repeatedly held that to justify suspension or disbarment, the act complained of must not only be immoral, but grossly immoral.[34] A grossly immoral act is one the extent of which is so corrupt to constitute a criminal act, or grossly unprincipled as to be reprehensible to a high degree or committed under circumstances so scandalous and revolting as to shock the common sense of decency.[35] An act to be considered grossly immoral shall be willful, flagrant, or shameless, as to show indifference to the opinion of good and respectable members of the community.[36]

Given the foregoing, We find that respondent's intimate relationship with a woman other than his wife, showed his moral indifference to the opinion of the good and respectable members of the community. His actions amount to utter disrespect of the laws on the sanctity of marriage, including his vow of fidelity in his marital relations and affairs. Dishonorable behavior displayed by the respondent warrants disciplinary sanction.

In a line of cases, this Court has emphasized that when the integrity of a member of the bar is challenged, denying the accusations against him/her shall not suffice. He/She must meet the issue and allegations against him/her and over the evidence presented by the opposing party. The party accused of gross immorality shall substantiate his/her plea that he/she has maintained the degree of integrity and morality expected of a member of the bar, at all times.[37] Unfortunately, respondent has utterly failed in this regard.

For these reasons, this Court finds respondent guilty of gross immorality in violation of Canon 1, Rule 1.01 and Canon 7, Rule 7.03 of the CPR. In deciding upon what disciplinary sanction should be imposed against a lawyer found guilty of misconduct, the case of Advincula v. Macabata[38] is instructive:
[x x x] When deciding upon the appropriate sanction, the Court must consider that the primary purposes of disciplinary proceedings are to protect the public; to foster public confidence in the Bar; to preserve the integrity of the profession; and to deter other lawyers from similar misconduct. Disciplinary proceedings are means of protecting the administration of justice by requiring those who carry out this important function to be competent, honorable and reliable men in whom courts and clients may repose confidence. While it is discretionary upon the Court to impose a particular sanction that it may deem proper against an erring lawyer, it should neither be arbitrary and despotic nor motivated by personal animosity or prejudice, but should ever be controlled by the imperative need to scrupulously guard the purity and independence of the bar and to exact from the lawyer strict compliance with his duties to the court, to his client, to his brethren in the profession and to the public.

The power to disbar or suspend ought always to be exercised on the preservative and not on the vindictive principle, with great caution and only for the most weighty reasons and only on clear cases of misconduct which seriously affect the standing and character of the lawyer as an officer of the court and member of the Bar. Only those acts which cause loss of moral character should merit disbarment or suspension, while those acts which neither affect nor erode the moral character of the lawyer should only justify a lesser sanction unless they are of such nature and to such extent as to clearly show the lawyer's unfitness to continue in the practice of law. The dubious character of the act charged as well as the motivation which induced the lawyer to commit it must be clearly demonstrated before suspension or disbarment is meted out. The mitigating or aggravating circumstances that attended the commission of the offense should also be considered.[39] Citations omitted)
The respondent's arrogance and cavalier attitude has not escaped the Court's attention. He unabashedly admitted his illicit affair before his wife and children. He even boasted that his paramour is monied. This only shows that respondent is rotten to the core and no longer deserves to belong to the legal profession.

In line with Panagsagan v. Panagsagan[40] the penalty of disbarment from the practice of law is commensurate under the circumstances.","WHEREFORE, Atty. Reynaldo L. Saludares is found GUILTY of Gross Immorality and is DISBARRED from the practice of law effective upon notice hereof. His name is ordered STRICKEN OFF from the Roll of Attorneys.

Let copies of this Decision be entered in the personal record of Atty. Reynaldo L. Saludares as a member of the Philippine Bar and furnished the Office of the Bar Confidant, the Integrated Bar of the Philippines and the Office of the Court Administrator for circulation to all courts in the country."
 A.C. No. 13615 (Formerly CBD Case No. 11-3166),"JULIEWHYN R. QUINDOZA, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. ERNESTO DAVID DELOS SANTOS* AND ATTY. MARUJITA S. PALABRICA, RESPONDENTS.","Quindoza filed an administrative complaint for disbarment against Atty. Delos Santos and Atty. Palabrica, before the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) Commission on Bar Discipline[4] alleging that she is the common-law wife of Atty. Delos Santos, and that they have a nonmarital child named Veronica. When Atty. Delos Santos started cohabiting with Quindoza, he was legally married to Baltasar. At the same time, Atty. Delos Santos also had another mistress, Fe Delilah (Delilah), with whom he had three nonmarital children. According to Quindoza, Atty. Delos Santos also had a sexual relationship with a woman named Marissa Beroy.[5]

Quindoza argued that Atty. Palabrica was a classmate of Atty. Delos Santos at the San Beda College of Law and that Atty. Palabrica had knowledge of their illicit affair. During Veronica's baptism, Atty. Palabrica stood as one of the sponsors. Quindoza also alleged that Atty. Palabrica consented to the immoral acts of Atty. Delos Santos.[6]

Quindoza further averred that Atty. Palabrica knew that Atty. Delos Santos committed acts of lasciviousness against Veronica. Despite Atty. Palabrica's knowledge, she remained passive on the abuse. According to Quindoza, Atty. Palabrica's passiveness on the abuse is a silent toleration on the abusive act of a fellow lawyer, which is a violation of the Canons of Professional Ethics.[7]

In her Verified Answer,[8] Atty. Palabrica stated that Atty. Delos Santos, who was her classmate, invited her to be one of the sponsors in Veronica's baptism. During Veronica's baptism, it was her first time to meet Quindoza and Veronica. Atty. Palabrica was neither properly introduced nor she had an opportunity to talk to Quindoza. The next time Atty. Palabrica saw Quindoza was during the hearings in the probate of the will of Atty. Delos Santos's deceased father at Branch 49, Regional Trial Court of Manila wherein Atty. Palabrica was Atty. Delos Santos's counsel, being the oppositor in the allowance of the will.[9]

According to Atty. Palabrica, she only knew about Quindoza and Veronica only during Veronica's baptism and that she had no contact with them afterwards. Atty. Palabrica denied that she had knowledge that Atty. Delos Santos committed acts of lasciviousness against Veronica, it being a private matter. Further, she averred that Quindoza should not have waited for two years to tell that the alleged acts of lasciviousness happened in view of the urgency of the matter.[10]

Atty. Palabrica argued that being a sponsor in Veronica's baptism should not be construed as upholding the immoral acts of a fellow lawyer because when she acted as a baptismal sponsor, she was neither acting as a lawyer nor taking advantage of her being a lawyer.[11]

Atty. Palabrica also averred that the complaint against her is founded on malice and bad faith, since it was a consequence of the opposition filed by Atty. Delos Santos in the probate of the will of his father Dr. Virgilio Delos Santos (formerly the chairperson and majority owner of the University of Manila). In the said probate of the will, Emily De Leon (De Leon), President of the University of Manila, and Dr. Ramona Delos Santos (Dr. Ramona), Atty. Delos Santos's sister and Vice-President of the University of Manila, will be benefited by the allowance of the will. Atty. Palabrica was Atty. Delos Santos's counsel in their opposition against the probate of the will, and in the criminal cases filed by De Leon against Atty. Delos Santos.[12]

On the other hand, Atty. Delos Santos denied that Quindoza was his common-law wife. He, however, admitted that he had a daughter, Veronica, with her. He expressed his remorse and had already ended his brief relationship with Quindoza. To make up for his mistakes, Atty. Delos Santos provided love, affection and financial support to Veronica.[13]

Atty. Delos Santos also admitted that a complaint for acts of lasciviousness allegedly committed against Veronica was filed against him in Baguio City. However, this case was dismissed by the Prosecutor's Office for lack of probable cause. According to Atty. Delos Santos, the said criminal case was filed for the purpose of harassing and tarnishing his good name. He further alleged that the motive for filing the disbarment case was to harass him and Atty. Palabrica because of the opposition they filed in the probate of the will of Dr. Virgilio. The beneficiaries, namely, Dr. Ramona and her lover De Leon, filed the petition for probate of the will. Atty. Delos Santos alleged that Quindoza was under De Leon's power because of the monetary allowance she receives from the University of Manila.[14]

On March 20, 2014, Commissioner Eldrid C. Antiquiera issued his Report and Recommendation,[15] which provides:
WHEREFORE PREMISES CONSIDERED, it is respectfully recommended that respondent Atty. Ernesto de los Santos be SUSPENDED from the practice of law for a period of TWO (2) YEARS while DISMISSING the complaint as regards Atty. Palabrica for lack of merit.[16]
On December 13, 2014, the IBP Board of Governors passed Resolution No. XXI-2014-890,[17] the dispositive portion of which provides:
RESOLVED to ADOPT and APPROVE, as it is hereby ADOPTED and APPROVED, with modification, the Report and Recommendation of the Investigating Commissioner in the above-entitled case, herein made part of this Resolution as Annex ""A"", and finding Respondent's act of cohabiting with Fe Delilah while his marriage with Editha is still subsisting, which relationship is adulterous and grossly immoral, in violation of Canon 1, Rule 1.01 of the Code of Professional Responsibility, Atty. Ernesto David Delos Santos is hereby DISBARRED from the practice of law and his name Ordered stricken off from the Roll of Attorneys. However, the case against Atty. Marujita S. Palabrica is DISMISSED for lack of merit.[18] (Emphasis omitted)
Upon Atty. Delos Santos's motion for reconsideration, the IBP Board of Governors issued a Resolution[19] dated November 28, 2017, which states:
RESOLVED to PARTIALLY GRANT the Respondent's Motion for Reconsideration by reducing the recommendation of Disbarment to SUSPENSION from the practice of law for five (5) years considering that: (1) the timeline of twenty three (23) years before this administrative complaint was filed (2) first marriage may had been legal but it was a non­-existent marriage (3) complainant and respondent's child was fully taken care of by Respondent (4) for humanitarian consideration considering the age of respondent, and; (5) respondent was remorseful for his actions.

RESOLVED FURTHER to direct the Commission to prepare an extended resolution explaining the Board of Governors' action.[20] (Emphasis omitted)
Subsequently, the IBP Board of Governor's Resolution and case records were forwarded to this Court.

The Code of Professional Responsibility requires all lawyers to possess good moral character from the time of their application for admission to the Bar, during and until their retirement from the practice of law.[21] In this regard, Canon 1, Rule 1.01, and Canon 7 and Rule 7.03 of the Code of Professional Responsibility state:
CANON 1 — A lawyer shall uphold the constitution, obey the laws of the land and promote respect for law and for legal processes.","For this Court's resolution is the Complaint[1] filed by Juliewhyn R. Quindoza (Quindoza) against Atty. Ernesto David Delos Santos (Atty. Delos Santos) and Atty. Marujita S. Palabrica (Atty. Palabrica) for violation of the Canons of Professional Ethics. With respect to Atty. Delos Santos, Quindoza averred that Atty. Delos Santos had an illicit relationship with her while he was legally married to Edita Baltasar (Baltasar). Further, Quindoza alleged that Atty. Delos Santos committed acts of lasciviousness against their daughter, Mergarett Veronica Delos Santos (Veronica).[2] Meanwhile, Atty. Palabrica was administratively charged for violation of the Canons of Professional Ethics because (1) she stood as godmother to Veronica during her baptism, despite knowing that Veronica is the nonmarital child of Quindoza and Atty. Delos Santos; (2) she knew of Quindoza and Atty.

A.C. No. 13504,"MARIA CRISTINA G. DAYOS, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. GRACE C. BURI, RESPONDENT","The complaint for disbarment was filed by Maria Cristina G. Dayos, as Corporate Secretary of GB Global Exprez, Inc. (GB Global), against Atty. Grace C. Buri. GB Global hired Atty. Buri to represent the company in a labor case. On January 3, 2018, Atty. Buri personally received P135,501.00 from GB Global to be posted as the company's appeal cash bond, and she assured the client that she was preparing the appeal. However, Atty. Buri failed to file the appeal within the reglementary period, causing the adverse labor decision to lapse into finality on February 9, 2018. Furthermore, she ignored the client's demands for copies of the pleadings and failed to account for or return the money intended for the bond, despite having received additional advances of P625,000.00 from the company. Although Atty. Buri eventually paid her full monetary obligation of P760,501.00 to GB Global approximately three years later, causing the company to lose interest in pursuing the case, the Supreme Court, recognizing that disbarment cases are sui generis (not purely civil or criminal), proceeded to resolve the case on its merits. Notably, Atty. Buri failed to attend any of the mandatory conferences or file any responsive pleadings before the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) despite numerous notices, showing continuous disrespect for the disciplinary process.","The Supreme Court adopted the findings of the IBP, concluding that Atty. Buri was liable for multiple violations of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR). Specifically, she violated: Rule 16.01 of Canon 16 for failing to account for the money received; Rule 1.01 of Canon 1 for dishonest and deceitful conduct; and Canon 17 and Rule 18.04 of Canon 18 for failing to pursue the appeal diligently and keep her client informed, resulting in the finality of the adverse labor decision. The Court emphasized that her failure to return the client's money upon demand gave rise to the presumption of misappropriation. Crucially, the Court treated Atty. Buri's current infraction as her third administrative offense, noting she had been previously suspended for one year and two years, respectively, in prior cases (Yap v. Atty. Buri and Go v. Atty. Buri), which were considered aggravating circumstances showing a clear penchant for violating the CPR and ignoring the Court's previous warnings. Given her repeated and brazen disregard for her duties and the lack of probity, the Court deemed disbarment appropriate.","Atty. Grace C. Buri is DISBARRED from the practice of law, and her name is ORDERED stricken off from the Roll of Attorneys, effective immediately. She is also meted a FINE in the amount of P10,000.00 for her disobedience to the orders of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines.","Atty. Grace C. Buri is found GUILTY of violating Canons 17 and 18, and Rules 1.01, 16.01, 18.03, and 18.04 of the Code of Professional Responsibility."

Dela Rosa as counsel and signatory for transactions. Complainant alleged that she was surprised to learn in 2008 that Atty. Dela Rosa had sold the awarded properties to an undisclosed buyer for a low price, and that the sale proceeds were released to a third party despite her refusal to sign any document or accept the money. She also noted that Atty. Dela Rosa deposited the full settlement amount (P30,000,000.00) in his personal bank account, earning interest, while paying the beneficiaries on an installment basis. Atty. Dela Rosa countered that Wilson had already conveyed his rights to the land to a third party, Eugene Gamolo, via a Deed of Sale of Acquired Rights and an Affidavit of Waiver and Quitclaim in 1992, prior to his death, and that he was authorized to sell the land by the cooperative's by-laws.","The Supreme Court found that Atty. Dela Rosa violated the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR) when he failed to inform his client (the cooperative members, including the complainant's interest) of the sale and resorted to a ""nefarious scheme to circumvent the law"" by using his legal knowledge to protect the interests of an undisclosed buyer. He was found to have acted with double-dealing and advocacy of interests hostile to his clients, in violation of Canons 15, 17, and 18 (regarding candor, fidelity, and diligence). Furthermore, he violated Rules 16.01 and 16.02 of Canon 16 by failing to account for the money and by having sole access to the cooperative's bank account where the large sum of money from the sale was deposited, thus failing to keep client funds separate from his own. The Court took judicial notice that the respondent employed the very same scheme and committed the very same acts that led to his prior disbarment in the case of Palalan Carp Farmers Multi-Purpose Coop v. Dela Rosa.","Since Atty. Dela Rosa had already been disbarred in a prior case involving the same facts, and given that there is no concept of ""double or multiple disbarment,"" the Court applied the precedent of imposing a fine. Accordingly, a FINE of PHP 100,000.00 is imposed on Atty. Elmer Dela Rosa for his gross misconduct. The Court further resolved to foreclose any opportunity for judicial clemency in favor of the respondent due to the gravity of his continued serious infractions.","Atty. Elmer Dela Rosa is found GUILTY of gross misconduct and for violating Canons 15, 16, 17, and 18, and Rules 15.01, 15.03, 16.01, and 16.02 of the Code of Professional Responsibility."
G.R. Nos. 255470-71,"COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, PETITIONER, VS. CARGILL PHILIPPINES, INC., RESPONDENT","Cargill Philippines, Inc. (Cargill), a VAT-registered corporation engaged in zero-rated export sales of coconut oil, filed two administrative and judicial claims for the refund of unutilized input VAT. The first claim (covering April 2001 to February 2003) was filed judicially on June 30, 2003, only three days after the administrative claim. The second claim (covering March 2003 to August 2004) was filed both administratively and judicially on May 31, 2005. The CTA initially dismissed both claims as premature, citing the mandatory 120-day waiting period established in the Aichi ruling. Upon recourse to the Supreme Court, the high court differentiated the two claims based on the BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 exception (the San Roque doctrine), which waived the 120-day period during the window from December 10, 2003, to October 6, 2010. Consequently, the SC dismissed the first claim as premature (filed before the window), but remanded the second claim for resolution on the merits (filed during the window). After remand, the CTA Division partially granted the second claim for PHP 1,779,377.16. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) then challenged this partial award, arguing that the law requires the input VAT to be directly attributable to the zero-rated sales.","The Supreme Court DENIED the CIR's petition, affirming the CTA En Banc's decision to uphold the partial refund awarded to Cargill. The Court held that the CIR's main argument—that the input VAT must be ""directly attributable"" to the finished product—was legally unsound. Citing Section 112(A) of the Tax Code and relevant revenue regulations, the Court clarified that the law only requires that the input tax be attributable to the zero-rated sales. Since the legal requirement for input VAT to be ""directly and entirely attributable"" to the zero-rated sales was not retained in later regulations (like Revenue Regulations No. 16-2005), the CIR was ""clutching at straws."" Finding no reversible error in the CTA's factual determination and legal interpretation, the Court sustained the reduced refund amount.","The Petition for Review on Certiorari filed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue is hereby DENIED. The Decision dated June 30, 2020 and the Resolution dated January 28, 2021 of the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc, in the consolidated cases CTA EB Nos. 1986 and 2001, are AFFIRMED.","The Supreme Court found that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue's argument regarding the necessity of direct attributability of input VAT to the finished zero-rated product was incorrect and without legal basis under the applicable revenue regulations. The Court's finding was that Cargill Philippines, Inc. met the requirements for the refund of PHP 1,779,377.16 representing its unutilized excess input VAT for the period March 1, 2003 to August 31, 2004."
G.R. No. 250288,"JOHN KRISKA LOGISTICS, INC. / JOHN KRISKA DISTRIBUTION CENTER INC., AND KAREN NERONA (MANAGER), PETITIONERS, VS. ELIZARDO T. MENDOZA, RESPONDENT","Elizardo T. Mendoza (respondent) worked for John Kriska Logistics, Inc. (petitioners) as a delivery helper from February 6, 2006. In September 2016, he stopped reporting after having cataract surgery on his left eye, believing his doctor's advice not to carry heavy objects meant he could no longer work. He insisted on separation pay, but petitioners required a medical certificate stating his illness was incurable within six months, a document the respondent failed to provide. Mendoza subsequently filed a complaint focusing on underpayment of wages, alleging his daily rate was below the minimum wage, and claiming differentials for salary, 13th month pay, service incentive leave (SIL), and the refund of his weekly cash bond deductions. The Labor Arbiter initially dismissed the complaint, finding no underpayment. However, the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) reversed this, ruling that the petitioners failed to prove proper payment and that the meal allowance was not part of the basic wage. The NLRC awarded Mendoza's monetary claims, which the Court of Appeals (CA) later affirmed","The Supreme Court DENIED the petition for review, finding no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC or the CA. The Court affirmed the NLRC's findings that the employer (John Kriska) failed to discharge its burden of proving payment for minimum wages, 13th month pay, SIL, and the return of the cash bond. The Court agreed that the meal allowance could not be automatically included in the basic wage. Furthermore, since the employer has custody of all employment records, their failure to present complete evidence regarding the SIL and cash bond supported the award of these claims to Mendoza. The Court also added a modification to award Mendoza's proportionate 13th month pay for 2016, even though he failed to specifically pray for it, in the interest of justice","The petition for review on certiorari is DENIED. The Decision dated April 24, 2019 and Resolution dated October 18, 2019 of the Court of Appeals are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. John Kriska Distribution Center, Inc. is ordered to pay Elizardo T. Mendoza the sum of P51,687.86 (covering the salary, 13th month, SIL, and cash bond differentials, plus attorney's fees) and is further ordered to pay his proportionate 13th month pay from January 1, 2016 to September 20, 2016, all subject to a six percent (6%) interest per annum from the finality of the NLRC decision/resolution until full payment. The case was remanded to the Labor Arbiter for the proper computation of the total monetary award.","The Supreme Court found that the petitioners, John Kriska Logistics, Inc., failed to overcome the burden of proof and were liable to the respondent for labor standard monetary claims. The Court affirmed the NLRC's finding that the respondent was entitled to: salary differential, 13th month pay differential, service incentive leave pay, and the refund of the cash bond."
G.R. No. 255750,"PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. DIANE ARGAYAN Y OGNAYON, ACCUSED-APPELLANT","Accused-appellant Diane Argayan y Ognayon (Diane) was charged with the crime of parricide for the death of her three-year-old daughter, Jeana Rose Argayan Mangili (Jeana). The prosecution's key witness was Diane's six-year-old niece, Raven Rhyzl Cha-ong (Raven). Raven testified that she saw Jeana crying with a knife embedded in her back, and when asked, Jeana said her mother (Diane) had stabbed her. Diane then removed the knife, bathed Jeana, changed her bloodied clothes, and put her to sleep, showing a lack of urgency in seeking medical help. Later, Raven found Jeana lying face down, dead and covered in blood. The post-mortem report confirmed Jeana died from hemorrhagic shock secondary to multiple stab wounds and multiple hack wounds, consistent with being caused by a bladed weapon. Diane waived her right to present evidence but argued on appeal that the prosecution failed to prove her guilt beyond reasonable doubt since there was no direct witness to the killing, and her alleged admission to a social worker was inadmissible.","The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction of Diane for parricide. It ruled that while there was no direct evidence, the totality of circumstantial evidence proved Diane's guilt beyond reasonable doubt. This evidence included the dying declaration of the victim (Jeana stating her mother stabbed her), Diane's unusual and suspicious behavior (removing the knife, bathing the child, washing the clothes, and cleaning the scene instead of seeking help), and the fact that she was the last person seen with the victim. The Court noted that Diane's denial of involvement and her attempt to cover up the crime were inconsistent with the actions of an innocent mother. The alleged oral admission of guilt to the social worker, while inadmissible as a formal extrajudicial confession because it wasn't written, was admissible as an independently relevant statement and served as strong corroborative evidence. The Court found all elements of parricide—the killing of a person, the accused as the killer, and the victim being the child of the accused—were established.","The appeal is DISMISSED, and the Decision of the Court of Appeals (CA) affirming the judgment of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) is AFFIRMED. Diane Argayan y Ognayon is imposed the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua. She is likewise directed to pay the heirs of Jeana Rose Argayan Mangili:

Civil indemnity in the amount of PHP 75,000.00

Moral damages in the amount of PHP 75,000.00

Exemplary damages in the amount of PHP 75,000.00

Temperate damages in the amount of PHP 50,000.00

All damages awarded shall incur interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the finality of the Decision until fully paid.",Accused-appellant Diane Argayan y Ognayon is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Parricide.
G.R. No. 206905,"JUNAR D. ORILLO AND FLORENCIO E. DANIELES, PETITIONERS, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT","The case involves a criminal complaint for Libel filed by Romeo Cabatian (a retired police officer and newly elected Vice President of a jeepney association) against several individuals, including petitioners Junar D. Orillo and Florencio E. Danieles (who were losing candidates in the association election). The petitioners and their co-accused were charged with conspiratorially posting copies of a criminal complaint for carnapping that had been filed against Cabatian on the association's bulletin board at the jeepney terminal on April 26, 2002. Prosecution witnesses testified that they saw the petitioners and others posting the documents, which led to Cabatian being exposed to public contempt and ridicule among the association members. In defense, Orillo claimed an alibi, stating he was in Bicol for a town fiesta and baptism on the date of the posting, while Danieles claimed he was merely a spectator and was only included in the complaint because he refused to testify against his co-accused","The Supreme Court affirmed the petitioners' conviction for Libel, finding that the elements of the crime were proven beyond reasonable doubt. The Court rejected the defense of alibi and denial, upholding the findings of the lower courts that petitioners' defenses were weak and uncorroborated, noting that it was not physically impossible for Orillo to have been at the crime scene. The Court found all elements of libel present: the imputation (carnapping) was defamatory as it discredited Cabatian's character, it was published by posting it on a public bulletin board, Cabatian was clearly identifiable, and the act was done with malice. The malice was evident because the posting occurred a month after the election, thus serving no purpose other than to injure Cabatian's reputation and expose him to ridicule, particularly since the petitioners were his losing rivals. However, the Court modified the penalty in line with prevailing jurisprudence that favors the imposition of a fine instead of imprisonment for libel.","The Petition for Review is DENIED. The July 23, 2012 Decision and April 18, 2013 Resolution of the Court of Appeals are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. In lieu of imprisonment, petitioners Junar D. Orillo and Florencio E. Danieles are instead sentenced to pay a FINE in the amount of P6,000.00 with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency. The award of attorney's fees by the trial court was DELETED, while the order to pay moral damages to Romeo Cabatian in the amount of Twenty Thousand (P20,000.00) was AFFIRMED.",Petitioners Junar D.

OCA IPI No. 18-4872-P,"JUDGE RODERICK A. MAXINO, COMPLAINANT, VS. JAIME M. JASMIN, LEGAL RESEARCHER II, BRANCH 43, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, TANJAY CITY, NEGROS ORIENTAL, RESPONDENT.","This administrative matter arose after the Supreme Court dismissed an initial complaint for usurpation of authority filed by Judge Roderick A. Maxino against Jaime M. Jasmin (respondent), a Legal Researcher II. Following the dismissal, Jasmin requested the Court to process his back salaries and allow him to return to work, attaching medical certifications. The Judicial Integrity Board (JIB) investigated and found that while Jasmin's application for sick leave for July 2018 was approved by the Supreme Court's Medical Services, he had continuously failed to report for work since August 2018 (going on Absence Without Official Leave, or AWOL). Since the respondent was neither prevented nor disallowed from reporting for work during this time, his prolonged unauthorized absence caused disruption to the functions of his office.","The Supreme Court adopted and approved the findings and recommendation of the JIB. The Court clarified that the procedure to drop an employee from the rolls due to AWOL is non-disciplinary in nature and is governed by the 2017 Rules on Administrative Cases in Civil Service (RACCS), not Rule 140 of the Rules of Court. Citing Section 107(a)(1) of the 2017 RACCS, which allows for separation if an employee is continuously absent without official leave for at least thirty (30) working days, the Court ruled that Jasmin's continuous unauthorized absence since August 2018 warranted his separation from service. Consequently, the Court denied Jasmin's request to return to work.","The Court DROPS respondent Jaime M. Jasmin, Legal Researcher II, Branch 43, Regional Trial Court, Tanjay City, Negros Oriental, from the rolls effective August 1, 2018, and his position is declared VACANT. However, since the separation is non-disciplinary, Jasmin is still qualified to receive the benefits he may be entitled to under existing laws until July 31, 2018, and may still be reemployed in the government.","The Supreme Court found that respondent Jaime M. Jasmin was continuously absent without official leave (AWOL) for at least thirty (30) working days since August 2018, which is a sufficient ground for separation from service."
G.R. No. 207140,"NATIONAL POWER CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT OF BULACAN, GLORIA P. STA. MARIA, MUNICIPAL ASSESSOR OF NORZAGARAY, AND THE MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT OF NORZAGARAY, BULACAN, RESPONDENTS","The National Power Corporation (NPC), a government-owned and controlled corporation (GOCC) operating the Angat Hydro-Electric Power Plant, received two Notices of Assessment for Real Property Tax (RPT) from the Municipal Government of Norzagaray, Bulacan: the Machineries Assessment (1996-2005) and the Land Assessment (1997-2006). NPC questioned the assessment before the Local Board of Assessment Appeals (LBAA). NPC argued that the properties listed in the Machineries Assessment were exempt from RPT under the Local Government Code (LGC) because they are actually, directly, and exclusively used for generating and transmitting electricity. Regarding the Land Assessment, NPC questioned the correctness of the assessed value. Critically, NPC did not pay the tax under protest before filing its appeal, asserting that the payment-under-protest requirement does not apply when questioning the assessor's authority to impose the tax on an exempt property. The LBAA and the Central Board of Assessment Appeals (CBAA) upheld the tax assessments, ruling that the properties were not exclusively used for power generation and that payment under protest was mandatory.","The Supreme Court DENIED NPC's petition. The Court ruled that NPC's claim for tax exemption (whether full or partial) does not question the assessor's authority to impose the tax, but rather the correctness or reasonableness of the assessment. A claim of exemption requires presenting factual evidence (e.g., proving the actual, direct, and exclusive use of the machinery) to the administrative bodies. When the issue is a question of fact or the correctness of the assessment, the requirement of ""payment under protest"" under Section 252(a) of the LGC is mandatory and a condition precedent. NPC’s failure to pay the assessed RPT under protest rendered its administrative appeal without effect, meaning the LBAA and subsequent appellate bodies lacked the authority to take cognizance of the case. Thus, the CTA En Banc correctly dismissed the appeal for lack of cause of action.","The Petition for Review on Certiorari is hereby DENIED. The Decision dated November 29, 2012, and the Resolution dated April 22, 2013, of the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc in CTA EB No. 850, which affirmed the assessments, are AFFIRMED. Accordingly, the National Power Corporation is directed to pay the Municipality of Norzagaray, Bulacan, its tax liabilities amounting to:

PHP 18,475,003.20 over the ""Land Assessments"" (covering January 1, 1997 to December 31, 2006).

PHP 113,960,000.00 over the ""Machineries Assessment"" (covering January 1, 1996 to December 31, 2005).","The Supreme Court found that the National Power Corporation (NPC) failed to comply with the mandatory condition precedent of paying the assessed Real Property Tax under protest, which is required when contesting the correctness of an assessment based on a claim of exemption."
G.R. No. 258894,"GLEN ORDA Y LOYOLA, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","Petitioner Glen Orda y Loyola was charged with three separate violations of Republic Act No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act): Section 5 (selling 0.310 gram of shabu), Section 11 (possession of 0.164 gram of shabu), and Section 12 (possession of drug paraphernalia). Petitioner sought to enter into plea bargaining in all three cases under the Supreme Court's framework (A.M. No. 18-03-16-SC), proposing to plead guilty to lesser offenses (two counts of Section 12 and one count of Section 15, which is for use). The prosecution objected, citing the Department of Justice (DOJ) Circular No. 27, which set stricter limits on plea bargaining, particularly barring a plea bargain for Section 5 to anything other than Section 11(3). The Trial Court granted the plea bargaining proposal, citing the Supreme Court's rule-making power. However, the Court of Appeals (CA) initially affirmed the trial court but later reversed itself upon reconsideration by the prosecution, ordering the cases to proceed to trial based on the required mutual consent for plea bargaining.","The Supreme Court REVERSED the CA's Amended Decision and reinstated the validity of the plea bargaining, but with a remand for qualification assessment. The Court referenced its recent consolidated rulings (People v. Montierro and Baldadera v. People) which reconciled the conflicting circulars. The Court noted that the DOJ had since issued DOJ Circular No. 18 (2022), aligning the prosecution's plea bargaining framework with the Supreme Court's A.M. No. 18-03-16-SC. This alignment meant that the prosecution's original objection, based solely on the superseded DOJ Circular No. 27, was effectively withdrawn.

However, the Court emphasized that while the trial court has the discretion to approve a plea bargain over a baseless prosecution objection, it must first determine whether the accused is qualified under the Montierro guidelines. This qualification involves assessing whether: (a) the evidence of guilt is strong, and (b) the accused has disqualifying circumstances (e.g., recidivism, habitual offender status, or a history of drug relapses). Therefore, the case must be remanded to allow the trial court to make this necessary factual determination regarding the petitioner's qualification.","The Petition is DENIED (insofar as it sought outright final approval of the plea bargain). The Amended Decision of the Court of Appeals dated July 21, 2021, which annulled the plea bargain and ordered trial, is REVERSED.

The Supreme Court REMANDS Criminal Case Nos. C-87-16, C-88-16, and C-89-16 to the Regional Trial Court of Roxas City, Branch 16, with an order to:

Determine the qualification of Glen Orda y Loyola to avail of the benefits of plea bargaining under the guidelines set forth in People v. Montierro.

Resolve anew his plea bargaining proposals based on that determination.","The Supreme Court found that the prosecution's objection to the plea bargaining, being based on the subsequently superseded DOJ Circular No. 27, was invalid. However, the Court found that the Trial Court had hastily approved the plea bargain without first determining the petitioner's qualification under the rules."
G.R. No. 240542,"PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. BALTAZAR ACHAY, JR. Y DOCIL, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","Accused-appellant Baltazar Achay, Jr. (Achay) was charged in four separate Informations stemming from a shooting incident on September 6, 2013, in Tondo, Manila. Achay was charged with: 1) Murder for the death of Barangay Chairperson Rolando Reyes; 2) Attempted Murder for the non-fatal shooting of Chairperson Reyes's wife, Marilou Estrella Reyes; 3) Attempted Murder for the shooting of Juanito Fausto, Jr.; and 4) Violation of Section 10(a) of R.A. No. 7610 (Child Abuse) for the minor injury sustained by two-year-old Adrian Dagulo. The prosecution's evidence relied on multiple eyewitnesses who positively identified Achay as the gunman who shot the victims at the barangay hall and later in the street. Achay maintained his innocence, claiming the defense of alibi, arguing he was at home at the time of the incident, and claiming his subsequent warrantless arrest was illegal. The Trial Court acquitted Achay of the attempted murder and R.A. 7610 charges, but convicted him of the lesser crimes of Less Serious Physical Injuries (for Marilou), Slight Physical Injuries (for Dagulo and Fausto), and Murder (for Rolando Reyes). The Court of Appeals later reinstated the charge against Fausto to Attempted Murder, while affirming the other convictions.","The Supreme Court AFFIRMED the conviction of Achay, finding no reason to disturb the lower courts' rulings. The Court upheld the principle that the defense of denial and alibi cannot outweigh the positive identification made by credible eyewitnesses, noting that Achay failed to prove the physical impossibility of his presence at the crime scene. Furthermore, the Court clarified that even if Achay's warrantless arrest had been illegal, his subsequent conviction was supported by the overwhelming testimony of the eyewitnesses, which was independent of the legality of the arrest or the admissibility of the seized firearm. The Court agreed with the CA's finding of treachery in the killing of Chairperson Rolando Reyes, upholding the conviction for Murder. For Fausto's case, the SC modified the CA's conviction from Attempted Murder back down to Attempted Homicide, finding that the prosecution failed to prove the qualifying circumstances of treachery and evident premeditation necessary for murder, but that Achay clearly intended to kill Fausto to facilitate his escape. The Court affirmed the convictions for Less Serious Physical Injuries for Marilou and Slight Physical Injuries for Dagulo.","The Decision of the Court of Appeals is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. Achay is sentenced and ordered to pay the following:

For Murder (Crim. Case No. 13-300493): Penalty of Reclusion Perpetua, and ordered to pay the heirs of Rolando Reyes P75,000.00 each for civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages, plus P44,225.00 for actual damages.

For Attempted Homicide (Crim. Case No. 13-300492): Indeterminate penalty of four (4) months of arresto mayor (minimum) to four (4) years and two (2) months of prision correccional (maximum), and ordered to pay Juanito Fausto, Jr. P20,000.00 each for civil indemnity and moral damages, plus P707.00 for actual damages.

For Less Serious Physical Injuries (Crim. Case No. 13-300491): Imprisonment for four (4) months, and ordered to pay Marilou Estrella Reyes P1,066.00 for actual damages and P5,000.00 for moral damages.

For Slight Physical Injuries (Crim. Case No. 13-300490): Imprisonment for twenty (20) days, and ordered to pay Adrian Dagulo P4,565.00 for actual damages and P5,000.00 for moral damages.

All damages shall bear interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the finality of the Decision until fully paid.","Accused-appellant Baltazar Achay, Jr. y Docil is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the following crimes:

G.R. No. 240255,"THE CITY GOVERNMENT OF CALOOCAN, PETITIONER, VS. CARMEL DEVELOPMENT INC., RESPONDEN","Since 1958, Carmel Development, Inc. (CDI) has been the registered owner of land where Pangarap Village is located. In 1973, Presidential Decree No. 293 (PD 293) declared CDI’s titles void and opened the lots for disposition to alleged occupants. However, in 1988, the Supreme Court, in the case of Tuason v. Register of Deeds, declared PD 293 unconstitutional and void ab initio, thereby restoring full ownership to CDI. Following the restoration of its title, CDI installed security measures, including road blockades and security booms, along Gregorio Araneta Avenue, a major thoroughfare within the village that CDI claimed as private property.

In January 2016, the City Government of Caloocan filed a Complaint for Abatement of Nuisance with prayer for injunction, arguing that CDI's road blockades were a public nuisance under the Civil Code because they endangered the welfare of residents and hampered the delivery of basic government services (police, fire, health, and utilities). The Regional Trial Court (RTC) granted the City's application for a writ of preliminary injunction, ruling that the City had a right to unhampered access and that CDI was estopped from denying access because it had tolerated the presence of government facilities for nearly 30 years after the Tuason ruling.","The Supreme Court DENIED the City Government of Caloocan's petition, thereby AFFIRMING the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision to dissolve the injunction. The Court ruled that the City failed to establish the two essential requisites for a writ of preliminary injunction:

Clear and Unmistakable Right: While the City has a right to possess the government facilities and structures it built (which must be compensated to CDI, as the land has been dedicated to public use under the Malonesio doctrine), it failed to prove that this right was substantially invaded. The City admitted that CDI had not totally prevented access, but merely regulated it, noting the existence of other backroads, albeit inconvenient.

Material and Substantial Invasion: The relative inconvenience caused by securing permission for entry did not constitute a material and substantial invasion of the City's right. The restriction was a valid exercise of CDI's ownership rights under Article 429 of the Civil Code, which allows an owner to use reasonable force (such as security barriers) to repel actual or threatened unlawful physical invasion or usurpation of private property.

Furthermore, the Court held that the RTC's issuance of the injunction had the effect of changing the status quo (the regulated access existing at the time the case was filed) rather than preserving it, which exceeds the scope of a preliminary injunction.","The Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED. The Court of Appeals' October 20, 2017 Decision and the June 20, 2018 Resolution in CA-G.R. SP. No. 147019 are AFFIRMED.","The Supreme Court found that the City Government of Caloocan failed to establish the legal requisites for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction, specifically the existence of a clear and unmistakable right to unhampered access and a material and substantial invasion of that right. The Court affirmed that the road blockades, though inconvenient, did not constitute a judicially abatable nuisance given the circumstances of private ownership."
G.R. No. 236161,"ALMA C. LUGAWE, PETITIONER, VS. PACIFIC CEBU RESORT INTERNATIONAL, INC., RESPONDENT.","Ms. Lugawe was hired by Pacific Cebu Resort International, Inc. (“PCRI”) as an accounting clerk in March 2000 and promoted to HR Officer/Manager on January 1, 2007. 

 In October 2013, PCRI underwent a change in ownership/management, and several key human-resources and administrative functions previously under Lugawe’s office (such as compensation & benefits, administration of security services, supervision of company drivers, hiring discretion) were transferred to other departments. 

 Lugawe claimed these changes effectively stripped her of meaningful duties and responsibilities, making her continued employment untenable, and filed a complaint for constructive dismissal (with claims for separation pay, 13th month pay, and other benefits) on December 13, 2013. 

 PCRI countered that Lugawe retained her title, salary, and benefits, and that the transfers were valid exercises of management prerogative. Furthermore, PCRI contended that Lugawe abandoned her job when she failed to report for work after her approved sick leave and did not respond to a letter requesting explanation—hence they considered her employment terminated by abandonment.","The Court held that the transfer of HR functions from Lugawe’s office was a valid exercise of management prerogative in furtherance of legitimate business interests (improving internal controls, organizational efficiency), and that Lugawe retained her rank, salary, and benefits, which meant there was no demotion in rank or diminution in pay. 
 The Court further concluded that Lugawe’s prolonged, unexplained absence from work, her failure to respond to a letter demanding explanation, and communications indicating she would no longer report for duty constituted abandonment of her employment.","The petition for review on certiorari was denied, the ruling of the Court of Appeals that Lugawe voluntarily resigned / abandoned her employment was AFFIRMED.","Ms. Lugawe was not constructively dismissed; rather, the employment relationship was terminated by abandonment, and she is not entitled to separation pay on the ground of constructive dismissal."

Prior to the marriage, Dolores had a child with a former partner whom Edward accepted as his own. 

 They had three children of their own. On April 26, 2005, Edward filed a Petition for Declaration of Nullity of Marriage under Article 36 of the Family Code, alleging that Dolores was psychologically incapable of fulfilling her essential marital obligations from the time of the marriage, though he only discovered this later. 

 He claimed that during the marriage Dolores gave priority to the family grocery business (managed by her family) rather than spending time with him or the children, neglected her personal appearance and hygiene to such an extent that he lost the desire for intimacy, and was unfair to one of the children (Jor-el) favouring the others. 
On his part, Edward admitted to two extra-marital affairs and fathering two children with a mistress (Perla), and that he abandoned his family for two years starting in 1989. 
 A clinical psychologist (Dr. Natividad Dayan) evaluated the parties and opined that Edward had Narcissistic Personality Disorder and that Dolores had a Compulsive Personality Disorder, and that their marriage was afflicted by partner relational problems. 

 In contrast, Dolores denied the allegations, insisted she was a model wife and mother, that she spent time with her family (her mother looked after the grocery on Sundays), and that their sexual life was normal until Edward began his affairs. 

 The Regional Trial Court (RTC) granted Edward’s petition on October 30, 2009, declaring the marriage void ab initio on grounds of psychological incapacity. 

 The Court of Appeals (CA) on September 9, 2013 reversed the RTC decision, finding the proof insufficient to show psychological incapacity; it observed that Edward’s infidelity, dissatisfaction and desertion were the real reasons for the failure of the marriage","The Court of Appeals held that the totality of evidence before the RTC did not satisfy the parameters for psychological incapacity: specifically it found that the petitioner had been faithful and functional for many years prior to his affair; his abandonment and extramarital relationship were not the product of a pre-existing, durable personality structure incapacitating him psychologically. It also held that mere infidelity and abandonment do not constitute psychological incapacity under Article 36.","The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision. It found procedural infirmity (lack of verification and certificate against forum-shopping) but also on the merits held that petitioner failed to show psychological incapacity as defined in the jurisprudence (existing at the time of marriage, durable personality structure, genuine serious psychic cause, clear and convincing evidence). It held that the evidence showed dissatisfaction and infidelity rather than incapacity.","The petition for review on certiorari was denied, and the reversal of the RTC decision by the Court of Appeals was affirmed, meaning the marriage stands and no declaration of nullity was granted."

G.R. No. 246410,"I-PEOPLE MANPOWER RESOURCES, INC., ELEC QATAR AND LEOPOLDO GANGOSO, JR., PETITIONERS, VS. COURT OF APPEALS AND JOMER O. MONTON, RESPONDENTS.","On June 24, 2013, Elec Qatar, a Qatar-based company offering electro-­mechanical services, hired Monton as one of its electrical engineers through its local manpower agency, I-People Manpower Resources, Inc. (IPMR).[6]

Monton and Elec Qatar executed an employment contract for two years, from November 9, 2013 to November 9, 2015, with a monthly basic salary of QAR 6,000.00 and an allowance of QAR 3,000.00.[7] His employment contract stipulated that he will be assigned to the State of Qatar. The contract also provided that Elec Qatar could terminate the contract by giving a one-month prior written notice to Monton.[8]

On November 7, 2013, Monton flew to Qatar and started his work on November 9, 2013. Monton subsequently paid IPMR the placement fees in the amounts of QAR 2,000.00, QAR 2,260.00, and QAR 2,000.00, or a total amount of QAR 6,260.00. These amounts were deducted from Monton's salary for July, September, and October 2014.[9]

Thereafter, Monton received a letter from Elec Qatar on October 6, 2014, informing him that his employment contract will be terminated within 30 days from the receipt of said letter by reason of the low activity in the company and the lack of projects, forcing the company to reduce cost and manpower.[10]

On November 4, 2014, Monton sent an e-mail with the subject ""Letter of Gratitude"" to Elec Qatar's managing director, Claudio Natali, which read:
Dear Sir Claudio,

Prior to the last day of my service I would like to personally thank you towards the support and guidance I've been receiving within my tenure in the organization.

Before I leave, I want to tell you that a year of working with you has bestowed me a further learning and exposure to the industry.

....

Respectfully yours,
Mr. Jomer Monton[11]
On November 10, 2014, Monton was repatriated to the Philippines—a year before the end of his employment contract on November 9, 2015. Then, on November 14, 2014, Monton filed with the Philippine Overseas Employment Agency-Licensing Regulation Office Anti-Illegal Recruitment Branch in Mandaluyong City a request for conciliation of his complaint and grievance against IPMR. Two conferences were conducted from December 10 to 15, 2014. However, the parties failed to reach an agreement.[12]

On December 15, 2014, Monton filed a Complaint for illegal dismissal against IPMR, Elec Qatar, and Leopoldo Gangoso, Jr., the latter being the corporate officer of IPMR (IPMR et al.). Monton prayed for the payment of his salary for the unexpired portion of his employment contract, reimbursement of the placement fee paid to IPMR, damages, and attorney's fees.[13]

Monton asserted that overseas Filipino workers may only be terminated for just or authorized causes, and after compliance with procedural due process. He claimed that he was illegally dismissed since Elec Qatar failed to prove that a valid retrenchment existed. He alleged that the latter was unable to provide evidence of substantial loss in the business, besides bare allegations that the company was experiencing low activity or a shortage of projects.[14]

On the other hand, Elec Qatar argued that there was a valid exercise of management prerogative when it terminated Monton's employment due to retrenchment, as Monton's position as electrical engineer was no longer needed. Moreover, Elec Qatar claimed that the termination was mutually consented to as could be inferred from the e-mail Monton. sent to Elec Qatar's managing director.[15]","This Court resolves a Petition for Certiorari[1] under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court assailing the Decision[2] and Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals, which reversed and set aside the Decision[4] and Resolution[5] of the National Labor Relations Commission by declaring that private respondent Jomer O. Monton (Monton) was illegally dismissed from service.","The Petition should be dismissed.

A discussion must first be made on the remedy availed by IPMR et al.

IPMR et al. are assailing the Decision[31] and Resolution[32] of the Court of Appeals via a Petition for Certiorari[33] under Rule 65, as could be understood when IPMR et al. manifested that ""[t]his is a special civil action for certiorari under Rule 65 of Revised Rules of Civil procedure, as Amended ..."" However, it is worth noting that the caption of the pleading is denominated as a Petition for Review.[34]

It must be emphasized that a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 is the proper remedy to assail a judgment, final order, or resolution of the Court of Appeals.[35] On the other hand, a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 is the proper remedy when there is no appeal or when there is no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy available.[36]

In National Irrigation Administration v. Court of Appeals,[37] this Court aptly explained that:
[S]ince the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction over the petition under Rule 65, any alleged errors committed by it in the exercise of its jurisdiction would be errors of judgment which are reviewable by timely appeal and not by a special civil action of certiorari. If the aggrieved party fails to do so within the reglementary period, and the decision accordingly becomes final and executory, he cannot avail himself of the writ of certiorari, his predicament being the effect of his deliberate inaction.

The appeal from a final disposition of the Court of Appeals is a petition for review under Rule 45 and not a special civil action under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, now Rule 45 and Rule 65, respectively, of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure. Rule 45 is clear that decisions, final orders or resolutions of the Court of Appeals in any case, i.e., regardless of the nature of the action or proceeding involved, may be appealed to this Court by filing a petition for review, which would be but a continuation of the appellate process over the original case. Under Rule 45 the reglementary period to appeal is fifteen (15) days from notice of judgment or denial of motion for reconsideration.","It is axiomatic that labor contracts are heavily impressed with public interest, since employers and employees ""do not stand on equal footing.""[81] The primacy of the law over the nomenclature of the contract and the stipulations contained therein is to uphold the policy outlined in the Constitution of affording full protection to labor.[82] Labor contracts are accorded a higher status than ordinary contracts and are subject to the police power of the State.[83] Article 1700 of the Civil Code further provides that:
The relations between capital and labor are not merely contractual. They are so impressed with public interest that labor contracts must yield to the common good. Therefore, such contracts are subject to the special laws on labor unions, collective bargaining, strikes and lockouts, closed shop, wages, working conditions, hours of labor and similar subjects.[84] (Emphasis supplied)
Otherwise stated, capital and labor may freely stipulate the terms and conditions in labor contracts; however, such contracts are still subject to existing laws and public policy. This Court further explained that:
A contract freely entered into should, of course, be respected, as PIA argues, since a contract is the law between the parties. The principle of party autonomy in contracts is not, however, an absolute principle. The rule in Article 1306, of our Civil Code is that the contracting parties may establish such stipulations as they may deem convenient, ""provided they are not contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order or public policy."" Thus, counter-balancing the principle of autonomy of contracting parties is the equally general rule that provisions of applicable law, especially provisions relating to matters affected with public policy, are deemed written into the contract. Put a little differently, the governing principle is that parties may not contract away applicable provisions of law especially peremptory provisions dealing with mailers heavily impressed with public interest. The law relating to labor and employment is clearly such an area and parties are not at liberty to insulate themselves and their relationships from the impact of labor laws and regulations by simply contracting with each other.[85] (Emphasis supplied)
In this instance, the employment contract between Elec Qatar and Monton should be read in conjunction with existing laws and jurisprudence. Thus, Monton could only be dismissed if both the substantive and procedural due process requirements under the Labor Code are complied with. Elec Qatar should have substantiated its allegations of retrenchment and served written notice to both the respondent and the appropriate Department of Labor and Employment Regional Office, at least a month before the intended date of the termination specifying the ground thereof,[86] to validly dismiss the respondent.

Regarding the e-mail Monton sent to Elec Qatar's managing director, such is immaterial to the case. It would be unjust if We were to consider Monton's courteous act of sending his appreciation as a form of waiver in seeking legal recourse. The e-mail is merely an acknowledgement of the efforts of his former superior. The fact that Monton acknowledged in his letter that his services were terminated cannot bar him from demanding his claims or from questioning the legality of his dismissal.

Lastly, We agree with the Court of Appeals that IPMR et al.'s actions do not demonstrate bad faith or an intent to undermine Monton's rights. At most, Elec Qatar was simply attempting to exercise its right to pre-terminate the employment contract in accordance with its provisions. As such, We do not believe that an award of moral and exemplary damages is warranted in this case.[87]

FOR THESE REASONS, the Petition is DENIED. The October 15, 2018 Decision and January 24, 2019 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA­-G.R. SP No. 144031, are hereby AFFIRMED. Petitioners I-People Manpower Resources, Inc., Elec Qatar and Leopoldo Gangoso, Jr., in his capacity as corporate officer of I-People Manpower Resources, Inc., are ORDERED to PAY private respondent Jomer O. Monton:
(1)

(2)	
Placement fees with twelve percent (12%) interest per annum from November 6, 2014 to the date that this Decision becomes final and executory; and
 	

(3)

A legal interest rate of six percent (6%) per annum is also hereby imposed on the total judgment award from the date of finality of this Decision until fully paid.

G.R. No. 214926,"CRISOSTOMO B. AQUINO, PETITIONER, VS. AGUA TIERRA ORO MINA (ATOM) DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION, REPRESENTED BY ITS CHAIRMAN & CEO, VIRGILIO A. BOTE, RESPONDENT.","The dispute involves a seaside parcel of land located on the shores of Boracay Island within Sitio Diniwid, Barangay Balabag, Malay, Aklan. ATOM owns an adjacent three-hectare property and has a pending foreshore lease application over the seaside lot, intending to build a resort-hotel there. ATOM alleged that in 2006, petitioner Aquino illegally took possession of the seaside lot through intimidation and stealth and began constructing permanent concrete structures. Despite repeated requests from ATOM and the local government to stop, Aquino continued his construction activities. ATOM claimed this illegal occupation frustrated their resort-hotel plans and caused foreign investors to withdraw and demand return of investments. ATOM filed an action for recovery of possession, injunction, and damages before the Regional Trial Court of Kalibo, Aklan, arguing that Aquino violated a municipal ordinance and that ATOM had preferential rights as the adjacent property owner. Aquino countered that he purchased the seaside lot in 2005 and that ATOM's claim based on riparian rights had no basis since the lot is located on a cliff facing the sea with no discernible shoreline during low tide, making it not legally classifiable as foreshore land. Aquino claimed the land is forest land under DENR jurisdiction and that his company has a pending Forest Land Use Agreement for Tourism application which was subsequently granted in December 2009. The RTC granted ATOM's preliminary injunction in June 2010 on environmental grounds, which Aquino challenged.","The Supreme Court granted Aquino's petition and dismissed Civil Case No. 8577 before the Regional Trial Court of Kalibo, Aklan. The Court dissolved the writ of preliminary injunction issued on August 31, 2010.","The Supreme Court found several critical errors in the lower courts' decisions. First, the preliminary injunctive writ was improperly issued because ATOM failed to prove a clear legal right to the seaside lot, as the land's classification as foreshore land was disputed and ATOM's title to the adjacent property was itself questionable. Second, the application of the Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases was erroneous since ATOM's complaint was fundamentally about possession for commercial purposes, not environmental protection, and ATOM intended to conduct the same construction activities it sought to enjoin Aquino from performing. Third, there was no proof that ATOM posted the required bond for the preliminary injunction. Most significantly, the Court held that the DENR had already exercised primary jurisdiction over the matter by classifying the seaside lot as forest land and issuing Aquino's company a Forest Land Use Agreement for Tourism in December 2009. The DENR's determination that the lot was forest land, not foreshore land, was based on technical findings that the area consists of a limestone cliff without a shoreline that alternates between being covered and exposed by tides. The Court ruled that ATOM's claim to preferential rights as a riparian owner failed because the land classification prerequisite for such rights did not exist, as confirmed by the DENR's authoritative determination.","The petition was granted. The Court ordered the dismissal of the civil case for lack of cause of action and dissolved the preliminary injunction, recognizing the DENR's primary jurisdiction over public land classification and the validity of the Forest Land Use Agreement for Tourism issued to Aquino's company."
G.R. No. 224803,"PROVINCIAL PROSECUTOR OF ALBAY, PETITIONER, VS. MARIVIC LOBIANO, RESPONDENT.","Jelyn Galino, a fifteen-year-old minor, filed a criminal complaint against Angeline Morota and Marivic Lobiano for violation of the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act. Jelyn alleged that she willingly left with Angeline, her fraternity sister and also a minor, believing she would work in a restaurant in Legazpi City. However, Angeline brought her to Sampaguita Bar in Sorsogon, where she was expected to work as a guest relations officer. Marivic, the owner of Sampaguita Bar, asked for identification to verify Jelyn's age, but Angeline answered that Jelyn was nineteen years old. As a guest relations officer, Jelyn was required to drink alcohol and entertain customers, which involved kissing and other lascivious conduct. Her salary depended on how many ladies' drinks she consumed, which were bought by customers. For one month and eight days, she received no salary because she had accumulated a debt of more than three thousand pesos for clothes and beauty products provided by Marivic. Jelyn was only able to leave when her mother, together with police officers, personnel from the Department of Social Welfare and Development, and the media, rescued her from Sampaguita Bar. Of the two respondents, only Angeline submitted a counter-affidavit while Marivic failed to submit any evidence. Angeline claimed that it was actually Jelyn and someone named Danny who recruited her to work as a guest relations officer, contrary to the representation that she would work as a waitress. The Office of the Provincial Prosecutor found probable cause to indict Marivic for Qualified Trafficking but dismissed the charges against Angeline. However, the Regional Trial Court dismissed the case outright for lack of evidence to establish probable cause, finding no proof of conspiracy between Marivic as owner and Jelyn and Danny as recruiters. The Provincial Prosecutor filed a motion for reconsideration arguing that under the law, the act of hiring and receiving a person for prostitution is separate and distinct from recruiting, and no conspiracy is required. After the RTC denied the motion, the Provincial Prosecutor filed a petition for certiorari before the Court of Appeals, which dismissed it for being filed out of time and for being the improper remedy.",The Supreme Court granted the petition for review on certiorari filed by the Provincial Prosecutor and set aside both the Court of Appeals' resolutions and the Regional Trial Court's order dismissing the criminal case. The Court reinstated the criminal information for Qualified Trafficking filed against Marivic Lobiano.,"The Supreme Court ruled that the Court of Appeals erred in dismissing the petition for certiorari on procedural grounds. First, the petition was timely filed because it was mailed on February 16, 2015, which was the first working day after the deadline of February 14, 2015 fell on a Saturday, and the date of mailing is considered the date of filing when filing by registered mail. Second, although a petition for certiorari is generally an improper remedy to question a final order dismissing a criminal case, the Court found that exceptions applied in this case because it involved public interest regarding human trafficking, a crime characterized by sexual violence and slavery, and because the RTC's order was a patent nullity constituting grave abuse of discretion. The Court held that the RTC gravely abused its discretion in dismissing the case for lack of probable cause. The evidence clearly established uncontroverted facts that Jelyn was a minor when Marivic received and hired her to work in Sampaguita Bar, Marivic did not take steps to verify Jelyn's age, and the work involved prostitution or lascivious conduct in exchange for money. Under Sections 4(a) and 6(a) of Republic Act No. 9208 as amended, these facts established probable cause for Qualified Trafficking. The Court emphasized that judges may only dismiss cases for lack of probable cause in clear-cut instances when evidence plainly fails to establish probable cause, not when its existence is merely doubtful. Since there was no clear showing of lack of probable cause, and the facts indicated that more likely than not the crime was committed, the dismissal was improper and all parties should be given opportunity to present their claims in a full-blown trial.","The petition was granted. The Court set aside the Court of Appeals' July 10, 2015 and April 15, 2016 resolutions as well as the Regional Trial Court's November 13, 2014 order dismissing Criminal Case No. FC-14-1646. The criminal information for Qualified Trafficking against Marivic Lobiano was reinstated, and the trial court was directed to proceed with the arraignment of the accused and trial of the case with dispatch."
G.R. No. 193569,"EDMOND LIM AND GERD PALAND, PETITIONERS, VS. CATALINA SEE, RESPONDENT.","On March 20, 2000, Chai Seng Ang filed six applications for registration of trademarks with the Intellectual Property Office, including Crown Device, Jowika & Device, Schiso & Device, Device Mark, Crown, and Oro & Device, all used to designate nippers, scissors, nail cutters, cutlery, files, spoons, and knives. On February 26, 2003, Ang filed Assignments of Trademark transferring these applications to Catalina See, who then filed Declarations of Actual Use for the subject marks. In 2004, Edmond Lim learned that See was registering these marks and claimed they were identical to marks owned and used by Gerd Paland for his products, which Lim exclusively distributed in the Philippines. On October 26, 2004, Lim and Paland filed a verified opposition with the IPO Bureau of Legal Affairs. Paland claimed to be the president of Gerd Paland Solingen, a company based in Germany, and asserted he owned the contested marks through his company and predecessor companies that had manufactured and distributed nipper products in Solingen, Germany for fifty years. The marks Schiso and Device had been used since 1970, while Crown, Oro, Jowika, and Stork were used since 1974. Paland obtained registration of these marks in Germany in 2004. Lim and Paland submitted evidence including affidavits, an exclusive distributorship agreement, authenticated German certificates of registration, photographs of products, sales invoices to various countries including the Philippines, and other supporting documents. See countered that she was the proprietor of Lena's Enterprises established in 1981 and had dealt with these nipper brands since then. She claimed that as early as 1968, when she was eight years old, she saw these brands being sold at Nightingale Bazaar owned by her grandfather and managed by her father Joaquin Siy. She testified that her father told her that he and Ang gave or supplied the marks to the nipper products and that these were their brands already known in the market through their efforts. After her father's death in 1981, Lena's Enterprises continued ordering from Ang. In 1999, she received complaints about counterfeit products, prompting Ang to apply for registration in 2000. See claimed Ang voluntarily assigned the trademark applications to her in recognition of the financial support he received from her father and Lena's Enterprises.","This Court resolves a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] assailing the Decision[2] and Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA), which reversed the Decision[4] of the Director General of the Intellectual Property Office. The Office of the Director General-Intellectual Property Office reversed and set aside the Decision[5] rendered by the Bureau of Legal Affairs-Intellectual Property Office which denied the Notice of Opposition filed by Edmond Lim and Gerd Paland (Lim and Paland) against the applications for trademark registration of Catalina See (See). As such, the assailed CA rulings allowed the trademark registration filed by See, except for the mark SCHISO & DEVICE.","The Supreme Court ruled that See registered the subject trademarks in bad faith contrary to the requirement of good faith registration under Section 122 of the Intellectual Property Code. The Court clarified that while the first-to-file rule generally applies, it is not absolute and registration must be done in good faith. Bad faith in trademark registration means the applicant has knowledge of prior creation, use, or registration by another of an identical or similar trademark. The Court found that Ang had knowledge of the prior creation and use of the subject trademarks by Paland and his predecessor companies, making the registration an act of trademark squatting. The Court determined that See's entire claim of ownership was founded on hearsay and self-serving statements, with no documentary evidence establishing Ang's ownership of the marks. See's testimony about seeing the products at age eight and her father's alleged statements were insufficient proof. The absence of any business records, correspondence, or evidence of Ang commissioning the manufacture of products as a trademark owner was fatal to her claim. The Court noted that the sales and delivery invoices submitted by Lim and Paland demonstrated that products bearing the subject trademarks were delivered through various distribution channels in the Philippines and abroad for over a decade, with no evidence that other distributors were authorized by Ang. Additionally, See's admission that the Schiso & Device mark did not belong to her father, yet proceeding with the application anyway, demonstrated bad faith. The Court emphasized that registration not in good faith is equivalent to no registration at all, and hence no ownership rights were transmitted. The burden was on See to establish her claim of ownership on the strength of her evidence, which she failed to do.","The petition for review was granted. The Court of Appeals' decision and resolution in CA-G.R. SP No. 108067 were reversed and set aside. The decision of the Office of the Director General dated March 13, 2009 was reinstated. Applications for trademark registration bearing serial numbers 4-2000-002135 for Crown Device, 4-2000-002136 for Jowika & Device, 4-2000-002138 for Device Mark, 4-2000-002139 for Crown, and 4-2000-002140 for Oro & Device were denied."
G.R. No. 255538,"ELENA GAERLAN-OSTONAL, PETITIONER, VS. ROMEO FLORES, RANDY FLORES, HEIRS OF FLORENCIO GAERLAN, THE OFFICE OF THE MUNICIPAL ASSESSOR OF BAUANG, LA UNION, AND THE OFFICE OF THE PROVINCIAL ASSESSOR OF LA UNION, DEFENDANTS,

HEIRS OF EFREN DELIM, RESPONDENTS.","Elena Gaerlan-Ostonal filed a complaint for cancellation of tax declaration, declaration of nullity of extra-judicial settlement of estate, quieting of title, temporary restraining order and injunction, and damages against Romeo Flores, Randy Flores, the Heirs of Florencio Gaerlan, and the Heirs of Efren Delim. Elena alleged that she was one of the legitimate children and heirs of the late Chan Jut Co, also known as Emiliano Gaerlan or Emiliano Chan, and Gorgonia Gapuz, who were married on January 1, 1913 before Reverend Father Estanislao Filler in Bauang, La Union. Although no record of the marriage was found in the civil registrar or parish office, principal sponsors Pablo Sanchez and Vicente Caluza executed a joint affidavit to prove the marriage existed. On the wedding day, Gorgonia's uncle gifted her a 727-square meter parcel of land in Bauang, La Union, which was declared for tax purposes in Chan Jut Co's name. Elena claimed that Felicidad Gaerlan, Efren Delim, and Romeo Flores, claiming to be compulsory and legal heirs of Chan Jut Co, executed an Extra-Judicial Settlement with Waiver dated March 29, 1983 and adjudicated the subject property among themselves without her knowledge and consent, resulting in the cancellation of the tax declaration in Chan Jut Co's name and transfer to the three defendants. Elena presented various documentary evidence including certifications from the local civil registrar stating that she and her siblings were born to Chan Jut Co and Gorgonia, certification of Emiliano's death stating he was married, and certificates of death from the parish stating Emiliano was married to Gorgonia. The Heirs of Efren contended that Emiliano's legitimate wife was Esperanza Flores, whom he married in the 1900s, and their legitimate children included Maura F. Chan who was the mother of the late Efren. They claimed the subject land was conjugal property of Emiliano and Esperanza, and that they had notorious, public, and open ownership and possession for almost 28 years. The Regional Trial Court ruled in favor of Elena, finding that Emiliano was married to Gorgonia based on documentary evidence and declared the extra-judicial settlement void. However, the Court of Appeals reversed the RTC decision, finding that Elena failed to prove the existence of the marriage between Chan Jut Co and Gorgonia, noting that the documentary evidence were hearsay and that certificates of birth and death only proved parentage and death, not marriage.","The Supreme Court granted Elena's petition for review on certiorari. The Court reversed and set aside the Court of Appeals' decision dated October 14, 2019 and resolution dated November 24, 2020. The Supreme Court reinstated the Regional Trial Court's decision dated September 19, 2017 with modification regarding legal interest on monetary awards.","The Supreme Court ruled that Elena successfully proved her legal title to the subject land as a compulsory heir of Emiliano and that the extra-judicial settlement was void. The Court clarified that pursuant to the doctrine in Treyes v. Larlar, even in ordinary actions, a declaration of heirship may be made to resolve the cause of action without requiring a prior special proceeding for settlement of estate. The Court held that compulsory or intestate heirs may commence an ordinary civil action to declare nullity of a deed and for recovery of property without necessity of a prior and separate judicial declaration of their status as heirs. Regarding the evidence, the Court found that the totality of evidence preponderates in Elena's favor. The certifications from the local civil registrar showing Elena and her siblings were born to Emiliano and Gorgonia, the certification of Emiliano's death showing he was married, and the parish certificates of death were sufficient to prove Elena and her siblings were filiated to Emiliano and therefore his compulsory heirs entitled to the subject land by succession. Conversely, the evidence did not sufficiently show defendants were filiated to Emiliano. The certificate of death stating Maura Flores Dilim's father was Emiliano Chan was insufficient to prove filiation, unlike Elena's birth certifications. Additionally, a Negative Certification of Birth from the National Statistics Office stating there was no record of birth of Maura F. Chan with parents Emiliano and Esperanza further cast doubt on the claimed filiation. The Court emphasized that public documents are prima facie evidence requiring high degree of proof to overcome. Moreover, one defendant, Lolita Gaerlan Calica, testified in favor of Elena through her judicial affidavit, constituting a judicial admission that required no further proof. Regarding the two requisites for quieting of title, the Court found both satisfied: Elena had legal title as a compulsory heir, and the extra-judicial settlement and tax declarations cast cloud on that title. Since defendants failed to prove their filiation to Emiliano, they had no right to settle his estate, making the extra-judicial settlement and resultant tax declarations void ab initio.","The petition was granted. The Court of Appeals' decision and resolution in CA-G.R. CV No. 110437 were reversed and set aside. The Regional Trial Court's decision in Civil Case No. 1999-BG was reinstated with modification that the monetary awards due to Elena shall earn legal interest at the rate of six percent per annum from finality of the decision until full payment. The extra-judicial settlement dated March 29, 1983 was declared void ab initio, and the offices of the municipal and provincial assessors were ordered to cancel the tax declarations issued in the names of Romeo Flores, Florencio Gaerlan, and Efren G. Delim."

REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","Miriam Durban Tagamolila and her sister Cecilia Durban Dima-ano, as the only legal heirs of their late father Rafael J. Durban, sought to register in their names three parcels of land forming part of Rafael's estate. They filed a petition for original registration of Lot Nos. 2264, 2270, and 2271 of the Himamaylan Cadastre, Province of Negros Occidental before the Regional Trial Court. In their petition, they contended that they were the legal heirs of Rafael, the properties were adjudicated to them by virtue of an Extrajudicial Declaration of Heirship to the Estate of Rafael J. Durban, and Rafael acquired the properties through inheritance from his predecessor as documented in a Petition for Probate of Last Will and Testament on March 23, 1935. The Office of the Solicitor General filed an opposition arguing that the parcels of land were part of the public domain belonging to the Republic of the Philippines, that neither the applicants nor their predecessors-in-interest had been in open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession since June 12, 1945 or prior thereto, and that the tax declarations and muniments of title did not constitute competent and sufficient evidence of bona fide acquisition or possession. The trial court declared all parties other than the Republic in general default and proceeded to trial. After the parties presented evidence, the Regional Trial Court granted the application for registration, finding that petitioners satisfactorily complied with the requirements for original registration. The Republic appealed, arguing insufficiency of evidence and insisting that land classification as alienable and disposable required certification not only from the City Environment and Natural Resources Office but also from the Secretary of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources. The Court of Appeals granted the Republic's appeal and reversed the trial court, finding the City Environment and Natural Resources certification insufficient to commence the thirty-year prescriptive period, and requiring certificates and approvals from the DENR Secretary that the property formed part of alienable and disposable lands of the public domain.","The Supreme Court partially granted the petition for review on certiorari. The Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision dated February 23, 2015 and resolution dated September 8, 2015 insofar as Tagamolila's adverse possession through her predecessors-in-interest remained uncontested and insofar as substantial compliance with requirements for proof of alienable and disposable nature was unmeritorious. However, the case was remanded to the Court of Appeals for reception of evidence on the subject property's land classification status based on Republic Act No. 11573.","The Supreme Court held that the basis for the Court of Appeals' reversal must be recalibrated in view of subsequent developments in the law on original registration of alienable and disposable lands of the public domain, particularly Republic Act No. 11573 and the case of Republic v. Pasig Rizal Co., Inc. The Court ruled that RA 11573 is a curative statute that could be applied retroactively to pending applications for judicial confirmation of title, even without express provisions for retroactivity, because it simplified and harmonized land registration laws and created new rights by shortening the required period of adverse possession from possession since June 12, 1945 to only twenty years immediately preceding the filing of the application. The Court held that the curative nature of RA 11573 could be discerned from its declared purpose to simplify, update and harmonize land laws to remove ambiguity in interpretation and implementation. The Court emphasized that RA 11573 amended the interpretation established in Heirs of Malabanan v. Court of Appeals, particularly the requirement for an express government manifestation that land was no longer intended for public service or development of national wealth. Under the new law, classification of land as alienable and disposable immediately places it within the commerce of man and renders it susceptible to private acquisition through adverse possession, without requiring further express government manifestation. The Court also established that Section 7 of RA 11573 prescribes the nature of proof sufficient to establish land status as alienable and disposable, superseding previous requirements. The Court rejected petitioner's claim of substantial compliance under Republic v. Vega because it applied only on a pro hac vice basis and had been superseded by new guidelines. The Court directed remanded proceedings to focus solely on the issue of the properties' classification as alienable and disposable, with petitioner's evidence of adverse possession limited to evidence already on record, similar to the approach in Pasig Rizal Co., Inc.","The petition for review on certiorari was partially granted. The Court of Appeals' decision dated February 23, 2015 and resolution dated September 8, 2015 in CA-G.R. CV No. 03802 were affirmed insofar as Tagamolila's adverse possession through her predecessors-in-interest remained uncontested and substantial compliance with previous requirements was unmeritorious. The case was remanded to the Court of Appeals for reception of evidence on the subject property's land classification status based on the parameters set forth in Section 7 of Republic Act No. 11573, with directions to resolve the case in accordance with the Supreme Court's decision with due and deliberate dispatch."
G.R. No. 261344,"FRANK ONG SIBUMA, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, ALMA L. PANELO, AND STEFANIE ANN ERIGUEL CALONGCAGON, RESPONDENTS.","Frank Ong Sibuma and Stefanie Ann Eriguel Calongcagon vied for the mayoralty position of the Municipality of Agoo, La Union in the May 9, 2022 National and Local Elections. Sibuma filed his Certificate of Candidacy on October 7, 2021. On November 2, 2021, Alma L. Panelo filed a petition to deny due course to or cancel Sibuma's Certificate of Candidacy under Section 78 of the Omnibus Election Code, alleging that Sibuma committed material misrepresentation by stating in his Certificate of Candidacy that he would be a resident of Barangay Sta. Barbara, Agoo, La Union for one year and three months on the day before the May 9, 2022 Elections, when in truth he was a resident of Zone 2, Purok 9, San Eugenio, Aringay, La Union. To prove her claims, Panelo submitted two certifications dated October 29, 2021 issued by Punong Barangay Erwina C. Eriguel stating that Sibuma was not a resident of Barangay Sta. Barbara, a Deed of Absolute Sale, Transfer Certificate of Title, applications for building permits and licenses showing the address belonged to Eric Ong Sibuma, and a certification from the Municipal Engineer stating no certificate of occupancy had been issued over the property. Sibuma alleged he had established residency in Agoo, La Union since birth and that while he may have been absent for some time, his intention to return had always been shown. He submitted evidence including his Certificate of Live Birth showing he was born in Agoo, his Secondary Student's Record from Don Mariano Marcos State University, telephone bills and electricity bills indicating Sta. Barbara, Agoo as his address, a Tax Declaration of Real Property, and an Affidavit of Residency signed by 41 residents attesting he had resided in Agoo from January 2021. Panelo offered supplementary evidence consisting of affidavits dated December 3 and 4, 2021 individually executed by eight of the 41 affiants recanting their participation in Sibuma's Affidavit of Residency. On May 10, 2022, the Municipal Board of Canvassers proclaimed Sibuma as the duly elected Mayor with 21,364 votes against Eriguel's 16,603 votes. On May 13, 2022, the COMELEC Second Division granted Panelo's petition and cancelled Sibuma's Certificate of Candidacy, ruling he committed material misrepresentation relating to his residency. The COMELEC found that Sibuma failed to establish actual physical presence at Agoo and gave weight to the certifications from the Punong Barangay and the recantation affidavits. On May 24, 2022, the Office of the Clerk of the Commission issued a Certificate of Finality stating the Resolution had become final and executory, noting that Sibuma had not filed any motion for reconsideration within the five-day reglementary period from service via email on May 16, 2022. Sibuma subsequently filed a Motion for Reconsideration on May 27, 2022, alleging he received the Resolution electronically on May 22, 2022. On June 29, 2022, the COMELEC Special Second Division issued a Writ of Execution ordering the annulment of Sibuma's proclamation and the proclamation of Eriguel in his stead.","The Supreme Court granted the petition for certiorari with prayer for temporary restraining order and writ of preliminary injunction. The Court annulled and set aside the COMELEC Second Division Resolution dated May 13, 2022, the Certificate of Finality dated May 24, 2022, the Entry of Judgment dated May 24, 2022, and the Writ of Execution dated June 29, 2022. The Court denied the petition to deny due course to or cancel Sibuma's Certificate of Candidacy.","The Supreme Court ruled that the COMELEC Second Division committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction when it cancelled Sibuma's Certificate of Candidacy and nullified his proclamation as the duly elected Mayor of Agoo, La Union. The Court held that there was no substantial evidence that Sibuma committed a deliberately false and deceptive representation of his residence qualifications in his Certificate of Candidacy. The Court emphasized that for a Section 78 petition to prosper, it is essential that a false representation be committed with a deliberate attempt to mislead, misinform, or hide a fact which would otherwise render a candidate ineligible, meaning it must be made with malicious intent to deceive the electorate. The Court found that the COMELEC failed to make findings of intent to deceive on Sibuma's part. The Court held that Section 74 of the Omnibus Election Code only requires that the facts declared in the Certificate of Candidacy be true to the best of the candidate's knowledge, creating a presumption of good faith in favor of a candidate's declaration under oath. The Court found that Sibuma's declaration of residency proceeded from his good faith and firm belief that he possessed the required residency, as confirmed by his supporting documents. The Court noted that Sibuma's domicile remains in Agoo, La Union where he was born and obtained his secondary education, and that he owns residential house and real properties therein together with his wife. The Court emphasized that absence from legal residence to pursue profession, study or do other things of temporary or semi-permanent nature does not constitute loss of residence, and that the animus revertendi to his home had not forsaken him. The Court also ruled that the COMELEC Second Division made a grossly unreasonable appreciation and evaluation of evidence by shifting the burden of proof upon Sibuma, faulting him for trivial matters, and giving improper weight to evidence such as the pro forma certification from the Punong Barangay who was the paternal aunt of respondent Calongcagon, and affidavits of recantation which should be viewed with suspicion. The Court noted that the COMELEC failed to resolve the petition prior to the May 9, 2022 Elections contrary to Section 78 requirements, and that Sibuma was decisively elected by the people with overwhelming votes, necessitating that doubts should have been resolved in favor of his residence qualification to give fullest effect to the manifest will of the people. The Court emphasized that in any action involving reversal of popular electoral choice, utmost effort must be made to resolve issues in a manner that would give effect to the will of the majority, as it is sound public policy to cause elective offices to be filled by those who are the choice of the majority.","The petition was granted. The COMELEC Second Division Resolution dated May 13, 2022, Certificate of Finality dated May 24, 2022, Entry of Judgment dated May 24, 2022, and Writ of Execution dated June 29, 2022 in SPA No. 21-172 (DC) were annulled and set aside. The petition to deny due course to or cancel Sibuma's Certificate of Candidacy was denied. The Certificate of Canvass of Votes and Proclamation of Winning Candidate for Municipal Mayor dated May 10, 2022 proclaiming Frank Ong Sibuma as the duly elected Mayor of the Municipality of Agoo, La Union stands. The Status Quo Ante Order issued by the Court on July 5, 2022 was made permanent."
G.R. No. 257610,"GLENN QUINTOS ALBANO, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, RESPONDENT.

[UDK No. 17230]

CATALINA G. LEONEN-PIZARRO, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, RESPONDENT.","Glenn Quintos Albano was the second nominee of Talino at Galing ng Pinoy Party-List for the May 9, 2022 elections. He previously ran for city councilor in Taguig City during the 2019 elections but lost. Catalina G. Leonen-Pizarro was the president and first nominee of the Arts Business and Science Professionals party-list for the 2022 elections. She previously served three consecutive terms as representative from 2007 to 2016, then ran for mayor of Sudipen, La Union in both 2016 and 2019 elections but lost both times. Both petitioners were rendered ineligible to participate in the 2022 elections as party-list nominees because of Section 8 of Republic Act No. 7941 and Sections 5(d) and 10 of COMELEC Resolution No. 10717, which prohibited persons who lost their bid for elective office in the immediately preceding election from being included in the list of party-list nominees. Both petitioners filed separate petitions challenging the constitutionality of these provisions, claiming they violated the Constitution by adding qualifications beyond those prescribed and violated the equal protection clause.","The Supreme Court granted both petitions and declared unconstitutional the phrase ""a person who has lost his bid for elective office in the immediately preceding election"" under Section 8 of Republic Act No. 7941, as well as its corresponding phrases in Sections 5(d) and 10 of COMELEC Resolution No. 10717.","The Court held that while Congress has the power under Article VI, Section 5(1) of the 1987 Constitution to determine who shall be elected through the party-list system and prescribe qualifications for party-list representatives, any additional qualifications must still comply with the equal protection clause. Applying the rational basis test, the Court found that the challenged provisions failed to demonstrate any rational basis. The classification discriminated against candidates who lost in the previous elections without showing any substantial distinction between them and those who won or did not participate. There was no clear connection between having lost in the immediately preceding election and the probability that such participation would frustrate the policy behind the Party-List System Act, which was to give voice to marginalized and underrepresented sectors. The Court emphasized that no unique circumstance exists attributable to losing candidates in the immediately preceding election that would result in subverting the objective of the party-list system. The prohibition was found to be an arbitrary and whimsical intrusion that violated both the equal protection clause and substantive due process.","The Supreme Court declared invalid and unconstitutional the phrase ""a person who has lost his bid for elective office in the immediately preceding election"" under Section 8 of Republic Act No. 7941, the phrase ""have lost in their bid for an elective office in the May 13, 2019 National and Local Elections"" under Section 5(d) of COMELEC Resolution No. 10717, and the phrase ""or a person who has lost his bid for an elective office in the May 13, 2019 National and Local Elections"" under Section 10 of COMELEC Resolution No. 10717. However, the Court clarified that the valid portion of Section 8 remains, which states: ""The list shall not include any candidate for any elective office,"" meaning a person cannot simultaneously run for another elective office while being a party-list nominee in the same election."
G.R. Nos. 251978-80,"ANECITA C. SUYAT, ASANO E. ABAN, AND MARCELINO P. ENDI, PETITIONERS, VS. COURT OF APPEALS, OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSMAN, AND COMMISSION ON AUDIT, RESPONDENTS.","Petitioners Anecita Suyat (Municipal Treasurer), Asano Aban (Municipal Agricultural Officer), and Marcelino Endi (Municipal Accountant) were officials of Buguias, Benguet who were involved in the procurement of insecticides and fungicides worth P1,050,000.00 under the Farm Inputs and Farm Implements Program in June 2004. On June 25, 2004, five days before Mayor Apolinario Camsol's term ended, a Memorandum of Agreement was executed between the Department of Agriculture and the Municipality for the implementation of the program. The procurement was conducted through personal canvass by petitioner Suyat instead of through public bidding as required by Republic Act No. 9184, the Government Procurement Reform Act. The purchase request prepared by petitioner Aban specified brand names of pesticides, which violated the law. Three suppliers submitted bids, with PMB Agro-Goods & Services winning the contract. The Commission on Audit issued an Audit Observation Memorandum noting irregularities, including the absence of public bidding, lack of consultation with farmer-beneficiaries, and overpricing. Subsequently, a Notice of Disallowance was issued declaring the disbursement irregular. Task Force Abono of the Office of the Ombudsman filed a complaint alleging that the procurement violated procurement laws, involved unfair canvassing among different types of distributorships, and that some farmers claimed they never received the supplies or were required to pay 25% of the purchase price to petitioner Aban before release.","The Supreme Court dismissed the Joint Petition for Certiorari filed by the petitioners and affirmed the Decision dated August 15, 2019 and Resolution dated December 19, 2019 of the Court of Appeals Special 16th Division.","The Supreme Court ruled that petitioners used the wrong mode of review by filing a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 instead of a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45, which is the proper remedy to assail decisions of the Court of Appeals. The Court held that petitioners should have filed their petition within fifteen days from receiving notice of the denial of their motion for reconsideration on January 8, 2020, meaning the deadline was January 23, 2020. However, they filed their petition on March 9, 2020, rendering the Court of Appeals decision final and executory. The Court also ruled that petitioners were not denied due process, as Commission on Audit proceedings do not forestall or postpone the Office of the Ombudsman's independent investigatory powers. The Ombudsman's investigation was based on the complaint filed by Task Force Abono, not solely on the COA audit report, and petitioners had ample opportunity to refute the administrative charges. On the substantive issues, the Court found no reversible error in the findings of the Office of the Ombudsman and Court of Appeals. The procurement violated Republic Act No. 9184's requirement for competitive public bidding, and none of the alternative modes of procurement applied to this case. Even under the old law (Local Government Code of 1991), which allowed personal canvass, petitioners failed to comply with requirements including monetary limitations. The Court emphasized that petitioners, as municipal officials, were duty-bound to know and follow the law, and their ignorance or lack of familiarity with Republic Act No. 9184 was not an excuse. Their actions collectively constituted grave misconduct, conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service, gross neglect of duty, and less serious dishonesty.","The Supreme Court dismissed the Joint Petition for Certiorari and affirmed the Court of Appeals decision finding petitioner Suyat guilty of grave misconduct and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service, petitioner Endi guilty of gross neglect of duty and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service, and petitioner Aban guilty of grave misconduct, conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service, and less serious dishonesty. All three petitioners were dismissed from service with cancellation of civil service eligibility, forfeiture of retirement benefits, perpetual disqualification from holding public office, and bar from taking civil service examinations. In the event dismissal could not be enforced due to resignation, retirement, or separation, the penalty would be converted to a fine equivalent to one-year salary. The Court emphasized that high standards of conduct in public service are not mere rhetoric and that public officers who commit serious offenses reflecting unfitness to continue in office must face administrative sanctions to preserve public faith and confidence in government."

DOMINGUEZ III, BUREAU OF INTERNAL REVENUE COMMISSIONER CAESAR R. DULAY, HOUSE SPEAKER PANTALEON D. ALVAREZ IN REPRESENTATION OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, AND SENATE PRESIDENT AQUILINO D. PIMENTEL III IN REPRESENTATION OF THE SENATE, RESPONDENTS.","These consolidated petitions challenged the constitutionality of Republic Act No. 10963, also known as the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) Act, which was the first package of the Duterte administration's Comprehensive Tax Reform Program intended to fund the government's ""Build, Build, Build"" program. In G.R. No. 236118, petitioners Tinio, Zarate, and Casilao, who were legislators and principal authors of bills that were eventually substituted by House Bill No. 5636, claimed that the TRAIN Act was unconstitutionally passed when the Bicameral Conference Committee Report was ratified on December 13, 2017 despite an alleged lack of quorum in the House of Representatives. They presented a video recording and photograph showing a near-empty session hall during the ratification. They also argued that President Duterte's signing of the bill into law was tainted with grave abuse of discretion. In G.R. No. 236295, petitioners Laban Konsyumer and Dimagiba filed as consumers claiming to be adversely affected by the pass-on excise taxes on diesel, coal, liquefied petroleum gas, and kerosene imposed by the TRAIN Act. They argued that the excise tax on coal did not originate from the House in violation of the Constitution, and that the excise taxes were regressive, constituted taxes on subsistence, and were confiscatory and violative of due process and equal protection. Both sets of petitioners claimed the issues were of transcendental importance and sought injunctive relief to halt implementation of the law.",The Supreme Court declared Republic Act No. 10963 (TRAIN Act) as constitutional and dismissed both consolidated petitions.,"The Supreme Court ruled comprehensively on multiple issues. First, the Court held that it could take cognizance of the case under its expanded power of judicial review since all four requisites for exercising such power were met: there was an actual case or controversy, petitioners had locus standi, the question of constitutionality was raised at the earliest opportunity, and the issue of constitutionality was the very lis mota of the cases. Second, direct recourse to the Supreme Court was justified by the presence of genuine issues of constitutionality and the transcendental nature of the cases. Third, Congress as an institution was substantially impleaded as an indispensable party through the Speaker and Senate President. Fourth, the inclusion of President Duterte as a respondent in G.R. No. 236118 contravened the doctrine of presidential immunity from suit, so he was dropped as a party. On the substantive issues, the Court held that the TRAIN Act was validly enacted into law. The Court emphasized that once a quorum was established at the beginning of a House session, assailing the same is an internal matter best left to the judgment of the congressional body, and that it is within the House's powers to determine how a quorum is counted or sustained. The Court applied the enrolled bill doctrine and the conclusiveness of Congressional Journals, noting that House Journal No. 48 clearly showed there was a quorum during the December 13, 2017 session. The video recording and photograph presented by petitioners were insufficient to overcome the presumption of validity of an official act of a co-equal branch of government. The Court held it could not look beyond what was written in the Journal and the enrolled bill in fealty to the principle of separation of powers. The Court also ruled that Section 48 of the TRAIN Act (excise tax on coal) was not a prohibited rider, as the Constitution does not limit the extent of amendments that may be introduced by the Senate to a House revenue bill. On due process, the Court held that petitioners failed to prove the law was confiscatory or arbitrary, emphasizing that the excise tax provisions must be read together with social welfare provisions designed to assist marginalized sectors. The Court stated it could not substitute its judgment for the wisdom of Congress. Finally, the Court ruled the TRAIN Act did not violate the equal protection clause as there were no specific provisions discriminating against the poor, and that while the excise taxes were regressive by nature, the Constitution does not prohibit regressive taxes but merely directs Congress to evolve a progressive system of taxation, which is not a judicially enforceable right.","The Supreme Court declared Republic Act No. 10963 (Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion Act) as constitutional. The Court dismissed the consolidated petitions in G.R. Nos. 236118 and 236295, denied petitioners' prayer for the issuance of a temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction contained in both petitions, and denied the Urgent Motion for the Issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order, Status Quo Ante Order and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction dated December 3, 2018 filed by petitioners in G.R. No. 236295. The Court also dropped former President Rodrigo Roa Duterte as a party respondent in G.R. No. 236118. The Court emphasized that while it acknowledges the effects of the TRAIN Act may be felt more acutely by vulnerable members of society, it is not within its province to supplant a presumably constitutional statute absent compelling proof of its invalidity, and that the principal check against abuse of the power to tax resides primarily in the responsibility of the legislature to its constituency."
G.R. No. 235534,"EDWARD R. AÑONUEVO, PETITIONER, VS. CBK POWER COMPANY, LTD. (CBK), HIROSHI TANIMURA (CHIEF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER-CBK), SERVILLANO DUNGLAO (VP FOR ADMINISTRATION-CBK), AND TCS MANPOWER SERVICES, INC. (TCS), RESPONDENTS.","On January 3, 2013, Añonuevo filed a complaint for illegal dismissal, regularization, attorney's fees, and moral and exemplary damages against respondents CBK Power Company, Ltd. (CBK), Hiroshi Tanimura (Tanimura), CBK's Chief Administrative Officer, and Servillano Dunglao (Dunglao), CBK's Vice-President for Administration.[6]

In his Affidavit,[7] Añonuevo alleged that on or about July 10, 2008, he went to the office of CBK's Human Resources Department in Kalayaan, Laguna to apply for work as a maintenance technician at CBK's Kalayaan Power Plant. However, he was instructed by CBK's staff to apply with Rolpson Enterprise (Rolpson), one of CBK's manpower providers. On the same day, Añonuevo went to Rolpson's office and there he was told that while he was to work at CBK, he would be getting his salary from Rolpson. On July 14, 2008, he started working at CBK's Kalayaan Power Plant under the Quality Management System Department.

On June 15, 2010, Añonuevo was allegedly informed by CBK that from then on, he would be receiving his salary from TCS Manpower Services, Inc. (TCS) instead of Rolpson. Thereafter, on March 9, 2011, he was required by TCS to sign two employment contracts: (a) a contract for the period of June 16, 2010 to November 15, 2010; and (b) a contract for the period of November 16, 2010 to April 15, 2011.[8]

On December 14, 2012, TCS informed Añonuevo that his employment at CBK will be terminated effective December 31, 2012 in view of the expiration of the service contract between TCS and CBK. On December 19, 2012, he reported for work but he was escorted out of CBK's premises upon the order of Dunglao, who declared that Añonuevo was no longer allowed inside CBK's premises as he had already been terminated from work. This prompted Añonuevo to file the subject complaint.

Añonuevo claimed that at the time of his dismissal, he was already a regular employee of CBK.[9] He stressed that since there was no written contract between him and Rolpson, he had become CBK's regular employee on his first day of work on July 4, 2008.[10] Añonuevo further maintained that he performed activities which were usually necessary or desirable in CBK's electric power generation business, namely, ""monitoring and reporting on activities of CBK's contractors in rehabilitating old and flooded turbines and in repairing the generator of another turbine; performing various IT jobs; safety patrol duties, and computer drawing.""[11] Añonuevo also averred that Rolpson and TCS were labor-only contractors as it was CBK who controlled the performance of his work and supplied all the tools and equipment that he used in doing his job, i.e., ""computers, testing instruments, office supplies, vehicles, etc.""[12] He likewise underscored that at the time of his dismissal, there was no longer any subsisting contract between him and TCS.[13] Thus, Añonuevo argued that he was illegally dismissed by CBK, there being no just or authorized cause warranting the termination of his employment.[14]

For their part, CBK, Tanimura, and Dunglao denied that CBK had any employment relationship with Añonuevo.[15] They averred that CBK is a duly registered and existing partnership engaged in the business of power production that was awarded the contract for operating the Kalayaan, Botocan, and Caliraya Power Plants owned by the National Power Corporation (NAPOCOR).[16] Pursuant to its Build Rehabilitate Operate and Transfer Agreement with NAPOCOR, CBK allegedly absorbed the NAPOCOR employees for its core operation or business of power production and contracted out temporary and incidental non-core business jobs and job undertaking to legitimate job contractors such as TCS.[17] CBK, Tanimura, and Dunglao maintained that the complaint should be dismissed in relation to CBK on the ground of lack of jurisdiction because CBK, based on the four-­fold test, was not the employer of Añonuevo.[18]

TCS intervened in NLRC Case No. RAB-IV-01-00010-13-L. In its Position Paper,[19] TCS averred that it was the employer of Añonuevo and that it was a duly registered independent contractor with a valid service contract with CBK. It claimed that it hired the services of Añonuevo on June 16, 2010 to November 2010 as IT Technician assigned to CBK and that Añonuevo's employment contract was automatically renewed following the renewal of TCS's contract with CBK. On December 12, 2012, TCS informed Añonuevo of the expiration of the service contract and directed the latter to report to TCS's head office. However, Añonuevo did not comply with TCS's directive.","This resolves the Petition for Review under Rule 45[1] (Petition) filed by petitioner Edward R. Añonuevo (Añonuevo) to assail the June 23, 2017 Decision[2] and November 6, 2017 Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 134064.

In the June 23, 2017 Decision, the CA found no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) in rendering its October 21, 2013 Decision,[4] which affirmed the June 23, 2013 Decision[5] of Labor Arbiter Enrico Angelo C. Portillo (Labor Arbiter) in NLRC Case No. RAB IV-01-00010-13-L. The Labor Arbiter dismissed Añonuevo's complaint for illegal dismissal. The CA's December 16, 2013 Resolution denied Añonuevo's Motion for Reconsideration.","The Petition is impressed with merit.

At the outset, the Court underscores that in labor cases, a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 is limited to determining whether the CA was correct in finding the presence or absence of grave abuse of discretion and jurisdictional errors on the part of the NLRC.[25]

There is grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC when its findings and conclusions are not supported by substantial evidence, i.e., that amount of relevant evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion.[26]

In the present case, the Court finds that the CA erred in finding that the NLRC committed no grave abuse of discretion in affirming the dismissal of Añonuevo's complaint. The evidence relied upon by the Labor Arbiter, the NLRC, and the CA was insufficient to support their conclusion that Añonuevo was an employee of TCS. On the contrary, the evidence points to CBK as Añonuevo's real employer.

Añonuevo is CBK's employee

In his submissions to the Labor Arbiter, the NLRC, and the CA, Añonuevo consistently maintained that he became a regular employee of CBK on his very first day of work since Rolpson was a labor-only contractor. However, the Labor Arbiter, the NLRC, and the CA, without so much as an explanation, all skirted this issue squarely raised by Añonuevo.

It bears stressing that CBK never refuted Añonuevo's allegation that he started working at the Kalayaan Power Plant operated by CBK on July 14, 2008. However, CBK insisted that Añonuevo was Rolpson's employee as it was the latter which engaged Añonuevo to perform services under Rolpson's legitimate sub-contracting arrangement with CBK.[27]

CBK fails to persuade.

Article 106 of the Labor Code, which governs job contracting, provides:
ARTICLE 106. Contractor or Subcontractor. — Whenever an employer enters into a contract with another person for the performance of the former's work, the employees of the contractor and of the latter's subcontractor, if any, shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of this Code.

In the event that the contractor or subcontractor fails to pay the wages of his employees in accordance with this Code, the employer shall be jointly and severally liable with his contractor or subcontractor to such employees to the extent of the work performed under the contract, in the same manner and extent that he is liable to employees directly employed by him.

The Secretary of Labor and Employment may, by appropriate regulations, restrict or prohibit the contracting-out of labor to protect the rights of workers established under this Code. In so prohibiting or restricting, he may make appropriate distinctions between labor-only contracting and job contracting as well as differentiations within these types of contracting and determine who among the parties involved shall be considered the employer for purposes of this Code, to prevent any violation or circumvention of any provision of this Code.

There is ""labor-only"" contracting where the person supplying workers to an employer does not have substantial capital or investment in the form of tools, equipment, machineries, work premises, among others, and the workers recruited and placed by such person are performing activities which are directly related to the principal business of such employer. In such cases, the person or intermediary shall be considered merely as an agent of the employer who shall be responsible to the workers in the same manner and extent as if the latter were directly employed by him. (Emphasis supplied)
Labor-only contracting is prohibited as it is seen as a circumvention of labor laws.[28] To protect labor, the general presumption is that a contractor is engaged in labor-only contracting.[29] Thus, the burden of proving that Rolpson and TCS are not labor-only contractors rests on the respondents.","In the present case, respondents clearly acted in bad faith. As discussed above, CBK, in cooperation with TCS, employed a scheme designed to allow CBK to evade being identified as Añonuevo's employer and the consequences of Añonuevo's regularization. Since Añonuevo's dismissal resulted from prohibited labor-only contracting and considering further that the respondents' unjust acts compelled Añonuevo to litigate to protect his rights, the Court deems it reasonable to award moral damages and exemplary damages in the amount of PHP 50,000.00 each and 10% attorney's fees, to be paid jointly and solidarily by the respondents pursuant to Article 109 of the Labor Code.[60]

Finally, in line with this Court's ruling in Nacar v. Gallery Frames,[61] the monetary awards are subject to 6% interest per annum from the finality of this Decision until full payment.

WHEREFORE, the Petition is GRANTED. The assailed June 23, 2017 Decision and November 6, 2017 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 134064 are REVERSED. The respondents are ORDERED to reinstate petitioner Edward R. Añonuevo to his former position without loss of seniority rights and other privileges, and to pay him: (a) backwages from his illegal dismissal on December 19, 2012, up to his actual reinstatement and should reinstatement be no longer be feasible, separation pay at one month's pay for every year of service; (b) moral damages of PHP 50,000.00; (c) exemplary damages of PHP 50,000.00; (d) and ten percent (10%) of all the sums due under this Decision as attorney's fees.

The monetary awards shall bear the legal interest rate of six percent (6%) per annum to be computed from the finality of this Decision until full payment.

The case is REMANDED to the Labor Arbiter for the computation of the total monetary benefits due Añonuevo in accordance with this Decision.

SO ORDERED."
A.C. No. 13588,"MIGUEL G. NAVARRETE AND MIGUELITO G. NAVARRETE, JR., COMPLAINANTS, VS. ATTY. CONSTANTE V. BRILLANTES, JR., RESPONDENT.","Complainants alleged that on October 30, 2004, respondent drafted, prepared, and notarized a Deed of Real Estate Mortgage[2] (DREM) in favor of a Willy Sebastian (Sebastian) involving the property co-owned by them (complainants) with their elder brother, Michael Dinno Navarrete (Dinno). They claimed that the DREM was executed without their knowledge and that respondent falsified and made it appear therein that they (complainants) were of legal age when in fact, Miguel was only 15 years old and Miguelito, Jr. was 13 years old at the time of the DREM's execution. Further, complainants alleged that respondent deliberately allowed complete strangers to sign their names as MGN and MGN, Jr., respectively, on the DREM.[3]

Complainants asserted that respondent's notarization of the DREM served as evidence that he knowingly and deliberately took part in the fraud committed against them by Sebastian. Further, they claimed that respondent defended the fraud committed by Sebastian, respondent's client, before the courts and the offices of our legal system.[4]

In support of their allegations, complainants attached copies of the following documents, among others: (a) Transfer Certificate of Title No. (TCT) T-1077136;[5] (b) their birth certificates showing that Miguel was born on March 14, 1989, while Miguelito, Jr. was born on May 22, 1991;[6] (c) the DREM and its Amendment;[7] (d) TCTs issued in favor of Sebastian;[8] (e) complainants' respective IDs;[9] (f) complainants' Joint Reply-Affidavit in the criminal complaint for estafa through falsification they (complainants) filed against respondent;[10] (g) the Community Tax Certificates (CTCs) and IDs presented to respondent as proof of identity of the persons who pretended to be them (complainants) as signatories to the DREM;[11] (h) respondent's Comment/Opposition to their Petition for Review with the Department of Justice;[12] and (i) their Amended Complaint and Second Amended Complaint before the trial court in the civil case they filed against Sebastian for the cancellation of the mortgage, extrajudicial foreclosure sale, and title.[13]

In his Answer,[14] respondent denied violating the 2004 Notarial Rules and the CPR, asserting that he in fact ascertained the identities of the persons who appeared before him when he prepared and notarized the DREM by having them present their CTCs and IDs, which he photocopied. Together, these documents confirmed the identities of the persons as Miguel and Miguelito, Jr. and that they were both of legal age. Additionally, respondent claimed that he merely copied the information in the property's TCT which explicitly states that complainants were of legal age.[15]

Respondent likewise averred that the persons who appeared before him were in fact accompanied by Miguelito R. Navarette, Sr. (Miguelito, Sr.), complainants' father who introduced the former as his sons, and Dinno, who acknowledged them as his brothers.[16] Respondent likewise pointed out that complainants, together with Miguelito, Sr., Dinno, Alexander R. Navarrete, and Michael Leandro A. Navarrete, executed an Extrajudicial Settlement of Estate[17] in July 2003 where they (complainants) likewise represented themselves as ""of legal age"" and by virtue of which, TCT No. T-077136 were issued in complainants' and Dinno's names. In this respect, respondent noted that the signatures of the persons who claimed to be Miguel and Miguelito, Jr. in the DREM are similar to complainants' signatures in the said Extrajudicial Settlement of Estate – signatures which complainants never questioned.[18]

Moreover, respondent pointed out that it was Atty. Rolando B. Bernardo who notarized the Amended DREM and not him, but complainants did not administratively charge the former.[19] Respondent also claimed that in the civil cases they filed against him and his client, complainants never questioned – in any of the pleadings they filed before the court – the validity of the DREM on the ground that they were minors at the time of its execution.[20]

Further, respondent asserted that the filing of the administrative complaint was merely an afterthought. In this regard, respondent pointed out that the DREM was executed and notarized on October 20, 2004 or almost twelve (12) years before the filing of the administrative complaint on October 7, 2016. Thus, respondent argued that the filing of the complaint is intended to harass and coerce him to convince his client to amicably settle or withdraw the civil case filed by complainants against his client pending before the Regional Trial Court of Bacoor, Cavite.[21]

Finally, respondent averred that this is the first time that an administrative case had been filed against him in his over 25 years of practice.[22] He added that at the time of the execution of the DREM, the 2004 Notarial Rules had just been enacted[23] and hence, it was not clear what constituted competent evidence of identity. In this respect, he pointed out that said Rules did not enumerate the documents considered as competent evidence of identity, which was in fact why he required the signatories to present their CTCs and IDs and had them sign the Notarial Register.","Before the Court is an administrative complaint[1] for disbarment filed by complainants Miguel G. Navarrete (Miguel) and Miguelito G. Navarrete, Jr. (Miguelito, Jr.; collectively, complainants) against respondent Atty. Constante V. Brillantes, Jr. (respondent) with the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) for allegedly violating the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice (2004 Notarial Rules) and Rules 1.01, 1.02, Canon 1, and Rule 10.01, Canon 10 of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR).","The Court affirms and adopts the findings and recommendations of the IBP with modifications, as will be explained hereunder.

Time and again, the Court has emphasized that ""notarization is not an empty, meaningless or routinary act, but one invested with substantive public interest. Notarization converts a private document into a public document, making it admissible in evidence without further proof of its authenticity. Thus, a notarized document is, by law, entitled to full faith and credit upon its face. It is for this reason that a notary public must observe with utmost care the basic requirements in the performance of his notarial duties; otherwise, the public's confidence in the integrity of a notarized document would be undermined.""[38] In this light, the Court has ruled that notaries must inform themselves of the facts they certify to; most importantly, they should not take part or allow themselves to be part of illegal transactions.[39]

In this regard, the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice provides that a notary public should not notarize a document unless the signatory to the document is in the notary's presence personally at the time of the notarization, and personally known to the notary public or otherwise identified through competent evidence of identity.[40] Section 12, Rule II of the same rules defines ""competent evidence of identity"" as follows:
Section 12. Competent Evidence of Identity. – The phrase ""competent evidence of identity"" refers to the identification of an individual based on:

(a)
at least one current identification document issued by an official agency bearing the photograph and signature of the individual;[41] or
(b)
the oath or affirmation of one credible witness not privy to the instrument, document or transaction who is personally known to the notary public and who personally knows the individual, or of two credible witnesses neither of whom is privy to the instrument, document or transaction who each personally knows the individual and shows to the notary public documentary identification. (Emphases and underscoring supplied)
Evidently, based on these Rules, notaries public should not notarize a document unless the person who signed the same is the very person who executed and personally appeared before them to attest to the contents and the truth of what are stated therein. This requirement, in turn, is fulfilled by the presentation by the attesting person of competent evidence of identity.

In this case, respondent was duly found by the IBP to have been remiss in the faithful observance of his duties as a notary public when he failed to properly confirm the identity of the persons claiming to be Miguel and Miguelito, Jr. through the competent evidence of identity required by the 2004 Notarial Rules. Case law settles that a community tax certificate or cedula is no longer considered as a valid and competent evidence of identity not only because it is not included in the list of competent evidence of identity under the Rules; even more, a CTC does not bear the photograph and signature of the persons appearing before them – requirements which the 2004 Notarial Rules deem as the more appropriate and competent means by which notaries public can ascertain the person's identity.[42]

Indeed, the records plainly show that complainants were still minors at the time of the execution of the DREM on October 30, 2004. Hence, they could not have been the persons who appeared before respondent and represented themselves as Miguel and Miguelito, Jr., to sign and execute the DREM. Had respondent been more circumspect in performing his duties and asked for identification documents issued by an official agency bearing their photograph and signature as required by the 2004 Notarial Rules, he would have immediately discovered that the persons before him were not the persons whom they purported to be. Thus, by accepting the CTCs presented by the persons who claimed to be complainants as evidence of identity, respondent made it appear that complainants personally appeared before him and subscribed the DREM in violation of the 2004 Notarial Rules.

Notably, while respondent claimed to have further verified the identity of the persons who represented themselves as Miguel and Miguelito, Jr. by asking them to present their respective IDs, it bears pointing out that the IDs presented by them were issued by mere private institutions, i.e., the University of Perpetual Help of Rizal and MRN Construction, and hence, not the identification documents issued by an official agency required by the 2004 Notarial Rules.","ACCORDINGLY, the Court finds respondent Atty. Constante V. Brillantes, Jr. GUILTY of violating the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice. He is hereby SUSPENDED from the practice of law for a period of six (6) months effective upon receipt of this Decision. Moreover, his notarial commission, if any, is hereby IMMEDIATELY REVOKED, and he is DISQUALIFIED from being commissioned as a notary public for a period of two (2) years. He is STERNLY WARNED that a repetition of the same offense or similar acts in the future shall be dealt with more severely.

The suspension from the practice of law, the disqualification from being commissioned as notary public, and the revocation of his notarial commission, if any, shall take effect immediately upon receipt of this Decision by respondent. He is DIRECTED to immediately file a Manifestation to the Court that his suspension has started, copy furnished all courts and quasi-judicial bodies where he has entered his appearance as counsel.

Let copies of this Decision be furnished to the Office of the Bar Confidant to be appended to respondent's personal record as an attorney; the Integrated Bar of the Philippines for its information and guidance; and the Office of the Court Administrator for circulation to all courts in the country.

A.M. No. RTJ-23-029 (Formerly OCA IPI No. 19-4955-RTJ),"SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, REPRESENTED BY COMMISSIONER EMILIO B. AQUINO, COMPLAINANT, VS. HON. OSCAR P. NOEL, JR., PRESIDING JUDGE, BRANCH 35, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, GENERAL SANTOS CITY, SOUTH COTABATO, RESPONDENT.","On February 14, 2019, the SEC issued a Cease and Desist Order (CDO)[2] against Kapa-Community Ministry International, Inc. (KAPA) after discovering that the latter was selling securities in the form of investment contracts, in violation of Republic Act No. (RA) 8799, otherwise known as ""The Securities Regulation Code"" (SRC).[3] KAPA initially filed a motion before the SEC seeking the lifting of the CDO, but later on, withdrew the same. On March 1, 2019, KAPA filed the subject case[4] for injunction with application for issuance of a temporary restraining order (TRO) and/or writ of preliminary injunction (WPI) before the RTC, essentially claiming that the CDO issued by the SEC violated its right to religious freedom.[5]

In an Order[6] dated March 1, 2019, the RTC Branch 58 denied KAPA's prayer for a 72-hour TRO on the ground that its proper remedy is to file a motion to lift the CDO before the SEC. Thereafter, the subject ease was raffled to the RTC Branch 35 where respondent sits as Presiding Judge. Thereafter, the following incidents occurred: (a) on March 12, 2019, the SEC was personally served with a Notice of Hearing[7] for a hearing scheduled on March 13, 2019; (b) on March 13, 2019, the SEC filed a Manifestation (Ex Abudanti Ad Cautelam)[8] contending that the RTC had no jurisdiction over the subject matter of the case but respondent formally expunged the same[9] on even date for violation of the Efficient Use of Paper Rule; (c) in an Order[10] dated March 15, 2019, respondent granted KAPA's prayer for a 20-day TRO on the ground that such prayer went unopposed, and proceeded to issue the same[11] on March 19, 2019; (d) in an Order[12] dated April 4, 2019, respondent issued a WPI in favor of KAPA, again on the ground that such prayer went unopposed. In granting the TRO and WPI, respondent opined that the regular courts, and not the SEC, have jurisdiction over issues involving the constitutional right to the free exercise of religion; that the power of the SEC is limited to issues on securities trading; and that the TRO and WPI did not cover issues on securities because said matter was not raised by KAPA in its petition.[13]

In light of the foregoing, the SEC filed the instant complaint for, inter alia, Gross Ignorance of the Law against respondent. Essentially, the SEC contended that it is a co-equal body of RTCs, and hence, the RTCs cannot interfere with or overturn its rulings. In this regard, the SEC pointed out Section 179 of RA 11232, otherwise known as the ""Revised Corporation Code of the Philippines"" (RCC),[14] which provides that ""[n]o court below the Court of Appeals shall have jurisdiction to issue a restraining order, preliminary injunction, or preliminary mandatory injunction in any case, dispute, or controversy that directly or indirectly interferes with the exercise of the powers, duties and responsibilities of the Commission that falls exclusively within its jurisdiction."" As such, respondent's acts of issuing a TRO and WPI against the CDO constitutes Gross Ignorance of the Law.[15]

In his Comment,""[16] respondent maintained that the charges against him were baseless and that the SEC has only itself to blame for failing to perform its duties of defending its position in court. According to respondent, the SEC was duly notified of the hearings for the TRO and WPI but did not attend the same. Furthermore, respondent insisted that the RTC has jurisdiction over the subject case, considering that KAPA raised the constitutional issue of free exercise of religion, and did not delve on trading and securities. Finally, respondent posited that if the SEC does not agree with his orders, then it should have availed of the judicial remedies available to it under the Rules.[17]","This administrative matter arose from a Complaint[1] filed by complainant Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), represented by Commissioner Emilio B. Aquino, charging respondent Hon. Oscar P. Noel, Jr (respondent), Presiding Judge of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of General Santos City, South Cotabato, Branch 35 with Gross Ignorance of the Law in connection with Special Civil Case No. 19-806, entitled ""Kapa-Community Ministry International, Inc., represented by Pastor Joel A. Apolinario v. Securities and Exchange Commission"" (subject case).","The Supreme Court adopted the findings of the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) with certain modifications and found the respondent judge guilty of Gross Ignorance of the Law for issuing a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) and Writ of Preliminary Injunction (WPI) against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), despite the SEC being a co-equal body vested with quasi-judicial powers. The Court applied A.M. No. 21-08-09-SC, or the Further Amendments to Rule 140 of the Rules of Court, which took effect in April 2022 and applies retroactively to all pending administrative disciplinary cases involving members of the judiciary.

The Court emphasized that judges must have mastery of the law and must perform their duties in a way that upholds public confidence in the judicial system. It explained that gross ignorance of the law occurs when a judge disregards basic and settled legal principles, especially when the law involved is clear and straightforward. In this case, the respondent judge violated fundamental doctrines by interfering with the SEC’s authority. Under existing laws and jurisprudence, Regional Trial Courts (RTCs) have no jurisdiction to enjoin or restrain the acts of co-equal bodies like the SEC, as stated in the doctrine of judicial stability and Section 179 of the Revised Corporation Code (RCC), which expressly prohibits lower courts from issuing restraining orders that interfere with the SEC’s powers. Moreover, the respondent disregarded the doctrine of primary jurisdiction, since the matter involved the enforcement of the Securities Regulation Code, which is under the SEC’s exclusive jurisdiction. The Court rejected the judge’s defense that the case involved constitutional issues on religious freedom, stating that the injunction still had the effect of restraining a lawful SEC order.

Because of these clear violations, the Court held that the judge’s lack of understanding of fundamental rules demonstrated gross ignorance of the law and undermined public trust in the judiciary. Under the amended Rule 140, gross ignorance of the law is a serious charge punishable by dismissal, suspension, or fine. The Court noted that the respondent had previously been found administratively liable twice for the same offense—once admonished and once reprimanded, the latter of which counts as an aggravating circumstance. Despite this being his third offense, the Court opted not to impose dismissal, explaining that the primary goal of administrative cases is accountability and the restoration of public trust, not mere punishment.

Accordingly, the Supreme Court imposed on the respondent a penalty of suspension from office for two (2) years without salary and other benefits, with a stern warning that a repetition of the same or similar acts will be dealt with more severely, possibly with dismissal from service. The Court concluded by reminding that judges must always embody competence, integrity, probity, and independence, and that ignorance of basic legal principles erodes public confidence in the courts and warrants disciplinary action.","ACCORDINGLY, the Court finds respondent Oscar P. Noel, Jr., Presiding Judge of the Regional Trial Court of General Santos City, South Cotabato, Branch 35, GUILTY of Gross Ignorance of the Law. He is hereby SUSPENDED from office without salary and other benefits for a period of two years, and is STERNLY WARNED that a repetition of the same or similar acts shall be dealt with more severely.

Let a copy of this Decision be attached to the personal record of responded judge.

SO ORDERED."
 A.C. No. 13664,"ATTY. PEDRO L. LINSANGAN, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. F. GEORGE P. LUCERO, RESPONDENT.","Complainant alleged that on April 2, 2007, respondent obtained a loan from him in the amount of P100,000.00, for which respondent issued a post-dated check dated April 30, 2007. After said loan became due, respondent promised to pay complainant. However, respondent suddenly stopped communicating with complainant, prompting the latter to deposit the post-dated check. Consequently, such check was dishonored for being drawn against a closed account.[2]

Thus, on August 21, 2007, complainant wrote a letter notifying respondent about the dishonored check, and accordingly, demanded for the payment of the loan. Thereafter, or on February 23, 2014, complainant's son, Atty. Gerardo M. Linsangan, notified respondent's daughter, Adelaida Sophia Marie F. Lucero (Adelaida), about the dishonored check. The following day, Adelaida informed complainant that ""[respondent had] been informed,"" and that in the future, he should be dealing with respondent directly.[3]

Despite the reasonable time given to respondent to pay his obligation, he still defaulted, which prompted the filing of the instant complaint. Mainly, complainant argued that respondent's act of issuing a bouncing check was tantamount to gross misconduct; and hence, the latter should be disbarred.[4]

In the course of the proceedings, respondent was served with several orders, but there was no proof that he was able to receive the same. Eventually, or on February 28, 2022, respondent was finally successfully furnished with said orders. Despite the foregoing, respondent failed to file his position paper; thus, the case was submitted for resolution on March 1, 2022.[5]","For the Court's resolution is the Complaint[1] for disbarment dated March 17, 2014 filed by complainant Atty. Pedro L. Linsangan (complainant) against respondent Atty. F. George P. Lucero (respondent) before the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP).","The Court affirms with modification the IBP's findings of fact and recommendations.

It is settled that a lawyer's deliberate failure to pay his obligations and the issuance of a dishonored check amount to gross misconduct,[12] which is punishable under Section 27, Rule 138 of the Rules of Court, thus:[13]

Sec. 27. Disbarment and suspension of attorneys by Supreme Court, grounds therefor. - A member of the bar may be disbarred or suspended from his office as attorney by the Supreme Court for any deceit, malpractice or other gross misconduct in such office, grossly immoral conduct or by reason of his conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude, or for any violation of the oath which he is required to take before admission to practice, or for a willful disobedience appearing as attorney for a party without authority so to do. x x x

In the Court's considered view, respondent's act of issuing a worthless check was an outright violation of the law. It clearly showed that he was unmindful of the deleterious effect of his act to the public interest and public order.[14] This is violative of Canon 1, Rule 1.01 and Canon 7, Rule 7.03 of the CPR,[15] viz.:

CANON 1 – A LAWYER SHALL UPHOLD THE CONSTITUTION, OBEY THE LAWS OF THE LAND AND PROMOTE RESPECT FOR LAW OF AND LEGAL PROCESSES.

Rule 1.01 – A lawyer shall not engage in unlawful, dishonest, immoral or deceitful conduct.

x x x x

CANON 7 – A LAWYER SHALL AT ALL TIMES UPHOLD THE INTEGRITY AND DIGNITY OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION AND SUPPORT THE ACTIVITIES OF THE INTEGRATED BAR.

x x x x

Rule 7.03 – A lawyer shall not engage in conduct that adversely reflects on his fitness to practice law, nor shall he whether in public or private life, behave in a scandalous manner to the discredit of the legal profession.

The duty of a lawyer is to uphold the integrity and dignity of the legal profession at all times. It can only be done by faithfully performing the lawyer's duties to society, to the bar, to the courts, and to his clients. Any misconduct that tends to besmirch the fair name of an honorable profession cannot be tolerated.[16] Verily, respondent's conduct indicates his lack of personal honesty and good moral character as to render him unworthy of public confidence, and constitutes a ground for disciplinary action.[17]

To further aggravate respondent's administrative liability, the Court notes that he failed to file his position paper before the IBP, thereby defying the IBP's orders to do so. Resultantly, this caused undue delay in the resolution of the instant case, thereby constituting violations of Canon 11 and Canon 12, Rule 12.04 of the CPR, which respectively read:

CANON 11 – A LAWYER SHALL OBSERVE AND MAINTAIN THE RESPECT DUE TO THE COURTS AND TO JUDICIAL OFFICERS AND SHOULD INSIST ON SIMILAR CONDUCT BY OTHERS.

x x x x

CANON 12 – A LAWYER SHALL EXERT EVERY EFFORT AND CONSIDER IT HIS DUTY TO ASSIST IN THE SPEEDY AND EFFICIENT ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE.

x x x x

Rule 12.04 – A lawyer shall not unduly delay a case, impede the execution of a judgment or misuse Court processes.

At the minimum, members of the legal fraternity are obligated to accord courts of justice respect, courtesy, and such other becoming conduct essential in the promotion of orderly, impartial, and speedy justice. Clearly, what respondent has done (i.e., disregarding the IBP's directives) was the exact opposite of such obligation; hence, he should be disciplined accordingly.[18]

Respondent's administrative liability having been established, the Court now goes into the imposable penalties on him. In this regard, case law instructs that in determining the appropriate penalty on an errant lawyer, sound judicial discretion based on the surrounding facts is required.[19]

In Grande v. Atty. Silva,[20] the Court, through Justice Consuelo Ynares-Santiago, imposed the penalty of suspension from the practice of law for a period of two (2) years against the errant lawyer for issuing a worthless check.

In Santos-Tan v. Atty. Robiso,[21] the Court, through Justice Dante O. Tinga, ruled that the issuance of a worthless check is a violation of the lawyer's oath and the CPR. Accordingly, it imposed upon the erring lawyer the suspension from the practice of law for a period of one (1) year.

In the similar cases of Arroyo-Posidio v. Atty. Vitan[22] and Castillo v. Atty. Taguines,[23] the Court, through Justice Consuelo Ynares-Santiago and former Chief Justice Artemio Panganiban, respectively, imposed upon the erring lawyers the penalty of suspension from the practice of law for a period of one (1) year for issuing a bouncing check.

In Bernasconi v. Atty. Demaisip,[24] the Court, through Justice Samuel H. Gaerlan, found Atty. Demaisip guilty of gross misconduct in violation of the CPR in, among others, issuing a worthless check. Accordingly, it imposed the penalty of suspension from the practice of law for a period of one (1) year, with a stern warning that a repetition of the same or similar act in the future shall be dealt with more severely.

Moreover, in several cases,[25] the Court imposed a fine in the amount of P5,000.00 against respondent for failure to comply with the court directives.

In view of the foregoing, the Court deems it proper to modify the penalty imposed against respondent to suspension from the practice of law for a period of one (1) year. He is likewise ordered to pay a fine of P5,000.00 due to his disregard of court directives. In addition, he is sternly warned that a repetition of the same offense or similar act shall be dealt with more severely.

On a final note, it is worthy to emphasize that the nature of the office of an attorney requires that a lawyer shall be a person of good moral character. Since this qualification is a condition precedent to a license to enter upon the practice of law, the maintenance thereof is equally essential during the continuance of the practice and the exercise of the privilege. Gross misconduct which puts the lawyer's moral character in serious doubt may render them unfit to continue in the practice of law,[26] as in this case.","ACCORDINGLY, respondent Atty. F. George P. Lucero (respondent) is found GUILTY of gross misconduct and violation of the lawyer's oath and Canon 1, Rule 1.01, Canon 7, Rule 7.03, Canon 11, and Canon 12, Rule 12.04 of the Code of Professional Responsibility. He is SUSPENDED from the practice of law for a period of one (1) year and FINED in the amount of P5,000.00, with a STERN WARNING that a repetition of the same offense or similar act shall be dealt with more severely.

The suspension from the practice of law shall take effect immediately upon receipt of this Decision by respondent. He is DIRECTED to immediately file a Manifestation to the Court that his suspension has started, copy furnished all courts and quasi-judicial bodies where he has entered his appearance as counsel.

Let copies of this Decision be furnished to the Office of the Bar Confidant to be appended to respondent's personal record as an attorney; the Integrated Bar of the Philippines for its information and guidance; and the Office of the Court Administrator for circulation to all courts in the country.

[G.R. No. 230186]

ERNEST DE LEON ESCALER, PETITIONER, VS. SANDIGANBAYAN [SPECIAL THIRD DIVISION] AND REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENTS.","The case originates from a 2002 complaint by Congressman Mark Jimenez accusing former Justice Secretary Hernando B. Perez of extorting US$2 million through threats and intimidation to drop criminal cases against him, with the funds allegedly transferred via foreign bank accounts in Hong Kong, Cayman Islands, Switzerland, and the Philippines involving intermediaries like Ramon C. Arceo, Jr. and Ernest De Leon Escaler. The Office of the Ombudsman investigated starting in 2005, finding probable cause for related crimes but initially deferring forfeiture under RA 1379 for further study; criminal charges were filed in 2008 but dismissed by the Sandiganbayan in 2013 for lack of probable cause and speedy trial violations, a ruling affirmed by the Supreme Court. In 2014, the Republic filed a civil forfeiture petition (SB-14-CVL-0002) against Perez, his wife Rosario, Arceo, and Escaler, alleging the US$2 million as unlawfully acquired property manifestly disproportionate to their lawful incomes during Perez's incumbency from 1995-2001. Petitioners moved to dismiss on grounds of res judicata, forum shopping, speedy disposition violations, and lack of cause of action, but the Sandiganbayan denied these, finding a prima facie case after a valid preliminary inquiry by the Ombudsman.
","The Supreme Court dismissed the consolidated petitions for certiorari, finding no grave abuse of discretion by the Sandiganbayan in denying the motions to dismiss and remand, thereby affirming the continuance of the forfeiture proceedings.
","Under RA 1379, forfeiture proceedings target properties unlawfully acquired by public officers that are manifestly out of proportion to their lawful income, with a presumption of state ownership upon prima facie showing, and such actions are imprescriptible per the Constitution; properties transferred to spouses, relatives, or nominees like Escaler must be included, and the Ombudsman holds authority under RA 6770 to initiate without a taxpayer suit based on its investigative mandate. No res judicata or forum shopping exists, as the prior criminal dismissal (People v.

G.R. No. 259422 (Formerly UDK-17231),"KAIMO CONDOMINIUM BUILDING CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. LAVERNE REALTY & DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION, RESPONDENT.","On December 15, 2006, the Quezon City Government auctioned the Kaimo Condominium Building for unpaid real property taxes, with respondent Laverne Realty & Development Corporation as the highest bidder. After payment and expiration of the redemption period without redemption, the City Treasurer issued a Final Bill of Sale to Laverne, leading to the issuance of a new Transfer Certificate of Title in Laverne's name. Laverne obtained a Writ of Possession, but this was quashed by the Regional Trial Court (Branch 220) on motions filed by Philippine Trust Company and petitioner Kaimo Condominium Building Corporation. On October 22, 2015, Laverne forcibly entered the building, evicted tenants, and constructed barriers. Petitioner filed a Petition for Contempt in Branch 226, alleging indirect contempt for defying the quashal order. Meanwhile, the Kaimos (unit owners) filed a separate Forcible Entry Case in the Metropolitan Trial Court, seeking recovery of possession of their units and damages. Respondent moved to dismiss the Contempt Case for forum shopping, claiming identity of parties, causes, and reliefs with the Forcible Entry Case. Branch 226 dismissed the Contempt Case for forum shopping, a ruling affirmed by the Court of Appeals.
","The Supreme Court granted the petition, reversed the Court of Appeals' Decision dated March 18, 2021, and its Resolution dated November 23, 2021, and reinstated the Contempt Case for further proceedings.
"," Forum shopping requires identity of parties (or representatives of same interests), identity of rights asserted and reliefs prayed for (founded on same facts), and such that judgment in one case amounts to res judicata in the other. No forum shopping occurred here: (1) No identity of parties, as petitioner KCBC is a separate corporate entity distinct from the Kaimos, who filed as individual unit owners vindicating personal rights; piercing the corporate veil was unwarranted without clear evidence of bad faith or fraud. (2) No identity of rights and reliefs, as the Forcible Entry Case sought recovery of individual units, monthly rentals, and damages for dispossession, while the Contempt Case addressed defiance of court orders through hostile takeover of the entire building. (3) No res judicata, as judgments in the cases would not bind each other due to differing causes of action.
","The Petition is GRANTED. The Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals are REVERSED. Civil Case No. R-QZN-15-10155-CV is ordered REINSTATED, and the Regional Trial Court, Branch 226, Quezon City is directed to proceed with utmost dispatch.

G.R. No. 205699,"MANUEL T. ZULUETA, PETITIONER, VS. CYMA GREEK TAVERNA CO., RESPONDENT.","Petitioner Manuel T. Zulueta claimed to have conceptualized the name “Cyma” for a Greek restaurant and launched the first branch, Cyma Boracay, on December 28, 2005, with Raoul Roberto P. Goco. They later formed a registered partnership called “Cyma Greek Taverna Company” (Cyma Partnership). On September 25, 2006, Zulueta filed a trademark application for “CYMA & LOGO” in his own name. While he was abroad from October 19 to November 26, 2006, a Deed of Assignment dated November 21, 2006 was executed, allegedly transferring his partnership interest to Raoul Goco’s sister, Anna Goco—a document Zulueta denied signing. On March 13, 2007, the Cyma Partnership filed its own trademark application for “CYMA GREEK TAVERNA AND LOGO,” which was granted registration on December 30, 2007. The Partnership opposed Zulueta’s application, asserting that Raoul Goco had conceived the mark during a 2002 trip to Greece and that the partnership was the first to use it commercially since 2005. Zulueta countered that he was the true originator and that the Deed of Assignment was fraudulent.","The Bureau of Legal Affairs of the Intellectual Property Office of the Philippines (IPOPHL-BLA) rejected Zulueta’s application on December 19, 2008, holding that the partnership’s registration constituted prima facie evidence of ownership and that issues regarding the Deed of Assignment were beyond IPOPHL’s jurisdiction. This was affirmed by the IPOPHL Office of the Director General (ODG) on January 9, 2012, and later by the Court of Appeals (CA) on October 15, 2012, with a motion for reconsideration denied on February 5, 2013.","The Supreme Court ruled that although Zulueta filed his trademark application first, he did so in bad faith because, as a partner, he was aware that the Cyma mark was being used by the partnership and had been conceptualized by Raoul Goco for the partnership’s exclusive use. Under the Intellectual Property Code, a trademark application tainted with bad faith is void ab initio and confers no priority rights. The Court emphasized that ownership of a mark is acquired through valid registration, but prior use may be considered to assess bad faith. Since Zulueta never used the mark in his individual capacity and filed the application despite knowing the partnership’s prior commercial use, his application was unregistrable. The Court also clarified that the validity of the Deed of Assignment and Zulueta’s partnership rights must be resolved in a separate civil proceeding, as IPOPHL lacks jurisdiction over such matters.","The petition was denied. The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals’ decision and resolution, upholding the rejection of Zulueta’s Trademark Application No. 4-2006-010623 for the mark “CYMA & LOGO” under Class 43 of the Nice Classification."

Noor, as Registrar of Deeds Manuel Castrodes Felicia, cancelled TCT No. T-9438 and issued TCT No. T-88286 in Noor's name without the owner's duplicate copy and without payment of taxes. Petitioner, as attorney-in-fact of the co-owners, filed Civil Case No. 13-02-117 in the RTC for recovery of ownership, possession, quieting of title, annulment of deeds and titles, and damages. Subsequently, on May 13, 2015, petitioner filed an affidavit-complaint before the Ombudsman against Noor and Felicia for violations of RA 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act) and RA 6713 (Code of Conduct for Public Officials), alleging conspiracy in the fraudulent title transfer.
","The Supreme Court partly granted the petition for certiorari. It dismissed the challenge to the Ombudsman's ruling on the administrative aspect (OMB-M-A-15-0195) for being the wrong remedy, deeming it final. However, it annulled and set aside the dismissal of the criminal aspect (OMB-M-C-15-0171), reinstated it, and remanded it to the Ombudsman for further proceedings.
","The Court held that the Ombudsman gravely abused its discretion by dismissing the criminal complaint outright on the ground of a prejudicial question, as the existence of such a question under Section 7, Rule 111 of the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure only warrants suspension of the criminal action, not dismissal, per Section 6, Rule 111. The civil case (Civil Case No. 13-02-117) involves similar issues that could determine the criminal liability under RA 3019, but the Ombudsman must first determine probable cause. The Court emphasized the Ombudsman's wide discretion in handling complaints but subject to review for grave abuse, which occurred here by evading the duty to assess probable cause and allowing potential prescription of the offense.
","The Ombudsman's Joint Resolution dated October 26, 2015, and Joint Order dated June 20, 2016, were partially annulled and set aside insofar as OMB-M-C-15-0171 is concerned; said criminal case was reinstated and remanded to the Ombudsman. The administrative aspect (OMB-M-A-15-0195) lapsed into finality due to improper remedy.

The NBI Special Task Force received information from a confidential informant about Realeza offering a minor for sexual favors; surveillance confirmed this, leading to an entrapment operation on November 18-19, 2016, where NBI agents posed as customers, and Realeza offered AAA261882 for P1,000.00, prepared a kubol for the act, and accepted marked money before his arrest. Realeza denied the charges, claiming the agents visited for drinking and that money was a tip, not payment for sex.
","The RTC found Realeza guilty beyond reasonable doubt of trafficking in persons under Section 4(a) of RA 9208, as amended by RA 10364, and sentenced him to 20 years imprisonment and a P1,000,000.00 fine.

[G.R. No. 224965]

DEPARTMENT OF AGRARIAN REFORM, PETITIONER, VS. FL PROPERTIES AND MANAGEMENT CORPORATION AND LLL HOLDINGS, INC., RESPONDENTS.","On October 22, 2015, in Quezon City, an informant tipped the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) that respondent Allan Almoite was selling shabu in Barangay Holy Spirit. A buy-bust team was formed, with PO1 Randy Garcia designated as poseur-buyer using two marked P100 bills. During the operation, Almoite handed Garcia a plastic sachet of white crystalline substance in exchange for the marked money. Almoite was arrested, and a search yielded the buy-bust money and two more sachets. The substances were marked, inventoried, and photographed at the scene in the presence of barangay kagawad Eduardo Natividad, but no media representative was present. The items were submitted to the forensic laboratory, confirming 0.09 gram, 0.06 gram, and 0.03 gram of methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu). Almoite was charged with violation of Section 5 (sale) and Section 11 (possession), Article II of RA 9165. He denied the charges, claiming he was framed and that the police planted the evidence.
","The Regional Trial Court convicted Almoite of both sale and illegal possession of dangerous drugs, sentencing him to life imprisonment and a P500,000 fine for the sale, and 12 years and one day to 14 years and eight months with a P300,000 fine for possession. The Court of Appeals acquitted him, ruling that the prosecution failed to prove the integrity of the seized items due to a break in the chain of custody—specifically, the absence of a media representative during the inventory and the lack of explanation for the non-compliance with Section 21 of RA 9165, as amended by RA 10640.
","The Supreme Court granted the People’s petition, reversed the CA decision, and reinstated the RTC conviction with modification. The Court held that while there was a procedural lapse in the absence of a media representative, the prosecution sufficiently established the chain of custody through the testimony of PO1 Garcia and forensic chemist Engr. Leonard Thou M. Ramos, who detailed the marking, inventory, turnover, and laboratory examination. The minor deviation did not compromise the identity and integrity of the corpus delicti, as the links in the chain—from seizure to laboratory submission—were unbroken and justified under the saving clause of RA 10640, given the presence of an elected official and the immediate conduct of inventory at the place of arrest. The marked money, positive qualitative examination, and consistent testimonies corroborated the buy-bust operation.
","The Decision of the Court of Appeals is REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Respondent Allan Almoite y Dipasupil is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of violating Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 and is sentenced to life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.00; he is also GUILTY of violating Section 11, Article II, and sentenced to twelve (12) years and one (1) day as minimum to fourteen (14) years and eight (8) months as maximum, and a fine of P300,000.00. The seized drugs are ordered transmitted to the PDEA for proper disposition.

G.R. Nos. 246318-19,"ARTHUR CUA YAP PETITIONER, VS. SANDIGANBAYAN (SIXTH DIVISION) AND PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENTS.","On November 25, 2008, the Board of Trustees (BOT) of the Philippine Rice Research Institute (PhilRice) held its 52nd meeting wherein petitioner, former Secretary of the Department of Agriculture (DA) and ex-officio Chairman of PhilRice, was one of the attendees. During the meeting, the board approved a car plan program for the benefit of PhilRice employees, subject to the availability of funds and the issuance by the PhilRice officers of an administrative order implementing the scheme on terms most advantageous to the government. As of the 53rd PhilRice BOT meeting on November 26, 2008, the implementing guidelines for the car plan had not yet been finalized and it was only in the following year, or on January 30, 2009, when PhilRice Executive Director Ronilo A. Beronio (Beronio) issued Administrative Order No. 2009-05 (AO No. 2009-05), detailing the rules for the implementation of the contentious project.[6]

On June 19, 2009, the BOT gathered once more for their 54th meeting, albeit petitioner was absent. The BOT tackled the execution of Hold Out Agreements (HOAs) with Philippine National Bank (PNB) in relation to the car plan. Notably, even at that point, they observed that AO No. 2009-05 appeared to be onerous and misleading.[7] Nevertheless, the project was rolled out pursuant to AO No. 2009-05, which states that ""(t)he acquisition of the vehicle shall be through financing by the Philippine National Bank for a period of 3 years payable on a monthly installment basis. The vehicle shall be mortgaged to the Philippine National Bank that has entered into a contract with the employee and PhilRice until full settlement of the selling price and interest.""[8]

Two years after the 54th BOT meeting, petitioner and the other members of the PhilRice Board of Trustees were implicated by the Office of the Ombudsman - Field Investigation Office (OMB-FIO) for violation of: 1) Section 3(e) of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 3019, otherwise known as the Anti­-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act; 2) malversation of public funds and property, defined and penalized under Article 217 of the Revised Penal Code; and 3) grave misconduct and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service under Section 22, Rule 14 of Omnibus Rules Implementing Book V of Executive Order No. 292, as amended by Civil Service Commission Circular No. 19, s. 1999.[9]

In the main, the OMB-FIO averred that the approval by the PhilRice BOT of the car plan program paved the way for the realization of a scheme that was grossly and manifestly disadvantageous to the government, thus causing undue injury thereto while granting unwarranted benefits to the beneficiaries of the project. The HDOs executed with PNB avowedly constrained PhilRice to maintain its deposit account or keep a sufficient amount therein to guarantee the HDOs. Moreover, the disbursement and taking of government funds as payment for the lease agreements with the employees-beneficiaries make out a case for malversation of public funds.[10]

Petitioner refuted the allegations in the complaint via his Consolidated Counter-Affidavit, asseverating that he neither had any participation in the formulation and/or issuance of AO No. 2009-05 nor did he participate or approve the disputatious HDOs. He likewise denied involvement in the execution and approval of the lease contracts between PhilRice and the employees-beneficiaries.[11]

On September 1, 2016, the Office of the Ombudsman issued a Joint Resolution, finding probable cause to indict petitioner, inter alia, for violation of Section 3(e) and 3(g) of RA No. 3019. Meanwhile, it found no basis to charge petitioner and his co-respondents with malversation of public funds as they were not the accountable public officers contemplated by Article 217 of the Revised Penal Code.[12] In its Joint Order[13] dated June 20, 2017, the Ombudsman gave short shrift to petitioner's bid for reconsideration of the Joint Resolution. At the interstice, he filed a petition for certiorari before this Court, ascribing grave abuse of discretion upon the Office of the Ombudsman after it found probable cause to charge him with the aforementioned offenses.","At the maelstrom of this Petition for Certiorari (with application for the issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction)[1] filed by Arthur Cua Yap (petitioner) are the Resolutions dated December 5, 2018[2] and February 27, 2019[3] of the Sandiganbayan (Sixth Division) in Criminal Case Nos. SB-18-CRM-0003 to SB-18-0004, which denied his Motion to Quash Informations[4] and Motion for Reconsideration,[5] respectively. On December 5, 2018, respondent Sandiganbayan (Sixth Division) issued the first assailed Resolution,[18] the fallo of which provides:
WHEREFORE, the Motion to Quash Informations dated February 14, 2018 of accused [petitioner], the Motion to Quash/Motion to Dismiss dated February 14, 2018 of accused Johnifer G. Batara, Fe D. Laysa, Senen C. Bacani, and Rodolfo C. Undan, and the Motion to Quash dated February 12, 2018 of accused Ronillo A. Beronio, are DENIED for lack of merit.","The Petition holds sway.

Section 16, Article III of the Constitution guarantees the right to speedy disposition of cases, viz.:
Section 16. All persons shall have the right to a speedy disposition of their cases before all judicial, quasi-judicial, or administrative bodies.
Following this constitutional mandate, any party to a case can demand expeditious action from all officials who are tasked with the administration of justice, but nowhere is this guaranty more significant and meaningful than in criminal cases, where not only the fortune, but the life and liberty of the accused as well, are at stake. In criminal cases, the right of an accused to the speedy disposition of cases is a sacrosanct right that must not only be respected by courts and tribunals, but must also be invoked only in clear instances of vexatious, capricious, and oppressive delays which render rights nugatory.[23]

Apropos thereto, Section 12, Article XI of the Constitution provides that:
Section 12. The Ombudsman and his Deputies, as protectors of the people, shall act promptly on complaints filed in any form or manner against public officials or employees of the Government, or any subdivision, agency or instrumentality thereof, including government owned or controlled corporations, and shall, in appropriate cases, notify the complainants of the action taken and the result thereof. (Emphasis supplied)
In Cagang v. Sandiganbayan, Fifth Division (Cagang),[24] this Court laid down the parameters in determining the presence of inordinate delay whenever the right to speedy disposition of cases or the right to speedy trial is invoked, thus:
First, the right to speedy disposition of cases is different from the right to speedy trial. While the rationale for both rights is the same, the right to speedy trial may only be invoked in criminal prosecutions against courts of law. The right to speedy disposition of cases, however, may be invoked before any tribunal, whether judicial or quasi-judicial. What is important is that the accused may already be prejudiced by the proceeding for the right to speedy disposition of cases to be invoked.

Second, a case is deemed initiated upon the filing of a formal complaint prior to a conduct of a preliminary investigation. This Court acknowledges, however, that the Ombudsman should set reasonable periods for preliminary investigation, with due regard to the complexities and nuances of each case. Delays beyond this period will be taken against the prosecution. The period taken for fact-finding investigations prior to the filing of the formal complaint shall not be included in the determination of whether there has been inordinate delay.

Third, courts must first determine which party carries the burden of proof. If the right is invoked within the given time periods contained in current Supreme Court resolutions and circulars, and the time periods that will be promulgated by the Office of the Ombudsman, the defense has the burden of proving that the right was justifiably invoked. If the delay occurs beyond the given time period and the right is invoked, the prosecution has the burden of justifying the delay.

If the defense has the burden of proof, it must prove first, whether the case is motivated by malice or clearly only politically motivated and is attended by utter lack of evidence, and second, that the defense did not contribute to the delay.

Once the burden of proof shifts to the prosecution, the prosecution must prove first, that it followed the prescribed procedure in the conduct of preliminary investigation and in the prosecution of the case; second, that the complexity of the issues and the volume of evidence made the delay inevitable; and third, that no prejudice was suffered by the accused as a result of the delay.

Fourth, determination of the length of delay is never mechanical. Courts must consider the entire context of the case, from the amount of evidence to be weighed to the simplicity or complexity of the issues raised.

An exception to this rule is if there is an allegation that the prosecution of the case was solely motivated by malice, such as when the case is politically motivated or when there is continued prosecution despite utter lack of evidence. Malicious intent may be gauged from the behavior of the prosecution throughout the proceedings. If malicious prosecution is properly alleged and substantially proven, the case would automatically be dismissed without need of further analysis of the delay.

Another exception would be the waiver of the accused to the right to speedy disposition of cases or the right to speedy trial. If it can be proven that the accused acquiesced to the delay, the constitutional right can no longer be invoked.

In all cases of dismissals due to inordinate delay, the causes of the delays must be properly laid out and discussed by the relevant court.

Fifth, the right to speedy disposition of cases or the right to speedy trial must be timely raised. The respondent or the accused must file the appropriate motion upon the lapse of the statutory or procedural periods. Otherwise, they are deemed to have waived their right to speedy disposition of cases.[25]
Based on the foregoing, the period for the determination of whether the inordinate delay was committed shall commence from the filing of a formal complaint and the conduct of the preliminary investigation.[26] The period taken for fact-finding investigations prior to the filing of a formal complaint is not included in the determination of whether or not there was an inordinate delay on the part of the Ombudsman. This is so because during the conduct of the fact-finding investigation, the government officials and employees concerned are not yet exposed to adversarial proceedings, but only for the purpose of determining whether a formal complaint against them should be filed based on the result of the said fact-finding investigation.[27] The court must then examine whether the Ombudsman followed the specified time periods for the conduct of the preliminary investigation.[28]","The foregoing jurisprudential precept was echoed in Perez v. Sandiganbayan,[32] where this Court held thusly:
In ruling that Perez should have moved for the early resolution of his case, the Sandiganbayan effectively shifted the burden back to the accused, despite the manifest delay on the part of the prosecution to terminate the preliminary investigation. The filing of a motion for early resolution is not a mandatory pleading during a preliminary investigation. With or without the prodding of the accused, the Rules of Procedure of the OMB, as well as Section 3, Rule 112 of the Rules of Court, fixed the period for the termination of the preliminary investigation. In other words, the OMB has the positive duty to observe the specified periods under the rules. The Court's pronouncement in Coscolluela v. Sandiganbayan (First Division), which was not abandoned in Cagang, remains good law, to wit:
Being the respondents in the preliminary investigation proceedings, it was not the petitioners' duty to follow up on the prosecution of their case. Conversely, it was the Office of the Ombudsman's responsibility to expedite the same within the bounds of reasonable timeliness in view of its mandate to promptly act on all complaints lodged before it. As pronounced in the case of Barker v. Wingo:
A defendant has no duty to bring himself to trial; the State has that duty as well as the duty of insuring that the trial is consistent with due process.
The Court cannot emphasize enough that Perez's supposed inaction - or, to be more accurate, his failure to prod the OMB to perform a positive duty - should not be deemed as nonchalance or acquiescence to an unjustified delay. The OMB is mandated to ""act promptly on complaints filed in any form or manner against officers and employees of the Government, or of any subdivision, agency or instrumentality thereof, in order to promote efficient service."" In conjunction with the accused's constitutionally guaranteed right to the speedy disposition of cases, it was incumbent upon the OMB to adhere to the specified time periods under the Rules of Court. Mere inaction on the part of the accused, without more, does not qualify as an intelligent waiver of this constitutional right.[33]
Although delay is not to be determined solely from the length of time taken for the conduct of the preliminary investigation, a long delay is inordinate unless the Office of the Ombudsman suitably justifies it. The courts must take unusually long periods into careful consideration when determining whether inordinate delay exists for otherwise, the Constitutionally guaranteed right to speedy disposition of cases would be reduced to nothing but an illusory promise.[34]

Having passed upon the existence of an inordinate delay in the conclusion of the preliminary investigation in this case, the need to discuss other issues has been rendered nugatory.

THE FOREGOING DISQUISITIONS CONSIDERED, the Petition for Certiorari (with application for the issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction) is hereby GRANTED. The Resolutions dated December 5, 2018 and February 27, 2019 of the Sandiganbayan (Sixth Division) in Criminal Case Nos. SB-18-CRM-0003 to SB-18-0004, are REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

Parties in the case were not residents of Iloilo, while the marriage was solemnized outside Iloilo.[18]
The foregoing observations prompted a discreet investigation, in the guise of a regular judicial audit, to be conducted in Branch 32, RTC of Iloilo City from August 10 to 14, 2015.[19] The audit team noted the following findings:

1.
The swiftness by which Judge Justalero was able to resolve nullity of marriage cases was marred by several irregularities:
 	 	 

a.
The decision was rendered one to three days after the filing of the memorandum;[20]
 	 	 

b.
The decision was rendered despite the absence of answer and collusion report by the public prosecutor;[21]
 	 	 

c.
The return of service of summons was issued after the substituted service of summons was made;[22]
 	 	 

d.
The motion to take deposition was granted one day after its filing;[23] and
 	 
2.
Despite hearing cases only every Friday in the RTC of Barotac Viejo, Judge Justalero was able to decide 26 cases on the declaration of nullity of marriage in 2014 as the Assisting Judge thereof, while he disposed only 11 nullity of marriage cases as the Presiding Judge in Branch 32, RTC of Iloilo City within the same span of time.[24]
Meanwhile, the audit team called attention to Judge Justalero's solemnization of marriages in RTC Barotac Viejo, Iloilo which were also attended by the following irregularities:

1.
The discharge of administrative functions such as the solemnization of marriages in Barotac Viejo, Iloilo has not been vested in Judge Justalero as the Assisting Judge in the Regional Trial Court of Barotac Viejo;[25]
 	 
2.
The number of marriages solemnized by Judge Justalero at the RTC of Barotac Viejo is highly suspect. Considering that he only hears cases therein on Fridays, it is unlikely that he still has the time to solemnize two marriages in one day;[26]
 	 
3.
In 26 marriages officiated by Judge Justalero, the marriage certificates were registered on the day of the marriage solemnization; in two instances, the marriage certificate was registered on the day of the issuance of the marriage license and of the marriage solemnization;[27]
 	 
4.
Twenty-six out of the 50 marriages solemnized by Judge Justalero from January 2015 to July 2015 were conducted under Article 34 of the Family Code, where no marriage license was required;[28]
 	 
5.
Almost all the affidavits of cohabitation attached to the marriage certificates were notarized and administered by Judge Justalero himself. In notarizing such affidavits, Judge Justalero did not require the presentation of competent proof of identity of the affiant as he allowed mere community tax certificates to be submitted;[29] and
 	 
6.
The affidavit for delayed registration of marriage was executed by Coloma, a court stenographer of Branch 32, RTC of Iloilo City.[30]","This Court resolves the administrative case filed by the Office of the Court Administrator against respondent Judge Globert J. Justalero (Judge Justalero) as the Presiding Judge of Branch 32, Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Iloilo City, and as the designated Assisting Judge of Branch 66, RTC of Barotac Viejo, Province of Iloilo, for gross ignorance of the law and procedure, gross misconduct, and incompetence.","After judicious study of the case, this Court finds no reason to deviate from the findings of the Office of the Court Administrator.

In resolving nullity cases, Judge Justalero disregarded the rules of procedure under A.M. Nos. 02-11-10-SC and 02-11-11-SC
At the outset, the Code of Judicial Conduct requires that judges be faithful to the laws and maintain professional competence. A judge must therefore be acquainted with legal norms and precepts, as well as with procedural rules. A magistrate who displays an utter lack of familiarity with the rules is guilty of gross ignorance of the law, for he or she erodes the public's confidence in the competence of the courts. Thus, ""[o]ne who accepts the exalted position of a judge owes the public and the court the duty to be proficient in the law.""[54]

Under Section 4 of A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC, a petition for declaration of nullity of marriage and for annulment of voidable marriage shall be filed in the Family Court of the province or city where the petitioner or the respondent has been residing for at least six months prior to the date of filing and in the case of non-resident respondent, where he or she may be found in the Philippines, at the election of the petitioner. The failure of the petitioner to comply with the residency requirement is a ground for the immediate dismissal of the petition, without prejudice to the refiling of the petition in the proper venue.[55]

In this regard, the case of Re: Raphiel F. Alzate[56] makes clear the duty of judges to ascertain the true residence of the parties, especially when the marriage certificates that were appended to the petitions showed different addresses from the ones stated in the petitions.[57]

Here, Judge Justalero did not deny that he resolved petitions for nullity of marriage over which the RTC of Barotac Viejo did not have jurisdiction. In the cases he decided, it is undisputed that the marriage certificate subject of Civil Case No. 14-972 established that the parties were residents of Valenzuela City and Makati City and their place of marriage was in Valenzuela City, while the marriage certificate subject of Civil Case No. 14-994 showed that the parties were residents of Molo, Iloilo City and their marriage was solemnized in Molo, Iloilo City. However, instead of exercising his sound discretion to determine the true residence of the parties, Judge Justalero did not bother to verify the jurisdictional allegations in the subject petitions under the flimsy excuse that he is ""saddled with 30 to 40 cases every hearing date [that he] could not anymore be expected to conduct an investigation on this matter[.]""[58]

Further, Section 5 (4) of A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC requires that the Office of the Solicitor General and the public prosecutor be furnished with a copy of the petition for declaration of nullity of void marriages, such that the failure to comply with this requirement may serve as ground for the immediate dismissal of the petition. In Civil Case No. 2013-899, the Office of the Court Administrator observed that the Office of the Solicitor General filed a motion for reconsideration to the Decision rendered by Judge Justalero, arguing that the Office of the Solicitor General was not furnished with copies of pleadings and documents in the case, and that it could not sufficiently determine if the interest of the State had been represented and protected in the case. Nonetheless, Judge Justalero decided to brush aside the motion on the ground that the arguments therein have been discussed in his assailed Decision.","In determining the sanction to be imposed on errant magistrates, this Court duly considers the factual milieu of each case, the offending acts or omissions of the judges, as well as previous transgressions, if any.[75] Hence, we take into consideration the fact that Judge Justalero had not been previously found liable for an administrative offense. While it does not excuse the procedural lapses he committed, we also note the heavy caseload of Judge Justalero to mitigate the imposable penalty against him.[76] As such, instead of the supreme penalty of dismissal recommended by the Office of the Court Administrator, this Court deems it proper to impose the penalty of suspension from office without salary and other benefits for a period of one year for his gross ignorance of the law and procedure and gross misconduct, with warning that a repetition of the same or similar offenses shall be dealt with more severely by this Court.

ACCORDINGLY, this Court finds respondent Judge Globert J. Justalero GUILTY of gross ignorance of the law and procedure and gross misconduct. He is SUSPENDED from office without pay for one (1) year effective immediately upon notice, and STERNLY WARNED that a repetition of the same or similar offenses shall be dealt with more severely by this Court.

G.R. No. 247798,"CONSTANCIA JAVATE-ASEJO, PETITIONER, VS. JUSTINIANO ZANTUA ASEJO AND REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENTS.","Constancia met Justiniano after she was widowed in 1987. Justiniano, a friend of Constancia's late husband, assisted her in processing her pension benefits. Constancia and Justiniano became close and later developed a ""mutual understanding.""[5]

During the time they were together, Constancia discovered the following about Justiniano:
a) that respondent Justiniano lives in a rowdy compound in Ugac Sur, Tuguegarao City where most of the residents therein are his relatives who are into gambling, betting, and drinking, living an easy (sic) go lucky lifestyle, b) that he lives with his family and being unemployed, depends on his parents and siblings for financial support; that his group of friends were known to be drug users and drunkards, and c) that he finished his studies but was never employed x x x.[6]
In 1989, Constancia got pregnant and, after being persuaded by her parents, she and Justiniano got married on December 23, 1989, at the Municipal Circuit Trial Court of Solana-Enrile, Solana, Cagayan.[7]

Thereafter, they lived with Justiniano's family. He insisted that they do so as he is unemployed and his family provided them financial support.[8] Constancia pleaded with Justiniano to get a job, but ""he could not be persuaded, refused to do so and continued to rely on their respective families for financial support.""[9] They tried to live independently, but returned to Justiniano's family compound after a month. While staying with Justiniano's family, the couple would always quarrel due to the following:
a) constant refusal of respondent Justiniano to get a job, b) he did nothing but eat and sleep all day when at home, c) he spent most of his time drinking with friends until dawn, d) he gambled and spent whatever money he had without concern for his family's needs, and e) he did not go home regularly and when asked, she was subjected to harsh verbal abuse x x x[10]
On April 1, 1990, the couple's only child, Clifford Javate Asejo (Clifford), was born.[11] Expenses for the childbirth were shouldered by Constancia's parents, and they continued to sustain the family's needs thereafter.[12]

In 1992, Constancia worked as a domestic helper in Hong Kong to support her son. During this time, she sent her son's allowance through her parents for fear that Justiniano will only spend it on his vices.[13]

In 1993, she went home and started working for a private company to personally take care of their son. She supported her son with the help of her parents.[14] During this time, Constancia observed that Justiniano's behavior towards her became worse:
every time respondent Justiniano got drunk, he would physically and verbally abuse her and utter the words ""second hand"", ""reject"", ""malas"", and ""basura ka""; one time, she was slapped by respondent Justiniano's sister about a simple misunderstanding and said ""dapat itapon ka sa basurahan"", but respondent Justiniano did nothing to apprehend (sic) the situation nor defend his wife; during his drinking sprees with friends, respondent Justiniano would often compel her to sit and entertain them likened to a Guest Relations Officer (GRO) and when she refused, he would beat her up; through all the years of their married life together, she was the only one who earned a living and financially supported their child x x x.[15]
In 1995, they moved in with Constancia's parents in Ilagan, Isabela. During this time, Constancia was employed in government. She rented a space in a boarding house and went home to her family twice a week in order to juggle her responsibilities.[16]

In 1996, they again lived with Justiniano's family, but they would keep moving back and forth to live with either Constancia's or Justiniano's family. Justiniano would physically hurt their child whenever he did something he disliked.[17]

Still, Constancia continued living with Justiniano until the day Justiniano, who was then drunk, threw out all her personal belongings and ""verbally, psychologically and physically maltreated"" and ""publicly scandalized"" her in front of her child, Justiniano's family, and all other people present. The incident left her ""mentally shocked and physically traumatized.""[18]

Thereafter, Constancia left Justiniano. However, she had to leave her child with Justiniano due to his studies. She took custody of her child a year after their separation.[19]

On September 9, 2013, Constancia filed a Petition for Declaration of Absolute Nullity of Marriage under Article 36 of the Family Code. Summons, together with a copy of the Petition, were served and personally received by Justiniano on December 19, 2013, but he did not file any Answer to the Petition.[20]

On October 22, 2013, the OSG, entered its appearance for the State, and authorized the City Prosecutor of Santiago City to appear in its stead.[21]

On March 17, 2014, the RTC directed the Office of the City Prosecutor of Santiago City to investigate whether there is collusion between the parties. On May 20, 2014, the Acting City Prosecutor, Arthur G. Kub-ao, submitted a Manifestation that there was no collusion between the parties.[22]","Before this Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari,[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the Decision,[2] dated November 29, 2018, and the Resolution,[3] dated May 8, 2019, of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA­-G.R. C.V. No. 110708 entitled ""Constancia Javate-Asejo, Petitioner­-Appellee, v. Justiniano Zantua Asejo, Respondent, Republic of the Philippines, Oppositor-Appellant.""

The petitioner Constancia Javate-Asejo (Constancia) questions the CA Decision that granted the appeal of the oppositor-appellant, Republic of the Philippines, through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), as well as the CA Resolution denying her Motion for Reconsideration. Through its assailed pronouncements, the CA held that the marriage between Constancia and the respondent Justiniano Zantua Asejo (Justiniano) remains valid and subsisting.

The CA reversed the Decision of the Regional Trial Court Branch 21 (RTC), Santiago City, dated June 19, 2017,[4] which earlier granted the declaration of nullity of the marriage between Constancia and Justiniano due to the latter's psychological incapacity.","This Court resolves to grant the Petition.

Contrary to the conclusions of the CA, the RTC correctly found that the marriage of Constancia and Justiniano is null and void due to the latter's psychological incapacity, as established by the testimonies of Constancia, the expert, and other witnesses presented. Such psychological incapacity is attended by gravity, juridical antecedence, and incurability, that render Justiniano incapable of performing the essential obligations of marriage.
 
The RTC did not err in giving weight to the testimony of the expert witness
 

In its Decision, the CA noted that the RTC heavily relied upon the testimony and findings of Dr. Pagaddu, whose conclusions were purely based on the testimony of Constancia and interviews with Justiniano's sister and sister-in-law. While the CA conceded that the lack of personal examination is not necessarily fatal, it still maintained that in this case, Dr. Pagaddu's failure to interview Justiniano is fatal as the totality of evidence is not sufficient to sustain a finding of psychological incapacity.

It further assailed the methodology employed by Dr. Pagaddu, as falling short of the ""required depth and comprehensiveness of examination,"" and hence, could not be relied upon as a basis for declaring the existence of Justininano's psychological incapacity.

In the assailed Decision and Resolution, the CA cited the case of Rumbaua v. Rumbaua (Rumbaua)[36] to illustrate the rigor required of a psychological report.
We cannot help but note that Dr. Tayag's conclusions about the respondent's psychological incapacity were based on the information fed to her by only one side – the petitioner – whose bias in favor of her cause cannot be doubted. While this circumstance alone does not disqualify the psychologist for reasons of bias, her report, testimony and conclusions deserve the application of a more rigid and stringent set of standards in the manner we discussed above. For, effectively, Dr. Tayag only diagnosed the respondent from the prism of a third party account; she did not actually hear, see and evaluate the respondent and how he would have reacted and responded to the doctor's probes. x x x We find these observations and conclusions insufficiently in-depth and comprehensive to warrant the conclusion that a psychological incapacity existed that prevented the respondent from complying with the essential obligations of marriage. It failed to identify the root cause of the respondent's narcissistic personality disorder and to prove that it existed at the inception of the marriage. Neither did it explain the incapacitating nature of the alleged disorder, nor show that the respondent was really incapable of fulfilling his duties due to some incapacity of a psychological, not physical, nature. Thus, we cannot avoid but conclude that Dr. Tayag's conclusion in her Report – i.e., that the respondent suffered ""Narcissistic Personality Disorder with traces of Antisocial Personality Disorder declared to be grave and incurable"" – is an unfounded statement, not a necessary inference from her previous characterization and portrayal of the respondent. While the various tests administered on the petitioner could have been used as a fair gauge to assess her own psychological condition, this same statement cannot be made with respect to the respondent's condition. To make conclusions and generalizations on respondent's psychological condition based on the information fed by only one side is, to our mind, no different from admitting hearsay evidence as proof of truthfulness of the content of such evidence.[37]
The disparity between Rumbaua and this case is pronounced. It should be stressed that in Rumbaua, the expert was only able to interview the petitioner. Additionally, the expert witness was unable to identify the root cause of therein respondent's alleged narcissistic personality disorder, prove its juridical antecedence, and show how the same rendered the respondent truly incapable of discharging marital obligations. None of these defects are present in the expert testimony in this case.","As in all civil matters, the petitioner in an action for declaration of nullity under Article 36 must be able to establish the cause of action with a preponderance of evidence. However, since the action cannot be considered as a non-public matter between private parties, but is impressed with State interest, the Family Code likewise requires the participation of the State, through the prosecuting attorney, fiscal, or Solicitor General, to take steps to prevent collusion between the parties and to take care that evidence is not fabricated or suppressed. Thus, even if the petitioner is able establish the psychological incapacity of respondent with preponderant evidence, any finding of collusion among the parties would necessarily negate such proofs.[64]
Thus, this Court must require no less than clear and convincing evidence before it declares a marriage null and void ab initio.

Contrary to the finding of the RTC that the psychological incapacity of Justiniano has been established through a preponderance of evidence, this Court finds that the evidence presented is more compelling, and ought to be properly regarded as clear and convincing proof.

The expert testimony was anchored on interviews with unbiased witnesses and has been corroborated by the other witnesses presented by Constancia. Justiniano's persisting psychological condition was identified, its history traced from his childhood and upbringing, and its manifestations prior to and throughout their marriage have been demonstrated by evidence beyond reproach. Thus, Constancia was able to discharge the requisite burden of proof.

Moreover, based on the foregoing discussions, this Court has noted that even the evidence presented by the State failed to dissuade and have actually buttressed the case for declaring the nullity of this marriage.

All told, the records speak clearly and convincingly that Justiniano is suffering from psychological incapacity, of such gravity, antecedence, and incurability, that prevents him from recognizing his essential marital obligations and renders his marriage to Constancia null and void ab initio.

WHEREFORE, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is GRANTED. The Decision, dated November 29, 2018, and the Resolution, dated May 8, 2019, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 110708 are REVERSED. The Decision, dated June 19, 2017, of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 21, Santiago City, is REINSTATED.

Uy, claiming they were employed seasonally for sugarcane cultivation and milling, paid on a pakyaw or daily basis without formal payrolls, and terminated after demanding higher wages and benefits through their union, the National Federation of Sugar Workers-Food and General Trades; the petitioners sought to reverse the Court of Appeals' affirmation of the National Labor Relations Commission's finding of no employer-employee relationship, introducing new evidence in a motion for reconsideration, including retractions from alleged coworkers and documents alleging Uy's management of 40 hectares via land-grabbing.
","This involves an illegal dismissal case where new evidence was presented in a motion for reconsideration before the Court of Appeals tending to disprove the findings of the National Labor Relations Commission and the Court of Appeals. This case was initiated in 2005.

","The Petition is DENIED for lack of merit; the Court of Appeals' Decision and Resolution are AFFIRMED, maintaining that no employer-employee relationship existed and dismissing the claims for illegal dismissal and related monetary awards without any reversal or modification.

G.R. No. 256242,"PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. MARK ANTHONY PAGUINTO Y WANIWAN, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","Mark Anthony Paguinto was charged with illegal sale and possession of dangerous drugs under Republic Act No. 9165 in two separate cases before the Regional Trial Court of Marikina City. On August 23, 2014, PO2 Ronel Agsawa, acting as poseur-buyer based on information from a confidential informant, purchased a sachet of methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu) from Paguinto during a buy-bust operation at H. Bautista Street, Marikina City, and recovered three additional sachets from Paguinto's possession. The seized items were marked, inventoried, and photographed in the presence of witnesses including elected public officials and a media representative, then submitted to the crime laboratory where they tested positive for shabu. Paguinto pleaded not guilty, denying the incident and alleging he was framed and beaten by authorities. The RTC convicted him of both charges, sentencing him to life imprisonment and a fine for the sale, and an indeterminate term for possession, with penalties to be served simultaneously. The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction but deleted the simultaneous service directive. Paguinto appealed, arguing non-presentation of the informant and a broken chain of custody.
","The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal, affirming the Court of Appeals' decision with modification to the penalty for illegal possession due to the omission of the drug's quantity in the information. Paguinto was found guilty of violating Section 5, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165 for illegal sale, sentenced to life imprisonment and a fine of PHP 500,000.00, and guilty of violating Section 11, Article II for illegal possession, sentenced to imprisonment of twelve years and one day to fourteen years and a fine of PHP 300,000.00.
","The Court held that the elements of illegal sale—identity of buyer and seller, the transaction, and corpus delicti—were proven by PO2 Agsawa's consistent testimony detailing the buy-bust transaction where Paguinto sold 1.10 grams of shabu. The non-presentation of the confidential informant was not required, as the poseur-buyer's account was sufficient and corroborated by the team leader, with no material inconsistencies or motives to falsify. For illegal possession, the elements were established by the recovery of three sachets totaling less than five grams of shabu from Paguinto's pocket, which tested positive, and his failure to explain the possession. The chain of custody was unbroken, as the seized drugs were properly marked, inventoried, photographed, custodied, examined, and submitted to court, with any procedural deviations justified by the preservation of integrity under Republic Act No. 10640. The omission of quantity in the information for possession did not invalidate the conviction but warranted the imposition of the lowest penalty, as quantity affects only the penalty under the law.
","The appeal was dismissed, affirming the guilty verdict and penalties for illegal sale and possession of dangerous drugs, with the illegal drugs ordered turned over to the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency for disposition, and the confiscated motorcycle returned to Paguinto.

G.R. No. 212269,"PRESIDENTIAL COMMISSION ON GOOD GOVERNMENT, PETITIONER, VS. OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSMAN, ROBERTO V. ONGPIN, GERARDO AGULTO, JR., DOMINGO INGCO, BERNARDO M. VERGARA, FEDERICO SALCEDO AND MERLE JEAN O. DEEN, RESPONDENTS.","This case stemmed from an Affidavit-Complaint[5] filed by PCGG, represented by Atty. Virgilio P.A. Ocaya (Atty. Ocaya), PCGG Legal Consultant in reviewing behest loan cases. Said complaint was filed against then Minister of Trade and Industry Roberto V. Ongpin (Ongpin), Minister of Tourism Jose D. Aspiras (Aspiras), Philippine National Bank (PNB) President Panfilo 0. Domingo (Domingo), PNB Senior Vice-President Gerardo Agulto, Jr. (Agulto), PNB Executive Vice-President Domingo G. Ingco (Ingco), Marbella Club Manila Incorporated (Marbella) Executive Vice-President Bernardo M. Vergara (Vergara), Marbella Vice-President Federico Salcedo (Salcedo), and Marbella Vice-President Merle Jean O. Deen (Deen).

The Ombudsman summarized the PCGG's complaint in this wise:
The complainant alleges that in April 1979, barely six (6) months after [Marbella] was incorporated, the National Investment and Development Corporation (NIDC), a subsidiary of PNB, approved the request of [Marbella] for the issuance of an NIDC Letter of Guaranty in favor of Europe-Asia Finance Corporation (EAFC) or any other financiers to guarantee foreign credit in the principal amount of US$20.0 Million. When the credit arrangement with EAFC did not materialize, [Marbella] applied for US$20.0 Million loan with PNB, which the latter approved on September 1, 1980[,] under Board Resolution No. 155.

To fund the loan of [Marbella], the Central Bank (CB) granted PNB a US$20.0 Million loan under its Consolidated Foreign Borrowings Program (CFBP). PNB approved the loan of [Marbella] even before it became the registered owner of the land where the purported tourism resort was to be established. Two years thereafter, or in December 1982, PNB, under Board Resolution No. 291 dated February 14, 1983, advanced Php15.6 Million to [Marbella], to enable the latter to pay the interest due on its foreign loan when it defaulted its interest payment due in November 1982.

The complainant asserts that such early default on mere interest payment, is already a clear indicium that the borrower was a poor credit risk, that loan was unwarranted, and that the loan granted by the respondent officials of PNB was attended with manifest partiality, bad faith and/or inexcusable negligence. The same manifest partiality and/or bad faith were evident in PNB's waiver of its share in the sale proceeds of condominium units bought by the Philippine Tourism Authority (PTA), wherein under the Loan Agreement, [Marbella] assigned to PNB all sale proceeds of the condominium units as a source of payment. With the waiver, PNB gave away the main source of funding for the payment of the subject loan, thereby reducing the change of its payment. By so doing, PNB entered into an agreement grossly disadvantageous to it, and ultimately, the government and the Filipino people.[6]
Ongpin, Domingo, Agulto, Ingco, Vergara, except for Salcedo and Deen, filed their respective counter-affidavits. The Ombudsman briefly discussed each, viz.:
The alleged offenses committed in 1980, x x x, has already prescribed. The government, thru the various units and offices tasked with investigating and prosecuting ill-gotten wealth and behest account cases connected with the Marcos Dictatorship regime, was in position to discover, and is considered to have imputed discovery of the anti-graft violations as early as March 1986. So, counting the prescriptive period from March 1986, the reckoning point is laid down in the Desierto rulings, more than 16 years have lapsed when the herein Affidavit-Complaint was filed on March 31, 2003. Clearly, this is beyond the 15-year period prescribed in Section 11, R.A. No. 3019, as amended.

Respondent Ongpin avers that the acts attributed to him do not constitute an offense. The said acts are not supported by competent and admissible evidence. He explains that the only ""testimonial evidence"" submitted is the Affidavit-Complaint of Virgilio P.A. Ocaya which, on its face, is hearsay, several times over. The papers appended to the Complaint are but photocopies and worse, photocopies of photocopies, not of the original papers (or even photocopies of the original papers), the genuineness and authenticity of which is not shown by any piece of evidence.

Respondent Ingco, for his part, declares that paragraph 24 of the Affidavit­- Complaint explicitly alleged and charged him as then PNB Senior Vice President and Panfilo O. Domingo, then PNB President who jointly recommended to the PNB Board of Directors the approval of the US$20.0 Million Central Bank­ Consolidated Foreign Borrowings [Program] (CB-[CFBP]) loan. Such act of recommending is the only act being charged against him, thus, he did not commit any violation. He might have been a ranking official of PNB but, unassailably, he neither had the title nor the authority to conclude and bind the bank to the questioned transactions. Like any other corporate banking institution, PNB's affairs were directed and its properties managed and preserved and its corporate powers exercised by its Board of Directors.

As for the transaction itself, it is an official FX lending under the CB-CFBP facility wherein the two principal parties are the Central Bank of the Philippines (CBP), which is the lender-fund provider, while [Marbella], which is the end­-user borrower. The PNB, as mere institutional conduit or channel for the CB­-provided FX funds under the CB-CFBP, was not the one who did the credit decision; rather, it was the CBP, whose FX funds are to be lent out. Therefore, if ever there was any flaw or defect, or even irregularity in that credit judgment, then it is the CBP, who approved the FX loan that should be asked to explain. At any rate, the FX loan approval by the CBP is itself an official act of a governmental instrumentality which enjoys the presumption of regularity and validity.","This Petition for Certiorari[1] under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court assails the August 24, 2012 Resolution[2] and the October 9, 2012 Order[3] of the Office of the Ombudsman [Ombudsman] in OMB-C-C-03-0425-H, which dismissed a complaint for violation of Section 3(e) and (g) of Republic Act No. 3019[4] or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act. Petitioner Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) contends that said issuances were tainted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.","The petition lacks merit.

Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzons[54] (Yatco) laid down this clear-cut procedure, to wit:
Meanwhile, with respect to criminal charges, the Court has settled that the remedy of an aggrieved party from a resolution of the Ombudsman finding the presence or absence of probable cause is to file a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court and the petition should be filed not before the CA, but before the Supreme Court. In the fairly recent case of Gatchalian v. Office of the Ombudsman, (decided on August 1, 2018), the Court traced the genesis of the foregoing procedure and cited a wealth of jurisprudence recognizing the same:","Practicality also leads this Court to exercise restraint in interfering with the Office of the Ombudsman's finding of probable cause. Republic v. Ombudsman Desierto explains:
[T]he functions of the courts will be grievously hampered by innumerable petitions assailing the dismissal of investigatory proceedings conducted by the Office of the Ombudsman with regard to complaints filed before it, in much the same way that the courts would be extremely swamped if they could be compelled to review the exercise of discretion on the part of the fiscals or prosecuting attorneys each time they decide to file an information in court or dismiss a complaint by a private complaint. x x x.
Jurisprudence has consistently ruled in favor of non-interference in the Ombudsman's determination of the existence of probable cause, unless there is a clear showing of grave abuse of discretion. This policy is based on respect for the Ombudsman's mandate and on practical grounds.x x x.[66]
This Court, in a petition for certiorari, will not hesitate to correspondingly address the issues when a tribunal acts with grave abuse of discretion in rendering judgment, in order to dispense and administer justice to the parties especially when the citizenry is affected by the actions of an errant public officer or tribunal. Conversely, this Court will exercise restraint when the petition for certiorari fails to show or lacks adequate evidence to support the assertion that the decision, resolution, decree, or order was tainted with grave abuse of discretion, as in this case.

WHEREFORE, the Petition for Certiorari is DISMISSED. The assailed August 24, 2012 Resolution and the October 9, 2012 Order of the Office of the Ombudsman in OMB-C-C-03-0425-H are AFFIRMED."
 G.R. No. 235641,"BORACAY ISLAND WATER COMPANY,[*] PETITIONER, VS. MALAY RESORTS HOLDINGS, INC., RESPONDENT.","Petitioner Boracay Island Water Company (BIWC) operates one of the two water utilities in the Boracay Island, Municipality of Malay, Province of Aklan (Boracay Island), through which potable water is distributed to establishments and households within the area. The BIWC also operates the only sewerage utility in the Boracay Island.[6]

Issue arose when BIWC issued the Terms and Conditions of Factored Sewer Charging Program[7] (Program). Under the Program, customers exclusively patronizing BIWC-supplied water and connected to the sewer system of BIWC shall be charged in accordance with the existing sewer/tariff rate. However customers who are connected to the sewer system operated by BIWC but not its water system (sewer-only customers) as well as those with dual water sources would be charged five times the customer's computed sewer charge.[8]

This prompted two affected customers, Ambassador in Paradise Corporation and Real Maris Resort & Hotel (plaintiffs), to file a civil case against BIWC before the RTC for declaration of nullity of the Program and damages[9] docketed as Civil Case No. 8849.[10]


J. King and Sons Company, Inc., and respondent Malay Resorts Holdings, Inc., (MRHI) moved to intervene and filed their respective complaints-in-intervention.[11] The RTC thereafter admitted the same.

On 08 July 2010, BIWC moved[12] to dismiss the complaint and complaints-in-intervention for failure to state a cause of action and forum shopping BIWC stressed that the charter of the Philippine Tourism Authority[13] (PTA) grants it the power to develop tourism zones and construct, operate, and maintain water distribution systems and sewerage systems. It averred that in operating the sewer and water utility in the Boracay Island, BIWC merely acts as the agents of the PTA pursuant to a concession agreement. As the designated concessionaire and agent of PTA, BIWC was merely implementing the existing Sewer Policies and Guidelines[14] approved by the PTA.

In its Motion to Dismiss [MRHI's] Complaint-In-Intervention,[15] BIWC asserted that the dismissal of the case was warranted on the ground of forum shopping. BIWC claimed that MRHI had previously filed with the National Water Resources Board (NWRB) a letter-complaint on the increased sewerage charge and the issue was discussed in the public conference conducted by the NWRB. It posited that all the elements of forum shopping were present: (i) BIWC and MRHI are parties to both the proceedings before the NWRB and the civil case before the RTC; (ii) the arguments and the relief MRHI set forth in its letter-complaint before the NWRB are the same as those raised and prayed for in the civil action; and, (iii) the decision of the RTC would preclude the NWRB from resolving the questioned Program and any decision or resolution by the NWRB would render the case before the RTC moot and academic.

Meanwhile, the NWRB called for a public conference in connection with the letter-complaints receive by the agency alleging that BIWC ""is operating a Water Supply and Sewerage System without a Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC) and charging fees therefore without authority from the NWRB.""[16] The declared topic notwithstanding, the imposition of the increased sewer charges by BIWC was also dis-cussed during the public­ conference held on 3 July 2010. However; the issue on NWRB's jurisdiction over the matter was raised by BIWC prompting the agency to seek the opinion of the Department of Justice (DOJ). On 13 August 2010, the DOJ issued its Opinion stating that the regulatory power over sewerage utility and service was not expressly granted by law or executive order to NWRB, as such, the latter cannot regulate said businesses for want of legal basis.[17]","This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] assailing the Decision[2] dated 28 February 2017 and the Resolution[3] dated 23 October 2017 by the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. S.P. No. 08412. The CA reversed and set aside the Orders dated 31 August 2012[4] and 06 February 2014[5] of Branch 9, Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Kalibo, Aklan in Civil Case No. 8849.","MRHI did not commit forum shopping

Forum shopping traces its origin as a concept in private international law as a choice of venue, which evolved in our jurisdiction as a choice of remedy, as discussed by the Court in First Philippine International Bank v. Court of Appeals:[28]
To begin with, forum-shopping originated as a concept in private international law, where non-resident litigants are given the option to choose the forum or place wherein to bring their suit for various reasons or excuses, including to secure procedural advantages, to annoy and harass the defendant, to avoid overcrowded dockets, or to select a more friendly venue. To combat these less than honorable excuses, the principle of forum non conveniens was developed whereby a court, in conflicts of law cases, may refuse impositions on its jurisdiction where it is not the most ""convenient"" or available forum and the parties are not precluded from seeking remedies elsewhere.

x x x x

In the Philippines, forum shopping has acquired a connotation encompassing not only a choice of venues, as it was originally understood in conflicts of laws, but also to a choice of remedies. As to the first (choice of venues) the Rules of Court, for example, allow a plaintiff to commence personal actions ""where the defendant or any of the defendants resides or may be found, or where the plaintiff or any of the plaintiffs resides, at the election of the plaintiff"" (Rule 4, Sec. 2 [b]). As to remedies, aggrieved parties, for example, are given a choice of pursuing civil liabilities independently of the criminal, arising from the same set of facts. A passenger of a public utility vehicle involved in a vehicular accident may sue on culpa contractual, culpa aquiliana or culpa criminal - each remedy being available independently of the others - although he cannot recover more than once.
""In either of these situations (choice of venue or choice of remedy) the litigant actually shops for a forum of his action. This was the original concept of the term forum shopping.

""Eventually, however, instead of actually making a choice of the forum of their actions, litigants, through the encouragement of their lawyers, file their actions in all available court, or invoke all relevant remedies simultaneously. This practice had not only resulted to (sic) conflicting adjudications among different courts and consequent confusion enimical (sic) to an orderly administration of justice. It had created extreme inconvenience to some of the parties to the action.

""Thus, 'forum shopping' had acquired a different concept -- which is unethical professional legal practice. And this necessitated or had given rise to the formulation of rules and canons discouraging or altogether prohibiting the practice.""
What therefore originally started both in conflicts of laws and in our domestic law as legitimate device for solving problems has been abused and misused to assure scheming litigants of dubious reliefs.[29]
To curb the reprehensible abuse of court processes and proceedings, the Court issued Circular No. 28-91,[30] the substance of which was later on incorporated in Section 5, Rule 7 of the Rules of Court. The provision reads:
Section 5. Certification against forum shopping - The plaintiff or principal party shall certify under oath in the complaint or other initiatory pleading asserting a claim for relief, or in a sworn certification annexed thereto and simultaneously filed therewith: a) that he or she has not theretofore commenced any action or filed any claim involving the same issues in any court, tribunal or quasi-judicial agency and, to the best of his or her knowledge, no such other action or claim is pending therein; (b) if there is such other pending action or claim, a complete statement of the present status thereof; and (c) if he or she should thereafter learn that the same or similar action or claim has been filed or is pending, he or she shall report that fact within five (5) calendar days therefrom to the court wherein his or her aforesaid complaint or initiatory pleading has been filed.","Here, the summary dismissal of the case by the court a quo prevented MRHI from fully ventilating its claim. Further, in the notices of public hearing for the proposed sewerage rates,[54] it is clear that the assailed imposition against sewer-only customers and sewer customers with dual water sources of a rate five times the customer's computed sewer charge is still in place. Clearly, despite the non implementation of the  Program and the alleged new rates, the issue raised by MRHI in its complaint-in-intervention persists and needs to be resolved. However, considering that factual determination is necessary in resolving the issues raised by MRHI in its complaint-in-intervention; the remand of the case is warranted since this Court is not a trier of facts.

WHEREFORE, premises considered, the petition is DENIED. The Decision dated 28 February 2017 and the Resolution dated 23 October 2017 by the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. S.P. No. 08412 are AFFIRMED. Civil Case No. 8849 is hereby REMANDED to the court of origin which is DIRECTED to resolve the case with dispatch."
 A.M. No. P-22-053 (Formerly OCA IPI No. 15-4466-P),"JUDGE JAIME B. SANTIAGO, COMPLAINANT, VS. ROMELITO G. FERNANDO, UTILITY WORKER I, BRANCH 18, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, [RTC], TAGAYTAY CITY, CAVITE, RESPONDENT.","Respondent was a Utility Worker I of Branch 18, Regional Trial Court of Tagaytay City, Cavite before being appointed by complainant judge as Clerk III in charge of civil cases in December 2014.[1]

In a Complaint[2] dated August 11, 2015, complainant judge charged respondent with Insubordination, Irregularity in the Performance of Duty, and Gross Neglect of Duty.

Complainant judge alleged that respondent failed to abide by his directives despite repeated admonishment and written warnings. In particular, respondent did not immediately refer to him the Formal Offer of Documentary Evidence (Formal Offer) in two (2) land registration cases, specifically, LRC No. TG-14-035 filed on October 10, 2014[3] and LRC No. TG-14-060 filed on February 17, 2015,[4] which prevented him from deciding these cases promptly. Instead, these pleadings were belatedly given to complainant judge on August 11, 2015.

In his Comment[5] dated November 9, 2015, respondent stated that the lapses he committed, if any, were unintentional and were due to his preoccupation with his numerous daily tasks. As to the purported delay in transmitting the Formal Offer of the cases, respondent faulted his co­ employees. With regard to LRC No. TG-14-035, he claimed that it was Remy Ligsa who was tasked to attach the Formal Offer to the case folder. As regards LRC No. TG-14-060, respondent averred that it was only on February 16, 2015 that he was instructed by complainant judge to give him the case folder. Moreover, he was unable to transmit the same immediately because it was only given to him by Madonna Cunanan on May 18, 2015.

Further, in a Supplemental Complaint[6] dated October 5, 2015, complainant judge charged respondent with Continued Irregularities, Gross Incompetence, and Gross Misconduct.

Complainant judge narrated that on September 18, 2015, Mrs. Lolita Borja arrived at court shouting and looking for respondent. She claimed that on May 22, 2015, respondent asked for P40,000.00 to facilitate the bail of her son, Eric Borja y Guevana, who was detained for violation of Section 11[7] of Republic Act No. 9165[8] in Criminal Case No. TG-15-1030.[9] Despite payment of the said amount, her son remained in jail. Further, the complainant judge claimed that during the January 2014 semestral inventory, he directed all staff to surrender all records in their possession. When he compared the docket with the records on hand, he noted that several criminal case records already submitted for decision/resolution were unaccounted for. He ordered his staff to search the entire office, including respondent's work area, where they discovered 51 criminal case folders and one (1) Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court case in his possession.[10] In addition, on February 14, 2014, he noticed another three (3) criminal case folders in respondent's custody. When confronted, respondent claimed that Sheriff Laydabell G. Pijana instructed him to mail the orders to the Assistant Provincial Prosecutor and the Public Attorney's Office lawyer.[11] Complainant judge issued Sheriff Laydabell G. Pijana and respondent a Memorandum[12] directing them to explain,[13] both of them categorically denied each other's claims and pointed to each other as the culprit.[14] Finally, when petitioners in LRC-No. TG-14-078 and LRC No. TG-13-1891 followed up The status of their cases, their corresponding records were nowhere to be found. This prompted complainant judge to order all his staff to search for the records. The missing case records were found inside respondent's steel drawer.[15]

In its 1st Indorsement[16] dated November 3, 2015, the OCA directed respondent to file a Comment to the Supplemental Complaint within ten (10) days from notice. Respondent requested for an additional five (5) days or until March 29, 2016 to submit his Comment,[17] citing health reasons. The OCA, in turn, granted respondent's request.[18] Records reveal that respondent went on Absence Without Official Leave (AWOL) without filing the required Comment.

In its 1st Tracer[19] dated January 16, 2017, the OCA reiterated its directive for respondent to file a Comment within five (5) days of receipt with a final warning that the administrative matter will be submitted to the Court without his Comment.

In a Memorandum[20] dated March 21, 2017, complainant judge reported that as per the Official Attendance Logbook of the Court, respondent last logged in on January 22, 2016 and thereafter, had been AWOL.

In a Resolution dated November 29, 2017, respondent's name was stricken from the rolls.[21]",This administrative matter arose from two Complaints initiated by Acting Presiding Judge Jaime B. Santiago (complainant judge) against Romelito G. Fernando (respondent) indorsed to the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) for appropriate action.,"Preliminary Matters

At the onset, it bears pointing out that the applicable rule in the present case is A.M. No. 21-08-09-SC dated February 22, 2022, entitled ""Further Amendments to Rule 140 of the Rules of Court"" (Revised Rule 140), which became effective on April 4, 2022. Revised Rule 140 was envisioned to be a disciplinary framework for the entire Judiciary that is wholly independent from the Civil Service Rules and uniformly applicable to all cases, regardless of when the infractions are committed.[28]

Further, respondent's absence without leave during the pendency of the administrative case against him will not prevent the Court from determining his liability and meting the proper penalty therefor. The filing of an administrative case is predicated on the holding of a position or office in government service and once jurisdiction has attached, the same is not lost by the mere fact that the public official or employee was no longer in office during the pendency of the case.[29] Thus, what is essential is that the administrative case was instituted while the court officer or employee was still in government service, which obtains in this case. Similarly, respondent's failure to file a Comment to the Supplemental Complaint will not hinder this Court from imposing the proper sanction for his infractions, if any.[30]

Substantive Matters

After a careful review of the records of the case, the Court adopts the findings of the OCA, but with modifications. In addition to the charges of Gross Insubordination and Grave Misconduct, the Court finds that respondent should be guilty of an additional count of Gross Insubordination for failure to file his Comment despite notice. Consequently, the Court modifies the penalty recommended by the OCA such that in addition to the forfeiture of all benefits, except accrued leave credits, and perpetual disqualification from re­employment in any government instrumentality, including government-­owned and controlled corporations which is imposed in lieu of dismissal from service, the Court deems it proper to impose a fine in the amount of P300,000.00, as authorized under Section 17(1) (c) in relation to Section 18 (b) of Revised Rule 140.","WHEREFORE, the Court finds respondent Romelito G. Fernando GUILTY of two (2) counts of GROSS INSUBORDINATION and one (1) count of GROSS MISCONDUCT constituting a violation of the Code of Conduct of Court Personnel. Respondent Romelito G. Fernando is meted the penalty, under Section 18(a) of the Revised Rule 140 of the Rules of Court, of forfeiture of all benefits, except accrued leave credits, and disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office, including government-owned or controlled corporations. He is also ordered to pay a FINE in the aggregate amount of P300,000.00 within a period not exceeding three (3) months from the time this Resolution is promulgated. If unpaid, such amount shall be deducted from the salaries and benefits, including accrued leave credits due to respondent. Finally, respondent Romelito G. Fernando is ordered to RETURN to Mrs. Lolita Borja the amount of P40,000.00, with interest rate at 6% per annum from finality of this Resolution until full payment.

G.R. No. 209516,"ANGELINA VILLANUEVA, PETITIONER, VS. HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS, NINTH DIVISION, NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION, FIRST DIVISION, UNIVERSITY OF THE EAST, AND THE MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF THE EAST, NAMELY: CHAIRMAN P.O. DOMINGO, (DECEASED) AND NOW REPLACED BY LUCIO TAN, JAIME J. BAUTISTA, DAVID O. CHUA, JOSEFINA CORTES, CORAZON DELA PAZ, P. SIERVO DIZON, CARMELITA MATEO, ANDRES NARVASA, JOSE NGAW, CORNELIO PERALTA, WILSON YOUNG AND DR. ESTER GARCIA, RESPONDENTS.","In 1970, petitioner, a lawyer and a certified public accountant, was employed by private respondent University of the East (UE) as a regular full-­time faculty member in the College of Business Administration. After 23 years of service, she optionally retired in 1993.[7]

Immediately following her optional retirement, petitioner was appointed as College Secretary in the College of Law of the same university, and later on as Associate Dean. During her tenure as College Secretary and Associate Dean, petitioner also served as a part-time lecturer in the College of Law, engaged on a semester-to-semester basis, and with a maximum teaching load of 12 units per semester.[8] In her contracts as part-time lecturer, it was stipulated that she was not entitled to the benefits available to regular faculty members, including retirement gratuity, pursuant to the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) between UE and the UE Faculty Association.[9]

In 2005, petitioner compulsorily retired as Associate Dean after reaching 65 years of age. Accordingly, she sought for the payment of her retirement benefits, which the university computed on the basis of the current hourly rate of a faculty member in the College of Business Administration with a teaching load of 24 units—i.e., PHP 224.51. The computation yielded a total amount of PHP627,279.79, which petitioner duly received. However, as she was unsatisfied with use of the PHP 224.51 rate, petitioner sought for a re-computation. She argued that the pay should be based on the hourly rate of a regular faculty member at the College of Law with the same teaching load of 24 units—i.e., PHP 532.35. If petitioner's computation would be followed, she would be entitled to a retirement differential pay of PHP 1,016,610.84.[10]

After some time, UE denied petitioner's request, citing its benevolent ""One Retirement Policy"" embodied in Board Resolution No. 75-8-86.[11] The board resolution allows faculty members who have optionally retired but are later on appointed to administrative positions to receive higher retirement benefits by reckoning their length of service from their first engagement as faculty members up to their tenure as administrative officials.[12] Under the board resolution, retirement pay of covered employees shall be computed either ""on the basis of teaching"" or ""on the basis of the service as an administrative official,"" at the rate obtaining on the time of retirement, whichever would yield the higher retirement benefits.[13]

According to the university, since the use of the current rate of a faculty member in the College of Business Administration would yield higher benefits compared to that of an Associate Dean (petitioner's regular position at the time of her retirement), the former rate should be used in the computation of petitioner's retirement pay. The rate of a regular faculty member in the College of Law cannot be used, since petitioner's engagement as such was merely contractual and on a per semester basis following university rules, and because it is impossible for petitioner to hold two regular plantilla positions at the same time.[14]

Unsatisfied, petitioner filed a Complaint,[15] arguing (1) that her rate as a faculty member in the College of Law should be used as basis in computing her retirement pay because she is considered a regular faculty member in the College of Law based on the four-fold test and based on the Court's ruling in St. Theresita's Academy v. National Labor Relations Commission[16] (St. Theresita's Academy); (2) that the use of her rate as Associate Dean contravenes Board Resolution No. 75-8-86 which provides that retirement pay shall be in accordance with the faculty benefits prevailing at the time of retirement; and (3) that UE acted in bad faith in requiring her to retire from the College of Business Administration and in delaying the resolution of her claim for differential retirement benefits.[17]","This resolves the Petition for Certiorari[1] assailing the May 31, 2013 Decision[2] and the August 30, 2013 Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 117993, denying petitioner Angelina Villanueva's Petition[4] for certiorari and Motion for Reconsideration,[5] respectively. The appellate court ruled that the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) did not commit grave abuse of discretion in ruling that petitioner was not entitled to her requested retirement differential pay.[6]","The Petition should be dismissed.

On procedural matters

It is basic that the special civil action of certiorari is a remedy available only when there is no appeal or any other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. When appeal is available, the action will not prosper even if the ascribed error is lack or excess of jurisdiction or grave abuse of discretion.[33]

Here, petitioner resorted to certiorari by alleging that the appellate court acted in grave abuse of discretion in rendering the assailed Decision. Yet, a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy was available to her for purposes of challenging the disposition of the CA, i.e., through a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, viz.:
Section 1. Filing with Supreme Court. — A party desiring to appeal by certiorari from a judgment or final order or resolution of the Court of Appeals, the Sandiganbayan, the Regional Trial Court or other courts whenever authorized by law, may file with the Supreme Court a verified petition for review on certiorari. The petition shall raise only questions of law which must be distinctly set forth.
Petitioner's counsel explained that the resort to certiorari was made in view of the lack of time to file the appeal, in turn caused by the ""volume and pressure of work in his law firm, without the assistance of his associate, who went on an indefinite leave x x x.""[34] However, such circumstance does not belong to the exceptions to the rule, which are (1) when public welfare and the advancement of public policy dictates, (2) when the broader interest of justice so requires, (3) when the writs issued are void, and (4) when the questioned order amounts to an oppressive exercise of judicial authority.[35]

As it is settled that a party cannot substitute the special civil action of certiorari for the lost remedy of ordinary appeal, especially if such loss or lapse was occasioned by one's own neglect or error in the choice of remedies,[36] the Petition deserves to be dismissed.","WHEREFORE, the Petition is DISMISSED. The May 31, 2013 Decision and the August 30, 2013 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 117993 are AFFIRMED.

G.R. No. 186155,"LAPANDAY FOODS CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, RESPONDENT.","Petitioner Lapanday Foods Corporation, a domestic corporation engaged in rendering management services, was assessed by the Bureau of Internal Revenue for deficiency taxes for taxable year 2000, including VAT of PHP 8,561,775.88 on interest income from inter-company loans extended to affiliates as financial assistance. Lapanday protested, and after proceedings, the Bureau issued a Final Decision on Disputed Assessment maintaining the VAT assessment with adjustments, while cancelling others. Lapanday appealed to the CTA, which affirmed the VAT assessment but cancelled EWT and DST, holding the loans incidental to Lapanday's business under Sec. 105 of the NIRC. The CTA En Banc upheld the VAT liability, finding the interest subject to VAT as incidental income and the assessment timely for the first quarter based on the amended return filing date.
","The Supreme Court granted Lapanday's petition, reversing and setting aside the CTA En Banc Decision. It held that the assessment for deficiency VAT for the first quarter of 2000 had prescribed and that the interest income on loans extended to affiliates is not subject to VAT.
","The Court ruled that the prescriptive period for assessment under Sec. 203 of the NIRC commences from the filing of the original VAT return on April 25, 2000, as the amended return did not constitute a substantial amendment, making the January 21, 2004 assessment untimely. On VAT liability, the interest from isolated loan accommodations to affiliates lacks intimate connection to Lapanday's primary business of management services, excluding fund management per its articles, and thus is not incidental under Sec. 105 of the NIRC, rendering it non-taxable.
","The petition was granted, reversing the CTA En Banc Decision, cancelling the deficiency VAT assessment as barred by prescription and lacking legal basis for taxability.

A.C. No. 13471,"MELISSA M. MASAYON AND CLIFFORD M. COMPAS, COMPLAINANTS, VS. ATTY. RONALDO E. RENTA, RESPONDENT.","Clifford alleged that at the beginning, all of Don Alberto's heirs were in agreement that the parcels of land in his estate should be sold and the proceeds thereof should be divided among each of them.[4] In this regard, on December 13, 2013, they executed an Extra-Judicial Deed of Partition with Special Power of Attorney[5] authorizing Clifford ""solely to negotiate the sale of the x x x [properties], x x x sign all deeds and other documents necessary to complete the sale of the same[,] and receive the proceeds [therefrom] x x x under his name, and do other tasks which may be necessary to facilitate and expedite the completion of the sale.""[6] Among the properties sold by virtue of the authority given to Clifford were the three (3) parcels of land referred to in the records as the Kamalig Property.[7] The Kamalig Property was sold to Melissa, through a Deed of Conditional Sale[8] dated January 7, 2015.

As regards the remaining parcels of land, Clifford learned from Ms. Siony[9] Sia (Ms. Sia) that the heirs could sell these properties for a higher price through the Conditional Mortgage Program (CMP) of the Social Housing Finance Corporation (SHFC). Ms. Sia is the President of Mineland Housing Corporation, a registered mobilizer with the SHFC.[10] Clifford then presented the idea to the heirs, who all acceded. Apart from the earlier authority, they also executed another Special Power of Attorney[11] dated August 4, 2014, a second Extra-Judicial Deed of Partition with Special Power of Attorney[12] dated June 5, 2015, as well as a handwritten notarized document signed by the heirs on April 23, 2015,[13] to carry out the proposed transactions. Subsequently, several parcels of land were successfully enrolled into the CMP and letters of guaranty were issued in favor of the heirs. According to Clifford, fifty percent (50%) of the proceeds from the CMP were already released to the heirs and divided according to their agreement.[14]

However, when Clifford sought the release of the remaining proceeds, he was informed by SHFC President Atty. Arnulfo Cabling (Atty. Cabling) that they received a letter from respondent prohibiting them from releasing the remainder of the proceeds. Respondent allegedly informed the SHFC that he is representing the legitimate heirs of Don Alberto, namely, the members of the second family, and that the latter are withdrawing the authority they granted to Clifford. According to Clifford, the members of the second family also refused to talk to him and told him to direct all communication to respondent. Ms. Sia then informed Clifford that respondent's clients went to her office to inquire about their share in the proceeds. Upon hearing this, Clifford asked Ms. Sia for her assistance in resolving the issue between the heirs, and she agreed.[15]

Ms. Sia, in her Judicial Affidavit,[16] alleged that sometime in February 2018, respondent went to her office ostensibly to inquire about SHFC's processes. Subsequently, he allegedly told her that he can convince his clients to ""anything,""[17] provided that he received some ""reward.""[18] Taken aback, Ms. Sia purportedly reminded respondent that they ought to be helping the heirs resolve their dispute. Angered by her response, respondent left her office. A month later, respondent contacted her again to request all relevant documents regarding the CMP and asked that they have another conference.[19]

On April 13, 2018, they met again in person, where respondent once again insisted that he can convince his clients to ""agree on anything.""[20] This time, as Ms. Sia was about to leave, respondent purportedly told her, ""[g]ive me P1,000,000.00. That is enough and we can close this issue, I can have them sign any document anytime.""[21] Ms. Sia left without agreeing. A few days later, respondent called her, telling her that if she can send him P200,000.00, he can start drafting the necessary paperwork to resolve the dispute and get his clients to sign it. When she told respondent that she will relay this to Clifford and would seek his approval first before acting on the proposal, respondent again reacted angrily and hung up.[22]

Still, a few days later, respondent called Ms. Sia again, this time saying that he is amenable to the proposal. He told her that he will draft a document stating that the heirs have resolved their dispute, have his clients sign it, and then deliver it to Clifford. Upon delivery, he stipulated that he should receive the amount of P1,000,000.00. Ms. Sia did not agree, insisting that the heirs should resolve the dispute based on their extrajudicial partition. As per available information in the records, the dispute remains unresolved; as a result of which, the remaining proceeds from the CMP have not yet been released.[23]

On the other hand, Melissa claimed that respondent, with three other men, entered the Kamalig Property without her permission. There, respondent and his companions encountered the caretakers Melito Abarca (Abarca) and Mark Renomeron.[24] When told to leave the premises, respondent ignored the caretakers and surveyed the property. As he was leaving, he allegedly told the caretakers, ""baka nagluluto kayo dito ng shabu, ha?"" and threatened to eject them from the premises.[25] The caretakers immediately reported the incident to Melissa and to the Tacloban City Police Station 2 (Police Station). A Certification[26] from the Police Station, as well as Abarca's Judicial Affidavit,[27] forms part of the records of this case.","This administrative case arose from a Complaint-Affidavit[1] for disbarment filed by complainants Melissa M. Masayon (Melissa) and Clifford M. Compas (Clifford; collectively, complainants) against respondent Atty. Ronaldo E. Renta[2] (respondent) for violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR) arising from respondent's alleged interference into and creating a dispute regarding the properties of the late Don Alberto C. Compas (Don Alberto).","After a careful study and review of the records, the Court modifies the findings of the IBP, but nevertheless, arrives at the same conclusion, i.e., that respondent should be found administratively liable. The Court also modifies the penalty and finds that respondent should be suspended from the practice of law for a period of five (5) years, as will be explained hereunder.

To recapitulate, the IBP-CBD found that respondent committed the following acts that merit disciplinary action: (1) meddling with the affairs of Don Alberto's family by encouraging the second family to litigate with the first family; (2) misrepresenting himself as the second family's attorney-in-fact; (3) asking for or requiring a personal reward of P1,000,000.00 in exchange for the settlement of the dispute between the family members; and (4) using offensive and threatening language towards Melissa's caretakers.

In addition, the IBP-CBD appeared to attribute another act to respondent, as stated in its Report: ""[t]he records show that the respondent offered monetary rewards to anyone who could provide him any information against the complainants] just so he would have a leverage in his actions against the latter.""[41] However, a closer reading of the Report and Recommendation shows that this is not among the allegations in the complaint or position paper for the complainants. Instead, the sentence forms part of the Court's decision in Ong v. Unto,[42] which is referenced in a footnote in the said Report.[43] Since the sentence was not in quotation marks or in a block quote format, respondent labored under the impression that the sentence referred to him. Accordingly, he sought to deny this allegation in his motion for reconsideration.[44] Thus, the Court sees the need to clarify that the said statement is not part of the charges against him; therefore, it shall not be discussed herein.","
In this case, the Court notes that respondent was previously warned, in two (2) separate occasions, that repetition of similar acts would be dealt with more severely. In Cristobal v. Renta (Cristobal),[73] respondent was reprimanded for failing to safeguard his client's interests when he failed to file the petition for recognition of certain minors, as the client required. He admitted to his failure and apologized for his negligence. Two years after Cristobal, in Beth Hein Transport v. Volante,[74] the Court once again warned respondent for failing to attach material portions of the record, notably the assailed decision, to a petition for review on certiorari. The Court stated in that case that the petitioner's cause, if legitimate, ""deserved better legal representation: one that knows the fundamental requirements needed to support a case, and one that recognizes that a case should be attended to with more care, prudence, and diligence.""

Given these circumstances — and further taking into consideration Part (C) (9.22) (a) of the IRP's Guidelines for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, which provides that prior disciplinary offenses constitute an aggravating circumstance — the Court finds that respondent should be suspended from the practice of law for a period of five (5) years.

ACCORDINGLY, respondent Atty. Ronaldo E. Renta is found GUILTY of violating Rules 1.01 and 1.04, Canon 1, Rule 7.03, Canon 7, Rule 8.01, Canon 8, and Canon 17 of the Code of Professional Responsibility, and is hereby SUSPENDED from the practice of law for a period of five (5) years, effective immediately upon his receipt of the Decision. He is STERNLY WARNED that a repetition of the same or similar act will be dealt with more severely.

Respondent is DIRECTED to report to this Court the date of his receipt of this Decision to enable it to determine when his suspension from the practice of law shall take effect.

Let copies of this Decision be furnished to: (1) the Office of the Bar Confidant to be appended to respondent's personal record as an attorney: (2) the Integrated Bar of the Philippines for its information and guidance; and (3) the Office of the Court Administrator for circulation to all courts in the country.

G.R. No. 236628,"MARVIN L. SAN JUAN, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","On March 26, 2014, in Valenzuela City, the petitioner, Marvin L. San Juan, a police officer who was intoxicated, threatened the life of 15-year-old AAA by poking a gun at him while the minor was at a basketball court with friends. San Juan initially scolded AAA for playing basketball during weekdays, got upset when AAA laughed, and pointed the gun at AAA's back while warning them not to hang out there. AAA and his friends fled, and San Juan chased AAA with a stone. The incident subjected AAA to psychological cruelty and emotional maltreatment as a minor.
","The Supreme Court modified the Court of Appeals' decision, finding the petitioner guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 10(a) in relation to Section 3(b)(1) of Republic Act No. 7610, deleting the correlation to grave threats. The Court affirmed the conviction based on the factual findings that San Juan pointed a gun at AAA, causing psychological harm, and imposed an indeterminate sentence.
"," The crime is properly nomenclated as child abuse under Section 10(a) of R.A. No. 7610 in relation to Section 3(b)(1), which covers psychological abuse and cruelty without requiring specific intent to debase or demean the child's dignity, as the Information alleged psychological cruelty and emotional maltreatment. The phrase ""but not covered by the Revised Penal Code"" in Section 10(a) qualifies acts under Article 59 of P.D. No. 603, including those without RPC counterparts, to increase penalties for child abuse. Pointing a gun at a minor is intrinsically cruel, causing fear and psychological harm, and as a police officer, San Juan's act was excessive and unnecessary.
","The petition is denied. The petitioner is sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of four years and nine months and eleven days of prision correccional, as minimum, to seven years and four months of prision mayor, as maximum. He is ordered to pay AAA P20,000.00 as moral damages and P20,000.00 as exemplary damages, plus interest at six percent per annum from finality until full payment.

THE HONORABLE COMMISSION ON AUDIT, RESPONDENT.","Various officials and employees from multiple regional and provincial offices of the National Food Authority (NFA) across the Philippines filed consolidated petitions challenging Notices of Disallowance issued by the Commission on Audit (COA) for food and grocery incentives granted annually since 1995, initially as food gift packages approved by the Secretary of Agriculture and later converted to gift checks, including a P7,000 food assistance and emergency allowance approved by President Joseph Estrada in 1998 for the yuletide season that was extended to NFA employees, a 2003 memorandum from President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo recognizing moderated year-end bonuses, NFA Council Resolution No. 226-2K5 approving P20,000 annual incentives in 2005, and OGCC Opinion No. 219 affirming the traditional Christmas grant; these incentives were disallowed for various years such as 2008-2012, with total amounts reaching millions like P3,840,000 for Region V offices in 2010-2011, and appeals were denied by COA based on lack of legal basis under RA No. 6758 and DBM Budget Circular No. 16, leading to assertions of solidary liability among approving and certifying officers and recipients.
","The Supreme Court dismissed the petitions in G.R. Nos. 236503, 237550, 237698, 237841, 240593, and 241717; partially granted the petitions in G.R.

Commission on Audit and Abellanosa v. Commission on Audit, requiring return by recipients via solutio indebiti while considering good faith for approving officers.
","The Court applied the principle of res judicata based on precedents like Escarez v. Commission on Audit and Wycoco v.

","All petitioners must return the food and grocery incentives received, with recipients held liable under solutio indebiti; approving and certifying officers are solidarily liable for the net disallowed amounts if they acted in bad faith or failed to notify superiors of illegality, but exonerated in cases of first-time disallowances or where no prior notice existed, such as in G.R.

PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","Magno was charged under two Informations for ""Other Acts of Neglect, Abuse, Cruelty or Exploitation, and Other Conditions Prejudicial to the Child's Development,"" the accusatory portions of which read:

The above act of the accused debases, degrades[,] and demeans the intrinsic worth and dignity of [AAA258682] as a child and human being.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[7]

Crim. Case No. 3309-G

That on or about the night of March 2, 2012, in the Municipality of xxxxxxxxxxx, Province of xxxxxxxxxxx, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused with intent to humiliate, harass, and shame, did then and there willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously abuse and take advantage of [BBB258682], a 17-year-old minor, by touching/stroking her genitalia within the view of other people, thereby causing utmost indignity and embarrassment to [BBB258682].

The above act of the accused debases, degrades, and demeans the intrinsic worth and dignity of [BBB258682] as a child and human being.

Contrary to law.[8]
Upon arraignment, Magno pleaded not guilty to both charges.[9] After pre­trial was conducted, trial on the merits then ensued.

The version of the prosecution established that on March 2, 2012, at around 9:00 p.m., AAA258682, and her friend, BBB258682, were strolling through the town plaza at xxxxxxxxxxx during the fiesta and looking at some items displayed for sale on the side streets.[10]

AAA258682, who was born on November 29, 1995, was 16 years old[11] at the time, while BBB258682, who was born on April 21, 1994, was 17 years old.[12]

AAA258682 testified that BBB258682 was walking on her right side when Magno approached them from the opposite direction and touched both of their private parts. After doing so, Magno casually walked away.[13] Shocked, AAA258682 moved backward and cursed, before turning to find Magno.[14] Initially, both minors tried to chase after Magno but eventually decided against it as they were afraid of the latter because he was bigger than them and seemed intoxicated.[15]

AAA258682 and BBB258682 relayed the incident to BBB258682's older sister, who was also at the plaza at the time. BBB258682's older sister told them that her friend, CCC258682, was also tapped in her private parts by a man that night.[16]

While together, AAA258682, BBB258682, BBB258682's older sister, and CCC258682 saw Magno with his group of friends. They all ran toward the soldiers of the Philippine Army that were patrolling the area to report the incident. In turn, the soldiers apprehended Magno and took him to the police station. AAA258682, BBB258682, BBB258682's sister, and CCC258682 followed them, and an investigation was conducted.[17]

AAA258682 and BBB258682 identified Magno as the person who touched them in their private parts based on his appearance,[18] specifically that he was tall, sported long hair, and had a large build. More, he wore a blue jersey bearing numbers[19] that evening, as opposed to other passersby who were wearing ordinary clothing.[20]

For their part, the defense's sole witness was Magno, who testified that he was a construction worker and that on March 2, 2012, he was at work at Land Bank of the Philippines, xxxxxxxxxxx from 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. After that, he rested in his quarters until 9:00 p.m.[21]

Sometime that evening, he needed to buy some medicine as he had a headache. He narrated that he went to the drugstore near the public market with his nephew, Jimmy Gardoce (Gardoce). While they were on their way to the drugstore, they met Rafael Tolentino (Tolentino), the son of Magno's godfather. Together, they decided to roam the plaza as the fiesta was ongoing.[22]

Magno denied the accusations against him and claimed that it was Tolentino who touched other persons while walking through the plaza and that he even tried to prevent him from doing the act. However, it was Magno who was arrested by the members of the Philippine Army and taken to xxxxxxxxxxx police station where he was incarcerated.","This Court resolves the Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] assailing the Decision[2] and the Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the Decision[4] of the Regional Trial Court, finding the accused-appellant Ireneo Magno y Montano (Magno) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 10(a), Article VI of Republic Act No. 7610, otherwise known as the ""Special Protection of Children Against Child Abuse, Exploitation, and Discrimination Act.""","The Petition is without merit.

In Quimvel v. People,[41] this Court found that:
Jurisprudence has already set the standard on how the requirement is to be satisfied. Case law dictates that the allegations in the Information must be in such form as is sufficient to enable a person of common understanding to know what offense is intended to be charged and enable the court to know the proper judgment. The Information must allege clearly and accurately the elements of the crime charged. The facts and circumstances necessary to be included therein are determined by reference to the definition and elements of the specific crimes.

The main purpose of requiring the elements of a crime to be set out in the Information is to enable the accused to suitably prepare his defense because he is presumed to have no independent knowledge of the facts that constitute the offense. The allegations of facts constituting the offense charged are substantial matters and the right of an accused to question his conviction based on facts not alleged in the information cannot be waived. As further explained in Andaya v. People:
No matter how conclusive and convincing the evidence of guilt may be, an accused cannot be convicted of any offense unless it is charged in the information on which he is tried or is necessarily included therein. To convict him of a ground not alleged while he is concentrating his defense against the ground alleged would plainly be unfair and underhanded. The rule is that a variance between the allegation in the information and proof adduced during trial shall be fatal to the criminal case if it is material and prejudicial to the accused so much so that it affects his substantial rights.[42] (Emphasis supplied and citations omitted)
Still in Quimvel, this Court emphasized that what determines the real nature and cause of the accusation against an accused is the actual recital of facts stated in the information or complaint, not the caption or preamble thereof nor the specification of the provision of law alleged to have been violated, being conclusions of law.

Thus, this Court is constrained to place the text of the Information under scrutiny.","ACCORDINGLY, the instant Petition is DENIED.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[5]
All of the accused were arrested, except for Gary Batan (Batan), Pedro Sorima (Sorima), Elorde Bitanghol (Bitanghol), and Andy Quintana, who remained at-large. Upon arraignment, all accused entered a plea of ""not guilty.""

On May 2, 2007, the RTC issued an Order[6] granting the prosecution's motion to discharge accused Rogelio Mendoza (Mendoza) as state witness.[7]

Version of the Prosecution

Mendoza revealed that he and his co-accused were members of a group called ""Waray-Waray Kidnap for Ransom,"" which was responsible for the kidnapping of Carrie Choa (Carrie). Mendoza was the cook of the group. He testified that sometime in June 2005, Hector Cornista (Cornista) brought Mendoza to the Mendrano Compound in Cavite allegedly to cook food for somebody. Upon arrival at the Mendrano Compound, Mendoza saw accused Bitanghol, Freeman Bagares (Bagares), Undo Fontillas (Fontillas), Batan, Sorima, and Alvin Labra (Labra). Thereafter, Mendoza, along with Cornista and Bitanghol proceeded to a flower farm and met with Brian Ho (Ho) to discuss about the plan to kidnap a female at 6:00 a.m. the next day.[8]

Subsequently, Cornista accompanied Mendoza to a nipa hut near a river in Antipolo and left him there with the other accused. The following day, Cornista returned to Antipolo bringing with him a woman whose hands were tied, and blindfolded. The woman was later identified by Mendoza as private complainant Carrie. Carrie was detained inside a nipa hut for four days. Upon Cornista's instructions, Mendoza guarded and fed Carrie and the other members of the group.[9]

Days later, Bagares and Bitanghol went back to Antipolo and ordered Mendoza and the other accused to bring out private complainant. Mendoza then boarded Carrie into a white taxi, after which, Bitanghol gave Mendoza PHP 15,000.00 as payment for his services.[10]

For her part, Carrie recalled that on the day of the kidnapping incident, she was at her orchid farm in Alapan, Imus, Cavite with Lourdes Torralba (Lourdes) when her worker, Jomari Descalota (Descalota), and a stranger approached them. Descalota asked Carrie if she needed an additional worker, but she declined. At this juncture, the stranger pointed a gun at Carrie and ordered her to go with him.[11]

Carrie was boarded on a Toyota Rav 4 and was blindfolded by a man, whom she identified in open court as Cornista. When Carrie felt that the vehicle stopped, she peeped through the blindfold and she saw three individuals alighting and talking to two other individuals, whom she later identified as Ricardo Banaay (Banaay) and Romeo Rayga (Rayga). Thereafter, they traveled for about two hours. When the kidnappers asked for a person whom they can contact, Carrie gave them the name and contact number of her sister, Gliceree L. Continting (Gliceree). They told her that they would demand PHP 1Million to PHP 2Million for ransom money.[12]

When they arrived at their destination, the individuals removed Carrie's blindfold and directed her to wear her shades. They walked to a nipa hut where she saw three other individuals, two of whom she identified as Mendoza and Joel Dionaldo (Dionaldo). Carrie was confined in the nipa hut for four days, guarded by Mendoza, Dionaldo and Andy Quintana (Quintana). While being held, Carrie was occasionally threatened by Cornista, Labra, and Batan. Labra even told her that he would have raped her if not for her age. After four days, Carrie was released.[13]

On the other hand, Gliceree testified that she contacted the Presidential Anti-Crime Emergency Response (PACER) to assist her in negotiating with the kidnappers. She paid PHP 515,700.00 to Batan for the release of Carrie.[14]

Lourdes corroborated the testimony of Carrie that she was with Carrie when the latter was kidnapped. She also identified Cornista, Batan, and Bagares as the persons who abducted Carrie.[15]","Assailed in this appeal[1] is the October 30, 2015 Decision[2] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R.

The fallo of the CA Decision reads:
WHEREFORE, the decision dated April 16, 2010 issued by the Regional Trial Court of Imus, Cavite Branch 21 (RTC) in Criminal Case No. 2664-06 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION that the award of moral damages to private complainant is increased to P100,000.00. Accused-appellants are also ordered to pay civil indemnity in the amount of P100,000.00.

The accused-appellants are ordered to pay legal interest on all damages awarded in this case at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the finality of this decision until fully paid.

SO ORDERED.[28]
The appellate court agreed with the RTC that all the elements of the crime of Kidnapping for Ransom were proven by the prosecution. It likewise gave more weight to the prosecution witnesses' testimony and positive identification of the kidnappers. The CA likewise rejected accused-appellants' defenses of denial and alibi holding that it was not physically impossible for them to have been at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission.

Not satisfied, accused-appellants appealed to this Court.

In a Notice[29] dated September 25, 2017, the Court required the parties to file their respective supplemental briefs, if they so desired. The Office of the Solicitor General and the accused-appellants manifested that they will no longer file a supplemental brief.[30] Accused-appellant Rayga, however, filed his own supplemental brief[31] which was received by the Court on September 9, 2019. Insisting on his innocence, Rayga pointed out that state witness Mendoza failed to elaborate on his alleged participation in the kidnapping incident. He reiterates that there was no direct testimony coming from Mendoza to implicate him in the commission of the crime.","We affirm the penalty of reclusion perpetua meted out upon accused­ appellants instead of the death penalty by virtue of Republic Act No. 9346.[40] Accused-appellants shall not be eligible for parole under Act No. 4103,[41] the Indeterminate Sentence Law, as amended.[42]

We likewise sustain the award of actual damages in the amount of PHP 515,700.00 representing the ransom money rec'eived by the kidnappers from Gliceree, as well as the award of civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages in the amount of PHP 100,000.00 each, in line with prevailing jurisprudence.[43] The foregoing amounts shall accrue interest at the rate of 6% per annum, from the date of the finality of this Decision until fully paid.[44]

G.R. No. 248140,"JACQUELINE S. UY, PETITIONER, VS. 3TOPS DE PHILIPPINES ESTATE CORPORATION, RESPONDENT.","This case stemmed from an Ex Parte Petition[7] (for the Issuance of a Writ of Possession under Section 7, Act No. 3135,[8] as amended by Act No. 4118)[9] (hereafter, Ex Parte Petition) dated February 20, 2018 filed by respondent 3Tops De Philippines Estate Corporation (respondent), thru its President, Oscar M. Chua, before the RTC of Bacolod City, Branch 45, which was docketed as Cad. Case No. 18-4069.

In its Ex Parte Petition, respondent averred that it is the registered owner of two parcels of land situated at Tindalo Avenue, Shopping Center, Barangay Villamonte, Bacolod City, Philippines, evidenced by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 092-2014000935, covering Lot No. 7-G-6-C, with an area of 169 square meters; and TCT No. 092-2014000936, covering Lot No. 7-6-7-A, with an area of 331 square meters (collectively, subject properties). Situated on the said lots was a commercial building with Property Index No. 143-00-060­28-124.[10]

Respondent alleged that the subject properties were previously owned by Lucy S. Uy (Lucy), who obtained a loan from the Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation (RCBC) in 1995 and as a security, mortgaged the said properties in favor of RCBC.[11] In 2007, RCBC assigned all its rights and interests in the mortgage agreement to Star Two, Inc. (Star Two).[12] When Lucy defaulted in her obligation, Star Two initiated the extrajudicial foreclosure of the mortgaged properties on December 27, 2011.[13] Upon failure by Lucy to redeem the properties, on June 6, 2013, Star Two consolidated the ownership of the same in its name, under TCT Nos. 092-2013003691 and 092-2013003692.[14]

Then, on January 8, 2014, Star Two sold the properties to respondent in the amount of PHP 4,700,000.00, as evidenced by a Deed of Absolute Sale. Respondent caused the titling of the subject properties in its name, including the commercial building situated thereon.[15]

Respondent averred that since its acquisition of the properties in 2014, it has paid the corresponding taxes on the lots and the commercial building. As proof, respondent attached the official receipts and certification from the City Treasurer evidencing payment of property taxes for previous years up to 2018.[16] Respondent argued that it has satisfactorily established its entitlement to the issuance of a writ of possession, and thus, the trial court has a ministerial duty to issue the same.[17] Respondent further prayed for the issuance of a writ of demolition.[18]

In an Order dated April 24, 2018,[19] the trial court granted respondent's Ex Parte Petition and held that after redemption, the purchaser of the property has the right to be placed in possession thereof, and correspondingly, the court has the ministerial duty to issue the writ of possession.[20] Accordingly, a Writ of Possession[21] was issued on even date commanding the Ex-Officio Sheriff of RTC, Bacolod City or any of his or her lawful deputies, to place respondent in possession of the properties, and to eject therefrom all adverse occupants. On May 10, 2018, a Notice to Vacate[22] was issued to Lucy and all adverse occupants.

Petitioner Jacqueline S. Uy (petitioner), in the interest of her mother, Lucy, and as the then occupant of the subject properties, filed an Urgent Motion to Admit Herein Opposition (With Motion for the Honorable Court to [R]econsider [i]ts Order dated April 24, 2018, to Quash the Petitioner's [Ex Parte] Petition for Issuance of a Writ of Possession, and to Hold in Abeyance the Implementation of the Writ of Possession dated May 08, 2018 and the Notice to Vacate dated May 10, 2018) dated May 25, 2018 (hereafter, Urgent Motion).[23]","This Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] (Petition) seeks the reversal of the January 16, 2019[2] and the July 1, 2019[3] Resolutions of the Court of Appeals (CA/appellate court) in CA-G.R.

WHEREFORE, the instant petition for [certiorari] is hereby DISMISSED. Accordingly, petitioner's prayer for injunctive relief and/or temporary restraining order is deemed DENIED.

SO ORDERED.[36] (Emphasis in the original)
The appellate court declared that the proper remedy to assail an order granting a writ of possession to the purchaser of mortgaged property is an appeal in accordance with Act No. 3135, as amended;[37] that the buyer in a foreclosure sale becomes the absolute owner of the property purchased if it is not redeemed during the period of redemption, and as such, is entitled to the possession thereof;[38] that upon proper application and proof of title, the issuance of the writ of possession becomes a ministerial duty of the court;[39] accordingly, since the trial court need not exercise its discretion, then it can never be ascribed with grave abuse of discretion.[40] Moreover, respondent acquired all the rights and interests of its predecessor-in-interest, Star Two, and can thus, validly apply for a writ of possession ex parte.[41] Further, the appellate court ruled that the pendency of a civil case questioning the mortgage and foreclosure is not a bar to the issuance of a writ of possession;[42] and that respondent is not guilty of forum shopping since the Ex Parte Petition is non-litigious.[43]

The CA likewise denied petitioner's motion for reconsideration[44] in its Resolution dated July 1, 2019.[45] In the said Resolution, the appellate court also noted that petitioner has already voluntarily surrendered the possession of the subject properties to respondent; thus, the relief sought by petitioner has already been rendered moot.[46]

Hence, this instant petition where petitioner argues that the CA committed an error when it denied the certiorari petition outright on the ground that an appeal is the proper remedy from an order granting a writ of possession;[47] when it found no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court in whimsically denying her Urgent Motion and Motion for Reconsideration, and in the issuance of the Writ of Possession despite the pendency of the civil cases involving the same properties and the irregularities in the foreclosure proceedings;[48] and when it ruled that the case has already been rendered moot by the alleged voluntary surrender by petitioner of the subject properties to respondent.[49]","WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED. The January 16, 2019 and the July 1, 2019 Resolutions of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

 G.R. No. 242286,"GLOBE TELECOM, INC., PETITIONER, VS. KAY ABASTILLAS EBITNER, RESPONDENT.","Petitioner Globe Telecom, Inc. is a corporation engaged in the business of providing telecommunication services. Meanwhile, respondent Kay Abastillas Ebitner was petitioner's employee, hired in June 2005.[5] Respondent rose from the rank through the years until she was eventually promoted as Retail Shop Specialist.

On March 16, 2015, petitioner served on respondent a Notice to Explain, directing her to give details as to why she facilitated a credit adjustment on her father's account without proper notation on its justification.[6] The pertinent portion of the notice reads:
A report has been provided by Fraud Risk Management in relation to their findings that you have facilitated an invalid credit adjustment to the account of Mr. Leon Ebitner with mobile number 09178798805 amounting to Php998.99 using your own userID.

In this regard, you are hereby directed to explain in writing within five (5) days from receipt of this memo why no disciplinary action should be given to you on your alleged violation on our Code of Conduct (COC) specifically on Non-Observance of SOP, Fraud against the Company and for Serious Misconduct when you have facilitated the credit adjustment that was deemed invalid, to which the said account belonged to a person connected to you.

Failure on your part to submit your explanation shall waive your right to be heard, and management shall decide on the case based on the documents it has.

In the meantime, you are hereby placed under PREVENTIVE SUSPENSION effective upon receipt of this memo. You are also directed to turn-over your tools of work for the duration of the preventive suspension.

For your strict compliance.[7]
In response, respondent submitted on March 19, 2015 her written explanation, admitting that she was the one who facilitated the credit adjustment on October 24, 2014, using her own userID;[8] however, respondent claimed that she could no longer remember the circumstances surrounding the transaction and why she did it. Thus, she requested that she be allowed to check the transaction records hoping to remember why she made the adjustment. Respondent also maintained that had the transaction been invalid, she would have received an e-mail from the management within one month after the date of the transaction, as per company policy. Lastly, respondent expressed willingness to reimburse the amount involved in case the transaction was proved invalid.[9]

During the administrative hearing held on March 30, 2015, respondent admitted that the account involved was under her father's name, but the end-user was her mother, who complained of dropped calls every time she made a phone call.[10] Thus, as a sign of goodwill, she adjusted the ""MSF"" (monthly service fee). Respondent maintained, however, that she made the proper notation upon adjusting the amount due.[11]

Despite respondent's explanations, on April 30, 2015, petitioner served upon the former a Notice of Decision, stating that she was found to have failed to follow basic standard procedures and that there were lapses in relation to the credit adjustment made.[12] Moreover, petitioner found that while respondent claimed during the hearing that a notation to support the credit adjustment was made, no such notation was retrieved. Therefore, respondent was dismissed from service on the ground of fraud against the company and serious misconduct.[13]

Deeply aggrieved, respondent filed a Complaint for illegal dismissal, illegal suspension, and damages against petitioner.[14]","This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] assailing the July 26, 2018 Decision[2] and the October 1, 2018 Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 145471 which awarded separation pay in lieu of reinstatement to respondent, and denied petitioner's Motion for Partial Reconsideration,[4] respectively.","In its Decision dated July 26, 2018, the CA modified the NLRC resolution and reinstated the monetary awards granted to respondent. The dispositive portion reads:
ACCORDINGLY, the Resolution dated February 19, 2016 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. Petitioner is GRANTED separation pay of one month salary for every year of service, less one month salary as penalty for petitioner's infraction. An interest of 6% per annum is imposed on this money award from finality of this decision until full payment thereof. Petitioner is further required to REIMBURSE Globe Telecom Inc. the amount of Php998.99 with 6% interest from October 24, 2014 until the same is fully paid.

SO ORDERED. [24]
In its ruling, the CA affirmed the finding of the NLRC that there was just cause for respondent's dismissal. The appellate court, however, found the penalty of dismissal too harsh, considering that petitioner has been working with respondent for already 10 years at the time of the incident, with an unblemished record. Thus, it found the grant of separation pay proper. Petitioner's Motion for Partial Reconsideration[25] was likewise denied in a Resolution[26] dated October 1, 2018.

Aggrieved by the CA Decision and Resolution, petitioner filed the present petition.

In its Memorandum,[27] petitioner claims that the CA committed error in awarding separation pay, arguing that such may only be done if the employee was validly dismissed for causes other than serious misconduct or those reflecting on their moral character.

Meanwhile, respondent contends that she was illegally dismissed, and that the award of separation pay was proper.[28]","WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED. The Decision of the Court of Appeals dated July 26, 2018 is AFFIRMED with the following MODIFICATIONS:

1. Petitioner Globe Telecom, Inc. is ordered to PAY respondent Kay Abastillas Ebitner separation pay equivalent to one (1) month salary for every year of service, with a fraction of six (6) months considered as one whole year, counted from the commencement of employment up to the finality of this Decision;

2. Petitioner Globe Telecom, Inc. is ordered to PAY respondent Kay Abastillas Ebitner full backwages, counted from the time of dismissal up to the finality of this Decision; and

Due to economic crises, Sprint encountered difficulties in the payments of its loan and defaulted in its obligations.[8] The loan thus became past due by April of 2005.[9] Sprint negotiated with petitioner bank for the restructuring of its loan obligation.[10] However, the same failed which prompted LBP to send several letters to Sprint demanding payment.[11]

Due to Sprint's failure to settle its obligations, petitioner bank instituted extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings of the mortgaged property. On May 7, 2007, the Office of the Clerk of Court and Ex Officio Sheriff of RTC Makati City issued a Notice of Sheriffs Sale.[12] Sprint requested for the deferment of the foreclosure proceedings, but it was denied by petitioner bank.[13] Thus, on June 6, 2007, the mortgaged property was sold at a public auction with LBP as the highest bidder.[14]

Petitioner bank then gave Sprint notice that the redemption period of one year will expire on June 27, 2008.[15] While Sprint offered to redeem the property, it failed to do so.[16] Thus, with the redemption period having expired and without Sprint exercising its right to redeem the foreclosed property, the title to the property was consolidated in the name of LBP under TCT No. 006-2011000594.[17]

Sometime thereafter, or on January 5, 2009, Sprint filed a Complaint for Nullification of the Foreclosure of Mortgage, Certificate of Sale, and the Declaration of the Deed of Mortgage and Promissory Note as Null and Void and for Damages, with Alternative Cause of Action for Redemption by means of Judicial Action, with prayer to fix Redemption Amount[18] (Complaint) against petitioner bank, with the necessary parties, Clerk of Court and Ex-Officio Sheriff of the RTC Makati City, and the Register of Deeds of Makati City.

Sprint alleged that it requested for a longer term and restructuring of its loan obligation, and petitioner bank agreed to take up its request in a committee. It averred that it was made to believe by petitioner bank that no foreclosure proceedings will be initiated until such time that the restructuring of the obligation will be decided upon. It claimed that LBP agreed that as long as the interests are paid, the account will not be foreclosed. However, LBP allegedly increased the interest rate, bloated the attorney's fees, penalties, and charges resulting in an erroneous computation of the total amount to be paid by Sprint. Thus, Sprint argued that the interest rates were excessive and exorbitant that it decided to suspend payments of the loan obligation until such time that the rate of interest is judicially fixed. Finally, Sprint pointed out that the foreclosure proceedings and public auction of the subject property failed to comply with the requirements of Act No. 3135,[19] as amended, and that by reason of the wrongful foreclosure, the redemption period has not expired.[20]

On its part, while there was a request for restructuring of Sprint's past due account, petitioner bank argued that it never assured Sprint that the loan account will be restructured; Sprint also failed to submit their repayment/proposal plan in order that the restructuring may be processed and submitted for approval. There was also no agreement to suspend foreclosure as long as the interests are paid; and that even granting that there is such agreement, Sprint has an accumulated interest arrearages in the amount of PHP701,759.01 per Statement of Account dated June 6, 2007.[21]

Moreover, petitioner bank argued that they have mutually agreed on the interest rates including attorney's fees as indicated in the promissory notes freely executed by Sprint. During all the meetings and its letters to petitioner bank, Sprint never protested or complained about the interest rates that the bank imposed. Thus, Sprint should be estopped from questioning the correctness of the computation and the interest rates and the attorney's fees that petitioner bank had charged.[22]

LBP also maintained that despite several notices, Sprint failed to settle its obligations which resulted in the foreclosure of the mortgage; that the foreclosure sale was made upon prior demand and in accordance with the provisions of Act No. 3135, as amended, and applicable guidelines by the Court; and that the redemption period expired on June 27, 2008 with no acceptable redemption offer ever received from the mortgagor.[23]","This Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] (Petition) seeks the reversal of the May 2, 2018 Decision[2] and the January 29, 2019 Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R.

WHEREFORE, the Appeal is GRANTED. The Decision dated 1 December 2015 of the Regional Trial Court, National Capital Judicial Region, Makati City, Branch 143 is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Judgment is hereby rendered as follows:

1. The interest rates imposed by LBP are declared null and void. The principal amount of the loan shall instead be subject to the interest rate of twelve percent (12%) per [annum] up to June 30, 2013, and starting July 1, 2013, six percent (6%) per [annum] until full satisfaction;

2. In view of the nullity of the interest rate[s] imposed on the loan which affected the arrearages upon which the foreclosure was based, the foreclosure of mortgage, certificate of sale, affidavit of consolidation are declared VOID and TCT No. 006-2011000594 is hereby ordered CANCELLED.

SO ORDERED.[30] (Emphasis in the original)
In ruling in favor of Sprint, the CA held that petitioner bank violated the principle of mutuality of contracts when it unilaterally increased the interest rates.[31] There is no showing that Sprint assented to the interest rates imposed by petitioner bank for each quarter; thus, the adjusted rates should not bind them.[32] Even assuming that Sprint voluntarily agreed to the increase in interest rates, the same are still null and void for being exorbitant and excessive.[33] The CA observed that based on Sprint's Statement of Account as of June 6, 2007, the average monthly interest imposed by petitioner bank is 3.41% or in excess of 40% per annum; and this does not include the 24% per annum penalty.[34] Since the contractual interest rate is void, the guidelines on interest rate in accordance with Nacar v. Gallery Frames[35] should be applied.[36] Finally, the appellate court held that Sprint should not be made to pay the exorbitant outstanding obligation based on an iniquitous interest; thus, the foreclosure proceedings should be nullified.[37]","In view of all the foregoing, the validity of the foreclosure of [the] mortgage should be upheld for it was done in accordance with the law as well as the certificate of sale issued in connection thereof. x x x Consequently, the alternative cause of action praying that [Sprint] be allowed to redeem the foreclosed property should be denied. Clearly, the one-year (1-year) redemption period has already expired on June 27, 2008 and [Sprint] failed to exercise [its] right to redeem the property within such period x x x.[70]
We have no reason to disturb these findings.

CONCEPCION, DANILO URSUA, NARCISO PINEDA, AND AUGUSTO OROSA,* RESPONDENTS.","The case originated from a complaint filed on February 12, 1990 by the Office of the Solicitor General before the Presidential Commission on Good Government against respondents Eduardo M. Cojuangco, Jr., Juan Ponce Enrile, Maria Clara Lobregat, Rolando Dela Cuesta, Jose R. Eleazar, Jr., Jose C. Concepcion, Danilo S. Ursua, Narciso M. Pineda, and Augusto Orosa for violation of Republic Act No. 3019, which was referred to the Office of the Ombudsman and docketed as OMB-0-90-2808. The complaint stemmed from a Memorandum of Agreement dated November 20, 1974 between the National Investment and Development Corporation and Agricultural Investors, Inc., owned by Cojuangco, Jr., for developing a coconut seed garden, later administered by the United Coconut Planters Bank after amendments under Presidential Decrees. An arbitral award in 1983 favored Agricultural Investors, Inc., leading to alleged siphoning of funds from the Coconut Industry Development Fund. The Ombudsman, through Graft Investigation Officer Emora C. Pagunuran, dismissed the complaint on August 6, 1998 on prescription grounds, approved by Ombudsman Aniano A. Desierto, and denied the motion for reconsideration on September 25, 1998. The Republic filed a petition for certiorari under Rule 65, which this Court granted on August 23, 2001, directing preliminary investigation, but set aside on July 7, 2004 due to procedural issues, allowing service on respondents. Procedural history included motions, comments from surviving respondents, and exclusion of deceased respondents Eleazar, Jr., Orosa, Lobregat, and Cojuangco, Jr.
","The Supreme Court found the petition partly meritorious, reversing the Ombudsman's dismissal of the complaint against surviving respondents Enrile, Dela Cuesta, Concepcion, Ursua, and Pineda on prescription grounds, directing the Ombudsman to proceed with preliminary investigation. The Court relaxed procedural rules for substantial justice, considering the petition timely filed under amended Rule 65 and allowing late service on some respondents.
","The Court ruled that the Ombudsman acted with grave abuse of discretion in dismissing the complaint on prescription, as the 10-year prescriptive period under Republic Act No. 3019 commenced from the discovery of the offense under the blameless ignorance doctrine per Act No. 3326, Section 2, due to legislative imprimatur by Presidential Decrees 582, 961, and 1468 suppressing information during the Marcos regime, and allegations of conspiracy. The period was interrupted by the filing of the complaint with the Ombudsman. The Court applied the discovery rule given suppression through connivance and martial law, reckoning from the 1986 Freedom Constitution enabling recovery of ill-gotten wealth. Criminal liability of deceased respondents Eleazar, Jr., Orosa, Lobregat, and Cojuangco, Jr. was extinguished by death, but civil liability may persist based on other sources.
","The Ombudsman's August 6, 1998 Review and Recommendation and September 25, 1998 Order dismissing the complaint are reversed and set aside as to surviving respondents Enrile, Dela Cuesta, Concepcion, Ursua, and Pineda. The Ombudsman is directed to conduct preliminary investigation in OMB-0-90-2808. Criminal liabilities of deceased respondents are extinguished without prejudice to recovery of ill-gotten wealth through separate civil action. No costs awarded.

NIETO A. RACHO, PETITIONER, VS. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","The case emanated from a complaint by a concerned citizen which prompted the Ombudsman to investigate Nieto A. Racho for alleged unexplained wealth. The investigation revealed several sizeable bank deposits not declared in Racho's Statements of Assets, Liabilities, and Net Worth (SALN). The deposits appeared manifestly out of proportion to his lawful income during his incumbency as a public officer. As a result, the Ombudsman filed complaints for falsification of public documents and administrative dishonesty against Racho. Separately, the Republic filed a Petition for the Forfeiture of Unlawfully Acquired Wealth under Republic Act No. 1379 before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) aiming to forfeit the ill-gotten bank deposits. The RTC ordered forfeiture of Php 5,793,881.39 in favor of the State. The Court of Appeals affirmed the RTC decision but reduced the forfeitable amount to Php 4,363,388.83, citing the conjugal share of Racho's wife, Lourdes. Racho challenged this, arguing that none of the deposits were ill-gotten and that Lourdes was a necessary party. The Republic questioned the Court of Appeals’ jurisdiction to hear the case, claiming exclusive appellate jurisdiction belongs to the Sandiganbayan.","The Supreme Court ruled that the Sandiganbayan has exclusive appellate jurisdiction over civil forfeiture cases involving regional trial courts. Thus, the Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction to entertain Racho's appeal, making its decision void and without effect. On the merits, the Court upheld the RTC's finding that the bank deposits were unlawfully acquired, as Racho failed to rebut the presumption of ill-gotten wealth under Republic Act No. 1379, supplementing with findings from prior Office of the Ombudsman investigations which discredited Racho's evidence and explanations for the source of wealth.","The Court granted the Republic’s petition and denied Racho's.

The Court reversed and set aside the Court of Appeals’ Decision and Resolution.

The RTC’s November 16, 2013 Decision forfeiting Php 5,793,881.39 in favor of the State was affirmed.

The forfeited amount is subject to 6% per annum interest from finality until full satisfaction.

The Court emphasized the civil and quasi-criminal nature of forfeiture proceedings and clarified jurisdiction rules under Republic Act No. 8249, underscoring exclusive appellate jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan over final judgments from regional trial courts in such cases.","The bank deposits of Nieto A. Racho amounted to ill-gotten wealth, subject to forfeiture in favor of the State. The appellate jurisdiction lies with the Sandiganbayan, not the Court of Appeals. The forfeiture ordered by the RTC stands, with interest to accrue until fully paid."

EASTERN ISLAND SHIPPING LINES CORPORATION, RESPONDENT.","The case arose from a criminal case involving alleged illegal possession and transportation of forest products in violation of Section 77 of Presidential Decree No. 705 (P.D. No. 705).

Two accused persons were convicted by the RTC for the offense, and the lumber products along with a truck (subject truck, plate no. ACO 1836) used in the commission of the crime were confiscated.

The truck was purportedly owned by Eastern Island Shipping Lines Corporation and leased to a third party.

The respondent (Eastern Island Shipping Lines Corporation) filed motions claiming ownership and lack of knowledge or participation in the crime, seeking release of the vehicle.

The RTC denied the motion to release the truck, leading to a petition for certiorari before the Court of Appeals.

The CA granted the petition, ruling that the RTC ordering confiscation without impleading the respondent violated due process rights; the CA ordered the release of the truck.","The Supreme Court ruled the CA was correct in holding that administrative confiscation under Section 68-A of P.D. No. 705 is distinct from judicial confiscation under Section 68.

The RTC had no jurisdiction to order confiscation without allowing respondent, as a third-party claimant, to present evidence proving ownership and non-participation.

The May 25, 2018 RTC order was void for grave abuse of discretion and lack of jurisdiction due to denial of due process.

However, the Supreme Court modified the CA decision by remanding the confiscation aspect of the case back to the RTC for proper hearing on the third-party claim, instead of ordering outright release.

The RTC was directed to resolve the third-party claim expeditiously with opportunity for both sides to present and contest evidence.","Affirmed the Court of Appeals decision insofar as it struck down the RTC's confiscation order.

Modified the CA decision by remanding the case for proper judicial proceedings on the confiscation and third-party claim.

Required the RTC to hear respondent's evidence regarding ownership and participation in the offense before deciding on confiscation.

Reinforced application of Article 45 of the Revised Penal Code suppletorily with P.D. No. 705.

Recognized respondent’s right to due process and to contest confiscation.","The confiscation order by the RTC was null and void due to lack of due process.

The confiscation aspect involving the Isuzu dump truck was remanded to the RTC for proper proceedings.

The truck is not automatically released to Eastern Island Shipping Lines Corporation but may be subject to confiscation only after fair hearing and proof of ownership and non-involvement.

The case emphasized due process protections for third-party claimants in confiscation under special laws related to forest products"

MAXIMO BUGNAY, SR., RESPONDENT.","The petitioners, indigenous peoples from the Ibaloi and Kankana-ey tribes of Benguet Province, claim ownership and long-time possession of certain ancestral lands in Baguio City, inherited from a pioneer named Bilag. They allege that their occupation predates formal titles and that their land was misappropriated by respondent Maximo Bugnay, Sr., who obtained certificates of ancestral land title through fraud and without due process, violating mandatory procedural requirements. Diclas et al. initially filed applications for townsite sales over the disputed lands but found that Bugnay was granted ancestral land titles by the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP). They sought cancellation of Bugnay's titles, citing failure to comply with delineation and recognition processes and claiming he committed fraud. Bugnay, Sr., in contrast, asserts his long possession of the land, supported by lineage, surveys, and a formal application process with the NCIP. Procedural violations alleged by Diclas et al. were rebutted by Bugnay who noted compliance with posting and publication requirements. The NCIP and the Court of Appeals upheld Bugnay’s title, finding substantial compliance with law and procedure, and rejected claims of fraud and denial of due process. Diclas et al. challenged this ruling by invoking procedural errors and questioning the sufficiency of evidence supporting Bugnay's claims.","The Supreme Court affirmed the factual findings of the NCIP and the Court of Appeals, highlighting the doctrine of finality and respect for administrative bodies' expertise. The Court ruled Diclas et al. failed to prove fraud in the procurement of the titles or their vested rights over the land. The Court emphasized that land ownership recognition by the NCIP resembles registration proceedings subject to review only with actual and extrinsic fraud, which was not substantiated. Petitioners’ assertions based on alleged procedural lapses, insufficient postings, or lack of de facto occupation were held as inadequate to nullify the ancestral titles. The Court reiterated that publication of applications meets procedural requirements and that absence of evidence showing failure in these respects meant no denial of due process. Furthermore, petitioners' claims of native title and vested rights were not supported by compelling evidence before the Court.","The petition for review was denied. The Court upheld the titles of Maximo Bugnay, Sr. as valid and confirmed his compliance with the procedural requisites for ancestral land recognition. It found no merit in allegations of fraud, denial of due process, or procedural noncompliance. The findings and rulings of the NCIP and the Court of Appeals were accorded great respect and finality, with no grounds for the Court to upset such determinations under Rule 45, as these involved factual controversies outside the Court’s scope to review.","The certificates of ancestral land title issued to Maximo Bugnay, Sr. are confirmed as valid. The petitioners, Gabriel Diclas and others, failed to establish their vested right or fraud allegations to warrant cancellation of the certificates. The Court thus dismissed the petition, affirming respondent’s ownership and possession of the disputed ancestral lands under the law and proper administrative processes. The decision underscores the importance of administrative findings in indigenous land disputes and the high burden required to overturn such titles through judicial review."

After Yu defaulted, PFC foreclosed and bought the property at auction, but never received a new title in its name. In 1991, the property became subject to compulsory acquisition under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) pursuant to Republic Act No. 6657. By 1993, Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) computed just compensation on only 60 hectares, since 15 hectares were found to have slopes of 18% or greater and deemed excluded from compulsory coverage. The Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) then cancelled the property’s title and issued new titles to farmer-beneficiaries for all 75 hectares. Paramount Finance, not notified of expropriation nor compensated, filed a petition contesting the amount of just compensation and the inclusion of the entire property in the CARP coverage. The Special Agrarian Court was tasked to resolve the dispute .","The Special Agrarian Court rejected attempts to dismiss the petition, and after failed pre-trial settlement, appointed three commissioners to value the property. Commissioner Rubia valued the land at P1,193,327.00 based on its present situation, which the lower courts adopted for all 75 hectares. The Court of Appeals affirmed the lower court's method and valuation, holding that since all 75 hectares were taken for agrarian reform, the full area should be included in compensation. Land Bank challenged this, arguing that the 15 hectares with slopes over 18% should have been statutorily excluded and returned to PFC .","The Supreme Court partly granted Land Bank's petition, ruling that the lower courts erred in ordering just compensation for the entire 75 hectares. According to Section 10 of Republic Act No. 6657, the 15 hectares with slopes over 18% should be excluded from compulsory acquisition. The Court ordered the re-titling and return of the 15-hectare excluded portion to Paramount Finance, with any costs of such return charged to DAR. The Regional Trial Court, nonetheless, was affirmed in its adoption of an alternative method to compute compensation, due to the absence of needed valuation factors like market value by tax declaration and comparable sales .","The just compensation for the covered 60 hectares is affirmed at P642,770.10, and for the incorrectly included 15 hectares, the title must be returned to Paramount Finance Corporation. Paramount Finance retains the right to seek damages for the wrongful titling of the 15 hectares in a separate proceeding. Thus, the Supreme Court mandates that only the lands properly covered by the CARP should be compensated, while those excluded by law must be returned to their previous owner, and that alternative methods for computing compensation are valid when strict formula requirements cannot be met ."
G.R. No. 244842,"PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. RUEL ALAGABAN Y BONAFE, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","On July 30, 2013, Ruel Alagaban y Bonafe was arrested in his residence in Legazpi City after Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) agents implemented a search warrant issued by the Regional Trial Court of Ligao City. During the search, agents recovered seven sachets containing a total of 11.989 grams of methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu). Alagaban was charged with illegal possession of dangerous drugs under Section 11, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165. The prosecution presented multiple witnesses to establish the chain of custody and validity of the search. Alagaban denied the charge and alleged improprieties in the conduct of the search and inventory, including claims that the police planted evidence and attempted extortion. The Regional Trial Court of Legazpi City found Alagaban guilty, sentencing him to life imprisonment and a fine of PHP 500,000. The Court of Appeals subsequently affirmed his conviction, upholding both the validity of the search warrant issued by Ligao City and the prosecution's compliance with statutory requirements for handling evidence.","On appeal, the Supreme Court scrutinized the validity of the search warrant and found serious procedural defects in its issuance and application. The Court pointed out that the search warrant was procured through an application filed in Ligao City rather than the court with territorial jurisdiction over Legazpi City, where the alleged crime was committed. The only reason provided for this venue choice was a vague assertion to prevent information leakage. The Supreme Court emphasized that while exceptions exist allowing search warrants to be issued outside territorial jurisdiction, such exceptions require substantiated, compelling reasons, not just uncorroborated claims. The Court found the application for the warrant, and thus the warrant itself, lacking in sufficient factual and evidentiary basis.","The Supreme Court held that the lower courts had erred in upholding Alagaban’s conviction, since the evidence was obtained through an invalidly issued search warrant. The Court stressed that constitutional and procedural requirements for the issuance and application of search warrants must be strictly complied with, particularly regarding venue and the substantiation of compelling reasons for deviation from standard rules. The absence of a valid finding of probable cause and a substantiated compelling reason for applying outside the proper venue rendered the search warrant invalid, and the evidence seized inadmissible.","The appeal was granted, and Ruel Alagaban y Bonafe was acquitted of the charge of illegal possession of dangerous drugs. The Supreme Court ordered his release unless he was being lawfully held for another cause. The decision underscores the importance of strict adherence to the procedural and constitutional safeguards in search and seizure operations, especially in drug-related cases."

[G.R. No. 185594]

THE HEIRS OF THE LATE DOMINGO BARRAQUIO REPRESENTED BY GLENN BARRAQUIO, PETITIONERS, VS. ALMEDA INCORPORATED AND THE COURT OF APPEALS, RESPONDENTS.","This case involves four parcels of land in Barangay Pulong Sta. Cruz, Santa Rosa, Laguna, owned by Almeda Incorporated, with a total area of 14.5727 hectares. In 1994, the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) awarded Certificates of Land Ownership Award (CLOAs) to several farmer-beneficiaries, including the late Domingo Barraquio. Almeda challenged the award, claiming the properties had been reclassified as industrial since March 1, 1989, by municipal ordinance, and thus should be excluded from agrarian reform coverage. The Provincial Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (PARAB) initially dismissed Almeda’s complaint but later reversed its decision, ordering cancellation of the CLOAs and reversion of the land to Almeda. Subsequently, Almeda obtained an Exemption Order from the DAR Secretary in 2003, and a Certificate of Finality was issued, but Barraquio filed for reconsideration and later passed away. His heirs continued the legal fight, arguing that the properties were still classified as agricultural before the relevant laws took effect, and that the exemption order was neither final nor a sufficient basis for cancellation of the CLOAs.","The Supreme Court determined that procedural remedies may be relaxed in cases involving social legislation, and found that the issuance of the DAR Secretary’s Exemption Order in 2003 was not yet final and executory, given that reconsideration and appeals remained pending. Therefore, it was improper to use the exemption order as the basis for canceling the CLOAs awarded to the heirs of Barraquio. The Court granted the motion to admit newly discovered evidence submitted by the petitioners, which supported the claim that the land was still classified as agricultural prior to the effectivity of Republic Act No. 6657, the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law. This evidence was central to the resolution of the case, as it pertained directly to whether the lands should be covered by agrarian reform.","The Supreme Court held that the conflicting certifications and evidence presented at various stages of the proceedings cast doubt on the respondent’s claim of industrial classification before 1988. The Court found that substantial evidence supported petitioner’s position showing the lands were classified as agricultural. Because the Exemption Order was not final and the evidence leaned towards agricultural classification, the Supreme Court ordered the restoration of the CLOAs issued to Barraquio’s heirs, subject to proof of just compensation to Almeda. Furthermore, the case reaffirmed that exemption orders must be final and executory before they can be used to revoke agrarian awards, and social justice considerations should favor landless farmers in agrarian disputes.","The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the heirs of Domingo Barraquio, ordering the restoration of the CLOAs in their favor and confirming that the properties remain covered by the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program, subject to payment of just compensation to Almeda Incorporated. The Court underscored the primacy of agrarian reform and social justice, and clarified that the Exemption Order lacked finality and could not serve as the sole basis for cancellation of the land awards.​"
G.R. No. 258526,"MANILA CREDIT CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. RAMON S. VIROOMAL AND ANITA S. VIROOMAL, OFFICE OF THE CLERK OF COURT AND EX-OFFICIO SHERIFF OF THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT OF PARAÑAQUE CITY, AS REPRESENTED BY ATTY. JERRY R. TOLEDO AND SHERIFF ALEJANDRO P. ABREMATEA, AND THE REGISTER OF DEEDS OF PARAÑAQUE CITY, RESPONDENTS.","In September 2009, respondents Ramon S. Viroomal and Anita S. Viroomal obtained a loan from petitioner Manila Credit Corporation (MCC) under Promissory Note (PN) No. 7155 in the amount of PHP 467,600.00 payable in 60 months. The loan has an interest rate of 23.36% per annum and is secured by a real estate mortgage (REM) over Ramon's property in Parañaque City covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 72248. To keep up with the monthly payments, respondents asked for a loan restructuring and executed a second promissory note, PN No. 8351, for the amount of PHP 495,840.00 payable in 84 months at 24.99% interest per annum. The restructured amount represents the unpaid balance in PN No. 7155, interests, and penalty charges. As respondents failed to make timely amortizations, MCC demanded full payment of the outstanding obligation of PHP 549,029.69 as of October 15, 2016. Respondents, however, claimed that they already paid a total of PHP 1,175,638.12 and thus asked for a re-computation of their account. MCC ignored respondents' request. Instead, it proceeded with the extra-judicial foreclosure of the REM. This prompted respondents to file a Complaint, Civil Case No. 2017-79, for the declaration of nullity of real estate mortgage, injunction, and specific performance with prayer for temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction before the Regional Trial Court of Parañaque City (RTC). Mainly, respondents argue that their loan obligation was fully paid had they not been burdened by the 36% per annum effective interest rate (EIR) and other charges which were allegedly surreptitiously imposed by MCC. Respondents argued that the interest rate and charges must be declared void for being unconscionable, iniquitous, and immoral. In its Answer, MCC countered that respondents willingly consented to the terms of the loan contract which charges an EIR of 36% per annum on the principal amount plus penalties in case of delay. Respondents are estopped from assailing the validity of the promissory notes since they benefited from the loan proceeds. MCC prayed that the Complaint be dismissed and that the Counterclaims be granted. Meanwhile, there being no injunctive relief issued by the trial court, MCC was declared the highest bidder in the foreclosure sale. Upon the lapse of the redemption period, the title over the mortgaged property was consolidated in MCC's name under TCT No. 010-2019001298 of the Registry of Deeds for Parañaque City.","On March 3, 2020, the RTC, Branch 258 rendered a Decision in favor of respondents, disposing as follows:
WHEREFORE, based on the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered declaring:
a. The interests compounded by defendant in PN7155 as void for being grossly excessive, unconscionable, exorbitant[,] and contrary to law; hence reduced to the legal interest rate of 12% per annum based on the original principal loan amount of Php467,600.00;
b. PN7155 plus all interests FULLY PAID and that the obligation considered cancelled and extinguished together with the accessory contract of Real Estate Mortgage securing the same[;]
c. PN8351 void ab initio for lack of consideration because the amount loaned therein represents the illegally compounded interests only; considering further that as of January 2014 the plaintiffs have already paid Php757,778.54, an amount over and above the obligation in PN7155 plus the legal interest herein imposed;
d. The Plaintiffs are allowed to recover from the defendant the overpayment in the amount or Php417,859.58 plus the 6% legal interest rate from date of filing;
e. The Registry of Deeds for Parañaque City is directed to cancel TCT No. 010-2019001298, defendant's title, and reinstate TCT No. 72248, plaintiff Ramon's title thereto, after payment of appropriate fees.
The prayer for damages and Attorney's fees are denied for having no basis.
SO ORDERED.
MCC filed a Motion for Reconsideration which was denied in the RTC's Order dated June 16, 2020.
On appeal, the CA affirmed the trial court's judgment. In the assailed July 6, 2021 Decision, the CA held that MCC imposed 36% per annum, equivalent to 3% per month EIR on respondents' outstanding balance upon delay. The EIR was charged on top of the 1/10 of 1% interest for each day it remains overdue, 1.5% per month penalty charge, and PHP 100.00 collection fee, in addition to the stipulated 23.36% interest per annum on the principal amount. In total, MCC charged 77.36% interest per annum, which must be equitably reduced for being exorbitant and unconscionable. Further, the CA declared that the compounded interests and penalty charges imposed by MCC are void. After applying the legal interest and deducting the total payments made by respondents, the CA ruled that the first loan under PN No. 7155 was fully paid. As for the second loan under PN No. 8351, which supposedly covered the ""unpaid balance"" of PN No. 7155, the same was also declared void. Thus, respondents are now entitled to recover overpayment, the foreclosure proceedings were void, and the title to the mortgaged property was reverted to respondents, to wit:
Following the above precepts, the compounded interests and penalty charges imposed upon appellees must also be considered as iniquitous, unconscionable and, therefore, void. As such, the rates may validly be reduced by the courts, as done in this case. Taking into consideration the reduction and the payment already made by appellees (P1,175,638.12 in total), PN No. 7115 has already been fully paid; and any overpayment may validly be claimed by appellees. Consequently, PN No. 8351, which represented the ""unpaid balance"" of PN No. 7155 inclusive of the exorbitant interests and penalty charges, has no leg to stand on. There being no reason to foreclose the REM, the same having been extinguished with the payment of the loan, the new title in the name of MCC is void. Accordingly, TCT No. 72248 in the name of Ramon must be reinstated[.]
MCC sought reconsideration of the adverse judgment but the CA denied its Motion in the assailed December 22, 2021 Resolution.","The Petition has no merit. By virtue of their contract of loan, MCC agreed to lend money to respondents, who, in turn, bound themselves to return the principal obligation plus pay monetary interest, which is the compensation for the use or forbearance of money. Under the principle of autonomy of contracts, parties to an agreement are allowed to establish such stipulations, clauses, terms, and conditions as they may deem convenient, provided that these are not contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order, or public policy. Here, MCC and respondents agreed on 23.36% per annum as monetary interest for the PHP 467,600.00 loan under the first promissory note, PN No. 7155. The stipulated interests were computed for the five-year duration of the loan as they formed part of the PHP 16,895.77 monthly amortization to be paid by respondents. PN No. 7155 also provided for the payment of ""an interest of 1/10th of 1% for every day"" the loan obligation remains unpaid, plus ""penalty of 1.5% per month"" and ""collection fee of P100.00 added, all of which, if left unpaid, shall be compounded monthly on due date to become part of the total outstanding obligation."" In this case, however, the RTC found that MCC imposed an additional 3% monthly interest, referred to as the EIR. During trial, MCC admitted that it was their company policy to charge 3% per month EIR for every delay. The EIR is on top of the stipulated 23.36% per annum monetary interest and the penalties of 1/10 of 1% per day and 1.5% per month penalty, all of which were compounded monthly as part of the outstanding balance. Clearly, the Court cannot sustain the imposition of the compounded 3% monthly EIR. The evidence shows that the EIR was not indicated in PN No. 7155. MCC unilaterally imposed the EIR by simply inserting it in the disclosure statement. This is not valid and does not bind the respondents as it violates the mutuality of contracts under Article 1308 of the Civil Code, which states that the validity or compliance to the contract cannot be left to the will of one of the parties. The Court likewise rejects MCC's argument that the 3% monthly EIR may not be invalidated because the reduction of interest rates only apply to loans with open-ended terms, citing De la Paz v. L & J Development Company, Inc. Further, MCC cannot validly insist that respondents may not question the interest rates after agreeing to and benefiting from the proceeds of the loan. In Megalopolis Properties, Inc. v. D 'Nhew Lending Corporation, the Court ruled that although there is no numerical limit on conscionability, the rate of 3% per month or 36% per annum is three times more than the 12% legal interest rate, and therefore, excessive and unconscionable. The rate of 36% per annum is also far greater than those previously upheld by the Court. Moreover, contrary to MCC's argument, we stressed in Megalopolis that the ruling in De la Paz did not in any way shield loan agreements with definite terms from scrutiny on conscionability. In De la Paz, the Court disallowed the creditor's claim for payment of monetary interests because of the absence of a written stipulation on interests as required under Article 1956 of the Civil Code. The fact that an interest of 6% per month was imposed on an open-ended loan wherein the period is unspecified only served to aggravate the outrageous amount being charged. At any rate, jurisprudence is settled that the willingness of the debtor in assuming an unconscionable rate of interest is inconsequential to its validity. When MCC and the respondents executed PN No. 7155 in September 2009, the legal interest rate was fixed at 12% per annum. This rate was considered the reasonable compensation for forbearance of money. As held in Spouses Abella v. Spouses Abella, while the contracting parties may depart from the legal interest rate, any deviation therefrom must be reasonable and fair. If the stipulated interest for a loan is more than twice the prevailing legal rate of interest, it is for the creditor to prove that this rate is justified under the prevailing market conditions. No justification was offered by MCC in this case. In Chua v. Timan, the Court declared that stipulated interest rates ranging from 3% per month and higher are excessive, unconscionable, and void for being contrary to morals, if not against the law. Although Central Bank of the Philippines Circular No. 905-82 has effectively removed the interest ceilings prescribed under the Usury Law, still, lenders may not impose interest rates that would enslave the borrowers or hemorrhage their assets. Following these standards, the 3% per month or 36% per annum EIR cannot pass as reasonable. It is unacceptable particularly in this case where the EIR was charged on top of the stipulated 23.36% per annum monetary interest and the penalties of 1/10 of 1% per day and 1.5% per month, compounded monthly. As correctly pointed out by the trial court, MCC's scheme exponentially bloated the principal loan amount of PHP 467,600.00. It misled respondents into continuously paying on the belief that their balance was increasing because of several delayed payments. Likewise, the Court denies MCC's prayer to maintain the stipulated interest and charges in PN No. 7155 and hereby affirms the RTC and the CA's judgment equitably reducing the stipulated interest rate to the applicable 12% per annum legal interest. Even if we disregard the 3% per month or 36% per annum EIR, the Court sees that the stipulated interest rate of 23.36% per annum and the additional interest of 1/10 of 1% per day and 1.5% per month penalty, all compounded monthly, or roughly 42% per annum, is still excessive. Stipulations authorizing the imposition of iniquitous or unconscionable interest are contrary to morals, if not against the law. Under Article 1409 of the Civil Code, these contracts are inexistent and void from the beginning. They cannot be ratified nor the right to set up their illegality as a defense be waived. The unconscionable interest rate is therefore, nullified and is deemed not written in the contract of loan. For these reasons, and given the span of years counted from 2009 that are covered by the computation of interests, the reduction of the stipulated interest rates and penalties to the applicable 12% per annum legal interest is more equitable. This prevents the outstanding balance from increasing to an amount which disproportionately exceeds the PHP 467,600.00 principal debt. The Court is empowered to equitably reduce the penalties charged especially in respondents' case because of their substantial payments. Note however that only the EIR and stipulated interest rates and penalties are declared void for being unconscionable. The very nature of the parties' contract of loan entitles MCC to recover not only the principal amount, but also the payment of monetary interest from the respondents, as compensation for the use of the borrowed amount. Based on Article 1420 of the Civil Code, respondents' obligation to pay the principal and the interest subsists as this can be separated from the void interests rates and charges. Now, in order to determine whether the RTC and the CA were correct in ruling that the entire principal obligation of PHP 467,600.00 under the first promissory note, PN 7155, has been fully paid by respondents, we apply the legal rate of 12% per annum, as monetary interest reckoned from the date of the contract, September 2009. We also deduct respondents' payments made until January 2014 amounting to a total of PHP 757,778.54, computed as follows: As can be seen from the foregoing, the RTC and the CA correctly ruled that respondents had fully paid the entire obligation. The Court finds that the obligation was fully paid as early as August 2012 and there was even an overpayment of PHP 11,532.47 for that month. Since respondents continued the payments until January 2014, they have a total overpayment of PHP 203,532.47 for PN No. 7155. Relative to this, the Court sustains the RTC and the CA's declaration that the second promissory note, PN No. 8351, is void for lack of consideration as it was only executed by respondents to cover the supposed ""unpaid balance"" in PN No. 7155. In this regard, we need to modify the RTC and the CA's judgment in order to reflect the correct amount of overpayment to be refunded to respondents. The total amount to be refunded to respondents must cover not only the payments made in PN No. 8351 in the amount of PHP 417,859.58, as awarded by the RTC and the CA, but also the overpayment in PN No. 7155 amounting to PHP 203,532.47, as shown in the computation above, plus legal interest of 6% per annum from the date of the filing of respondents' Complaint until finality, following Nacar v. Gallery Frames. All monetary awards will earn interest at the rate of 6% per annum from finality of this Decision until full payment. Finally, the Court affirms the CA's ruling that the foreclosure proceedings are void. Generally, the nullity of the unconscionable interests and charges does not affect the terms of the real estate mortgage. The creditor's right to foreclose the mortgage remains, and such right can be exercised upon the failure of the debtors to pay the debt due. In this case however, the principal loan obligation was extinguished by the full payment of the respondents. This act automatically terminates the real estate mortgage. Being a mere accessory contract, the mortgage cannot exist independently of the principal obligation. Considering that the mortgage ceased to exist, the new title, TCT No. 010-2019001298 of the Registry of Deeds for Parañaque City, issued in the name of MCC as a result of the foreclosure, is void. The title registered in the name of respondent Ramon, TCT No. 72248, was properly reinstated by the RTC and the CA.

Abarracoso, without the authority from the Sangguniang Bayan of Hinabangan, Samar, their participation being:
(a) Abarratigue signed Disbursement Voucher No. 100-2008081081 approving the payment of PhP500,000.00 to Ofelia S. Abarracoso, widow of Isidro A. Abarracoso, for the purchase of a portion of Lot 387 situated in the Municipality of Hinabangan, Samar;
(b) Abarratigue entered into a contract of sale with Ofelia S. Abarracoso and her children by signing the Extrajudicial Settlement of Estate among the Heirs with Absolute Deed of Sale in behalf of the Municipality of Hinabangan, Samar;
(c) Tapia certified as to the availability of funds in Disbursement Voucher No. 100-2008081081 and signed Check No. 617805; and
(d) Bagro received Check No. 617805 for and in behalf of Ofelia S. Abarracoso.
Upon their arraignment, accused-appellants pleaded not guilty. During pre-trial, the parties stipulated, among others, to the above facts. The Sandiganbayan found that Abarratigue failed to secure prior authorization from the Sangguniang Bayan to purchase the lot, contrary to Section 22(c) and Section 444(b)(1)(vi) of RA 7160 (Local Government Code). Documentary evidence showed there was no specific resolution or ordinance authorizing the contract. Despite this, the transaction for the purchase was completed and the check was issued with Bagro as payee, not the seller. The P500,000.00 was disbursed from municipal funds for the unauthorized transaction, constituting undue injury to the government.","The Sandiganbayan found all elements of violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019 were proven: that the accused were public officers (or acting in collusion therewith); that they acted with evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence; and that their acts caused undue injury to the government. The court found that the funding was only intended for cemetery expansion and did not authorize outright purchase of land, and that issuing the check to a municipal employee as payee for a transaction with a private seller violated explicit legal prohibitions. The appellants were found guilty beyond reasonable doubt and were sentenced accordingly.","The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction. It held that the allocation of funds for “expansion of the municipal cemetery” did not amount to authority to purchase land for this purpose without a specific resolution or ordinance from the Sangguniang Bayan. The issuance of the check in the name of an employee instead of the seller, and the absence of proper legal authorization, constituted not mere negligence but evident bad faith and a violation of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act. The acts committed by accused-appellants were found to be conscious wrongdoings carried out for a perverse motive, resulting in the disbursement of public funds for unauthorized purposes and warranting conviction.","The appeal is DENIED. The Decision dated November 8, 2019, of the Sandiganbayan in Criminal Case No. SB-17-CRM-1805 is hereby AFFIRMED in toto. Accused-appellants Alejandro Navual Abarratigue, Raul Robelio Tapia, and Analiza Mabonga Bagro are hereby found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019 or the “Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.” They are sentenced to suffer the penalties of imprisonment for an indeterminate period of six (6) years and one (1) month, as minimum, to ten (10) years, as maximum, and perpetual disqualification from holding public office.

A.C. No. 13466 (Formerly CBD Case No. 16-5156),"MARICEL H. ARTATES, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. MEINRADO ENRIQUE A. BELLO, RESPONDENT.","Complainant alleged that she engaged the legal services of respondent to represent her in an illegal dismissal case that she would file before the Labor Arbiter (LA). Consequently, respondent represented complainant in the conciliation conference of the labor case and likewise submitted the latter's position paper and reply therein. However, complainant claimed that respondent never informed her of the unfavorable decision in the said case. Complainant and her husband then tried to contact respondent in order to inquire the status of the labor case, but no to avail. Considering that five months had passed since the filing of the case and without a word heard from respondent, complainant asked his husband to inquire the status of her case before the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC). She then found out that her case was already dismissed by the LA on September 29, 2015. As she could not contact respondent, complainant hired the services of a new lawyer to file an appeal. However, the appeal was dismissed for being filed out of time. Faulting the dismissal of the case to respondent's negligence, complainant filed the instant administrative complaint, seeking that respondent be found guilty of violating the lawyer's oath, as well as the ethical standards expected of him as a lawyer. For his part, respondent denied complainant's charges, claiming instead that after the LA's rendition of the subject judgment, he immediately informed a certain ""Reiner Cunanan"" (Cunanan), complainant's focal person, of the matter. However, Cunanan told respondent that he could no longer contact complainant and asked him to inform complainant himself. Respondent then averred that he did not hear anything from Cunanan and complainant since then. Respondent likewise narrated that complainant was only introduced by Cunanan in one of their meetings wherein the latter asked for his assistance in the filing of an illegal dismissal case before the NLRC. Respondent further claimed that complainant and Cunanan requested him not to charge fees as complainant had no capacity to pay attorney's fees. Respondent acceded but told complainant to reimburse him of his gasoline expenses. He then told complainant that he would assist her in the preparation of the position paper and other pleadings in the LA level.","In a Report and Recommendation dated March 12, 2020, the IBP-Investigating Commissioner (IBP-IC) recommended that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for a period of six (6) months. In so recommending, it found that there was a lawyer-client relationship between complainant and respondent, whether there was a focal person, and that respondent's failure to inform complainant of the status of her case was a clear violation of Rules 18.03 and 18.04, Canon 18 of the CPR. In a Notice of Resolution dated October 10, 2020 in Resolution No. CBD-2020-10-14, the IBP Board of Governors (IBP-BOG) adopted and approved the IBP-IC's recommendation. Aggrieved, complainant moved for reconsideration before the IBP-BOG. Consequently, in a Notice of Resolution dated December 2, 2021 in Resolution No. CBD-XXV-2021-12-17, the IBP-BOG modified its earlier Resolution, adding the phrase ""with a stern warning that any similar subsequent infraction shall merit a more severe penalty x x x.""","The Court affirms the findings and adopts the recommendation of the IBP. Lawyers, upon becoming members of the Philippine Bar, solemnly take the Lawyer's Oath, by which they vow, among others, that they will delay no person for money or malice, and will conduct themselves as lawyers according to the best of their knowledge and discretion, with all good fidelity, as well as to the courts as to their clients. Should they violate this oath, they likewise contravene the provisions of Canon 17 and Rules 18.03 and 18.04, Canon 18 of the CPR. In this case, there is no dispute that respondent neglected the legal matters entrusted to him by complainant. Records revealed that respondent failed to inform complainant of the unfavorable decision issued by the LA. Clearly, his negligence caused material damage to complainant as she was precluded from perfecting her appeal before the NLRC. Moreover, the fact that respondent was not accepting attorney's fees from complainant will not negate his administrative liability. Verily, a lawyer is expected to maintain at all times a high standard of legal proficiency, and to devote his or her full attention, skill, and competence to the case, regardless of its importance and whether he or she accepts it for a fee or for free. With regard to the appropriate penalty on an errant lawyer, sound judicial discretion based on the surrounding facts is required. This Court has consistently meted out the penalty of suspension from the practice of law to lawyers who neglect their client's affairs. In view thereof, the Court affirms the recommendation of the IBP BOG. Accordingly, he is meted the penalty of suspension from the practice of law for a period of six (6) months, with a stern warning that a repetition of the same and similar acts shall be dealt with more severely.","ACCORDINGLY, respondent Atty. Meinrado Enrique A. Bello (respondent) is found GUILTY of violating the Lawyer's Oath, Canon 17, as well as Rules 18.03 and 18.04, Canon 18 of the Code of Professional Responsibility. He is SUSPENDED from the practice of law for a period of six (6) months, and is STERNLY WARNED that a repetition of the same offense or similar act shall be dealt with more severely. The suspension from the practice of law shall take effect immediately upon receipt of this Decision by respondent. He is DIRECTED to immediately file a Manifestation to the Court that his suspension has started, copy furnished all courts and quasi-judicial bodies where he has entered his appearance as counsel. Let copies of this Decision be furnished the Office of the Bar Confidant to be appended to respondent's personal record as an attorney; the Integrated Bar of the Philippines for its information and guidance; and the Office of the Court Administrator for circulation to all courts in the country. SO ORDERED."
G.R. Nos. 245982-83,"PHILIPPINE PIZZA, INC., PETITIONER, VS. MICHAEL A. ORAA, BERNARDITO* R. GARCIA, JR. AND CONSOLIDATED BUILDING MAINTENANCE, INC., RESPONDENTS.","Petitioner is a domestic corporation and the franchisee and operator of the Pizza Hut chain of restaurants. On the other hand, Consolidated Building Maintenance, Inc. (CBMI) is a corporation engaged in the business of providing janitorial, kitchen, messengerial, elevator maintenance, and allied services to various clients, such as petitioner. On January 21, 2015, respondents filed a complaint for constructive illegal dismissal with prayer for reinstatement and money claims against petitioner and CBMI. In their Magkasanib na Sinumpaang Salaysay, respondents averred the following: (1) petitioner hired Oraa as a team member in April 2005, while it engaged Garcia as a delivery rider in January 2010; (2) they were deemed as regular employees of petitioner as their jobs were necessary and desirable to its business; (3) it was petitioner which exercised control and supervision over the manner of their work, and which owned the tools they used in the performance of their duties; (4) upon the end of their respective contracts, petitioner advised them to apply with CBMI; (5) eventually, CBMI hired them to do the same jobs and deployed them to their former Pizza Hut branches; and (6) on account of the previous complaint for regularization which they filed against petitioner in February 2013 (the earlier regularization case), petitioner constructively dismissed them from employment. According to Oraa, petitioner no longer allowed him to report for work on December 22, 2014 after he went on leave on December 21, 2014 to attend his cousin's wedding. On the other hand, Garcia narrated that on December 20, 2014, he rendered work from 1:00 p.m. until 1:00 a.m. Consequently, he failed to report for his regular shift on December 21, 2014. Garcia alleged that petitioner no longer allowed him to report for work on December 22, 2014. In defense, CBMI alleged the following in its Position Paper: (1) it is a legitimate job contractor and respondents were its employees; (2) respondents incurred unauthorized absences from December 21 to December 27, 2014; (3) it exercised its management prerogative when it dismissed respondents from work for their unauthorized absences; (4) it served a Notice to Explain upon Oraa via registered mail, but he failed to respond despite notice; (5) for Oraa's failure to reply, it found him liable for abandonment of work and dismissed him from employment; and (6) Garcia's complaint before the LA was premature as he filed it during the pendency of the administrative investigation of his case. For its part, petitioner averred in its Position Paper that respondents were the employees of CBMI, and that the latter is a legitimate job contractor. To prove its allegation, petitioner adduced the following pieces of evidence: (1) a copy of its Contract of Services with CBMI executed on February 8, 2002; (2) CBMI's Articles of Incorporation; (3) CBMI's Company Profile; (4) Independent Auditor's Report as of December 2012 and 2013; (5) CBMI's Certificate of Registration issued by the DOLE valid until March 1, 2018; and (6) Certifications showing CBMI's remittance of respondents' premium contributions to the Social Security System, the Pag-IBIG Fund, and the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation covering the periods of April 2006 to December 2014 for Oraa, and December 2010 to December 2014 for Garcia.","In the Decision dated July 28, 2015, the LA ruled in favor of respondents and held that they were regular employees of petitioner because: (1) it controlled and supervised the manner of respondents' work; and (2) it owned the tools and machines which respondents used in the performance of their duties. According to the LA, the transfer of respondents from petitioner to CBMI was merely a scheme to prevent respondents from attaining regular employment status. Further, the LA held that respondents were deprived of their constitutional right to due process as petitioner summarily dismissed them from employment, and it failed to establish that they abandoned their work. Petitioner and CBMI separately appealed the LA Decision. In the Decision dated December 28, 2015, the NLRC affirmed the finding of the LA that respondents were regular employees of petitioner and not of CBMI. In so ruling, the NLRC adopted its Decision dated November 29, 2013 in the earlier regularization case; it held that such decision could no longer be modified as it already attained finality. Likewise, the NLRC agreed with the LA that petitioner illegally dismissed respondents from employment. CBMI and petitioner filed their respective motions for reconsideration, but the NLRC denied them in the Resolutions dated February 19, 2016 and June 30, 2016. Aggrieved, CBMI and petitioner elevated the case to the CA. In the assailed Decision dated July 9, 2018, the CA did not agree with the NLRC that the latter's Decision dated November 29, 2013 in the earlier regularization case already became final. The CA clarified that CBMI was able to file a timely petition for certiorari to annul the NLRC Decision dated November 29, 2013, which held that CBMI was a labor-only contractor. However, the CA found no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC when it held that CBMI was a labor-only contractor. The CA applied ""the doctrine of non-interference"" of judicial stability and adopted its prior Decision dated September 16, 2015 in the earlier regularization case that respondents were regular employees of petitioner. Lastly, the CA held that petitioner illegally dismissed respondents from employment as petitioner failed to prove that respondents abandoned their work, when they committed the alleged unauthorized absences. Petitioner moved for reconsideration, but the CA dismissed the motion in the Resolution dated March 4, 2019.","The Court opts to review the factual finding of the CA that CBMI is a labor-only contractor as such inference is manifestly mistaken and based on misapprehension of facts. That CBMI is a legitimate job contractor had long been settled in the case laws of Consolidated Building Maintenance, Inc. v. Asprec (Asprec), Philippine Pizza, Inc. v. Cayetano (Cayetano), and Borce v. PPI Holdings, Inc. (Borce). Adhering to the principle of stare decisis, the Court adopts the conclusions reached in the above stated case laws that CBMI Is a legitimate job contractor, and thus, the employer of respondents. As to the illegal dismissal issue, the Court disagrees with CBMI's argument that respondents' unauthorized absences from December 21 to December 27, 2014 were tantamount to abandonment of work which is a just cause to terminate their employment. In the case, CBMI failed to prove that respondents clearly, voluntarily, and intentionally abandoned their work with no intention of returning. Other than respondents' alleged absence from work for a few days, CBMI failed to prove any overt act on the part of respondents to show their deliberate and actual intent to abandon their employment. Moreover, it is well settled that when an employee takes steps to protest his dismissal, it cannot be said that he has abandoned his work because a complaint for illegal dismissal is inconsistent with the charge of abandonment. In the case, respondents' filing of a complaint for illegal dismissal on January 21, 2015, after they were prevented from returning to work on December 22, 2014, is inconsistent with CBMI's allegation that they indeed abandoned their work. Even assuming that respondents voluntarily abandoned their work, CBMI failed to comply with the two-notice rule under the law, resulting in the violation of respondents' right to procedural due process. To stress, respondents were both prevented from returning to work on December 22, 2014. That respondents' right to procedural due process was violated is demonstrated by the fact that CBMI sent via registered mail the Notice to Explain to Oraa only on January 30, 2015, while the Notice of Charge/Notice to Explain against Garcia was dated March 13, 2015. Significantly, CBMI sent these notices long after respondents were already dismissed from work and after the complaint for illegal dismissal was already lodged with the LA on January 21, 2015.","WHEREFORE, the petition is PARTLY GRANTED. The Decision dated July 9, 2018 and the Resolution dated March 4, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP Nos. 145514 and 147663 are AFFIRMED WITH MODIFICATION in that Consolidated Building Maintenance, Inc. is declared a legitimate job contractor, and thus, the employer of respondents Michael A. Oraa and Bernardito R. Garcia, Jr. Accordingly, Consolidated Building Maintenance, Inc. is ORDERED as follows: to REINSTATE respondents Michael A. Oraa and Bernardito R. Garcia, Jr. to their former and/or substantially equivalent positions without loss of seniority rights, privileges, and other benefits; to PAY respondents Michael A. Oraa and Bernardito R. Garcia, Jr., their backwages computed from the time they were illegally dismissed up to their actual reinstatement; and to PAY respondents Michael A. Oraa and Bernardito R. Garcia, Jr. an amount equivalent to 10% of the total judgment awards, as and for attorney's fees. The total monetary award shall earn interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of the finality of this Decision until full satisfaction. Further, the case is REFERRED to the Labor Arbiter for the computation and execution of the foregoing monetary awards due to respondents. SO ORDERED."
G.R. No. 211701,"FLORENTINO G. DUEÑAS, JR., PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","That on or about the 7th day of May 2004, in the City of Makati, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above named accused, conspiring and confederating together and both of them mutually helping and aiding one another, being then employed as Sales Manager and Finance Officer of complainant AUTOMALL PHILS. CORPORATION, respectively enjoying the trust and confidence reposed upon them, with intent to gain and with grave abuse of confidence, unfaithfulness and without the knowledge and consent of the owner thereof, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously take, steal and carry away the proceeds of the sale of the 1999 Color White Honda Civic 1.6 Vti MT, with Serial No. P6FDI-P402766, Engine No. PADEK1540XV102784 bearing Plate No. WTZ-603 in the amount of P310,000.00 belonging to said complainant, AUTOMALL PHILS. CORPORATION, herein represented by Jose Paolo Castrillo, to the damage and prejudice of the said complainant in the aforementioned amount. CONTRARY TO LAW. Dueñas pleaded not guilty of the crime charged. The prosecution presented Jose Paolo Briones Castrillo (Castrillo), Automall's Director for Business Development, as its only witness. Castrillo testified that Dueñas was the Sales Manager of Automall who was tasked to track the vehicle inventory and deal directly with Honda Cars Makati (Honda Makati) relative to Automall's trade-in program with said company. Castrillo alleged that when he and his father, Carlito Castrillo (Carlo), Automall's president, were out of the country, Automall purchased an old Honda vehicle from a client of Honda Makati under the said trade-in program. However, Castrillo found out that said unit was not in Automall's showroom nor was there any record of its sale to the secondary market. After Automall's payment to Honda Makati, Castrillo confronted Dueñas who admitted that he sold the old Honda vehicle for P310,000.00. Dissatisfied with his profit, Dueñas used the proceeds of the sale to purchase another unit which he intended to sell again for a higher return. Dueñas wrote a letter dated June 22, 2004 narrating the facts that transpired in the subject incident. Dueñas testified that as Automall's Sales Manager, he appraised a Honda Civic VTi 1999 model (Honda Civic) for trade-in with Automall at P295,000.00. Dueñas was able to talk with a certain Annette Gamboa (Gamboa) who informed him about a Toyota 2002 model (Toyota car) in Pampanga which Automall could buy for P250,000.00 and sell at ""fast break"" for P300,000.00, thereby generating a P50,000.00 profit. However, Gamboa failed to deliver the car to Automall. Dueñas tried to call Gamboa but she could no longer be contacted. Worried that his father would fire him from the company, Castrillo proposed to Dueñas that the latter take all the blame but they will divide the payment of the proceeds paid to Gamboa. Dueñas acceded and issued checks in the total amount of P365,000.00; P40,000.00 of which, covered by Maybank Check No. 5882622, was cleared by the bank.","In a Decision dated June 15, 2010, the RTC found Dueñas guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Carnapping defined by Section 2 of Republic Act No. (RA) 6539, otherwise known as the ""Anti-Carnapping Act of 1972,"" and punished under Section 20 of RA 7659, which amended Section 14 of RA 6539 – contrary to the charge of Qualified Theft in the Information. Accordingly, Dueñas was sentenced to suffer the penalty of imprisonment for an indeterminate period of not less than fourteen (14) years and eight (8) months, but not more than seventeen (17) years and four (4) months, and ordered to pay Automall the amount of P295,000.00, the value of the vehicle, plus interest of twelve percent (12%) per annum from the filing of the Information until fully paid. In a Decision dated September 24, 2013, the CA denied the appeal but modified the RTC's ruling by convicting Dueñas of the crime of Qualified Theft. Accordingly, the CA sentenced Dueñas to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua and ordered him to pay Automall the amount of P310,000.00, equivalent to the proceeds of the sale of the vehicle, less the P40,000.00 already paid to Automall, plus interest of six percent (6%) per annum from the filing of the Information until fully paid. The CA held that Dueñas' conviction for the crime of Carnapping under RA 6539 is a violation of his right to be informed of the nature of the accusation against him, as the act for which he was convicted is different from that alleged in the Information. Nonetheless, the CA found Dueñas guilty of the crime of Qualified Theft. The CA held that all of the following elements for said crime are present, namely: (1) there was taking of personal property; (2) the said property belongs to another; (3) the taking was accomplished without violence or intimidation against person, or force upon things; (4) the taking was done without the consent of the owner; (5) the taking was done with intent to gain; and (6) the taking was done under any of the circumstances enumerated in Article 310 of the RPC, i.e., with grave abuse of confidence.","The Court held that the prosecution was able to prove all the elements for Qualified Theft. The presence of the first and second elements in this case was undisputed. Dueñas took and received the proceeds of the sale but did not turn over the same to Automall. On the third element, Dueñas' defense that the proceeds from the sale of the Honda Civic were used to purchase a Toyota car from Gamboa with Castrillo's consent does not persuade. Dueñas could not present any evidence that Castrillo consented to the transaction with Gamboa on the purchase of the Toyota car. On the fourth element, Dueñas' intent to gain is presumed from his act of taking the proceeds of the sale of the Honda Civic and his failure to turn over the same to Automall without the latter's consent. On the fifth element, Dueñas admitted that he received the proceeds through the sale of the Honda Civic without the use of violence or intimidation against person, or force upon things. Finally, on the sixth element, Dueñas was the sales and trade-in manager of Automall who was entrusted with access to funds due to Automall. However, Dueñas gravely abused this relation when he failed to remit the proceeds of the Honda Civic's sale to Automall. Anent the proper penalty to be imposed on Dueñas, the Court applied RA 10951 which adjusted the value of the property and the amount of damage on which various penalties are based, with retroactive effect as it is favorable to the accused.","ACCORDINGLY, the instant petition is DENIED. The Decision dated September 24, 2013 and the Resolution dated March 4, 2014 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 33880 finding petitioner Florentino G. Dueñas, Jr. (Dueñas) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Qualified Theft, as defined and penalized under Article 310 in relation to Article 308 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, are hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION such that Dueñas is sentenced to suffer the penalty of imprisonment for an indeterminate period of four (4) years, two (2) months and one (1) day of prision correccional, as minimum, to nine (9) years, four (4) months and one (1) day of prision mayor, as maximum. He is further ORDERED to pay Automall Philippines Corporation the amount of P310,000.00, equivalent to the proceeds of the sale of the vehicle, less P40,000.00 already paid to Automall Philippines Corporation, or a total of P270,000.00, with legal interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the date of finality of this Decision until full payment.

G.R. No. 247564,"SERAFIN MANARIN, PETITIONER, VS. LEONCIA MANARIN, ELIZA MANARIN-ALTAREZ, FRANCISCA MANARIN-GONZALES, DOMINGO MANARIN-GONZALES, OBDULIA MANARIN-PAMPLONA, AND FELY PANGANIBAN AS ATTORNEY-IN-FACT, RESPONDENTS.","On June 5, 1997, Leoncia Manarin, Eliza Manarin-Altarez, Francisca Manarin-Gonzales, Domingo Manarin-Gonzales, and Obdulia Manarin-Pamplona (respondent heirs) executed an extrajudicial settlement of estate of Fermin Manarin (Fermin) where they adjudicated unto themselves, as legal heirs, a 504,286-square meter land located in Carmona, Cavite and covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-741686. The extrajudicial settlement failed to include Serafin Manarin (petitioner) who is also an heir of Fermin. Consequently, petitioner filed a Complaint for Annulment of Deed of Extrajudicial Settlement of Estate, Cancellation of Title, and Declaration as Heir, with Damages, against respondent heirs, before the RTC. On November 15, 2005, petitioner and respondent heirs filed a Joint Motion to Render Judgment Based on Compromise Agreement (Compromise Agreement) before the RTC. In the Compromise Agreement, the parties stipulated that: (a) they are the legitimate descendants of Fermin; (b) the property would be sold or offered for joint venture to interested buyers; (c) the proceeds of the sale would be equally shared by the heirs of Fermin; and (d) Danilo Sayarot (Danilo) who financed the reconstitution of TCT No. T-741686 would turn over the owner's copy of the title to the parties. On July 27, 2012, the RTC rendered a Decision based on the parties' Compromise Agreement. The Decision became final and executory on October 2, 2012 as evidenced by the Certificate of Finality. On December 10, 2012, respondent heirs executed an Irrevocable and Exclusive Special Power of Attorney (SPA) in favor of Fely Panganiban (Fely), giving her the power and duty to take custody and possession of duplicate copy of the TCT No. T-741686. On January 24, 2013, the SPA was annotated at the back of the title as Entry No. 2013004653. On July 4, 2013, petitioner filed an omnibus motion praying for: (a) correction of the title number of the property from TCT No. T-7416786 to TCT No. T-741686, (b) issuance of a writ of execution, and (c) cancellation of Entry No. 2013004653 on TCT No. T-741686. In its September 26, 2017 Order, the RTC amended the July 27, 2012 Decision to reflect the correct TCT number as T-741686. Danilo was also ordered to turn over the owner's copy of the title to the RTC for custody, pending the sale of the property. Thus, petitioner filed an Amended Omnibus Motion to Declare Lost Title [TCT No.] T-741686 with Motion to Issue an Order for the Issuance of New Title in Lieu of the Lost One. In its June 8, 2018 Order, the RTC granted the amended omnibus motion. It declared TCT No. T-741686 as lost, and of no force and effect because Danilo was not in possession of the owner's duplicate certificate. On June 28, 2018, respondent heirs filed an Urgent Motion to declare as null and void or to recall the order directing the issuance of new owner's duplicate copy of the title, claiming that the owner's duplicate copy of TCT No. T-741686 was not actually lost, but in the custody and possession of Fely. In its July 13, 2018 Order, the RTC directed Fely to surrender possession and custody of the owner's copy of the title to its Clerk of Court, with a notation that in case she fails to do so, said title would be declared irretrievably lost and a new owner's duplicate copy of the title would be issued. In its August 31, 2018 Order, the RTC denied respondent heirs' omnibus motion and ruled that the July 27, 2012 Decision is final and executory. It was underscored therein that Fely is not even a party to the case and that respondent heirs defied the RTC's July 13, 2018 Order requiring Fely to surrender the owner's duplicate certificate of title. Meanwhile, on January 7, 2019, petitioner filed a Manifestation informing the CA that the Register of Deeds of the Province of Cavite already issued and released a New Owner's Duplicate Copy of TCT No. [T-]741686, pursuant to the August 31, 2018 Order of the RTC.","In its March 28, 2019 Decision, the CA granted the petition and held that the July 27, 2012 RTC Decision had long become final and executory; thus, any amendment which substantially affects the same is null and void for lack of jurisdiction, including the entire proceedings held for that purpose. The CA ruled that the September 26, 2017 Order and the May 11, 2018 Writ of Execution deviated from the terms of the Compromise Agreement. Further, the CA held that the June 8, 2018 Order declaring the title under TCT No. T-741686 to have been lost, therefore of no force and effect, and ordering the Register of Deeds of the Province of Cavite to issue a new owner's copy is erroneous. Petitioner's motion for the replacement of the owner's copy of TCT No. T-741686 was in effect an action for the issuance of a new title in lieu of the lost one; thus, there has to be a separate petition filed for issuance of the new owner's duplicate copy of the title, which must comply with the requirements under Section 109 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1529 or the Property Registration Decree. The CA likewise held that the new owner's duplicate copy of TCT No. T-741686 issued by the Register of Deeds of the Province of Cavite, pursuant to the August 31, 2018 Order, is void and must be cancelled. Petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration against the March 28, 2019 Decision of the CA. However, the CA denied the said motion in its May 24, 2019 Resolution.","The Supreme Court found that the RTC did not commit grave abuse of discretion when it issued the assailed four Orders. The Court held that the subsequent Orders issued by the RTC neither varied nor departed from the terms of the July 27, 2012 Decision in any manner. The correction of the TCT number was merely clerical and typographical, which did not affect the rights of the parties. The September 26, 2017 Order directing Danilo to deliver the owner's copy of TCT No. T-741686 to the Clerk of Court does not substantially deviate from the July 27, 2012 Decision. The Court found that the RTC correctly applied the provisions of Sec. 107 of P.D. No. 1529 in the issuance of a new owner's duplicate certificate of title because Fely refused to surrender the same. The owner's duplicate certificate of title is not lost, but is in fact in the possession and custody of Fely by virtue of the SPA executed by respondent heirs themselves. The Court held that a petition to surrender the owner's duplicate certificate of title being unlawfully withheld by another person may be instituted by the aggrieved party as an incident in a pending proceeding. Petitioner may file a motion before the trial court to surrender the owner's duplicate certificate of title as an incident to the main action affecting the rights of the parties to the property.","WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated March 28, 2019 and the Resolution dated May 24, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 157528 are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The Orders dated September 26, 2017, June 8, 2018, July 13, 2018, and August 31, 2018 of the Regional Trial Court of Bacoor City, Branch 89 in Civil Case No. BCV 2000-157 are REINSTATED. SO ORDERED."
G.R. No. 250539,"DHY REALTY & DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS-SPECIAL SIXTH [6TH] DIVISION, CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY ARBITRATION COMMISSION, SHERIFF OF THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY AUTHORITY OF THE PHILIPPINES, AND WING-AN CONSTRUCTION DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION, RESPONDENTS.","DHY Realty & Development Corporation (DHY Realty) and Wing-An Construction Development Corporation (Wing-An) entered into a Construction Contract Agreement on June 24, 2014. Under the Construction Contract, Wing-An obligated itself to construct a warehouse building with a canteen for DHY Realty at M. Eusebio Avenue, Barangay San Miguel, Pasig City. The Construction Contract contained an arbitration clause. Wing-An commenced construction on January 10, 2014 with the intention of completing all the works in August 2014. In the course of construction, Wing-An submitted a proposal for the construction of a high fence, which DHY Realty accepted and approved. However, Wing-An claimed that when it demanded payment of the contract price agreed upon, DHY Realty refused to pay and instead demanded that the height of the fence should be increased by 1.5 meters. Wing-An agreed to increase the height but only received PHP 600,000.00 from DHY Realty despite the latter's promise to fully pay upon completion. Wing-An sent demand letters for payment of unsettled billings for additional works, change orders, and variation orders. After an exchange of letters between the parties, no agreement was reached as to the payment of Wing-An's claims. On September 29, 2016, Wing-An filed its Complaint and Request for Arbitration with the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission (CIAC). The Complaint stated that DHY Realty and its President Yap may be served at their address at Bel-air Soho Condominium Corp, #45 Polaris Corner Badajos St., Poblacion, Makati City (Makati Address). On September 30, 2016, the CIAC Executive Director wrote a letter to Yap informing him that Wing-An filed a Complaint and Request for Arbitration. The letter was sent via courier to the Makati Address. On January 20, 2017, the CIAC issued an Order directing Wing-An to determine DHY Realty's correct principal address after some notices were returned. In compliance, Wing-An submitted DHY Realty's Amended Articles of Incorporation and latest General Information Sheet dated September 22, 2016, which stated that DHY Realty's principal official address is the Makati Address. The preliminary conference and evidentiary hearing pushed through with only Wing-An appearing. DHY Realty and Yap did not appear. The CIAC Tribunal promulgated the Final Award on May 9, 2017. Wing-An filed a Petition for Review with the CA. On August 15, 2019, the CIAC issued the Writ of Execution ordering the Ex-Officio Sheriff to execute the Final Award. On October 30, 2019, DHY Realty filed its Formal Entry of Appearance with Omnibus Motion to Quash Writ of Execution and Lift Notice of Garnishment. DHY Realty claimed it was unaware of the proceedings and that the Makati Address used by CIAC was wrong. DHY Realty asserted its principal address is at Christine Royale Executive Subdivision, M. Eusebio Street, San Miguel, Pasig City (Pasig Address).","The CIAC Tribunal promulgated the Final Award on May 9, 2017 ordering DHY Realty to pay Wing-An PHP 9,160,000.00 representing the value of extra or additional works/change and variation orders plus interest at 6% per annum, PHP 300,000.00 as attorney's fees, and PHP 487,043.07 for cost of arbitration. The CA rendered the Decision on January 29, 2019 which denied Wing-An's Petition for Review and affirmed the Final Award. The CA held that there was valid service to DHY Realty and Yap of the Request for Arbitration and other notices. The CA relied on Section 4.2 of the CIAC Rules which states that failure despite due notice which amounts to a refusal of the Respondent to arbitrate shall not stay the proceedings notwithstanding the absence or lack of participation of the Respondent. The CIAC issued an Order dated December 4, 2019 denying DHY Realty's Formal Entry and Omnibus Motion, stating that the CA Decision which affirmed the Final Award was already final and executory.","The Supreme Court held that DHY Realty failed to comply with the stringent requirements for a special civil action for certiorari under Rule 65. First, it did not file a motion for reconsideration in the CA. Second, at the time of filing the Petition, the remedy of appeal through a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 was still available. The Court emphasized that the CIAC acted judiciously in ensuring that DHY Realty was properly notified of the proceedings. The CIAC was extra careful and scrupulous in evaluating Wing-An's claim given that DHY Realty was not represented in the proceedings. The Court found that the CIAC's conduct in the arbitration proceedings cannot be described as wanton, arbitrary, capricious, and colored with bad faith. The CA also exercised diligence to ensure that DHY Realty was properly served with notices and pleadings. On the substantive issue, the Court held that Wing-An, the CIAC, and the CA correctly relied on the information provided in the General Information Sheet (GIS) in ascertaining DHY Realty's address. A GIS is a document that the SEC requires corporations to submit containing vital information including its principal office address. The Court found that the Letter-Notice was duly delivered to DHY Realty at the Makati Address which was DHY Realty's principal office address provided in its latest GIS at the time of actual delivery. As DHY Realty was duly notified of the Complaint and of its right to file an answer, the CIAC had the authority to proceed with the arbitration even in DHY Realty's absence.","WHEREFORE, the Petition is DISMISSED. The assailed Decision dated January 29, 2019 and Resolution dated June 21, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

G.R. No. 205986,"GMA NETWORK, INC. AND CITYNET NETWORK MARKETING AND PRODUCTIONS, INC., PETITIONERS, VS. ABC DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION (ABC), MEDIA PRIMA BERHAD, AND MPB PRIMEDIA, INC., RESPONDENTS.","In 2004, Citynet entered into a Co-Production/Blocktime Agreement with Zoe Broadcasting Network, Inc. (Zoe Broadcasting), where Citynet would be providing shows to be broadcast on ZOE Channel 11. They eventually reformatted the channel and launched QTV-11. Later, Citynet assigned all its rights under the agreement to GMA, which then undertook the programming, launching and airing of shows and news broadcasts of QTV-11. When QTV-11 was launched in November 2005, it allegedly obtained encouraging patronage and satisfactory share in public viewership. In its first two months, it ranked third in Mega Manila, followed by Studio 23 in fourth place and ABC Development Corporation (ABC-5) in fifth. The controversy arose in 2008 when Merrill Lynch of Singapore, as well as newspapers Philippine Daily Inquirer and The Manila Times, reported that ABC-5 sold through a Blocktime Agreement all its airtime to MPB Primedia, Inc. (Primedia), except news and Christian programming. The acquisition was reportedly part of the investment strategy of Media Prima Berhad, a Malaysian corporation, to establish a company in the Philippines of which it would be 70% owner. On December 3, 2008, GMA, Citynet, and Zoe Broadcasting filed before the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City a Complaint against defendants ABC-5, Primedia, and Media Prima Berhad, seeking to nullify the Blocktime Agreement with damages for unfair competition. The plaintiffs alleged that even if Primedia's Articles of Incorporation stated that it was Filipino-owned, it was nonetheless Media Prima Berhad's subsidiary, purposely established to purchase and manage a chunk of ABC-5's airtime content and sales. The plaintiffs claimed that the Blocktime Agreement should be declared void under Article 1409 of the Civil Code, not only for violating the limitation in ownership and management of mass media under Article XVI, Section 11(1) of the Constitution, but also the Anti-Dummy Law. At the time of the Complaint's filing, the program grid of ABC-5's TV-5 allegedly showed that 93.75% of its airtime was controlled by Primedia. ABC-5 later filed an Omnibus Motion to Dismiss and to Strike against the Amended Complaint on the grounds that: plaintiffs failed to exhaust the administrative remedies available to them before the National Telecommunications Commission; each plaintiff failed to affirm in the certification of non-forum shopping that it has not commenced any action or filed any claim involving the same issues in any court, tribunal or quasi-judicial agency; the Amended Complaint is a collateral attack upon the corporate franchise of MPB Primedia; and plaintiffs judicially admitted that they are not in possession of the Blocktime Agreement.","On December 15, 2009, the Regional Trial Court issued a Joint Order dismissing the Amended Complaint. The trial court held that the National Telecommunications Commission had the authority to probe into the technical aspect of the implementation of the Blocktime Agreement owing to its administrative and regulatory functions. The trial court also found that GMA, Citynet, and Zoe Broadcasting violated the rule on certification against forum shopping when they failed to state that they had not commenced any action or filed any claim involving the same issues in any court, tribunal or quasi-judicial agency. The trial court also held that the issue on foreign ownership of mass media and the Anti-Dummy Law related to the exercise of ABC-5's legislative franchise, which should be resolved in quo warranto proceedings. GMA and Citynet filed a Petition for Certiorari before the Court of Appeals. In an October 16, 2012 Decision, the Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal of the Amended Complaint. It agreed with the trial court that the plaintiffs violated the doctrine on exhaustion of administrative remedies for failing to seek initial recourse with the National Telecommunications Commission, which had primary jurisdiction over the matter. The Court of Appeals also affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the Amended Complaint for failing to comply with the requirements of a certification against forum shopping. In a February 21, 2013 Resolution, the Court of Appeals denied GMA and Citynet's Motion for Reconsideration.","The Supreme Court denied the Petition. The Court held that adhering to the doctrine of primary jurisdiction, courts usually defer jurisdiction to administrative agencies on cases concerning matters that demand their special competence. The Court found that petitioners raised causes of action in their Amended Complaint that involved allegations requiring examination of the Blocktime Agreement and factual determination of whether unfair competition existed. The Court emphasized that the National Telecommunications Commission has primary jurisdiction over matters involving unfair competition in the broadcast industry and technical aspects of telecommunications regulation. The Court also found that petitioners violated the rule on certification against forum shopping by failing to disclose their prior letter-complaint before the Commission. The Court further held that the proper remedy for questioning the exercise of a legislative franchise is through quo warranto proceedings instituted by the Solicitor General, not through a private civil action.","WHEREFORE, the Petition is DENIED. The Decision dated October 16, 2012 and Resolution dated February 21, 2013 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 112529, which affirmed the Joint Order dated December 15, 2009 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 227, dismissing the Amended Complaint in Civil Case No. Q-08-64125, are AFFIRMED.

G.R. No. 204479,"RUDY CHUA AND CAI CHANGCHENG, PETITIONERS, VS. THE HON. SECRETARY OF JUSTICE AND PRESIDENTIAL ANTI-SMUGGLING GROUP-TASK FORCE SUBIC (PASG-TFS), RESPONDENTS.","At around 8:35 p.m. on May 25, 2008, Security Guard III Wilfredo Agnazata (SG3 Agnazata) of the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority Department flagged down a Mitsubishi Outlander with Plate No. RAE 615 driven by Anthony ""Anton"" Ang (Ang), part-owner of Hualong International, Inc. (Hualong). He inspected the passengers as well as the several boxes in the car. The driver failed to show documents authorizing them to bring out the cargoes, which were earlier seen being unloaded from a docked Chinese-registered cargo ship F/B Shun Fa Xing. SG3 Agnazata went to the guard post to ask for back-up, but the front seat passenger was no longer there upon his return. SG3 Agnazata brought Ang to the office of Internal Affairs General Assignment Service for investigation. When questioned, Ang refused to open the boxes and claimed that they merely contained sensitive computer parts. Ang was later allowed to leave the office after committing to produce the cargoes' necessary documents, but he failed to return. When the boxes were opened, they contained 40 transport plastic packs containing white crystalline substance, which later tested positive for shabu, a dangerous drug. These had a total weight of 81.95 kilograms. On May 28, 2008, two green leatherette bags containing 10 vacuum-sealed packs of the same substances were recovered by divers of the Subic Dry Dock. Laboratory examinations yielded positive results for shabu with a total weight of 20.49 kilograms. On the same day, the operatives of the Presidential Anti-Smuggling Group-Task Force Subic (Task Force) received information that a Dark Blue Toyota Hi-Ace with plate number UKU-699 parked inside a warehouse owned by Anglo Asia Commodity Corporation (Anglo Asia) contained similar boxes as those earlier seized. The operatives proceeded to the warehouse and confiscated 60 boxes containing five packs of shabu weighing 612.22 kilograms. Enrique L. Ong, manager of Anglo Asia, admitted that he was instructed by Ang and Ang's wife Estrella Ang (Estrella), Operations Manager of Hualong, to allow Rolando T. Labandelo, the driver of the Dark Blue Toyota Hi-Ace, to park the said vehicle inside the warehouse. It was also revealed during the investigation that Estrella notified the Seaport Department of Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority of the arrival of the cargo vessel F/B Shun Fa Xing, which contained the dangerous drugs later seized. On June 13, 2008, the Task Force operatives filed before the Office of the City Prosecutor of Olongapo City an Amended Joint Complaint of Arrest against Chua et al.—incorporators of Hualong—and several others as co-principals for the illegal importation of dangerous drugs defined and penalized under Sections 4 and 5 in relation to Sections 26 and 30 of Republic Act No. 9165. In their counter-affidavit, Rudy Chua (Chua) and Cai Changcheng (Changcheng) denied having knowledge or participation in the illegal importation of shabu as well as the lease agreement between Hualong and Anglo Asia regarding the use of the warehouse. They claimed that they had already assigned all their shares in Hualong to Robert Lee (Lee) for P388,000.00 pursuant to a Deed of Assignment dated August 30, 2007. The City Prosecutor of Olongapo dismissed the complaint against Chua, Changcheng, and the others for lack of probable cause. The Regional State Prosecutor sustained the dismissal, and the case was elevated to the Secretary of Justice for review. The Secretary of Justice reversed and set aside the City Prosecutor's Resolution. The Secretary of Justice found that Chua et al. and the others, as incorporators and directors of Hualong, must be the ones to assume criminal liability. Hence, the Secretary of Justice directed the City Prosecutor to file the information against Chua et al. and the others for violation of Sections 4 and 5 in relation to Section 26 of Republic Act No. 9165. A subsequent motion for reconsideration was denied. Chua et al. assailed the Decision and Resolution of the Secretary of Justice before the Court of Appeals through a petition for certiorari.","In its July 17, 2012 Decision, the Court of Appeals dismissed the petition, holding that the Secretary did not commit grave abuse of discretion when it reversed the City Prosecutor of Olongapo City's Resolution and ordered the filing of informations. The Court of Appeals found that the Secretary of Justice did not commit grave abuse of discretion because the findings were reasonably based on the evidence on record. For one, as officers of Hualong, the Secretary of Justice held that Chua et al. were among the persons to assume criminal responsibility. He also belied Cai Wengcong's (Wengcong) allegation that he had already departed for China in 2007 because he had subscribed and sworn to the veracity of his counter-affidavit before the prosecutor. Several documents on record also dispute Chua et al.'s claim that they had already assigned their interest in Hualong to another person. Ultimately, the Court of Appeals said that trial is where these claims can be substantiated through the introduction of evidence for all parties. Chua et al. moved for reconsideration, which the Court of Appeals denied for lack of merit in its November 14, 2012 Resolution.","The Supreme Court denied the Petition. The Court held that the determination of probable cause for filing an information is lodged with the public prosecutor. Absent any finding of grave abuse of discretion, it is not reviewable by the courts. The Court ruled that as a general rule, a petition for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court can only raise questions of law, and raising questions of fact is a ground for the petition's denial. The Court found that petitioners have failed to establish that an exception applies to their case. On the merits, the Court held that probable cause for filing a criminal information has been defined as such facts sufficient to engender a well-founded belief that a crime has been committed and that a person is probably guilty of the crime. The full discretionary authority to determine probable cause in a preliminary investigation to ascertain sufficient ground for the filing of information rests with the executive branch. Courts cannot substitute the executive branch's judgment. The Court of Appeals correctly found that respondent Secretary of Justice did not commit any grave abuse of discretion in finding probable cause against petitioners. Respondent Secretary of Justice's Resolution finding probable cause was reasonably based on available evidence. Records from the proceedings before respondent Secretary of Justice show that Wengcong was in the Philippines when he subscribed and swore to the allegations in his counter-affidavit before the public prosecutor, contrary to his claims that he had already left for China long before the incidents of the case transpired. There was also Lee's denial that petitioners had transferred or assigned their Hualong shares to him and that he did not renew the lease of the warehouse units with petitioner Chua. These opposing claims controverted petitioners' defenses and were the basis for respondent Secretary of Justice's determination that probable cause exists to charge petitioners for trial.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DENIED. The assailed July 17, 2012 Decision and November 14, 2012 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP. No. 113802 are AFFIRMED. SO ORDERED."

WONG, OFFICE OF THE DEPUTY OMBUDSMAN FOR MINDANAO AND ROBERTO Y. UY,** PROVINCIAL GOVERNOR, PROVINCE OF ZAMBOANGA DEL NORTE, RESPONDENTS.","The case stemmed from the Joint Complaint-Affidavit dated May 10, 2012 signed by Antonio B. Jumawak, Marina M. Tinonga, Nestor I. Epo, Cornelio R. Tabad, Samuel L. Emia, Arfel D. Daan, Omar G. Bayron, and Luzvina M. Sumiton filed against Dr. Peter Stephen S. Samonte (petitioner), Municipal Health Officer; Cipriano B. Plazos, Municipal Treasurer; and Urdaneta C. Madridondo, Senior Bookkeeper and former Officer-in-Charge Municipal Accountant of the Municipality of Katipunan, Zamboanga del Norte for Grave Misconduct, Gross Neglect of Duty, and Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service. The OMB-M-A-15-0148 is a redocket of OMB-M-A-12-0225, which is the administrative aspect of the complaint against petitioner and Plazos, et al. on the complaint against their alleged unliquidated cash advances. In a Joint-Resolution dated February 14, 2013, the Ombudsman dismissed OMB-M-A-12-0225 without prejudice because of insufficiency of evidence and the absence of audit findings from the Commission on Audit (COA). Concurrently, the Ombudsman ordered the COA to conduct a special audit investigation. The COA submitted its Final Evaluation Report dated February 16, 2015 showing that petitioner obtained a total of P173,615.00 cash advances from January 1999 up to 2011, and as of February 2015 his unliquidated balance remained at P27,500.00. The COA found that petitioner and Plazos, et al. violated the laws, rules, and regulations on cash advances. In petitioner's counter-affidavit before the Ombudsman, he denied the charges against him and averred that he had fully liquidated his cash advances as evidenced by the Certification dated June 16, 2015 issued by Mary Ann A. Elumbaring, Municipal Accountant.","In its Decision dated October 27, 2015, the Ombudsman – Mindanao found petitioner and Plazas, et al. administratively liable as charged for violating and neglecting to observe the laws, rules, and regulations, governing the grant and liquidation of cash advances. In his Motion for Reconsideration, petitioner raised, among others, that: (1) the Ombudsman failed to appreciate and recognize that he substantially complied with the liquidation requirements; (2) his liquidation reports were supported by the required documents as opposed to the findings of the Ombudsman; (3) the Ombudsman failed to consider the Final Evaluation Report by Audit Team Leader Jonathan Q. Manuel stating that petitioner no longer had any outstanding cash advance; and (4) the penalty of dismissal with its accessory penalties was too harsh considering the extenuating circumstances obtaining in the case. In the Order dated May 4, 2016, the Ombudsman denied the motion. Petitioner and Plazos, et al. filed a Petition for Review with the CA. In its assailed Decision, the CA denied petitioner's petition for review and affirmed in toto the findings of the Ombudsman. The CA ruled that: (1) the findings of the Ombudsman are supported by substantial evidence; (2) the dismissal was not unduly harsh following Section 55 of the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (URACCS); and (3) the dismissal of OMB-M-A-12-0237 did not attain finality; hence, the dismissal did not bar the redocketing of the case. Petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration, but the CA denied it in the assailed Resolution.","The Supreme Court granted the petition. The Court found that petitioner is not totally innocent of any misconduct. There is substantial evidence to prove petitioner's guilt, not of Grave Misconduct, Gross Neglect of Duty, or Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service, but only of Simple Misconduct. The Court took into account the nature of petitioner's work as the Municipal Health Officer of Katipunan, Zamboanga del Norte and, at the same time, as the Rural Health Physician of the Municipality of Roxas, Zamboanga del Norte. While petitioner's voluminous work and the fact that he had no clerk to help him with his liquidations cannot serve as valid excuse from complying with the liquidation requirements, the circumstances show the lack of the element of corruption. The Court found that petitioner is not liable for either Gross or Simple Neglect of Duty. The Ombudsman failed to consider that petitioner had in fact fully liquidated all his cash advances on July 26, 2012. The Court also found that petitioner's act did not amount to Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service. The Ombudsman failed to show by substantial evidence that petitioner benefited from his acts. Absent any evidence establishing corruption and bad faith, petitioner therefore cannot be held liable for grave misconduct, or any other grave offense classified under the Civil Service Law.","WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated September 27, 2018 and the Resolution dated July 26, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

LILIA VIZCARRA-NOCILLADO, ANTONIO A. VIZCARRA, NORMA VIZCARRA-SANCHEZ, RIZALINA VIZCARRA-HINKLEY, AND JULIETA V. HUNTER-SUTTON, RESPONDENTS.","Ireneo Vizcarra (Ireneo) is the registered owner in fee simple of parcels of land located in Parañaque City, containing an area of 96 square meters and 61 square meters, covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 63087. On September 5, 1993, Ireneo died and was survived by Constancio and Purificacion. On August 18, 2004, Constancio died and was survived by his heirs, namely, his wife, Concepcion, and their children: (1) Feliciano married to Maria; (2) Victor A. Vizcarra; (3) Evarista A. Vizcarra; and (4) Dionisio A. Vizcarra (collectively, Heirs of Constancio). Meanwhile, Purificacion died on November 19, 2006 without any legitimate issues. On December 31, 2006, the Heirs of Constancio executed an ""Extra Judicial Settlement of the Estate of Ireneo Vizcarra, Constancio F. Vizcarra and Purificacion Vizcarra"" (Extrajudicial Settlement). By virtue of the Extrajudicial Settlement, the Heirs of Constancio were able to cause the cancellation of TCT No. 63087 registered in the name of Ireneo and subsequent partition of the said property. Thus, on January 20, 2007, new certificates of title were issued in the name of the Heirs of Constancio. On October 4, 2007, respondents filed a complaint before the RTC of Parañaque City praying for the declaration of nullity of the Extrajudicial Settlement and the subsequent cancellation of the certificates of title issued in the name of the Heirs of Constancio. In their Complaint, respondents alleged that they are the heirs of Silvestre F. Vizcarra (Silvestre). According to respondents, Silvestre was born on December 31, 1920. He was the son of Ireneo with a woman named Rosalia Ferrer, and as such, he was entitled a share in the estate of Ireneo. However, Silvestre predeceased Ireneo, thus, respondents filed the complaint in representation of their father, Silvestre, to claim and assert their right as heirs of Ireneo. To prove Silvestre's filiation with Ireneo, respondents presented the following documents: (1) a Certificate dated September 11, 2007 issued by the National Statistics Office (NSO), wherein it was indicated that Silvestre's father was a certain ""Irineo Vizcarra;"" (2) a Certification dated August 3, 1978 (1978 Certification) issued by the Office of the Local Civil Registrar of Parañaque, wherein it stated that according to its Register of Births, Silvestre was born to ""Irineo Vizcarra"" and ""Rosalia Ferrer""; and (3) the Marriage Contract between Silvestre and Trinidad Agner, wherein it was indicated that Ireneo was the father of Silvestre.","After trial, the RTC ruled in favor of respondents, declared null and void the Extrajudicial Settlement executed by petitioners, and ordered the cancellation of the subsequently issued TCT. The RTC after considering the pieces of evidence presented by both parties ruled that respondents were able to prove by preponderance of evidence that Ireneo was the father of Silvestre. In arriving at the foregoing conclusion, the RTC highlighted the NSO Certificate, which indicated that the father of Silvestre was Ireneo. The RTC then pointed out that petitioners failed to present any countervailing evidence to rebut the said certificate. In its Decision dated October 4, 2012, the Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the RTC similarly relying on the NSO Certificate as sufficient proof of filiation of Silvestre to Ireneo. The CA held that the NSO Certificate was a valid reconstruction of Silvestre's birth records even though it was made on the basis of the 1978 Certification and not from the 1920 Record Book. In arriving at its conclusion, the CA relied on the testimony of Vivian Cruz, the representative of the Local Civil Registrar, who testified that before reconstruction, they must first examine the authenticity and validity of the document on which the reconstruction is based. Petitioners filed their Motion for Reconsideration, which was eventually denied by the CA in its Resolution dated January 14, 2013.","The Supreme Court granted the petition and reversed the findings of the lower courts. The Court ruled that respondents, as the heirs of Silvestre, sought to establish his filiation to Ireneo. However, none of the circumstances enumerated under Article 173 of the Family Code is present in this case to allow respondents to establish Silvestre's filiation. Simply, the right to claim the filiation of Silvestre to Ireneo was not transferred to respondents, depriving them a standing to file the action in the first place. The Court was not convinced that the NSO Certificate was sufficient to establish Silvestre's filiation to Ireneo. The name of the father indicated therein is a certain ""Irineo Vizcarra"" which is different from the putative father, ""Ireneo Vizcarra."" Absent any other proof that the ""Irineo Vizcarra"" indicated in Silvestre's NSO Certificate is the same ""Ireneo Vizcarra"" from whom respondents are claiming to be the heirs of, the Court cannot make the conclusion that they are indeed one and the same person. Even assuming that the ""Irineo Vizcarra"" indicated in the NSO Certificate refers to the putative father, Ireneo, the same is not conclusive as to Silvestre's filiation absent Ireneo's intervention in its preparation. A careful examination of the NSO Certificate does not reveal if the putative father, Ireneo had a hand in its preparation. It did not bear his signature nor was there anything in the remarks portion, which would indicate that Ireneo had supplied any information or intervened in its preparation. Accordingly, the NSO Certificate has no probative value to prove the filiation of Silvestre to Ireneo.","WHEREFORE, the Petition for Review on Certiorari dated March 4, 2013 is GRANTED.

G.R. No. 249323,"PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. ISAGANI LAURENCE DE GUZMAN NICOLAS AND LEONARDO ROSARIO NICOLAS, JR., ACCUSED-APPELLANTS","Isagani Laurence de Guzman Nicolas (Isagani) and Leonardo Rosario Nicolas, Jr. (Leonardo) were charged with direct bribery for allegedly extorting PHP 3,000,000.00 from Representative Amado T. Espino, Jr. through Arturo V. Soriano in consideration of facilitating the dismissal of three cases allegedly pending investigation before the Field Investigation Office of the Office of the Ombudsman. Leonardo, an Associate Graft Investigation Officer III of the Office of the Ombudsman, contacted Geraldine Ubana-Baniqued, provincial legal officer of Pangasinan, in May 2017 offering to help dismiss a complaint against Mayor Jumel Anthony I. Espino in exchange for money. When Mayor Espino refused, Leonardo mentioned cases against Representative Espino and demanded PHP 1 million per complaint, or PHP 3 million total. Representative Espino instructed Soriano to coordinate with the National Bureau of Investigation, which organized an entrapment operation on July 21, 2017. During the operation, Leonardo received an envelope supposedly containing PHP 3 million (actually containing 50 marked one-thousand peso bills and boodle money) and was arrested along with Isagani. Isagani claimed he was merely present as Leonardo's companion and had no participation in the crime.","The Sandiganbayan found Leonardo and Isagani guilty of direct bribery and sentenced them to imprisonment of two years and four months of prision correccional in its minimum period, as minimum, to four years and two months of prision correccional in its medium period, as maximum, and to pay a fine of PHP 6 million each with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and special temporary disqualification from holding public office. The Sandiganbayan found all elements of direct bribery proven and concluded that Isagani conspired with Leonardo, acting as a bridge between the Espinos and Leonardo by introducing them and being present at both the July 14 and July 21, 2017 meetings. The Sandiganbayan denied the motions for reconsideration separately filed by Leonardo and Isagani.","The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction of Leonardo, finding that all elements of direct bribery were proven beyond reasonable doubt. Leonardo, as a public officer, personally received PHP 3 million bribe money in consideration of facilitating the dismissal of complaints, which constitutes an unjust act. The act related to the exercise of his functions as Associate Graft Investigation Officer III. However, the Court acquitted Isagani, finding that the prosecution failed to prove conspiracy beyond reasonable doubt. The Court found that Isagani introduced Leonardo to Soriano upon Representative Espino's request, and there was no evidence showing Isagani's direct participation in demanding or receiving the bribe money. Leonardo himself testified that Isagani had nothing to do with the transaction and was only there to accompany him. The Court held that mere presence at the meetings, without proof of participation in the criminal act, was insufficient to establish conspiracy.","WHEREFORE, the appeal is PARTIALLY GRANTED. The Decision dated March 6, 2019 and Resolution dated July 30, 2019 of the Sandiganbayan in Criminal Case No. SB-18-CRM-0013 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. Accused-appellant Leonardo Rosario Nicolas, Jr. is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Direct Bribery under Article 210 of the Revised Penal Code and sentenced accordingly. Accused-appellant Isagani Laurence de Guzman Nicolas is ACQUITTED of the crime charged for failure of the prosecution to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. SO ORDERED."
A.C. No. 13376 (Formerly CBD No. 19-6116),"CRISENTE L. CAPARAS, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. ALWIN P. RACELIS, RESPONDENT.","In his complaint-affidavit, complainant alleged the following matters: On December 5, 2017, complainant approached respondent regarding his intent to file an ejectment case against ""the Pacias"" involving complainant's land located in Calamigan, Tiaong, Quezon Province (subject property). Respondent accepted the engagement and in turn, complainant paid him a total sum of P35,000.00. More particularly, complainant paid respondent P20,000.00 in cash and the balance of P15,000.00 via money remittance as he returned to Canada already. On December 20, 2017, while in Canada, complainant sent an electronic mail (e-mail) to respondent informing him that the payment of P15,000.00 was sent via money remittance. On December 21, 2017, respondent acknowledged receipt of complainant's message further stating that: As soon as the [Barangay] Certification is made available, [I] will immediately send [a] formal demand letter and file our complaint po. Will keep you posted. On even date, complainant furnished his sister-in-law and appointed representative, Guia Lindo (Guia), of the reply of respondent. On February 27, 2018, complainant sent an e-mail to respondent asking for an update on the ejectment case and informing him that he authorized Guia to look after his concern over the subject property. Respondent, however, did not reply to complainant's e-mail. In separate occasions on March 15, 2018 and June 27, 2018, complainant tried calling respondent via Facebook Messenger application (Messenger) but to no avail. Meanwhile, on December 24, 2018, complainant sent another e-mail asking respondent why one year had passed yet he had not given any update on the ejectment case. Respondent did not reply to complainant's e-mail. In March 2019, complainant sent respondent another message through Messenger asking anew for an update on the ejectment case, but the latter did not answer the query. Having received no response from respondent, complainant informed the Commission on Bar Discipline of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) of respondent's inaction in his ejectment case. In response, on January 11, 2019, the IBP required complainant to file a verified complaint before it. Complainant contended that respondent's act of sleeping on the rights of his client (herein complainant) clearly showed the defiance of respondent to the Lawyer's Oath and the CPR. By reason of which, complainant insisted that respondent must be disbarred from the practice of law and be ordered to return the amount of P35,000.00 that complainant paid him plus legal interest. On the other hand, respondent in his Answer denied that he violated the Lawyer's Oath and the CPR. Respondent met complainant in person only once. Because complainant returned to Canada already, it was one Cecilia L. Pangan (Cecilia) who visited and coordinated with respondent. When Cecilia visited respondent in January 2018, she asked for P2,000.00 instead of giving him documents relative to the ejectment case. Sometime in February or March 2018, Guia visited respondent's office, introduced herself as the sister-in-law of complainant, and informed respondent that Cecilia would no longer represent complainant in the ejectment case. Respondent coordinated with Guia and eventually, Guia brought to respondent the barangay certification to file action and photographs of the subject property. After sometime, Guia no longer visited respondent, and the latter did not receive any document relative to the ejectment case. Despite this, in May 2018, respondent proceeded and sent a demand letter to the Pacias directing them to vacate the subject property.","In his Report and Recommendation dated July 29, 2020, Investigating Commissioner Sherwin D. Vizconde (Investigating Commissioner) recommended that respondent be ordered to refund the amount of P35,000.00 to complainant plus interest, and that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for one (1) month. He further recommended that respondent be admonished and sternly warned that the commission of the same or similar acts shall be dealt with more severely. The Investigating Commissioner stated that through inordinate delay, respondent knowingly slept on the rights of complainant and had shown a repugnant conduct unbecoming of a lawyer. He also averred that respondent's negligence was beyond dispute; that respondent failed to inform the complainant of the status of the ejectment case for more than one year; and that despite follow-ups, through e-mail and Messenger, respondent failed to inform complainant of the status and development of the ejectment case. In the Resolution No. CBD-XXV-2021-11-21 dated November 19, 2021, the IBP Board of Governors resolved to modify the Report and Recommendation of the Investigating Commissioner. It recommended to instead impose upon respondent the penalty of suspension from the practice of law for a period of three (3) months and for respondent to return to complainant the sum of P35,000.00 with legal interest from the finality of the Court's ruling adopting the recommendation, but without the imposition of admonition with warning, after taking into consideration the facts of the case.","The Court found that respondent failed to observe the diligence and competence expected of him as complainant's lawyer in the ejectment case. His act of receiving money as professional fees in handling such case and eventually failing to render legal service is a clear violation of his fiduciary relationship with his client. Respondent communicated to complainant via e-mail his receipt of the balance of his professional fees. Respondent's argument that he relayed to complainant's representative that he preferred communication by text message or phone call is of no moment. Respondent himself initially made use of e-mail as a means of connecting with complainant. The Court also observed that respondent did not explain why he failed to answer the Messenger calls of complainant. Despite the repeated follow-ups of complainant via e-mail and calls through Messenger, respondent neither informed complainant of the need of these documents nor relayed to the latter that his representative had not yet submitted to respondent the needed documents. Respondent miserably failed to update complainant of any development in the intended ejectment case. For having been found guilty of negligence in handling the cause of his client, and violating Rules 18.03 and 18.04 of the CPR, the Court finds it proper to suspend respondent from the practice of law for six (6) months with a warning that the commission of the same or similar act shall be dealt with more severely. Respondent is also ordered to return to complainant the amount of P35,000.00 that the latter paid him with interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the finality of this Decision until paid in full.","WHEREFORE, respondent Atty. Alwin P. Racelis is GUILTY of violating the Lawyer's Oath, Canon 17 as well as Rules 18.03 and 18.04 of Canon 18 of the Code of Professional Responsibility. He is SUSPENDED from the practice of law for six (6) months with STERN WARNING that a repetition of the same or similar act shall be dealt with more severely. Respondent Atty. Alwin P. Racelis is also ordered to return to complainant Crisente L. Caparas the amount of P35,000.00 with interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the finality of this Decision until paid in full. The suspension of respondent Atty. Alwin P. Racelis from the practice of law shall take effect immediately upon his receipt of this Decision. He is DIRECTED to immediately file a Manifestation to the Court that his suspension has started, copy furnished to all courts and quasi-judicial bodies where he has entered his appearance as counsel. SO ORDERED."
G.R. No. 228150,"KARLOS NOEL R. ALETA, PETITIONER, VS. SOFITEL PHILIPPINE PLAZA MANILA, RESPONDENT.","On February 13, 2009, Attorney Bonifacio A. Alentajan (Atty. Bonifacio) and Doctor Marilyn C. Alentajan (Dr. Marilyn), Karlos's parents-in-law, went to Sofitel to check in. Karlos's parents-in-law were accompanied by his children namely, Carlos Marco Aleta (Carlos) and Mario Montego Aleta (Mario), who were then five and three years old respectively. Later that day, Dr. Marilyn brought Carlos and Mario to the hotel's kiddie pool. As Mario was stepping into the pool near the lifeguard station, he suddenly slipped which resulted to his head hitting the rugged edge of the pool. He sustained injuries which caused his head to bleed. Meanwhile, Carlos mounted the kiddie pool slide and thereafter bumped his head. He sustained a contusion, which likewise caused his head to bleed. To prevent the injuries' progression, Karlos and Dr. Marilyn administered first aid treatment to the children. Carlos and Mario were then brought to the hotel clinic where they were treated by the hotel's physician. On February 25, 2009, Karlos sent a Letter to Mr. Bernd Schneider, Sofitel's Manager, demanding compensation for his children's injuries. On April 15, 2009, Sofitel, through its counsel, denied Karlos's request for compensation. Four months later, in June 2009, Carlos started having seizures and was admitted at Medical City. He was subjected to laboratory diagnostics, MRI, and EEG procedures which caused his father to incur expenses. Aggrieved, Karlos filed a Complaint for Damages against Sofitel before the Metropolitan Trial Court. On August 26, 2009, Sofitel filed its Answer where it alleged the following affirmative allegations and defenses: (1) the complaint states no cause of action; (2) Karlos failed to identify his right violated by Sofitel entitling him to damages; (3) Karlos has no cause of action against Sofitel; and (4) the incident was an accident.","After trial, the Metropolitan Trial Court dismissed Karlos's complaint on the ground that he was unable to substantiate his allegations. It found that Karlos failed to prove that the injury sustained by his children was the proximate cause of his children's admission at Medical City. Karlos moved for reconsideration but the Metropolitan Trial Court denied it on August 1, 2011. On appeal, the Regional Trial Court affirmed in toto the Metropolitan Trial Court's decision. Karlos's motion for reconsideration was likewise denied by the Regional Trial Court in its October 11, 2013 Order. In its May 11, 2016 Decision, the Court of Appeals denied the petition and affirmed the Regional Trial Court's decision. It ruled that Karlos failed to establish the connection between Sofitel's alleged negligence and the injuries sustained by his children. On November 2, 2016, the Court of Appeals denied Karlos's motion for reconsideration.","The Supreme Court granted the Petition. The Court found that there has been a gross misapprehension of facts, which permits the Court to resolve the factual controversies involved. The Court held that although the swimming pool alone may not be considered as an attractive nuisance, the kiddie pool's close proximity to the slides formed an unusual condition or artificial feature intended to attract children. In other words, the installation of the slides with slopes ending over the swimming pool's waters makes it an attractive nuisance. By this reason, respondent was duty bound to undertake protective measures to ensure the children's safety. The Court found that all requisites for the application of res ipsa loquitur are present in the case. It is undisputed that petitioner's children sustained their injuries while playing within the pool's premises—an instrumentality within respondent's exclusive management and control. By reason of the swimming pool's nature as an attractive nuisance, respondent is duty bound to guarantee that it had installed sufficient precautionary measures to ensure the safety of its guests, particularly the children. The establishment of these safeguards should have prevented the incident. Accordingly, it could be inferred that petitioner's children would not have sustained their injuries were it not for respondent's negligence. The Court found that respondent's failure to prevent the children from using the swimming pool was the proximate cause of the injuries they sustained. Respondent's failure to install the needed safeguards constitutes negligence for which it should be held liable for damages.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is GRANTED. The May 11, 2016 Decision and November 2, 2016 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA G.R. SP No. 132851 are REVERSED. Respondent Sofitel Philippine Plaza Manila is ORDERED to pay petitioner Karlos Noel R. Aleta: (1) P50,000.00 as temperate damages; (2) P100,000.00 as moral damages; (3) P50,000.00 as exemplary damages; and (4) P50,000.00 as attorney's fees. All damages awarded shall be subject to interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the finality of this Decision until its full satisfaction. SO ORDERED."
G.R. No. 250979,"PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PETITIONER, VS. RENE ESMA Y JOVEN, RESPONDENT.","The public prosecutor charged respondent with violation of Sections 5 and 11, Article II of RA 9165, in two (2) Informations. Respondent was charged with: (a) selling one heat-sealed transparent plastic sachet containing 0.0416 grams of white crystalline substance; and (b) possessing two heat-sealed transparent sachets containing 0.0694 grams of white crystalline substance which were later confirmed to be shabu. During the trial, respondent filed a Motion to Allow Accused to Plea Bargain dated July 21, 2018 praying that he be allowed to plea to the lower offense of ""Possession of Equipment, Instrument, Apparatus and Other Paraphernalia for Dangerous Drugs"" under Section 12, Article II of RA 9165 in lieu of Illegal Sale and Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs under Sections 5 and 11, respectively, Article II of RA 9165. The prosecution opposed respondent's motion. It averred that under Department of Justice (DOJ) Department Circular No. 27, where the offense charged is violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 and the quantity of shabu is less than five grams, the acceptable plea bargain is violation of Section 11, Article II of RA 9165. As for Criminal Case No. R-TAC-15-00332-CR, where respondent was charged with violation of Section 11, Article II of RA 9165, the prosecution requested for time to study the motion to plea bargain because trial on the merits had already commenced.","Finding the plea bargain to be in accord with the rationale behind the law and the wisdom of A.M. No. 18-03-16-SC, or the Adoption of the Plea Bargaining Framework in Drugs Cases, the RTC issued a Joint Order dated July 30, 2018 approving it. The RTC held that the Rules drafted by the Philippine Judges Association and adopted by the Court precisely adhere to the purposes of RA 9165. It emphasized that the Rules mandate a drug dependency examination; and that thereafter, the accused shall undergo rehabilitation and counseling as a condition to plea bargaining. The RTC ruled that the prosecution's opposition failed to show that allowing plea bargaining would negate the purposes for which RA 9165 was enacted. On the contrary, it held that a resort to plea bargain would benefit public order as it would result in respondent's conviction and he will be given the chance to be rehabilitated and reintegrated into the mainstream society as a productive individual. The public prosecutor filed a Motion for Reconsideration but the RTC denied it in its Order dated August 30, 2018. Consequently, the People, represented by the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), filed a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court before the CA asserting that the RTC gravely abused its discretion in approving respondent's motion to plea bargain. On November 22, 2019, the CA rendered the assailed Consolidated Decision upholding the RTC's approval of respondent's plea bargain. The CA pointed out that the power and authority to promulgate the rules of procedure is lodged exclusively with the Supreme Court.","The Supreme Court denied the petition for review on certiorari for failure of petitioner to show that the CA committed a reversible error in affirming the findings of the RTC approving respondent's plea bargain. The Court took judicial notice of DOJ Department Circular No. 18 dated May 10, 2022, which effectively revoked DOJ Circular No. 27. Under the recent DOJ Circular No. 18, where the subject of the illegal sale is 0.01 gram to .99 gram of shabu, the accused may plea to the lesser offense of Illegal Possession of Drug Paraphernalia under Section 12, Article II of RA 9165. This is the same with the plea bargaining framework in A.M. No. 18-03-16-SC. The Court found that respondent's plea bargain is in accordance with A.M. No. 18-03-16-SC and DOJ Circular No. 18. While the issuance of DOJ Circular No. 18 has admittedly rendered moot the issues in the present case, the Court is not precluded from examining and ruling on the merits thereof especially if: (1) there is a need to stress the exclusive rule-making power of the Court; (2) the decision will guide the bench and the bar in resolving issues concerning plea bargaining agreements in drugs cases; and (3) the issue is capable of repetition yet evading judicial review. The Court noted that plea bargaining in criminal cases is a rule of procedure that falls within the exclusive rule-making power of the Court under Section 5(5), Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution. The Court emphasized that the prosecution's opposition to the motion to plea bargain of the accused should be treated as a continuing objection that should be resolved by the trial court. The decision to deny or sustain the prosecution's objection to the plea bargaining offer of the accused is still subject to the trial court's sound discretion.","WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED. The Consolidated Decision dated November 22, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CEB SP No. 12227 is AFFIRMED in toto. SO ORDERED."
G.R. No. 257733,"JAMES BILLOSO Y OBLIGAR PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","James Billoso and Dave Billoso y Capapas, were charged with violation of Section 5 in relation to Article II, Section 26 of Republic Act No. 9165. Billoso was also charged with violation of Article II, Section 11 of Republic Act No. 9165 in another Information. During their arraignment on August 1, 2018, Billoso and his co-accused entered a plea of ""not guilty"" to both charges. On the same day, they submitted their Proposal for Plea Bargaining stating their willingness to plead guilty to the lesser offense of violation of Article II, Section 12 of Republic Act No. 9165 for all charges. The prosecution filed its Comment/Objection (To Proposal for Plea Bargaining) praying for the denial of the plea bargaining proposal on the grounds that in Criminal Case No. C-224-18: (1) the prosecution is directed not to accept plea bargaining proposals pursuant to Department of Justice (DOJ) Circular No. 027-18; and (2) the prosecution's evidence was sufficient to convict petitioner and his co-accused of the crimes charged. For Criminal Case No. C-225-18, the prosecution argued that the evidence was sufficient to convict the accused of the crime charged.","In an Order dated January 24, 2019, the RTC granted Billoso and his co-accused's proposal for plea bargaining and ordered their re-arraignment for the lesser offense of violation of Article II, Section 12 of Republic Act No. 9165. After the plea of ""not guilty"" to the lesser offense was entered, the RTC rendered its Decision declaring Billoso and his co-accused guilty of the lesser crime. The RTC held that Administrative Matter No. 18-03-16-SC shall prevail over Department of Justice Circular No. 027. The Office of the Solicitor General moved for the reconsideration of the RTC Decision. Thereafter, the RTC issued its Order denying the motion for reconsideration on the ground that it was filed out of time. The Office of the Solicitor General subsequently filed a Petition for Certiorari praying for the annulment of the RTC's Decision and Order, and for the reinstatement and the continuation of proceedings. In the assailed Decision, the CA granted the Office of the Solicitor General's Petition for Certiorari. Billoso and his co-accused moved for reconsideration which was denied by the Court of Appeals in its Resolution.","The Supreme Court denied the Petition. The Court clarified that insofar as the inconsistency to plea bargaining involving violation of Section 5 of Republic Act No. 9165 is concerned, the same was already reconciled with the issuance of DOJ Circular No. 18 dated May 10, 2022, and thus, any objection based solely on DOJ Circular No. 027-18 can now be considered effectively withdrawn. However, with respect to the prosecution's second ground, jurisprudence and guidelines issued by the Court have consistently provided that trial courts should resolve plea bargaining proposals on the basis of evidence. The Court held that a trial court's ruling on motions for plea bargaining must be grounded on evidence. Trial courts should resolve plea bargaining proposals in drugs cases based on whether evidence exists that the accused is a recidivist, is a habitual offender or known in the community as a drug addict and a troublemaker, has undergone rehabilitation but had a relapse, has been charged many times, or is guilty of the crime charged. The Court found that no error was committed by the CA when it ruled for the annulment and setting aside the RTC's Decision and Order, and directed the reinstatement of the criminal cases against Billoso. The RTC indubitably gravely abused its discretion when it, contrary to established jurisprudence and guidelines issued by the Court, approved Billoso's plea bargaining proposal without resolving the prosecution's claim that there is sufficient evidence to convict Billoso of the offenses originally charged against him.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DENIED for lack of merit. The Decision dated October 28, 2020 and the Resolution dated June 30, 2021 issued by the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 12761 are MODIFIED. The case against James Billoso y Obligar in Criminal Case Nos. C-224-18 and C-225-18 are REMANDED to Branch 16, Regional Trial Court, Roxas City to RESOLVE James Billoso y Obligar's proposal for plea bargaining in accordance with the Montierro guidelines. SO ORDERED."
G.R. No. 256253,"PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. ROMEL VALE Y PALMARIA,[1] ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","The prosecution alleged that on the afternoon of October 2, 2013, AAA256253 was on her way to purchase dye for her mother when she was suddenly grabbed by a man who covered her mouth and dragged her toward an isolated grassy area. The man removed AAA256253's pants and tied them around her neck, causing her to lose consciousness. After regaining consciousness, AAA256253 walked home half-naked, with her pants still tied around her neck. AAA256253's mother then saw her, noticing that AAA256253's eyes were red and her vagina was oozing blood. When asked what happened, AAA256253 related the incident and described her assailant as the man residing near the farm. AAA256253 was later brought by her mother to the Barangay Captain to inform him of the incident and to ask for assistance, and thereafter to the hospital. It was at the hospital where AAA256253 positively identified Vale as her attacker after the latter was brought there by several barangay officials. Upon treatment and examination at the hospital, AAA256253 was found to have an infra-orbital contusion hematoma on her left eye, swelling in her chin, strangulation markings on her neck, and a fresh laceration in her vagina. In defense, Vale denied the allegations against him. He claimed that on October 2, 2013, he was at their farm until 10:00 a.m., after which he went home. He asserted that he was at home with his wife until 10:00 p.m. of the same date, and only went out of his house to check the palay he was sun-drying. By 10:00 p.m., he contended that several barangay officials went to his house and invited him to the barangay hall. He was, however, brought to the hospital where AAA256253 identified him as the one who raped her.","In a Decision dated May 25, 2018, the RTC found Vale guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Rape of a minor in relation to Republic Act No. (RA) 7610, sentencing him to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua. The RTC further directed Vale to pay AAA256253 civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages at P 100,000.00 each, as well as the costs of the suit. The RTC gave full faith and credit to the clear, simple, and straightforward testimony of AAA256253, and ruled that Vale's bare, unsubstantiated denial will not prevail over his positive identification by AAA256253 as the perpetrator of the crime. Undeterred, Vale appealed to the CA. In a Decision dated February 24, 2020, the CA affirmed Vale's conviction with modifications, decreasing the award of civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages to P75,000.00 each. The CA found no cogent reason to disturb the findings of the RTC in upholding the credibility of AAA256253. The CA rejected Vale's arguments that his identity as AAA256253's assailant was not clearly established and that there was no evidence of sexual intercourse because AAA256253 was unconscious at the time of the incident. Further, the CA rebuffed Vale's contention that the RTC did not acquire jurisdiction over the case because the Information charging him with Rape was legally defective as it did not bear the signature of the Provincial Prosecutor of Camarines Sur.","The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal. On the threshold issue of jurisdiction, the Court found it erroneous for Vale to claim that the RTC lacked jurisdiction over his case owing to the alleged absence of a prior written authority or approval of the provincial or city prosecutor in the filing of the Information against him. The Court emphasized that in Villa Gomez v. People, the Court abandoned previous doctrine that divests courts of jurisdiction over the accused and the subject matter in a criminal action if an Information filed in court lacks the signature and approval of the provincial, city, or chief state prosecutor. The Court held that jurisdiction springs from substantive law, whereas a government officer's authority to sue is a matter of mere form and procedure. The supposed jurisdictional infirmity may be waived by the accused through silence, acquiescence, or failure to raise such ground during arraignment or before entering a plea. On the merits, the Court held that all the elements of Statutory Rape under Article 266-A (1) (d) in relation to Article 266-B of the RPC are present in this case. The first element was proven by the birth certificate of AAA256253 showing she was just nine (9) years old at the time the crime was committed. The second element was proven by the categorical testimony of AAA256253 that it was Vale who grabbed her and dragged her to an isolated grassy area, that Vale removed her pants and tied them around her neck until she lost consciousness, that after waking up she already had no underwear, and that she felt pain in her vagina with blood oozing therefrom. These circumstances concur with the Medico Legal report and the testimony of the examining physician that AAA256253 sustained a hymenal laceration. The Court rejected Vale's contention that there was no evidence of carnal knowledge because AAA256253 lost consciousness, holding that circumstantial evidence of rape is sufficient to warrant conviction.","ACCORDINGLY, the appeal is DISMISSED. The Decision of the Court of Appeals dated February 24, 2020 in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 11547 is hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. Accused-appellant Romel Vale y Palmaria is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of Rape under Article 266-A (1) in relation to Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code and is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua. Further, he is ordered to pay AAA256253 the amounts of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages, and P75,000.00 as exemplary damages, all of which shall earn legal interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the date of the finality of this Decision until full payment. SO ORDERED."
G.R. No. 248890,"MA. CECILIA P. NGO, PETITIONER, VS. FORTUNE MEDICARE, INC. AND DR. ALFONSO SAHAGUN, RESPONDENTS.","This case arose from a complaint for illegal dismissal filed by petitioner against Medicare and its President, Dr. Alfonso Sahagun before the NLRC. Petitioner alleged that she was employed by Medicare in September 2002 initially as an Accounting Manager, and less than five (5) years thereafter, she was promoted to Assistant Vice President (AVP) for Accounting of Medicare until her dismissal. Petitioner claimed that sometime in December 2015, Medicare's former President asked her to represent the finance team in a management meeting and directed petitioner to include in her presentation the report of Vilma D. Cruz, the AVP for Credit and Collection, regarding Medicare's collection efficiency. The contents of Cruz's report were later found by Medicare to be allegedly incorrect during an independent audit, resulting in an internal audit of Medicare's operations. Petitioner received a letter dated January 6, 2016 informing her that she would be on preventive suspension pending the investigation and audit of the company accounts. On February 1, 2016, petitioner received another letter dated January 29, 2016 from Medicare, directing petitioner to explain in writing why she should not be disciplined and dismissed for: (1) Missing 841 documents; (2) Claiming and reporting 99% collection efficiency; (3) No accompanying notes to financial statement; and (4) No updated reconciliation of all company bank accounts. Petitioner submitted her written explanation through a letter dated February 4, 2016. During the administrative hearing, petitioner inquired as to whether there were any significant findings against her, and she was allegedly informed that there were no significant findings. Petitioner alleged that she met with Dr. Sahagun and a Board Member wherein Dr. Sahagun requested that petitioner return to work, promising her choice of location for her office and a salary adjustment. However, on March 23, 2016, petitioner was surprised to receive a notice of termination dated March 22, 2016 informing her of her termination from the service effective March 23, 2016.","In a Decision dated May 26, 2017, the LA found that petitioner had been illegally dismissed by Medicare. The LA ruled that respondents failed to provide clear and convincing evidence to support the basis of loss and trust and confidence in petitioner, while petitioner was able to sufficiently explain her side against the accusations of respondents. Aggrieved, respondents filed an appeal before the NLRC. In a Decision dated November 27, 2017, the NLRC affirmed the LA's ruling, stating that there was no sufficient cause to justify the loss of trust and confidence of Medicare on petitioner. However, the NLRC deleted the award of salary during petitioner's preventive suspension and her retirement pay, as she had committed minor infractions. Respondents moved for reconsideration, which the NLRC denied in a Resolution dated December 29, 2017. Aggrieved, they filed a Petition for Certiorari before the CA. In a Decision dated May 2, 2019, the CA reversed and set aside the Decision dated November 27, 2017 and the Resolution dated December 29, 2017 of the NLRC, and held that there was no illegal dismissal. The CA ruled that the requisites to allow an employer to terminate the services of an employee for loss of trust and confidence under Article 282 (c) (now Article 297 [c]) of the Labor Code were met in this case.","The Supreme Court granted the Petition. The Court found that the CA erred in ascribing grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC when the latter tribunal declared petitioner to have been illegally dismissed by Medicare. The NLRC's finding of illegal dismissal is in accord with the evidence on record, as well as settled legal principles of labor law. The Court found that Medicare failed to provide reasonable grounds to believe that petitioner is responsible for the purported conduct attributed to her that served as basis for her termination. The Court held that Medicare's assertion that petitioner misled management by reporting that the company's collection efficiency was at 99% cannot be given any merit as it is not disputed that another office was in charge of the preparation of the report and that petitioner was merely requested by Medicare's former president to present the same. With regard to the allegation that petitioner misplaced 841 accounting or financial documents, the Court agreed with the NLRC that Medicare's failure to provide the specific details on the allegedly missing documents belies the accusation. The Court found that petitioner has sufficiently explained that it had been company practice to only include notes on the year-end financial statements. The Court ruled that petitioner was not afforded the opportunity to reply to the additional allegation regarding the cash advances in violation of procedural due process. Based on the established facts, petitioner committed only minor infractions at best, and there were no grounds for her preventive suspension.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated May 2, 2019 and the Resolution dated July 26, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 154726 are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The Decision dated November 27, 2017 of the National Labor Relations Commission in NLRC NCR Case No.02-01776-17 is hereby REINSTATED with MODIFICATION. Respondent Fortune Medicare, Inc. is ORDERED to immediately pay petitioner Ma. Cecilia P. Ngo the following: (1) Backwages computed from March 23, 2016, the date of her illegal dismissal, up to the finality of this Decision, plus six percent (6%) interest per annum from March 23, 2016 until fully paid; (2) Separation pay equivalent to one (1) month salary for every year of service until the finality of this Decision; (3) Salary during the Suspension Period (January 6, 2016 to March 22, 2016); (4) Ten percent (10%) Attorney's Fees; and (5) Legal interest of six percent (6%) per annum for (2), (3) and (4) from the finality of this Decision until fully paid. The case is REMANDED FOR EXECUTION to the Labor Arbiter, who is hereby ORDERED to prepare a revised comprehensive computation of the monetary awards based on the foregoing and cause its implementation, with utmost dispatch.

Severo Brillantes (respondent) liable for violations of Canons 8 and 11 of the Code of Professional Responsibility and suspended him from the practice of law for a period of six (6) months. Respondent received the copy of this Court's resolution on 08 February 2021. The following day, he filed a Manifestation with Plea for Mercy dated 09 February 2021 requesting that his suspension be reduced to one month only. This Court denied respondent's plea for mercy in a Resolution dated 14 June 2021. Subsequently, respondent filed a Manifestation with Motion to Lift Order Suspending Respondent from the Practice of Law, alleging that after his receipt of the copy of the Resolution dated 02 March 2020, he desisted from the practice of law. He claims that he has furnished all concerned adverse parties in the cases he has been handling, as well as the courts and quasi-judicial agencies where he has entered an appearance with copies of his Manifestation dated 09 February 2021. Moreover, he has filed his Withdrawal of Appearance therein, attaching copies of the emails sent as proof thereof. Citing various health problems, respondent apologizes for the delay in notifying the aforesaid parties. He also contends that he has already complied with the six-month period of suspension.","In a Report and Recommendation dated 12 October 2021, the OBC recommends the lifting of respondent's suspension, noting that respondent has served his suspension from the time he received notice on 08 February 2021 until 08 August 2021. It opines that while respondent has failed to submit certifications from the courts where he practices, as well as from the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) Chapter where he belongs, his sworn statement attesting to his compliance to the order of suspension should be deemed sufficient compliance to the guidelines set forth in Maniago v. De Dias. The OBC observes that over the years, there have been varying interpretations of the Court's guidelines in Maniago with respect to the requirements for lifting an order of suspension. The OBC recommends that the requirement on additional certifications be set aside and that the filing of a sworn statement of compliance be deemed sufficient to reinstate suspended lawyers.","The Supreme Court granted the motion to lift the order of suspension. The Court clarified and set the uniform rule that for purposes of requests for lifting of the suspension, submission of a sworn certification of service of suspension shall be deemed sufficient compliance to Maniago. While lawyers are neither prohibited nor discouraged to attach supporting certifications from their local IBP chapters, and from courts and quasi-judicial agencies where they practice, their requests to resume practice will not be held in abeyance on account of their non-submission. The Court is cognizant of the effects of requiring lawyers to submit these certifications as it may have resulted in prolonging the suspension more than the periods set by the Court. The Court found that there are procedural safeguards in place to address the probability of abuse as every order of suspension imposed against a member of the Bar will still be furnished to the OBC, the IBP, and the OCA for circulation to all courts in the country. The Court held that by making the process of lifting suspensions more efficient, it is not waiving its authority to discipline erring lawyers or tolerating professional indiscretions but is merely balancing its regulatory duty with practical considerations. In this case, the Court notes that respondent's suspension ended at the time the country was just starting to gain control of the pandemic through the administration of vaccines. In addition to his sworn statement of compliance to the order of suspension, respondent also submitted copies of email communications he sent to the private adverse parties, concerned courts, and quasi-judicial agencies, notifying them of his suspension.","WHEREFORE, premises considered, respondent Atty. Severo Brillantes' Manifestation with Motion to Lift Order Suspending Respondent from the Practice of Law is hereby GRANTED. Accordingly, he is hereby ALLOWED to RESUME his practice of law effective immediately. For the guidance of the Bench and the Bar, the following guidelines shall govern the lifting of the penalty of suspension imposed against members of the Bar: (1) After a finding that the respondent lawyer must be suspended from the practice of law, the Court shall render a decision or resolution imposing the appropriate penalty; (2) The order of suspension shall be immediately executory upon receipt thereof by the respondent lawyer; (3) Every order of suspension imposed against a member of the Bar shall be furnished to the Office of the Bar Confidant, Integrated Bar of the Philippines, and Office of the Court Administrator; (4) Upon the expiration of the period of suspension, the respondent lawyer shall file a Sworn Statement with the Court, through the Office of the Bar Confidant, stating therein that he or she has desisted from the practice of law, has not appeared in any court during the period of his or her suspension and has complied with all other directives of the Court; (5) Copies of such Sworn Statement shall be furnished to the Local Chapter of the IBP, the Executive Judge of the courts, or any quasi-judicial agencies where the respondent lawyer has pending cases; (6) The order of suspension shall be automatically lifted upon submission by the respondent lawyer of such Sworn Statement; (7) While respondent lawyers are neither prohibited nor discouraged to attach supporting certifications, their requests to resume the practice of law will not be held in abeyance on account of their non-submission; and (8) Any finding or report contrary to the statements made by the respondent lawyer under oath shall be a ground for the imposition of a more severe punishment, or even disbarment. SO ORDERED."

ERMITA, SECRETARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, SECRETARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY, PHILIPPINE NATIONAL OIL COMPANY, AND PHILIPPINE NATIONAL OIL COMPANY EXPLORATION CORPORATION, RESPONDENTS.","On March 14, 2005, CNOOC, PETROVIETNAM, and PNOC, with the authorization of their respective Governments, signed the JMSU in Manila, Philippines. The JMSU has a term of three years starting from the date of commencement of its implementation. According to its fourth whereas clause, its execution is an expression of the Parties' commitment ""to pursue efforts to transform the South China Sea into an area of peace, stability, cooperation, and development."" The Parties desire ""to engage in a joint research of petroleum resource potential of a certain area of the South China Sea as a pre-exploration activity."" The JMSU shall cover 142,886 square kilometers of the Agreement Area. Article 4(1) of the JMSU authorizes the conduct by the Parties of ""seismic work"" in the Agreement Area. On June 5, 2005, then Department of Energy (DOE) Secretary Raphael P.M. Lotilla issued a six-month term permit to the PNOC Exploration Corporation, the assignee of the PNOC under Article 9.1 of the JMSU, which constituted the Philippine Government's approval of the JMSU. On July 1, 2005, the JMSU commenced to be implemented for the Agreement Term or until July 1, 2008. On May 21, 2008, petitioners, suing as legislators, taxpayers, and citizens, filed a petition against respondents. Petitioners argued that the JMSU is unconstitutional based on two grounds: (1) the JMSU allows large-scale exploration of petroleum and other mineral oils by corporations wholly-owned by foreign states in violation of Section 2(1), Article XII of the 1987 Constitution; and (2) the JMSU is not covered and sanctioned by any of the allowable and permissible undertakings for the EDU of natural resources under the 1987 Constitution. Meanwhile, on June 30, 2008, the JMSU expired.","Commenting on the petition, respondents, through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), argued that PGMA is not a proper respondent in the petition because the president is immune from suit. The OSG alleged that the president and her cabinet members are also not liable for the execution of the JMSU since they are not parties to the agreement. The JMSU was executed by PNOC, a government corporation that possesses a personality separate and distinct from the Republic. Respondents insisted that the petition fails to make a case for certiorari and prohibition because the JMSU already expired on June 30, 2008. Moreover, the issues raised in the petition are factual and would require the presentation of evidence. Respondents maintained that petitioners' proper remedy is an ordinary civil action for annulment of contracts cognizable by the Regional Trial Courts. In their reply, petitioners countered that they did not file the petition to harass PGMA. They claimed that she is accountable for the execution and implementation of the JMSU because she did not repudiate the act of the DOE Secretary in issuing a permit which constituted the Republic's approval of the agreement. Without such approval, the JMSU would not be binding on the Republic.","The Supreme Court granted the petition. The Court ruled that PGMA is improperly impleaded in the case. Though not expressly reserved in the 1987 Constitution, the rule that the president is immune from suit during his/her tenure remains preserved under our system of government. The Court held that presidential immunity does not hinge on the nature of the suit and the president cannot be sued while holding such office. The Court ruled that the writs of certiorari and prohibition are proper remedies to assail the constitutionality of the JMSU and to determine whether respondents committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. The Court found that direct recourse to it is justified because the issue of whether the JMSU violated Section 2, Article XII of the 1987 Constitution not only presents a genuine issue of constitutionality, but also involves a question of law. The Court ruled that all the four exceptions to the moot and academic principle obtain in this case. The Court held that petitioners have standing to file the suit as legislators, taxpayers, and citizens. The Court ruled that the JMSU involves exploration of the country's petroleum resources. The Court held that exploration, whether used in the ordinary or technical sense pertains to a search or discovery of something. Applying this definition, the Court ruled that the JMSU involves the exploration of the country's natural resources, particularly petroleum, because the text of the fifth whereas clause of the JMSU is clear that the Parties expressed desire to engage in a joint research of petroleum resource potential. The Court held that the JMSU is unconstitutional because it does not fall under any of the four modes prescribed by Section 2, Article XII of the 1987 Constitution for the exploration, development and utilization of natural resources.","WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED. The Tripartite Agreement for Joint Marine Seismic Undertaking in the Agreement Area in the South China Sea By and Among China National Offshore Oil Corporation and Vietnam Oil and Gas Corporation and Philippine National Oil Company is declared UNCONSTITUTIONAL and VOID. SO ORDERED."
G.R. No. 250636,"MERLINDA PLANA, PETITIONER, VS. LOURDES TAN CHUA AND HEIRS OF RAMON CHIANG, RESPONDENTS.","On August 25, 2000, petitioner Merlinda Relano (Merlinda) filed a Complaint for Reconveyance of Lot 10031 against Ramon Chiang (Ramon) and Lourdes Tan Chua (Lourdes) before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) – Iloilo City. Merlinda alleged that she and her first husband (now deceased) Nelson Plana (Nelson) owned five (5) lots covered by TCT Nos. T-57960, T-57961, T-57962, T-57963 and T-57864 located in Santa Barbara, Iloilo. On December 15, 1971, Nelson died. Four (4) years later, or on March 17, 1975, she got married to Ramon. But in 1979, they got separated from bed and board. While she and Ramon were still together, the latter fraudulently made her sign a Deed of Definite Sale dated December 17, 1975 purportedly selling the five (5) lots to him. Consequently, TCT Nos. T-57960, T-57961, T-57962, T-57963 and T-57864 were all cancelled and five (5) new titles were issued in the name of Ramon alone. In 1980, she sued Ramon for recovery of the four (4) lots under TCT Nos. T-86912, T-86913, T-86914, T-86915 which Ramon sold to one Serafin Modina. On October 29, 1999, the Court in Modina v. Court of Appeals declared as void the Deed of Definite Sale over the four (4) lots for being simulated and without consideration. On June 25, 1996, Ramon mortgaged the 5th lot (Lot 10031) covered by TCT No. T-86916 to Lourdes to secure the amount of P130,000.00 which he borrowed from Lourdes. On July 15, 1996, the mortgage was annotated on the back of TCT No. T-86916 under Entry No. 656728.","After due proceedings, the RTC rendered its Decision dated November 12, 2012, (1) declaring as void the sale of Lot 10031 to Ramon and the subsequent mortgage thereof to Lourdes; (2) ordering the cancellation of TCT No. T-86916 issued in the name of Ramon, as well as the annotation thereon of ""Entry No. 656728 – Real Estate Mortgage in favor of Lourdes;"" (3) ordering the reinstatement of TCT No. T-57961 in the name of ""Nelson Plana married to Merlinda Relano;"" (4) directing Ramon to pay Merlinda P100,000.00 as moral damages, P100,000.00 as exemplary damages, and P50,000.00 as attorney's fees; and (7) pronouncing no cost against Lourdes. Lourdes alone appealed. Under Decision dated June 25, 2018, the Court of Appeals affirmed with modification. It found that there was no preponderant evidence to show that Lourdes had prior knowledge of the defect in the title of Ramon. The Court of Appeals ruled that since Lourdes was a mortgagee in good faith, the real estate mortgage should be deemed valid. Consequently, the Court of Appeals ordered the annotation of the Real Estate Mortgage dated June 25, 1996 on TCT No. T-57961 under the name of ""Nelson Plana married to petitioner Merlinda Relano."" Merlinda's Motion for Reconsideration was denied under Resolution dated October 16, 2019.","The Supreme Court partly granted the petition. The Court ruled that both the RTC and the Court of Appeals found that Lourdes was a mortgagee in good faith. The Court held that all the requisites for the doctrine of mortgagee in good faith are present in this case. However, the Court clarified that where the true owner has not been found negligent or has not committed an act which could have brought about the issuance of another title relied upon by the purchaser or mortgagee for value, then the true innocent owner, whether still registered or deemed registered, has a better right over the mortgagee in good faith. The Court found that insofar as the issuance of TCT No. T-86916 is concerned, Merlinda was not shown to have directly or indirectly caused it through her fault or negligence. Nor was it shown that, in one way or another, she led Lourdes, a mortgagee in good faith, to believe in, let alone, rely on the said title. Applying Spouses Bautista and Modina, the Court ruled that Merlinda's title over Lot 10031 should prevail over the right of Lourdes as a mortgagee in good faith. The Court held that whatever right Lourdes may have acquired over Lot 10031 must yield to the superior right of Merlinda as the true owner thereof. The Court also noted that Lourdes and her counsel do not deny the veracity of the material information regarding the existence of Civil Case No. 25285 for accounting and damages filed by Ramon against Lourdes. By their silence, Lourdes and her counsel are considered to have admitted every piece of information regarding Civil Case No. 25285, showing that Ramon already paid Lourdes a substantial, if not full settlement of the loan.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is PARTLY GRANTED. The Decision dated June 25, 2018 and Resolution dated October 16, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CEB-CV No. 04831 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION, thus: (1) TCT No. T-86916 issued in the name of Ramon Chiang is cancelled; (2) The annotation of the Real Estate Mortgage on the back of TCT No. T-86916 under Entry No. 656728 in favor of Lourdes Tan Chua is likewise cancelled; (3) TCT No. T-57961 issued in the name of Nelson Plana married to Merlinda Relano is reinstated; (4) The Estate of Ramon Chiang, through his heirs is ordered to pay Merlinda Plana the following amounts: P100,000.00 as moral damages; P100,000.00 as exemplary damages; P50,000.00 as attorney's fees; and six percent (6%) interest per annum on these amounts from finality of this Decision until fully paid.

G.R. No. 263061,"GLENDA BURAY ECLEO, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, RESPONDENT.","Petitioner Ecleo, a member of Lakas-Kampi party, was a candidate for Governor of Dinagat Islands during the 2010 elections. She won and subsequently ran during the 2013 elections, where she was re-elected for her second term of office. On June 8, 2010, Ecleo filed her Statement of Contributions and Expenditures (SOCE), following the elections, as required by law. On December 13, 2014, the COMELEC, represented by the Campaign Finance Unit (CFU), filed a Complaint motu proprio against Ecleo with the COMELEC Law Department for an alleged violation of Section 100, in relation to Section 262 of the Omnibus Election Code. The Complaint alleged that Ecleo exceeded the expenditure limit provided by law for campaign spending, in violation of Section 13 of Republic Act No. 7166 (R.A. 7166), which allows a candidate, other than for presidency and vice presidency, to spend an amount of P3.00 for every voter currently registered in the constituency where he/she filed his/her certificate of candidacy. At the time of the 2010 elections, Dinagat Islands had 70,353 registered voters, and Ecleo was authorized to spend P3.00 on each of them. Thus, Ecleo's allowable expenditure limit as provided by law was P211,059.00. However, based on her SOCE, Ecleo spent P230,000.00 in the 2010 election, exceeding the limit by P18,941.00, or 8.97% above the allowable threshold. In her Counter-Affidavit, Ecleo vehemently denied the allegations against her, and maintained that she is not guilty of overspending. She also claimed that her secretary, who prepared the SOCE, merely surmised the amounts as she was not in possession of the receipts at the time. On June 23, 2021, the COMELEC En Banc issued the assailed Resolution, adopting the recommendation of the Law Department to file an Information against Ecleo for violation of Section 100, in relation to Section 262 of the Omnibus Election Code. On July 20, 2022, Ecleo received a copy of the assailed Resolution.","On August 12, 2022, Ecleo filed a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 64 before the Court, alleging grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of the COMELEC En Banc for (1) issuing the assailed Resolution seven years from the time of the filing of the complaint, resulting in inordinate and gross delay; (2) refusing to consider that the complaint is moot and academic; and (3) considering the inherently defective SOCE which formed the basis for the complaint.","The Supreme Court granted the Petition for Certiorari under Rule 64 filed by Ecleo. The Court held that the COMELEC gravely abused its discretion when it directed its Law Department to file an Information against Ecleo seven years after the filing of the complaint against her, and found that it is guilty of inordinate delay in the conduct of preliminary investigation. The Court applied the four-fold test to determine whether the right to speedy disposition of cases has been violated, considering: (1) the length of the delay; (2) the reasons for such delay; (3) defendant's assertion or non-assertion of his or her right; and (4) the prejudice caused to the defendant as a result of the delay. The Court found that the COMELEC took an unreasonable amount of time to conduct its preliminary investigation, on an issue that could be resolved by simple arithmetic, without offering a valid explanation for the delay. The COMELEC, as represented by the CFU, initiated the filing of a complaint against Ecleo in 2014, but it was only in 2021 that the COMELEC issued a Resolution directing the Law Department to file the appropriate Information against Ecleo for violation of the Omnibus Election Code, in flagrant violation of its own internal rules of procedure. Section 8, Rule 34 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure provides that the preliminary investigation must be terminated within twenty (20) days after receipt of the counter-affidavits and other evidence of the respondents, and resolution thereof shall be made within five (5) days thereafter. In stark contrast to its self-prescribed timelines, the COMELEC took seven long years to determine probable cause. The Court noted that not only did Ecleo complete her term as Governor of Dinagat Islands, she had even been re-elected to the same post and had already completed her second term. The Court found that considering the simplicity and straightforwardness of the issue, which did not even need the examination of voluminous records, it is unfathomable why it took this long for the COMELEC to complete its preliminary investigation.","WHEREFORE, the Petition for Certiorari is GRANTED. The assailed Resolution No. 21-0424-29, dated June 23, 2021, of the Commission on Elections in E.O. Case No. 14-598 is NULLIFIED, having been issued with grave abuse of discretion. E.O. Case No. 14-598 against the petitioner Glenda Buray Ecleo is DISMISSED. SO ORDERED."
G.R. No. 219425,"VIOLETA C. MAGASO, PETITIONER, VS. THE HON. COMMISSION ON AUDIT, RESPONDENT.","Sometime in 2004, then Congressman Hussin U. Amin of the First District of Sulu, identified the Municipality of Panglima Tahil, Sulu as one of the recipients of his Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) for calendar year (CY) 2004. Congressman Amin requested the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) to allocate P3,000,000.00 for the procurement of various medicines, medical supplies, and devices to be distributed to the constituents of the Municipality of Panglima Tahil. The DBM issued Special Allotment Release Order (SARO) No. ROIX-2004-071 dated 16 March 2004 in the amount of P3,000,000.00. Said PDAF was released to the Department of Health (DOH), Regional Field Office IX, Zamboanga City. In response to a complaint filed relative to said transactions, a Special Audit Team (SAT) was created under Legal and Adjudication Office Order No. 2005-058 tasked to conduct an audit investigation on various transactions of the DOH-CHD, Zamboanga Peninsula, covering check disbursements for CY 2004. During their audit, it was found that a Notice of Cash Allocation No. 149403-2 dated 6 May 2004 was issued by the DBM in the amount of P3,000,000.00 to DOH-CHD, Zamboanga Peninsula. Said fund was eventually released by the latter through Check Number 70241 dated 7 May 2004 to the Municipality of Panglima Tahil c/o Mayor Burahan during the 2004 election period. After its audit investigation, the SAT issued the Notice of Disallowance No. 07-022-101 (04) dated 14 March 2007 as it found the transaction violative of Section 261(w) of Batas Pambansa Blg. 881, or the Omnibus Election Code. The SAT named several persons to be held liable including Accountant III Violeta Magaso for certifying Box ""B"" of said disbursement voucher. Aggrieved, Pacatang and Magaso wrote a letter requesting for reconsideration of said Notice of Disallowance and praying that they be excluded from liability.","On 31 March 2009, the COA, thru the LSS, issued the assailed Decision No. 2009-163 denying the request for exclusion as persons liable of Mr. Wilfredo S. Pacatang and Violeta C. Magaso. The COA cited Section 19 of the Manual for Certificate of Settlement and Balance which states that public officers who certify to the necessity, legality and availability of funds/budgetary allotments, adequacy of documents, etc. involving the expenditure of funds or uses of government property shall be liable according to their respective certifications. According to the COA, it is evident that Magaso and Pacatang's participation as signatories of Box ""A"" and Box ""B"" of the disbursement voucher is material and significant enough to the consummation of the transaction. Without their signature, the transaction could not have been consummated and the funds could not have been transferred to the Municipality of Panglima Tahil.","The Supreme Court denied the petition. The Court held that Magaso alleged, and it was uncontested, that she did not receive a copy of the assailed Decision, thus said Decision has not yet attained finality. Nonetheless, the Petition must still be denied even if the Court resolves the case on the merits. The Court held that the COA correctly invoked Section 261(w) of the Omnibus Election Code as basis of its disallowance. Check No. 70241 is a device undertaking future delivery of money which is chargeable against public funds. The Court held that by certifying the propriety of the supporting documents of the disbursement voucher, Magaso attests to its entirety, which necessarily includes compliance with existing laws. The surrounding circumstances should have raised Magaso's suspicion, i.e., the timing of the disbursement during the 2004 election period and the instruction that the check be issued c/o Mayor Burahan. The Court noted that at present, similar to Magaso's case, accounting officers are required to attest that the supporting documents are in fact complete and proper, as opposed to ""appearing legal and proper."" The Court held that the palpable disregard of laws and applicable directives amounts to gross negligence. The Court held that Magaso is not the proper party to raise the due process violation on the part of the other signatories found liable under the Notice of Disallowance. The Court held that a perusal of the assailed decision of the COA shows that it adequately covered the relevant facts and law of the case, and thus informed the parties of how it was decided.","WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the present Petition is hereby DENIED. The Decision of the Commission on Audit in Legal Services Sector No. 2009-163 dated 31 March 2009 is hereby AFFIRMED. SO ORDERED."
G.R. No. 255509,"EDWIN D. RODRIGUEZ AND MICHAEL T. DEFENSOR, PETITIONERS, VS. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, MARIA JOSEFINA G. BELMONTE, GIAN CARLO G. SOTTO, WILFREDO B. REVILLAME, AND ELIZABETH A. DELARMENTE, RESPONDENTS.","Petitioners, Filipinos of legal age and residents of Quezon City, filed a Complaint Affidavit against respondents before the COMELEC. According to petitioners, respondents Belmonte, Sotto, and Delarmente, then candidates for Mayor, Vice-Mayor, and Representative of the First District of Quezon City, respectively, in the May 2019 National and Local Elections, along with respondent Revillame, a television personality, committed the offense of vote-buying during a campaign rally on 11 May 2019. Petitioners alleged that on May 11, 2019, respondents held a campaign rally along Roosevelt Avenue, Pitimini, Quezon City, and Willie Revillame was called on the stage. With Willie Revillame on the stage were the so-called ""wowowee girls"" who did a production number. While addressing the crowd, Willie Revillame, on multiple occasions, gave cash to the crowd and thereafter endorsed the respondents to the position they were running for. All respondents categorically denied the charge of vote-buying. Respondents-candidates Belmonte, Sotto and Delarmente explicitly denied having given money of any amount to voters/crowd during the event. But respondent Revillame admitted having given some small amount of cash to the audience but reasoning that it was part of the entertainment show and the fund was sourced out from his personal pocket and not from his co-respondents.","On 11 October 2019, the COMELEC Law Department issued a Memorandum on petitioners' Complaint Affidavit. Based on the allegations, supporting video footage, and photographs presented by petitioners, the Investigating Officer found that petitioners failed to establish, by allegations or evidence, that vote-buying took place and that respondents are probably guilty thereof. Petitioners' bare allegations in their Complaint Affidavit were declared as insufficient to establish probable cause. Petitioners failed to present corroborative testimony of any witness who may have personal knowledge about the giving of money. The video footage and the still photos showing Revillame giving cash to the audience, without testimonies of the person who took them, as well as the testimonies of the recipients of the money, are hearsay and have weak evidentiary value. The Law Department opined that the miting de avance, or campaign rally of respondents Belmonte, Sotto and Delarmente, and respondent Revillame's entertainment program were found to be two distinct and separate events. The COMELEC En Banc in its assailed Resolution No. 10625 dated 14 November 2019 adopted the Recommendation of the Law Department to dismiss the case against respondents for alleged violation of Section 261(a)(1) of the Omnibus Election Code for lack of probable cause. On 19 December 2019, petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration. The COMELEC En Banc again adopted the Recommendation of the Law Department in its assailed Minute Resolution No. 20-0268-14 dated 17 June 2020 denying the Motion for Reconsideration.","The Supreme Court dismissed the petition. The Court held that in issuing the challenged resolutions, the COMELEC En Banc did not commit grave abuse of discretion in dismissing petitioners' Complaint Affidavit for lack of probable cause. The Court held that petitioners' Complaint Affidavit, as filed, is insufficient to sustain their allegations of vote-buying under Section 261(a)(1) of the Omnibus Election Code. It is not ""supported by affidavits of complaining witnesses attesting to the offer or promise by or of the voter's acceptance of money or other consideration from the relatives, leaders or sympathizers of a candidate"" as required under Section 28 of the Electoral Reforms Law. The absence of supporting affidavits shows the frailty of petitioners' Complaint Affidavit and makes it vulnerable to dismissal. Submission of self-serving statements, uncorroborated audio and visual recordings, and photographs are not considered as direct, strong, convincing and indubitable evidence. The Court held that petitioners' allegation that respondents Belmonte, Sotto, and Delarmente were present when respondent Revillame gave cash to certain persons in the audience hastily concludes that the former were the givers. The Court held that the testimonies of the alleged vote-sellers are invaluable in proving the intent of the vote-buyer. Section 261(a) of the Omnibus Election Code explicitly states that intent is an element of the offenses of vote-buying and vote-selling. The Court held that vote-buying is inherently immoral as it destroys the sanctity of votes and prostitutes the election process.","WHEREFORE, the present petition is DISMISSED. Resolution No. 10625 dated 14 November 2019 and Minute Resolution No. 02-0268-14 of the Commission on Elections En Banc in E.O. Case No. 19-199 are AFFIRMED. SO ORDERED."
G.R. No. 214223,"REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, PETITIONER, VS. SPOUSES JOVITO AND KATHLEEN BERCEDE, RESPONDENTS.","In their Petition for Reconstitution dated June 12, 2008, respondents claimed that they are the owners of a 345 square meter parcel of land denominated as Lot No. 199 of the Cadastral Survey of Carcar, situated in Barangay Poblacion II, Carcar City, Cebu, which is covered by OCT No. 4275. Respondents alleged that they purchased the property from Kathleen's parents, Spouses Edgar Paraz and Drusilla V. Paraz, via a Deed of Absolute Sale executed on June 5, 2008. Edgar and Drusilla, in turn, bought the property from Kathleen's grandmother, Lourdes Paraz, through an Absolute Deed of Sale dated March 23, 1987. Lourdes acquired the property from the heirs of the original owners, the spouses Teofisto Alesna and Faustina Esmeña, by way of an extra-judicial settlement of the estate with a deed of absolute sale dated August 5, 1975. Praying for the reconstitution of OCT No. 4275, respondents averred that the original copy of the said title, which should have been on file with the Office of the Register of Deeds of the Province of Cebu, as well as the owner's duplicate copy, have both been lost and destroyed. Respondents presented a photocopy of OCT No. 4275, Tax Declaration No. 02434, tax clearance, the extra-judicial settlement with deed of absolute sale and succeeding deeds of sale, and a Certification issued on June 3, 2008 from the Land Registration Authority stating that the certificate of title covering Lot No. 199 issued in the name of Teofisto and Faustina is not available, as it has either been burned or lost during the last World War. In an Opposition dated July 3, 2009, petitioner sought to dismiss the Petition for Reconstitution, contending that the same should comply with the mandatory requirements provided under Republic Act No. (RA) 26, as amended.","In a Judgment dated September 16, 2009, the RTC ruled in respondents' favor, and accordingly, directed the Register of Deeds of the province of Cebu to reconstitute the original copy of OCT No. 4275 in the name of spouses Teofisto and Faustina and to furnish respondents with a copy thereof. Undaunted, petitioner appealed to the CA. Petitioner also put in issue the supposed intercalations and erasures on the photocopy of OCT No. 4275, including the handwritten and allegedly superimposed number 4275. In a Decision dated October 29, 2013, the CA affirmed the RTC. The CA held that the basis of the reconstitution — the photocopy of OCT No. 4275 — falls under the category ""any other document"" as mentioned in Section 2 (f) of RA 26 as one possible source of reconstitution. Further, the CA rejected the conclusion drawn by petitioner that the photocopy of OCT No. 4275 is fake and spurious. Furthermore, the CA pointed out that the contents of the photocopy of OCT No. 4275 all coincide with the other documents on record. Finally, the CA held that the strict and mandatory requirements laid down under Sections 12 and 13 of RA 26 have been substantially complied with by respondents.","The Supreme Court granted the petition. The Court held that the judicial reconstitution of a Torrens title under RA 26 means the restoration in the original form and condition of a lost or destroyed Torrens certificate attesting the title of a person to registered land. The Court held that both courts a quo did not make any categorical ruling on whether respondents have established that they failed to secure or find the documents mentioned in paragraphs (a) to (e) in Section 2 to justify their resort to a photocopy of OCT No. 4275. The Court held that respondents' only basis for seeking reconstitution of their title is that it was lost and destroyed based on the June 3, 2008 Certification issued by the LRA. The Court held that it is significant to note that the June 3, 2008 Certification issued by the LRA refers only to the loss or destruction of the copy of OCT No. 4275 on file with the Register of Deeds. The Court held that the unavailability or loss of the source documents listed higher in the list than the one being offered as the source for a petition for reconstitution must be proved by clear and convincing evidence. The Court held that a petitioner must strictly follow and comply with the special requirements and the mode of procedure prescribed by RA 26, as substantial compliance with the jurisdictional requirements is not enough because the acquisition of jurisdiction over a reconstitution case is hinged on strict compliance with the requirements of the law. The Court laid down guidelines for the judicial reconstitution of original or transfer certificates of title where the source document upon which the petition for reconstitution is based falls under either Sections 2 (f) or 3 (f) of RA 26. The Court held that close scrutiny of the record shows that the Petition for Reconstitution has NOT complied with the requisites enumerated under the guidelines.","WHEREFORE, the Petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated October 29, 2013 and the Resolution dated August 28, 2014 rendered by the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CEB-CV No. 03344 are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The Petition for Reconstitution filed by the respondents spouses Jovito and Kathleen Bercede before the Regional Trial Court of Cebu City, Branch 6, is hereby DISMISSED. SO ORDERED."
G.R. No. 237322,"CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION, PETITIONER, VS. PO1 GILBERT FUENTES, RESPONDENT.","On September 29, 2004, at around 8:00 p.m., Oliver Pingol was on his way home from an off-track betting station in Obrero, Manila on board a maroon pick-up truck traversing along C. Name corner Bayani Streets, Caloocan City. He was with his friends. During the same occasion, PO1 Fuentes, a member of the Philippine National Police, was seated at the back of a tricycle on his way home from duty. While driving along C. Name corner Bayani Streets in Caloocan City, the pick-up truck suddenly encountered a mechanical problem, which caused a traffic jam. The tricycle stopped in front of the pick-up truck. After Oliver fixed the pick-up truck, he started its engine, and when the truck started to move, it almost hit the tricycle in front. PO1 Fuentes instructed the tricycle driver to stop, and after alighting therefrom, he confronted Oliver, who had also alighted from the truck. An altercation ensued which eventually led to Oliver's fatal shooting. Oliver's two companions succeeded in taking PO1 Fuentes' firearm and pointed the same at him. The two companions pulled the trigger twice, but the firearm misfired. PO1 Fuentes ran away and sought for assistance, while Oliver was rushed to the Our Lady of Grace Hospital in Caloocan City, and later transferred to the Chinese General Hospital, where he died after about one hour. Immediately, Nestor G. Pingol, Oliver's brother, filed an administrative case against PO1 Fuentes for grave misconduct before the National Police Commission's Inspection, Monitoring, and Investigation Services.","In a Decision dated March 18, 2011, the National Police Commission found PO1 Fuentes guilty of grave misconduct, aggravated by the use of a Philippine National Police-issued firearm, and meted the penalty of dismissal from the service. PO1 Fuentes moved for reconsideration, but the National Police Commission denied it in a Resolution dated August 30, 2013. Aggrieved, PO1 Fuentes appealed to the Commission, which rendered its Decision dismissing PO1 Fuentes' appeal and affirming the National Police Commission decision. PO1 Fuentes moved for reconsideration, but the Commission denied it in a Resolution. Undaunted, PO1 Fuentes filed a Petition for Review before the Court of Appeals under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court. In a Decision dated February 1, 2018, the Court of Appeals granted the Petition, and reversed the Commission's earlier Decision. The Commission ruled that while Oliver's death was regrettable, PO1 Fuentes unintentionally killed Oliver.","The Supreme Court granted the Petition. The Court held that the Commission, generally has standing to bring an appeal before the Court as an aggrieved party in cases involving the reversal or modification of its decisions or resolutions. The Court held that being a central personnel agency is at the heart of the Commission's creation. The Court held that the Commission cannot thoroughly perform its constitutional mandate of being a central personnel agency without its power to discipline its officials and employees. The Court declared rules regarding the Commission's standing to bring an appeal before the Court. The Court held that PO1 Fuentes' act of drawing his service firearm in a situation that did not call for it is an act of misconduct. The Court held that under no circumstance should PO1 Fuentes have had any use for his service firearm, considering that a mere traffic incident transpired. The Court held that as a member of the Philippine National Police armed with sufficient training and expertise, PO1 Fuentes was in the best position to know that in no way can a traffic incident justify the use of a firearm. The Court held that PO1 Fuentes' act of drawing his service firearm in a situation that did not call for it and shooting Pingol, which eventually caused Pingol's death, is a deliberate violation of a rule of law. The Court held that PO1 Fuentes must be held guilty of grave misconduct, punishable by dismissal from service.","WHEREFORE, the Petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated February 1, 2018 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 146854 is REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The Decision dated March 31, 2016 and the Resolution dated July 5, 2016 of the Commission finding respondent Police Officer 1 Gilbert Fuentes guilty of grave misconduct and meting upon him the penalty of dismissal from service with accessory penalties are REINSTATED and AFFIRMED. SO ORDERED."
G.R. No. 258424,"PHILIPPINE HEALTH INSURANCE CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON AUDIT, REPRESENTED BY ITS CHAIRPERSON, MICHAEL G. AGUINALDO, RESPONDENT.","On several dates in 2012-2013, the COA-Corporate Government Sector Cluster 6 issued several notices of disallowance pertaining to allowances and benefits granted to employees and job order contractors of the PhilHealth Regional Office No. VI during the years 2012-2013. The allowances and benefits were disallowed for the following reasons: (1) lack of legal basis, (2) being irregular or excessive, (3) failure to submit PhilHealth's Corporate Operating Budget for the calendar year 2012, duly reviewed by the Department of Budget and Management; and (4) lack of authority from the Office of the President. As a result of the disallowance, approving officers, certifying officers, and recipients were found liable under the subject NDs. The PhilHealth Regional Office VI employees lodged an appeal with the COA-Corporate Government Sector Cluster 6. However, the same affirmed the subject NDs in its Decision No. 2014-016 dated November 14, 2014. Aggrieved, the PhilHealth Regional Office VI employees filed a petition for review with the COA Commission Proper mainly arguing that the disbursements were proper based on the fiscal autonomy of PhilHealth pursuant to Republic Act No. 7875, the supposed confirmation of PhilHealth's fiscal autonomy by then-President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, and good faith on the part of the recipients.","The COA upheld the disallowance, and held the approving and certifying officers solidarily liable for the amounts, but exempted the recipients from returning the amounts they received. A motion for reconsideration was filed where the PhilHealth Regional Office VI employees additionally asserted that the officers should likewise be absolved from refunding the amounts received. In its Resolution, the COA denied the motion for reconsideration and ordered the recipients to refund the amounts they received, in addition to the approving and certifying officers being solidarily liable for the same.","The Supreme Court partially granted the petition. The Court held that the COA did not commit grave abuse of discretion in upholding the notices of disallowance, as the said Decision and the Resolution were based on prevailing law, rules, and jurisprudence. The Court held that this Court has already settled the issue of the limits of the fiscal independence of PhilHealth and its claimed exemption from Republic Act No. 6758 and that PhilHealth is bound by the provision of Presidential Decree No. 1597 which requires the approval of the President in granting allowance, honoraria, and other fringe benefits. The Court held that lacking the requisite presidential approval, the disapproval of the subject benefits and allowances that were based solely on the invocation of PhilHealth's fiscal independence and issued by its officers is in line with prevailing laws, rules, and jurisprudence. The Court held that PhilHealth's employees are entitled to longevity pay in view of the curative effect of Republic Act No. 11223 which declared PhilHealth personnel as public health workers. However, the Court held that the grant of WESA or subsistence allowance was granted sweepingly without showing that the qualifications had been met and thus the disallowance is justified. The Court held that the recipients are liable to return the amounts they received. The Court held that the certifying officers cannot be held solidarily liable with the recipients for the amounts pertaining to the disallowed benefits and allowances. The Court directed the COA to identify in a clear, certain, and complete manner, the specific PhilHealth members and officials who approved the disallowed benefits and allowances covered in the subject Notices of Disallowance.","WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Petition for Certiorari of Philippine Health Insurance Corporation is PARTIALLY GRANTED. The Decision in COA Decision No. 2019-264 dated June 25, 2019 and the Resolution in COA Decision 2021-262 dated October 7, 2021 are AFFIRMED WITH MODIFICATION, as follows: (1) The disallowance of longevity pay in the amount of PHP 126,039.00 in Notice of Disallowance No. 12-051-100-(11) is REVERSED and SET ASIDE; (2) The disallowances of various benefits and allowances covered by Notice of Disallowance Nos. 12-030-100-(11), 12-032-100-(11), 12-048-100, 12-049-100-(11), 12-050-100-(11), 2013-001-100(12), 2013-002-100(12), 2013-003-100(12), 2013-004-100(12), 2013-005-100(12), 2013-006-100(12), and 2013-007-100(12) are AFFIRMED; (3) The recipients of the benefits and allowances pertaining to the disallowed NDs, including any approving or certifying officers who received portions of the disallowed amounts, are ORDERED to REFUND the amount they received in connection therewith; (4) Certifying officers are ABSOLVED from solidary liability for the disallowed amounts; and (5) The Commission on Audit is DIRECTED to identify the specific PhilHealth Board members and officials who approved the disallowed benefits and allowances.

G.R. No. 244587,"AMIL P. SULA, GASPAR S. ASI, AND HUSSIEN K. MALIG, SR., PETITIONERS, VS. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, IN ITS OFFICIAL CAPACITY AS THE NATIONAL PLEBISCITE BOARD OF CANVASSERS, RESPONDENT.

MAYOR FRANCES CYNTHIA GUIANI-SAYADI, PETITIONER-INTERVENOR, VS. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, IN ITS OFFICIAL CAPACITY AS THE NATIONAL PLEBISCITE BOARD OF CANVASSERS, RESPONDENT.","On July 21, 2018, the Organic Law was passed into law. The law provides for the determination of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region's territorial jurisdiction through majority votes cast in a plebiscite. On December 13, 2018, the Commission on Elections promulgated Resolution No. 10464 scheduling the conduct of a plebiscite for the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, Isabela City, Basilan, and Cotabato City on January 21, 2019. On January 21, 2019, the plebiscite was conducted in Cotabato City. Cotabato City's Certificate of Canvass of Votes garnered 38,682 ""YES"" votes, while the ""NO"" votes got 24,994. However, the same Certificate stated that the total number of registered voters who actually voted was only 39,027. The Commission on Elections ordered for a retabulation of the votes cast in Cotabato City. On January 25, 2019, the Commission on Elections officially proclaimed the ratification of the Organic Law and the inclusion of Cotabato City in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. On March 1, 2019, petitioners filed a Petition before the Court assailing the Commission on Elections' conduct of the January 21, 2019 plebiscite and subsequent announcement of the Organic Law's ratification. Petitioners alleged that the Commission on Elections failed to comply with the statutory requirement that the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region's establishment shall only take effect once the Organic Law is ratified by a majority of the votes cast in a plebiscite. They also claimed that the question posed in the plebiscite was misleading, and that the plebiscite was held beyond the prescribed 150-day period. Further, petitioners manifested that there were massive irregularities shown through discrepancies in the Certificate of Canvass of Votes.","Respondent Commission on Elections asserted that it did not commit grave abuse of discretion when it proclaimed that the plebiscite resulted in the ratification of the Bangsamoro Organic Law. It maintained that the plebiscites were within the period provided by the law, as the law became effective on September 10, 2018, making the January 21 and February 6, 2019 plebiscites within the 150-day period. It contended that the question posed to Cotabato City during the plebiscite was compliant with the Bangsamoro Organic Law's provisions. It denied that there were massive irregularities in the conduct of the plebiscite, and added that the discrepancies in the Certificate of Canvass of Votes were reconciled during the retabulation.","The Supreme Court dismissed the petition for lack of merit. The Court held that the plebiscites held on January 21 and February 6, 2019 were both within the 150-day period provided by law. The Court held that the Commission on Elections, as the constitutional body mandated to enforce and administer all laws and regulations relative to the conduct of elections and plebiscites, has the authority to modify or alter the dates of the plebiscite. The Court held that respondent Commission on Elections complied with the wording of the Organic Law in constructing the question for the plebiscite. The Court held that only those directly affected by the abolition of the original Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao were asked about ratification of the Organic Law, while contiguous areas including Cotabato City were asked whether they desired to be part of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region. The Court held that the allegations of irregularities surrounding the plebiscite are factual in nature and would require admission and examination of evidence before the Commission on Elections. The Court held that allegations of fraud and irregularities in the conduct of a plebiscite cannot be the subject of a special civil action for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court. The Court held that the discrepancies in the Certificate of Canvass of Votes were corrected upon retabulation. The Court held that allegations of fraud, violence, or intimidation must be supported by conclusive or convincing evidence, and petitioners failed to offer evidence demonstrating the presence of manipulation or irregularities beyond the lone Certificate of Canvass of Votes.","ACCORDINGLY, the instant Petition for Certiorari, Prohibition, and Mandamus with Application for a Temporary Restraining Order and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction and/or Preliminary Mandatory Injunction and Petition-for-Intervention are DISMISSED for lack of merit. Petitioners' prayer for the issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction restraining the Commission on Elections from implementing the Bangsamoro Organic Law with respect to Cotabato City is likewise DENIED. SO ORDERED."
A.M. No. P-14-3248 (Formerly A.M. No. 14-6-66-MTC),"OFFICE OF THE COURT ADMINISTRATOR, COMPLAINANT, VS. VIRGILIO M. FORTALEZA AND NORBERTA R. FORTALEZA, RESPONDENTS.","The audit of the books of the Municipal Trial Court of Catanauan, Quezon (MTC) led to the Financial Audit Team (Team) of the Court Management Office, Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) Team's discovery that Virgilio M. Fortaleza (Virgilio), alone and in certain instances in cooperation with his spouse Norberta R. Fortaleza (Norberta), misappropriated a total of P779,643.15 from the various judiciary funds under Virgilio's control, particularly the following: Fiduciary Fund, Judiciary Development Fund, Special Allowance for the Judiciary Fund, Clerk of Court General Fund, Mediation Fund, and Sheriffs Trust Fund. During the Team's exit conference with the MTC's Acting Presiding Judge and Norberta, Norberta admitted all the anomalies which the Team discovered. The Team found that Norberta tampered with a total of 59 official receipts. Virgilio did not report the Fiduciary Fund collections recorded in the 59 official receipts, in the total amount of P380,500.00, to the Revenue Section, Accounting Division, Financial Management Office of the OCA. Virgilio and Norberta reported total Fiduciary Fund collections in the amount of P2,396,557.00 from March 1996 to December 28, 2012. However, a total amount of P87,800.00 from this collection was not deposited to any of the MTC's bank accounts. The Team discovered that there were several unauthorized withdrawals of the cash bonds posted in criminal cases pending before the MTC. The signatures of the bondsmen were forged in the acknowledgment receipts submitted to the bank. The court orders presented to the bank were not actually signed by the presiding judge and were merely stamped as ""ORIGINAL SIGNED."" The team found 17 tampered official receipts representing marriage solemnization fees and bond fees. Virgilio failed to collect cash bond and marriage solemnization fees, which are mandatory payments due to the MTC. Virgilio also did not collect the required solemnization fees in 57 marriages and the required clearance fee for 70 court clearances. The Team found that Virgilio and Norberta tampered with four official receipts representing fines and bond fees in the total amount of P30,600.00. Virgilio tampered an official receipt representing the payment of a court fine in the amount of P22,000.00. Virgilio failed to deposit the amount of P3,500.00 to the MTC's Mediation Fund. Virgilio served as the MTC's Process Server from December 3, 2010 to December 27, 2012 and accumulated Sheriffs Trust Fund collections in the total amount of P17,200.00 which was never deposited in the MTC's bank account.","In its Memorandum dated December 20, 2016, the OCA recommended that: respondent spouses be found guilty of grave misconduct, gross neglect of duty, and serious dishonesty; respondent Norberta be ordered dismissed from government service with cancellation of civil service eligibility, forfeiture of retirement benefits and other privileges, except accrued leave credits, if any, and with prejudice to reemployment in any branch or instrumentality of the government; considering that respondent Virgilio had already retired from the service, that the penalty of cancellation of eligibility, forfeiture of retirement benefits and other privileges, except accrued leave credits, if any, and with prejudice to re-employment in any branch or instrumentality of the government be instead imposed on him; and respondent Virgilio be directed to restitute the incurred cash shortages in the total amount of P779,643.15.","The Supreme Court found that the respondents failed to meet the stringent standards governing the conduct of employees in the judiciary. The Court found that the OCA correctly concluded that Respondent Virgilio should be penalized for gross misconduct, serious dishonesty, and gross neglect of duty. The Court held that the findings of the Team and the evidence on record only warrant that Norberta be charged and penalized for gross misconduct and serious dishonesty for specific violations where she was found to have performed, or assisted Virgilio in the performance of, unlawful acts. The Court ruled that the respondents are liable for gross misconduct and serious dishonesty for tampering with official receipts, failure to remit collections, double withdrawal and unauthorized withdrawal of cash bonds. The Court held that Virgilio is solely liable for gross misconduct and serious dishonesty for tampering with an official receipt, failure to deposit amounts to the Mediation Fund and Sheriff's Trust Fund, and unauthorized withdrawal from the Fiduciary Fund account. The Court held that Virgilio should be held liable for gross negligence for failure to collect required fees and cash shortages which remain unexplained. The Court held that given the gravity of the offenses which Norberta committed, the penalty of dismissal from the service should be imposed. The Court held that Virgilio's retirement benefits are forfeited and required Virgilio to restitute the total amount of P779,643.15.","WHEREFORE, Norberta R. Fortaleza is found GUILTY of gross misconduct and serious dishonesty. She is ordered DISMISSED from the service with forfeiture of all retirement benefits, except accrued leave credits. She is also disqualified from being re-employed in the government, including government-owned and controlled corporations. Virgilio M. Fortaleza is found GUILTY of gross misconduct, serious dishonesty, and gross neglect of duty. His retirement benefits, except accrued leave credits, are declared FORFEITED. He is likewise disqualified from being re-employed in the government, including government-owned and controlled corporations. Finally, Respondent Virgilio Fortaleza is ordered to RESTITUTE the incurred cash shortages in the total amount of P779,643.15 to the Municipal Trial Court of Catanauan, Quezon, within 30 days from notice. The case against the Respondent Virgilio M. Fortaleza is referred to the Office of the Ombudsman for appropriate action. SO ORDERED."

STEHMEIER, ROSE ANA G. VICTA, NOEMI R. CRESENCIO AND OTHER FEMALE FLIGHT ATTENDANTS OF PHILIPPINE AIRLINES, PETITIONERS, VS. PHILIPPINE AIRLINES, INC., RESPONDENT.","Petitioners are members of Flight Attendants and Stewards Association of the Philippines (FASAP), the sole and exclusive bargaining representative of Philippine Airlines, Inc. (PAL) flight attendants, stewards, and pursers hired on different dates prior to November 22, 1996. On July 11, 2001, PAL and FASAP entered into a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) incorporating the terms and conditions of employment of cabin attendants for the years 2000 to 2005 (PAL-FASAP 2000-2005 CBA). On July 29, 2004, petitioners filed a Petition for Declaratory Relief enjoining PAL from enforcing Section 144(A) of the PAL-FASAP 2000-2005 CBA. They sought the nullity of Section 144(A) for discriminating against female flight attendants in violation of the Constitution, the Labor Code, and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. Section 144(A) provided that compulsory retirement shall be fifty-five (55) for females and sixty (60) for males. In its May 22, 2015 Decision, the trial court granted the petition for declaratory relief and declared Section 144(A) of the PAL-FASAP 2000-2005 CBA null and void for being discriminatory. The trial court held that Section 144(A) violates the Constitution, the Labor Code, and the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women for being discriminatory against women flight attendants. The trial court ruled that petitioners' rights cannot be bargained away and found that PAL failed to show any difference between male and female cabin attendants which would justify the implementation of the assailed provision. In a May 31, 2018 Decision, the Court of Appeals reversed and set aside the decision of the Regional Trial Court, and ruled in favor of PAL. The Court of Appeals ruled that since FASAP voluntarily assented to the questioned provision, there is a reasonable presumption that it is beneficial and acceptable to its members. The Court of Appeals ruled that the questioned provision is a valid and binding undertaking, as there was nothing illegal in the retirement clause warranting its nullification.",The Regional Trial Court granted the petition for declaratory relief and declared Section 144(A) of the PAL-FASAP 2000-2005 CBA null and void for being discriminatory. The Court of Appeals reversed the trial court's decision.,"The Supreme Court granted the Petition. The Court held that the fundamental equality of women and men before the law is enshrined and guaranteed by the Constitution, statutes, and international convention where the Philippines is a signatory. The Court held that respondent was not able to provide any reasonable basis for differentiating the compulsory retirement age for female cabin attendants at 55 years old and the male cabin attendants at 60 years old. The Court held that the Court of Appeals' reasoning supports the view that the compulsory retirement age for female cabin attendants was made lower than their male counterparts on the mere basis of their being women, which is discriminatory against women. The Court held that there is no proof that female cabin attendants, between 55 to 59 years old, do not have the necessary strength to open emergency doors, the agility to attend to passengers in cramped working conditions, and the stamina to withstand grueling flight schedules as compared with their male counterparts. The Court held that petitioners were able to prove that the enforcement of Section 144(A) of the PAL-FASAP 2000-2005 CBA is discriminatory against them, and thus prohibited by the Constitution, laws, and international conventions. The Court held that petitioners substantiated that they were discriminated upon when they were forced to retire at 55 years old while their male counterparts were compulsory retired at 60 years old. The Court held that the compulsory retirement provision in Section 144(A) of the PAL-FASAP 2000-2005 CBA is repugnant to the Constitution, the Labor Code, the Magna Carta of Women, and the CEDAW. The Court held that the said provision was not voluntarily agreed upon by petitioners. The Court held that contracts and its stipulations, whose cause, object, or purpose is contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order, or public policy, are void, thus Section 144(A) of the PAL-FASAP 2000-2005 CBA is void for being contrary to the Constitution, laws, international convention, and public policy.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review is GRANTED. The May 31, 2018 Decision and November 19, 2018 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 107085 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

G.R. No. 255668,"JEREMY REYES Y COLLANO, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","This case stemmed from four (4) Informations filed before the RTC charging Reyes with Illegal Possession of Firearms and Ammunition, as defined and penalized under Section 28 (a) in relation to Section 28 (e)(l) of RA 10591, and Reyes and accused Lorenz Christian Alano with Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs, and Alano with Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs and Illegal Possession of Equipment, Instrument, Apparatus, and Other Paraphernalia for Dangerous Drugs. The prosecution alleged that on March 25, 2017, pursuant to a tip of a confidential asset that a certain ""Jer Jer"" (later identified as Reyes), was engaged in selling drugs, members of the Sta. Maria Police Station organized a buy-bust operation with PO1 Genesis Tolentino as the poseur buyer. When the team arrived, they frisked Reyes and recovered from him the buy-bust money and an improvised gun loaded with ammunition. Upon subsequent verification with the Firearms and Explosives Office of the National Police Commission, it was discovered that Reyes had no authority to carry or possess any firearms, and that he was not a licensed firearm holder of any kind and caliber. For his part, Reyes denied the charges against him and claimed that during that time, he was at the house of Alano to invite him to attend a bible study. Thereafter, five armed men forcibly entered the house and ordered them to lie face down on the ground while they searched for marijuana. The police asset sealed a plastic sachet of marijuana and placed it on a table. Reyes claimed that he heard someone say that a bullet was found, after which, the police asset hit him with a belt, cursed him, and asked him if there was a gun in the house.","In a Joint Judgment dated September 7, 2018, the RTC found Reyes guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Illegal Possession of Firearms and Ammunition. The RTC ruled that the prosecution was able to prove all the elements of the crime charged since it was established that Reyes was found in possession of an improvised gun loaded with ammunition, and that based on the Certification dated June 19, 2017 issued by the Firearms and Explosive Office, he was not a licensed or registered firearm holder of any kind or caliber. The RTC acquitted Reyes of the other charges for failure of the prosecution to prove the fourth link in the chain of custody over the seized items. In a Decision dated July 10, 2020, the CA affirmed the RTC ruling in toto. It held that there was a valid search incidental to a lawful arrest as it was made following a buy-bust operation and that the police officers were justified in searching Reyes of any concealed weapon that he may use to facilitate his escape.","The Supreme Court denied the petition. The Court held that the prosecution was able to establish beyond reasonable doubt all the elements of the crime of Illegal Possession of Firearms and Ammunition as it was proven that petitioner was in possession of an improvised gun loaded with ammunition and the Certification issued by the Firearms and Explosives Office revealed that Reyes was not a licensed/registered firearm holder of any kind or caliber. The Court held that the search made by the apprehending officers on Reyes, being contemporaneous to a valid warrantless arrest, incidental to a legitimate buy-bust operation was legal, and thereby making all the items seized therefrom admissible in evidence. The Court held that the failure of the prosecution to prove compliance with the chain of custody rule for illegal drugs under Section 21 of RA 9165 does not amount to failure to prove the crime of illegal possession of firearms and ammunition, if the latter charge does not go into the very transaction for which it was discovered. The Court held that the application of the chain of custody rule under Section 21 of RA 9165 has not been extended to other objects seized. The Court held that if the proffered evidence is unique, readily identifiable, and relatively resistant to change, that foundation need only consist of testimony by a witness with knowledge that the evidence is what the proponent claims. The Court modified the sentence and sentenced Reyes to suffer the penalty of imprisonment for an indeterminate period of eight (8) years and one (1) day of prision mayor, as minimum, to ten (10) years, eight (8) months, and one (1) day of prision mayor, as maximum.","ACCORDINGLY, the instant petition is DENIED. The Decision dated July 10, 2020 and the Resolution dated February 4, 2021 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 42825 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. Petitioner Jeremy Reyes y Collano is hereby found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Illegal Possession of Firearms and Ammunition, as defined and penalized under Section 28 (a) in relation to Section 28 (e) (1) of Republic Act No. 10591, otherwise known as the ""Comprehensive Firearms and Ammunition Regulation Act."" In addition, he is sentenced to suffer the penalty of imprisonment for an indeterminate period of eight (8) years and one (1) day of prision mayor, as minimum, to ten (10) years, eight (8) months, and one (1) day of prision mayor, as maximum.
