"G.R. No. 260434, January 31, 2024","NOW TELECOM COMPANY, INC., PETITIONER, VS. NATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION, RESPONDENT.","On January 8, 2018, the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) issued Memorandum Order (M.O.) No. 001, series of 2018, entitled, ""Policy Guidelines for the Entry of a New Major Player in the Public Telecommunications Market,"" in compliance with the directive of then President Rodrigo R. Duterte (President Duterte) to fast-track the entry of a new major player (NMP) to compete in the Philippine telecommunications market.

The said memorandum order provides that the NMP applicant must (1) possess a valid congressional telecommunications franchise, and the NTC shall issue the appropriate licenses/authorities to the winner after the bid; (2) not be a subsidiary, affiliate, or have any corporate or financial interest with the Globe Group or PLDT Group of Companies; and (3) have a written and binding commitment from a foreign joint venture company, if applicable.[5] It also provides that the applicant must have the highest committed investment for the first five years, and such commitment must be secured with a performance bond.[6] The NMP shall be assigned radio frequency bands that are available for assignment.[7] The NTC was directed to promulgate the memorandum circular containing the Terms of Reference (TOR) for the selection and assignment of radio frequencies for the purpose.[8]

On April 6, 2018, former President Duterte issued Administrative Order (A.O.) No. 11, series of 2018, creating an Oversight Committee to assist the NTC in formulating the TOR, oversee its compliance, ensure timely implementation, and exercise such incidental powers as may be necessary.[9]

After the conduct of public hearing, and pursuant to the foregoing, the NTC promulgated the subject Circular on September 20, 2018.[10] The Oversight Committee and the NTC decided that the best way to select the NMP was through a public, open, and competitive selection process.[11]

Thereafter, the DICT and the NTC published the timeline for the implementation of the subject Circular.[12] The timeline stated that the said Circular shall take effect on October 6, 2018; the Invitation to Bid shall be published on October 7, 2018; the issuance of the selection documents shall be on October 8, 2018; and the submission and opening of bids shall be on November 7, 2018.[13]

On October 8, 2018, NOW Telecom filed before the RTC a Complaint for Injunction[14] with application for an ex-parte temporary restraining order (TRO), 20-day TRO, and/or WPI against the NTC.[15]

In the said Complaint, NOW Telecom challenged the following provisions of the subject Circular as void for being excessive, confiscatory, and violative of due process:
(1)	
Section 6.2(j), which requires bidders to post a Participation Security with a face value of PHP 700,000,000.00 equivalent to 0.5% of the minimum Capital and Operational Expenditure at the end of the Commitment Period;
(2)	
Section 11, which requires the NMP to post a Performance Security in the amount of 10% of the remaining Capital and Operational Expenditure; and
(3)	
Section 8, which provides for a non-refundable filing fee of PHP 10,000,000.00 for appeal to the NTC En Banc against the decisions of the Selection Committee.[16]
NOW Telecom likewise challenged Section 10.1 of the subject Circular, which requires the submission of the Business and Roll-out plans after the NMP is determined, as circumventing the prohibition on substantial variation in bids and contracts.[17] It also assailed Section 3, which provides for the covered and contingent radio frequencies to be assigned to the NMP, for violating its alleged vested right to be allocated radio frequencies as holder of a legislative and administrative franchise to operate a telecommunications facility.[18]

Hence, NOW Telecom prayed that the NTC be enjoined from enforcing the aforementioned provisions of the subject Circular. It further prayed for the issuance of TRO and WPI pending the resolution of the Complaint.[19]

In support of its prayer for TRO and WPI, NOW Telecom argued that (1) it has a clear legal right considering its legislative and administrative franchise; (2) it is entitled to the relief sought, i.e., enjoining the NTC from enforcing the vague, oppressive, and confiscatory provisions of the Subject Circular; and (3) it has established the extreme urgency on account of the timeline provided by the NTC. NOW Telecom further argued that the selection process for the NMP is not an infrastructure project that is covered by the prohibition against injunctions under Republic Act No. 8975.[20]

The NTC opposed NOW Telecom 's prayer for injunctive writs. Thereafter, the RTC conducted summary hearing on the application for TRO.[21]

In its Order[22] dated October 12, 2018, the RTC denied NOW Telecom's prayer for TRO. The RTC then directed the parties to submit their respective memoranda on the propriety of the issuance of a WPI.[23]","This case involves the Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] (Petition) filed by petitioner NOW Telecom Company, Inc. (NOW Telecom) assailing the Decision[2] (assailed Decision) and the Resolution[3] (assailed Resolution) of the Court of Appeals (CA), which affirmed the Order[4] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC).

In the said Order, the RTC denied NOW Telecom 's application for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction (WPI) against respondent National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) to restrain the implementation of certain provisions of NTC Memorandum Circular (M.C.) No. 09-09-2018 entitled, ""Rules and Regulations on the Selection Process for a New Major Player in the Philippine Telecommunications Market"" (subject Circular).","The Petition is denied.

NOW Telecom's application for
injunctive relief has been rendered
moot and academic

At the outset, it is worth noting that, during the pendency of this case, Mindanao Islamic Telephone Company, Inc. (MISLATEL) was selected as the NMP by virtue of the subject Circular, and was accordingly issued a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN).[35]

It is an established rule that injunction will not issue to restrain the performance of an act already done, or to prevent events that have already happened.[36] When the act sought to be prevented by injunction has already been performed or completed, ""nothing more can be enjoined or restrained; a writ of injunction then becomes moot and academic, and the court, by mere issuance of the writ, can no longer stop or undo the act. To do so would violate the sole purpose of a prohibitive injunction, that is, to preserve the status quo.[37]

In this case, the act sought to be restrained by NOW Telecom has already been done. The actual implementation of the selection process of the NMP pursuant to the subject Circular, and the resulting assignment of the allocated radio frequencies for the NMP to MISLATEL have rendered NOW Telecom's prayer for injunctive relief moot and academic. Accordingly, NOW Telecom's application for WPI should be denied.

Lower courts cannot issue an
injunctive writ against the selection of
NMP

Section 3 of Republic Act No. 8975 prohibits lower courts from issuing a TRO or WPI against the government for the conduct of the bidding or awarding of contract or project of the National Government, thus:
SEC. 3. Prohibition on the Issuance of Temporary Restraining Orders, Preliminary Injunctions and Preliminary Mandatory Injunctions. - No court, except the Supreme Court, shall issue any temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction or preliminary mandatory injunction against the government, or any of its subdivisions, officials or any person or entity, whether public or private, acting under the government's direction, to restrain, prohibit or compel the following acts:
(a) Acquisition, clearance and development of the right-of-way and/or site or location of any national government project;

(b) Bidding or awarding of contract/project of the national government as defined under Section 2 hereof;

(c) Commencement, prosecution, execution, implementation, operation of any such contract or project;

(d) Termination or rescission of any such contract/project; and

(e) The undertaking or authorization of any other lawful activity necessary for such contract/project.
This prohibition shall apply in all cases, disputes or controversies instituted by a private party, including but not limited to cases filed by bidders or those claiming to have rights through such bidders involving such contract/project. This prohibition shall not apply when the matter is of extreme urgency involving a constitutional issue, such that unless a temporary restraining order is issued, grave injustice and irreparable injury will arise. The applicant shall file a bond, in an amount to be fixed by the court, which bond shall accrue in favor of the government if the court should finally decide that the applicant was not entitled to the relief sought.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari filed by petitioner NOW Telecom Company, Inc., is hereby DENIED. The Decision dated May 24, 2021 and the Resolution dated April 12, 2022 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 158237 are AFFIRMED."
"G.R. No. 255180, January 31, 2024","CONRADO FERNANDO, JR. PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","The case stemmed from an Information[5] dated July 30, 2007, that charged petitioner with the crime of Estafa, defined and penalized under Article 315 (2) (a) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC). The accusatory portion of the Information reads:
That on or about the 1st day of August, 2006 in Quezon City, Philippines, the said accused, did, then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously defraud one DOROLIZA REYROSO DIN, in the following manner, to wit: the accused, by means of false manifestations and fraudulent representations which he made to the complainant, to the effect that he could facilitate the processing of the pertinent papers of the promo package which the accused offered to the complainant in a four (4) day tour in Hongkong Disneyland, for the amount of P37,400.00, Philippine Currency, induced and succeeded in inducing said complainant to give and deliver, as in fact Doroliza R. Din gave and delivered to the accused the amount of P37,400.00, Philippine Currency, to meet the requirements thereof, said accused well knowing that the same were false and fraudulent but were made solely to obtain, as in fact the said accused did obtain the amount of P37,400.00, Philippine Currency, which amount once in possession thereof, with intent to defraud, misapplied, misappropriated and converted the same to his own personal use and benefit, despite demand made upon him, to the damage and prejudice of the said offended party in the amount aforementioned.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[6]
Upon arraignment, petitioner entered a plea of ""Not Guilty"" to the crime charged.[7]

Trial ensued.","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] assailing the Decision[2] dated January 7, 2021, of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-­G.R. CR No. 39899. The CA affirmed with modification the Decision[3] dated November 24, 2016, and the Omnibus Order[4] dated March 8, 2017, of Branch 216, Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Quezon City in Criminal Case No. Q-07-148522. The CA found Conrado Fernando, Jr. (petitioner) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Estafa, but it deleted the award of actual damages in the amount of PHP 37,400.00.","At the outset, the Court notes that Atty. Valentino K. Villaluz, counsel for petitioner, has failed to comply with the Resolution[39] dated August 31, 2022 which required him to submit within five days from notice the following:
(1) a soft copy of the petition in portable document format as required under the Rules in E-Filing (A.M. No. 10-3-7-SC) and the Efficient Use of Paper Rule (A.M. No. 11-9-4-SC); (2) a certification against forum shopping; (3) a valid verification of the petition with (a) the additional attestations in the verification of the petition as required under Section 4, Rule 7 of the 2019 Amended Rules of Court; and (b) a properly accomplished jurat with affiant's current identification document issued by an official agency bearing his photograph and signature; pursuant to Secs. 2, 6, and 12, Rule 11 of the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice, as amended by A.M.

However, considering that petitioner's liberty is at stake, the Court resolves to brush aside the procedural infirmities of the petition and give due course to the petition in the higher interest of substantial justice.

The Court shall now delve into the merits of the present petition. Petitioner filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. For the petition to prosper, Section 5 (2) of Rule 45 of the Rules of Court states that the questions raised in the petition should be of such substance as to warrant consideration. Also, Section 6 of the same Rules provides the reasons which will be considered by the Court —
SEC. 6. Review discretionary.... 
 
(a)
When the court a quo has decided a question of substance, not theretofore determined by the Supreme Court, or has decided it in a way probably not in accord with law or with the applicable decisions of the Supreme Court; or


(b)
When the court a quo has so far departed from the accepted and usual course of judicial proceedings, or so far sanctioned such departure by a lower court, as to call for an exercise of the power of supervision.
In the present case, the Court finds that the RTC's factual findings, as affirmed by the CA, are not in accordance with law and recent jurisprudence.","WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated January 7, 2021 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 39899 is REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

" G.R. No. 256194, January 31, 2024","REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, PETITIONER, VS. HEIRS OF ROGELIO P. LAUDES, NAMELY, VICTORIA ORDIZ VDA. DE LAUDES, ROVI ROVILLE LAUDES-CORNELIO, ROVIN LAUDES, ROVIROSE LAUDES AND ROVICOR LAUDES, REPRESENTED BY VICTORIA ORDIZ VDA. DE LAUDES, RESPONDENTS.","On September 19, 1984, Rogelio P. Laudes (Rogelio) died when the Chevrolet Truck owned by Jesus E. Enova (Jesus) and driven by Elias Pilo (Pilo) hit him. As a result of Rogelio's death, his heirs filed both civil and criminal cases against Jesus and Pilo. Both Civil Case No. 5175 and Criminal Case No. 4040 were consolidated before the RTC, Branch 40 (RTC Branch 40). In its Joint Decision, dated January 6, 1989, RTC Branch 40 found Pilo guilty for reckless imprudence resulting to homicide, slight physical injuries, and damage to property, while Jesus was ordered to pay civil liability in the total amount of PHP 205,000.00.[5]

Thereafter, a Writ of Execution was issued, followed by the issuance of a Notice of Levy against the properties of Jesus, including those covered by TD No. 006-0168 and TD No. 006-0279. The sheriff then issued a Notice of Sheriff's Sale, setting the levied properties of Jesus for public auction on September 25, 1990, in satisfaction of the civil liability adjudged by RTC Branch 40.[6]

During the said public auction, Victoria emerged as the highest bidder and was awarded the properties levied, giving Jesus and his heirs, assigns, administrator or executor one (1) year from the date of the auction sale to redeem the said properties. However, the subject properties were not redeemed. Thus, the Sheriff's Final Deed, dated October 16, 1991, was issued. Thereafter, a Writ of Possession was issued by RTC Branch 40.[7]

In the Sheriff's Return, dated January 3, 1992, the sheriff was able to place the Heirs of Laudes in possession of some of the properties including the property with TD No. 006-0279. However, the sheriff failed to do the same for the other properties, including the property with TD No. 006-0168.[8]

Upon issuance of an Alias Writ of Possession, the sheriff, in his Partial Return, dated January 11, 1993, reported that the Heirs of Laudes were again dispossessed of the property with TD No. 006-0168 after placing them in possession on January 8, 1993, and that the property with TD No. 006-0279 has not yet been placed in their possession.[9]

Meanwhile, records reveal that Gregorio Zantua, Jr. (Zantua), Jose Enova (Jose), Leopoldo Enova (Leopoldo), and Ricardo Lotik (Lotik) filed a complaint before RTC Branch 40, docketed as Civil Case No. 6118, against the Heirs of Laudes for recovery of real properties and annulment of sale. They alleged that the properties subject of the public auction were sold to them prior to the levy made by the sheriff. Zantua, Jose, and Lotik eventually withdrew as party-plaintiffs in Civil Case No. 6118, but filed separate civil cases for the same cause of action against Victoria.[10]

In Civil Case No. 6118, the Heirs of Laudes moved that they be declared as the true, lawful, and absolute owner of the properties with TD No. 006-0168 (now TD No. 006-1347) and TD No. 006-0279 (now TD No. GR-2008-FF-06-006-00539). Thus, in its Order, dated January 5, 2000, the RTC Branch 40 declared the Heirs of Laudes as the true and lawful owner of the subject properties.[11]

By virtue of the said Order, the Heirs of Laudes filed the application for registration of the property covered by TD No. 006-0279, before the Municipal Trial Court of Paracale (MTC), on June 20, 2001. The MTC then issued an Order, dated June 25, 2001, directing the Bureau of Lands and the National Land Title and Deeds Registration Administration to submit a report before the scheduled initial hearing.[12]

In compliance with the said Order, the Land Registration Authority (LRA) submitted its Report, and the Notice of Initial Hearing, with instructions that the said notice must be posted and published. Junior Process Server Loreto C. Banal (Banal) then executed a Certificate of Posting. Subsequently, the LRA submitted its Certificate of Publication, with the attached Certificate of Publication from the National Printing Office (NPO), and a Certificate of Notification.[13]

Meanwhile, an Urgent Opposition to Application for Registration was filed by Zantua, claiming ownership of the subject properties. Due to the said opposition, the MTC issued an Order, dated December 3, 2001, declaring that it has no jurisdiction to hear and decide the case, thereby directing that the records of the case be transmitted to the Executive Judge of the RTC. The case was raffled to RTC Branch 39.[14]

In the ensuing trial, the Heirs of Laudes manifested before RTC Branch 39 that a similar case was pending before it, and prayed that the cases be tried jointly, to which the trial court acceded. Thus, LRC Case No. N-873, involving a parcel of land covered by Plan Psu-214678, and LRC Case No. N-875, involving a parcel of land designated as Lot 9150, Pls-1047-D of Paracale Public Land Subdivision, were tried jointly.[15]

The Heirs of Laudes presented the following witnesses: Victoria herself, Pio T. Oco, Sr., Teofilo T. Oco (Teofilo), Ponciano M. Mabeza, Jr. (Mabeza, Jr.), Officer-In-Charge (OIC) of the Community Environment and Natural Resources Office (CENRO) of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), and Ramely Urbano (Urbano), Administrative Officer I of CENRO. In addition, the Heirs of Laudes attached Certification Nos. RS DCN-2015-40 and RS DCN-2015-41, both dated April 13, 2015, issued by the Secretary of the DENR, delegating the authority to reclassify the land to the CENRO. The Office of the Prosecutor, on behalf of the State, did not present any evidence.[16]","This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari (Petition),[1] filed under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the Decision,[2] dated June 30, 2020, and the Resolution,[3] dated March 9, 2021, of the Court of Appeals (CA), in CA-G.R. CV No. 111651. The CA affirmed the Joint Decision,[4] dated June 21, 2018, of the Regional Trial Court of Daet, Camarines Norte (RTC), Branch 39 (RTC Branch 39), which ruled that Victoria Ordiz Vda. de Laudes (Victoria), Rovi Rovile Laudes-Cornelio (Rovi), Rovin Laudes (Rovin), Rovirose Laudes (Rovirose), and Rovicor Laudes (Rovicor), all represented by Victoria (collectively, the Heirs of Laudes), were able to prove that the properties covered by Tax Declaration (TD) No. 006-0168 and TD No. 006-0279 (collectively, the subject properties), that they sought to be registered, were alienable and disposable lands, and that their predecessors-in-interest have been in open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession and occupation under a bona fide claim of ownership over the subject properties.","The Petition is meritorious.

Classification of lands

Pursuant to the Regalian Doctrine (Jura Regalia), all lands of the public domain belong to the State. This means that the State is the source of any asserted right to ownership of land, and is charged with the conservation of such patrimony.[39] As elucidated in Federation of Coron, Busuanga, Palawan Farmer's Association, Inc. v. The Secretary of Department of Environment and Natural Resources:[40]
The Regalian Doctrine was embodied as early as in the Philippine Bill of 1902. Under Section 12 thereof, it was stated that all properties of the Philippine Islands that were acquired by the United States through the treaty with Spain shall be under the control of the Government of the Philippine Islands, to wit:
SECTION 12. That all the property and rights which may have been acquired in the Philippine Islands by the United States under the treaty of peace with Spain, signed December tenth, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, except such land or other property as shall be designated by the President of the United States for military and other reservations of the Government of the United States, are hereby placed under the control of the Government of said Islands, to be administered for the benefit of the inhabitants thereof, except as provided in this Act.
The only exception in the Regalian Doctrine is native title to land, or ownership of land by Filipinos by virtue of a claim of ownership since time immemorial and independent of any grant from the Spanish Crown. In Cariño v. Insular Government, the United States Supreme Court at that time held that:
It might, perhaps, be proper and sufficient to say that when, as far back as testimony or memory goes, the land has been held by individuals under a claim of private ownership, it will be presumed to have been held in the same way from before the Spanish conquest, and never to have been public land.[41] (Citations omitted)
Lands may either be of (1) public dominion or (2) of private ownership.[42] Lands under public dominion are either (1) those intended for public use, such as roads, canals, rivers, torrents, ports and bridges constructed by the State, banks, shores, roadsteads, and others of similar character; or (2) those which belong to the State, without being for public use, and are intended for some public service or for the development of the national wealth.[43]

Hence, based on Article 420 of the Civil Code, there are three kinds of property of public dominion: (1) those for public use, which may be used by anybody, such as roads and canals; (2) those for public service, which may be used only by certain duly authorized persons, although used for the benefit of the public; and (3) those used for the development of national wealth, such as our natural resources. Lands of public dominion remain part of the inalienable land of the public domain unless the State is shown to have reclassified or alienated them to private persons.[44]","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari filed by the Republic of the Philippines is PARTLY GRANTED.

The case is REMANDED to the Court of Appeals for reception of evidence on the subject properties' land classification status based on the parameters set forth in Section 7 of Republic Act No. 11573. The Court of Appeals is directed to resolve the case with utmost dispatch."
"G.R. No. 264158, January 31, 2024","MELBA ALCANTARA DENUSTA, PETITIONER, VS. MIGRANT WORKERS MANPOWER AGENCY, INC., THERESITA M. CERALDE, AND K&G MANPOWER SERVICES, LTD., RESPONDENTS.","Petitioner filed a complaint for illegal dismissal, underpayment of salaries, damages, payment of wages for the unexpired portion of the contract, and attorney's fees against Migrant Workers Manpower Agency, Inc. (Migrant), a placement and recruitment agency, K&G Manpower Services, Ltd. (K&G), Migrant's foreign principal, and Theresita M. Ceralde (Ceralde), in her capacity as Migrant's president (collectively, respondents).[4]

In the complaint, petitioner averred that she was hired as a Kitchen Hand for The Lunch Box Ltd. (Lunch Box) in Rarotonga, Cook Islands under a two-year employment contract executed with Migrant and K&G. Based on her contract, she would receive a weekly salary of NZ$400.00 or NZ$1,600.00 per month. On May 22, 2019, she arrived in the Cook Islands and started her employment. She was repatriated to the Philippines on November 17, 2019.[5]

During her employment, petitioner alleged that her employer, Charlene Tairea (Tairea) committed several violations of her contract of employment. She was paid less than the agreed rate and was not provided with accommodation, transportation, or food allowances. She was considered a part-time employee and was not paid her salary during holidays. Petitioner likewise averred that she was maltreated by her foreign employer's family members. Due to her predicaments in the hands of her foreign employer, she claimed that respondents were guilty of illegal dismissal.[6]

Worse, when petitioner informed Migrant of her situation, Migrant did not act on it. Furthermore, before she was permitted to return home, respondents forced her to sign a Quitclaim, but she refused. Instead, she executed a Letter of Dispute narrating her ordeal.[7]

Petitioner, thus, prayed in her complaint that she be reimbursed for her accommodation and transportation expenses while in the Cook Islands, as well as for the amount she paid for the return ticket, agency fee, and work permit fee.[8] She likewise claimed that she was entitled to her salaries and benefits for the unexpired portion of her contract, as well as her salary differentials in the total amount of PHP 1,379,170.00 based on the prevailing conversion rate.[9]

Respondents denied the allegations in the complaint. They countered that petitioner was not illegally dismissed and, therefore, not entitled to her monetary claims.[10]

Respondents claimed that petitioner was a ""name-hire"" worker and that she was not an agency-recruited worker of Migrant. She was engaged but through the referral of her friend, who sought the help of another friend in securing her employment with Tairea. It was only Migrant who processed her travel documents.[11]

Furthermore, respondents contended that petitioner lied in her application as she claimed that she could speak basic English and drive a motorcycle, which were among the main conditions of her employment. However, when asked to drive a motorcycle by her employer, she refused and said that she did not know how to drive. Further, during her employment in the Cook Islands, petitioner demonstrated an arrogant attitude towards Tairea's mother, Vaine Parau Tairea (Vaine).[12]

After Tairea left with her daughter to New Zealand for the latter's surgery, Vaine took over the management of the restaurant and it was this time when petitioner's attitude changed. She no longer wanted to work until Tairea's return. She falsely accused another employee of stealing, which disrupted the workplace.[13]

When Tairea returned from New Zealand, she asked petitioner to return to work but the latter refused. Instead, petitioner asked that she be released from her employment contract. She then requested to be repatriated because of her disagreement with Vaine. Tairea was then constrained to release her from her employment contract and repatriate her to the Philippines.[14]

Respondents concluded that petitioner was not illegally dismissed as it was petitioner who asked for her release from her employment and declined to finish her two-year contract. Furthermore, petitioner is not entitled to her money claims for failure to present sufficient evidence to support the same.[15]","This Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assails the Resolutions dated June 14, 2022[2] and October 19, 2022[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 171524, which dismissed the Petition for Certiorari filed by Melba Alcantara Denusta (petitioner) for being filed beyond the reglementary period.","The instant petition is meritorious.

The CA erred in denying the motion for extension of time to file Petition for Certiorari and dismissing the same for being filed beyond the reglementary period
In the instant petition, petitioner begs this Court to relax the procedures and rule on the substantive issues raised in the petition. She claims that motions for extension to file a petition for certiorari are allowed and that the extension thereof is subject to the sound discretion of the court. Petitioner added that the COVID-19 pandemic and the deadly surge of cases are exceptional circumstances and compelling reasons to allow the extension of time to file a petition for certiorari.[31]

We are persuaded.

Under the Rules of Court, a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 shall be filed not later than 60 days from notice of the judgment, order, or resolution.[32] With the issuance of A.M. No. 00-2-03-SC,[33] motions for extension of time to file petitions for certiorari were allowed for compelling reasons only. The rules, therefore, admit an exception and the filing of petitions for certiorari is now extendible, albeit only for compelling reasons.

In the case of Fluor Daniel, Inc.-Philippines v. Fil-Estate Properties, Inc.,[34] We enumerated several instances where the Court allowed an extension for filing a petition for certiorari, thus:

. . . when the assailed decision was contradictory to the evidence presented; in a motion for consolidation of several criminal cases, when the relief sought would be more in keeping with law and equity, and to facilitate a speedy trial, considering that there was substantial identity in the informations filed and the witnesses to be presented; where paramount public interest necessitated that the dispute involving the operation of a major power plant be resolved on the merits; where the case involved the expropriation of private property to build a major highway and no undue prejudice or delay will be caused to either party in admitting the petition; and when the appellate court had already granted an extension but later reversed itself. Furthermore, in Castells, et al. v. Saudi Arabian Airlines, the Court enumerated the following instances when the period to file a petition for certiorari may be extended:

Contrary to law.[6]
AA pleaded not guilty to the charges. Trial on the merits ensued.[7]

The prosecution presented BBB and Dr. Editha Martinez (Dr. Martinez), the medico-legal officer of xxxxxxxxxxx Crime Laboratory.[8] Meanwhile, the defense presented AAA and his sister, CCC, as its witnesses.[9]

BBB, then 15 years old, recalled that on December 1, 2015, at around 4:00 a.m., while she was sleeping in her room, she was sexually abused by AAA, her stepfather. She said that her mother, ODD, was not home as she leaves early to sell vegetables in the market. When AAA got into her room, he took off her jogging pants and his shorts. He then climbed on top of her and inserted his penis in her vagina.[10]

BB alleged that AAA threatened to kill her family if she resisted his lewd advances. When he was done, he wore his shorts back and told BBB to keep silent. She wanted to shout and push the accused away but he threatened to kill her, her mother, or her family.[11]

From December 1 to 24, 2015, AAA would go to her room at around 4:00 a.m. to sexually assault BBB whenever her mother was not around. Repeated sexual assaults on BBB happened in similar ways and under similar conditions.[12] AAA would remove her shorts and underwear, remove his shorts and underwear, mount her, insert his penis into her vagina and start pumping.[13] Unfortunately, her room's door lock was broken and had not been fixed because her mother and brother were always busy with work.[14]

When she could no longer take the pain of being sexually abused over and over again, BBB told her sister EEE about what happened.[15]

Her sister then brought her to the barangay to file a Complaint.[16]

Upon medico-legal examination on BBB, Dr. Martinez found the ""presence of deep healed laceration at the 6 o'clock position of the hymen.""[17] The examination showed ""clear evidence of blunt penetrating trauma to the hymen caused by any blunt hard object that penetrated the hymen which could be an erected penis, finger or any blunt hard object.""[18]

For his defense, AAA denied the accusations.[19] He testified that from December 1, 2015 to December 24, 2015 at 4:00 a.m., the period that BBB was allegedly raped, he slept in a different room. Their house had three separate rooms, and thus it was physically impossible for him to be in her room.[20] Most of the time, he woke up at around 6:00 or 7:00 a.m. and went with BBB's mother to Novaliches market at around 10:00 a.m.[21] Further, AAA asserted that he did not have the physical strength to commit the crime and overpower BBB into submission as he lost his left hand in a firecracker accident in 1990.[22]

In its January 30, 2020 Judgment,[23] the Regional Trial Court convicted AAA of seven counts of rape.[24] The trial court found that the alleged rape committed on December 8 to 24, 2015 had not been established by the required quantum of evidence as BBB ""merely made a general statement that the rape was committed in.the same manner as in the previous dates already testified on.""[25]","The moral ascendancy of the common law father of a minor substitutes force and intimidation in rape.[1] When the offender has moral ascendancy over the victim, physical resistance no longer needs to be proven.

This Court resolves an appeal[2] from the Court of Appeals Decision[3] finding AAA guilty beyond reasonable doubt of rape under Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code, as amended. The Court of Appeals modified the Judgment[4] of the trial court, finding AAA guilty of six counts of rape instead of seven.","This Court does not find accused-appellant's alibis to be credible.

First, he claimed that it was physically impossible for him to be in BBB's room when the rape happened as he was sleeping in another room. Second, he insisted that the charges were baseless, claiming that the cases were filed against him because BBB's mother and her two sisters had a misunderstanding, which led them to leave their house. He even claimed that he had a good relationship with BBB as he supported her studies and everyday needs.[59] Third, accused-appellant pointed out that he could not overpower BBB if she resisted as he only had one hand. Lastly, he asserted that she had the chance to report the incident to the authorities or even tell her mother, but she decided not to.[60]

This Court has consistently ruled that for alibi to prosper, it is not enough for the accused to prove that they have been elsewhere when the crime was committed. They must also show that it was physically impossible for them to be at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission.[61]

Accused-appellant's alibi fails to persuade this Court.

BBB's positive identification of the accused and her testimony pointed to accused-appellant as the offender. By saying that he was in the next room, accused-appellant in effect admitted that it was not physically impossible for him to have been at the crime scene during the times when BBB was raped.[62]

In addition, the delay in reporting the incidents to the proper authorities did not taint BBB's credibility. Jurisprudence provides that ""long silence and delay in reporting the crime of rape have not always been construed as an indication of false accusation.""[63] A rape barge becomes doubtful only when the delay in revealing its commission is unreasonable and cannot be explained.[64] In this case, accused-appellant threatened BBB that he would kill her family if she discloses to anyone what happened. We find this explanation for the delay reasonable.

The claim of the accused-appellant that the charges filed against him were baseless as these were filed due to the misunderstanding between BBB's mother and her is unsubstantiated. Further, accused-appellant's claim that BBB could have defended herself against his advances emphasizing that he would not have been able to overpower her if she resisted, given that he only had the use of one hand is unjustified.

In People v. Senieres,[65] this Court held that there is ""no standard form of behavior [that] can be anticipated of a rape victim following her defilement, particularly by a child who could not be expected to fully comprehend the ways of an adult. People react differently to emotional stress and rape victims are no different from them.""[66]

Further, the Court held that ""physical resistance need not be established in rape when threats and intimidation are employed and the victim submits herself to the embrace of her rapist because of fear.""[67]

With this, we affirm accused-appellant's conviction and dismiss the appeal. In People v. Jugueta,[68] this Court held that ""when the circumstances of the crime call for the imposition of reclusion perpetua only, the civil indemnity and moral damages should be .[PHP] 75,000.00 each, as well as exemplary damages in the amount of [PHP] 75,000.00.""","ACCORDINGLY, the March 22, 2022 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR HC No. 14261 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. Accused-appellant AAA is GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of six counts of rape in Criminal Case Nos. 265-M-2016 to 268-M-2016 and 270-M-2016 to 271-M-2016. He is sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua for each of the six counts.

He is ORDERED to pay BBB PHP 75,000.00 as civil liability, PHP 75,000.00 as moral damages, and PHP 75,000.00 as exemplary damages for each of the six counts of rape. All damages awarded shall earn interest at the legal rate of 6% per annum from the finality of this Decision until fully paid.[69]"
"B.M. No. 4720, January 30, 2024","IN RE: PETITION TO RETAIN/REACQUIRE THE PRIVILEGE TO RESUME THE PRACTICE OF LAW IN THE PHILIPPINES, REGINA STELLA P. JACINTO, PETITIONER.","Jacinto alleged that she was admitted as a member of the Philippine Bar on April 11, 1996 with Roll of Attorneys No. 40547. However, on May 29, 2023, she received her Maltese citizenship. She alleged that according to the Maltese Citizenship Act, it is lawful for any person to be a citizen of Malta and at the same time a citizen of another country. Thus, she alleged that she was not required to renounce her Philippine citizenship under the said law. She likewise posits that pursuant to Republic Act (RA) 9225, otherwise known as the ""Citizenship Retention and Re-acquisition Act of 2003,"" she is deemed not to have lost her Philippine citizenship, considering that she became a Maltese citizen after the effectivity of the law.[2]

Thus, on June 29, 2023, Jacinto filed a Petition for Retention/Re­-Acquisition of Philippine Citizenship under RA 9225[3] with the Bureau of Immigration (BI) to formalize the retention of her Philippine citizenship. Accordingly, the BI granted her Petition in an Order[4] dated July 14, 2023 leading to the issuance of a Certificate of Re-acquisition/Retention of Philippine Citizenship/Identification Certificate[5] similarly dated July 14, 2023. Thereafter, Jacinto, on August 7, 2023, took her Oath of Allegiance[6] to the Republic of the Philippines before a solemnizing officer of the BI in the City of Manila, Philippines.[7]

Considering the foregoing, Jacinto filed the present Petition with the OBC. Following the documents previously required by the OBC as indicated in In Re: Muneses,[8] she submitted the following documents:

(a)
A copy of her Certificate of Naturalization[9] dated May 29, 2023;

(e)
A certified true copy of the Oath of Allegiance[13] to the Republic of the Philippines dated August 7, 2023;

(m)
A photocopy of the Official Receipt[21] dated January 4, 2023 as proof of payment of her professional tax for year 2023;


(n)
A copy of her Certificate of Compliance[22] dated February 2, 2023 issued by the Mandatory Continuing Legal Education Office stating that she has complied with the required units for the 7th Compliance Period under Bar Matter No. 850.","Before the Court is a Petition[1] dated September 8, 2023 to formalize the Privilege to Practice Law in the Philippines filed by petitioner Regina Stella P. Jacinto* (Jacinto) before the Office of the Bar Confidant (OBC) praying that she be allowed to formalize her privilege to practice law in the Philippines.","The Court adopts the Report and Recommendation of the OBC with modification.

Time and time again, this Court has emphasized that any person who is privileged to practice law in the Philippines is required to strictly adhere to certain conditions:
The practice of law is a privilege burdened with conditions. It is so delicately affected with public interest that it is both the power and duty of the State (through this Court) to control and regulate it in order to protect and promote the public welfare.

Adherence to rigid standards of mental fitness, maintenance of the highest degree of morality, faithful observance of the legal profession, compliance with the mandatory continuing legal education requirement and payment of membership fees to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) are the conditions required for membership in good standing in the bar and for enjoying the privilege to practice law. Any breach by a lawyer of any of these conditions makes him unworthy of the trust and confidence which the courts and clients repose in him for the continued exercise of his professional privilege.[25]
In this relation, Rule 138, Section 2 of the Rules of Court dictates that one of the requirements for admission to the Philippine Bar is a Philippine citizenship:
Section 2. Requirements for all applicants for admission to the bar. - Every applicant for admission as a member of the bar must be a citizen of the Philippines, at least twenty-one years of age, of good moral character, and a resident of the Philippines; and must produce before the Supreme Court satisfactory evidence of good moral character, and that no charges against him, involving moral turpitude, have been filed or are pending in any court in the Philippines. (Emphasis supplied)
In In Re: Muneses, the Court En Banc categorically held that one's Philippine citizenship is a continuing requirement for the practice of law in the Philippines.[26] Thus, the loss of one's Philippine citizenship results in the termination of their membership in the Philippine Bar; ergo, one loses the privilege to engage in the practice of law in the Philippines. [27]

Nonetheless, in the cases of In Re: Dacanay[28] and In Re: Muneses,[29] the Court has consistently held that a Filipino who loses their citizenship by reason of naturalization is considered to have reacquired the same by taking an oath of allegiance to the Republic. The reacquisition of Philippine citizenship thereby allows a person to again be qualified for membership of the Philippine Bar since the reacquisition of Philippine citizenship is not an automatic grant to resume the practice of law. Thus, a person who has reacquired one's citizenship still needs to apply with the proper authority for the license or permit to engage in the practice of a profession pursuant to Section 5 of RA No. 9225.[30]","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition of Attorney Regina Stella P. Jacinto is GRANTED, subject to the condition that she shall re-take the Lawyer's Oath, sign the Roll of Attorneys, and subject to the payment of appropriate fees."
" A.M. No. P-23-082 (Formerly OCA IPI No. 19-4991-P), January 30, 2024","RODALYN GUINTO-HANIF, COMPLAINANT, VS. CHRISTOPHER T. PEREZ, SHERIFF IV, BRANCH 74, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, OLONGAPO CITY, ZAMBALES, RESPONDENT.","On October 14, 2009, the Subic Bay Development and Management Corporation, Inc. entered into an Industrial Lease Agreement with M. Waseem International Trading Corporation (M. Waseem) over a 5,000-square meter parcel of land located on Innovative Street, Subic Bay Gateway Park, Subic Bay Freeport Zone, for a period of 38 years.[2] Rodalyn averred that she and her husband, Muhammad Hanif (Muhammad), were the biggest shareholders of M. Waseem, while Muhammad was also the president of the company.[3]

On December 20, 2016, Rodalyn and Muhammad executed separate Deeds of Assignment transferring 380 shares of stock to Zeeshan Ashraf (Zeeshan) and 367 shares of stock to Hamza Shabbir (Hamza) for a consideration of PHP 1,000.00 per share. On January 10, 2017, a new set of Board of Directors and Officers were elected in M. Waseem.[4]

On December 17, 2017, at around 4:30 a.m., Rodalyn, along with 20 other individuals armed with high caliber firearms and other dangerous weapons, forcibly entered the leased warehouse/office compound of M. Waseem and ordered the employees and caretakers to vacate the yard under threat of being fired upon.[5]

This led to the filing by Hamza and Zeeshan, as authorized representatives of M. Waseem, of a complaint for Forcible Entry with Prayer for the Immediate Issuance of Writ of Preliminary Injunction and/or Temporary Restraining Order with the Municipal Trial Court in Cities (MTCC), Olongapo City against Rodalyn and Muhammad and the other individuals who acted under their supervision. The case was docketed as Civil Case No. 7733 and raffled to Branch 3 of the MTCC, Olongapo City, Zambales.[6]

In their Answer, Rodalyn and Muhammad averred that the Deeds of Assignment executed with Hamza and Zeeshan were null and void for lack of valuable consideration as the assignees failed to pay for the shares. Thus, Rodalyn and Muhammad argued that they did not forcibly enter the leased property considering that they were still the majority owners of M. Waseem.[7]

The MTCC decided in favor of Hamza and Zeeshan in its Decision[8] dated August 24, 2018, the dispositive portion of which reads:

WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiffs as follows:

Ordering the defendants and all persons claiming right[s] under them to vacate the premises situated at 35 Lot 70-A Innovative Street, Subic Bay Gateway Park, SBFZ, Olongapo City and peacefully return possession thereof to the plaintiffs;

Ordering the defendants to pay the plaintiffs the amount of One Hundred Thousand Pesos [[PHP] 100,000.00] per month for the use of the premises from the time of filing of the Complaint until the premises shall have been vacated and turned over to the plaintiffs;

Costs against the defendants.

Perez (Sheriff Perez) of Branch 74, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Olongapo City, Zambales for grave misconduct and conduct unbecoming a public officer.","The Court adopts the factual findings of the JIB, but finds it necessary to modify the administrative liability of Sheriff Perez.

At the outset, the Court notes that Sheriff Perez has repeatedly failed to submit his comment despite the numerous opportunities given to him by the OCA.

After the complaint against Sheriff Perez was filed on November 26, 2020, the OCA, on January 10, 2020, referred the complaint to Sheriff Perez via the 1st Indorsement wherein he was given 10 days from receipt thereof to submit his comment.[36]

On March 2, 2020, Sheriff Perez submitted a Motion for Extension of Time to File Comment,[37] which the OCA granted but despite the extension, Sheriff Perez failed to submit his comment.

On October 20, 2020, the OCA sent a 1st Tracer[38] to Sheriff Perez, reiterating the previous directive for him to submit his comment, this time within five days from receipt of the tracer, otherwise the matter would be submitted to the Court. However, despite the repeated directives, Sheriff Perez still failed to submit his comment.[39]

Based on the records, Sheriff Perez has been given several opportunities to submit his comment and address the allegations against him. There was also no question that Sheriff Perez knows of the existence of the complaint, as evidenced by his filing of a motion for extension of time to file his comment. Yet, despite the numerous opportunities given him, and notwithstanding the consideration given by the OCA in granting his motion for extension, Sheriff Perez continued to display a clear dispassion towards the complaint filed against him.","ACCORDINGLY, the Court rules that:

1.
Christopher T. Perez be found GUILTY of Grave Abuse of Authority and be DISMISSED FROM THE SERVICE with forfeiture of all benefits, and disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office, including government-owned or -controlled corporations. Provided, however, that the forfeiture of benefits shall in no case include accrued leave credits; and


2.
Christopher T. Perez be found GUILTY of Gross Insubordination and be meted with a penalty of a FINE in the amount of PHP 110,000.00. He shall pay the fine within a period not exceeding three (3) months from the time this decision is promulgated. If unpaid, such amount may be deducted from the accrued leave credits due to him."
"A.C. No. 13955 (Formerly CBD Case No. 19-6114), January 30, 2024","ADRIAN M. KELLEY, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. CIPRIANO D. ROBIELOS III, RESPONDENT.","According to Kelley, sometime in February 2016, Atty. Robielos borrowed from him PHP 240,000.00, for which Atty. Robielos issued as payment Bank of Commerce Check No. 0000008[2] dated June 30, 2016. When he presented the check for payment, however, the same was dishonored for being ""drawn against insufficient funds."" He consequently sent Atty. Robielos a demand letter[3] dated July 30, 2016.[4]

He and Atty. Robielos subsequently entered into an Agreement[5] (""Kasunduan ng Pag-Aayos"") dated September 13, 2016 before the Office of the Barangay Chairman, Barangay 33, Caloocan City, whereby Atty. Robielos committed to pay in installments of PHP 20,000.00 every 15 days for a period of six months. Atty. Robielos, however, only paid three installments or a total of PHP 60,000.00, leaving a balance of PHP 180,000.00.[6]

He was, therefore, constrained to file a small claims complaint[7] against Atty. Robielos before the Branch 51, Metropolitan Trial Court, Caloocan City, (MeTC-Branch 51) docketed as Small Claims Case No. 17-2040. Despite receipt of summons, Atty. Robielos failed to file an answer and did not appear during the hearing.[8]

By Decision[9] dated February 23, 2017, MeTC-Branch 51 ordered Atty. Robielos to pay the amount of PHP 180,000.00 with 5% interest per annum. Kelley then filed a Motion for Execution,[10] which Atty. Robielos opposed,[11] claiming he had suffered a mild stroke. During the hearing on the motion for execution, Atty. Robielos appeared and was directed by the court to file his answer, which he did. Atty. Robielos countered that the check was issued merely to ""return a favor"" and was not intended to be encashed as payment for a debt.[12]

By Order[13] dated April 3, 2017, MeTC-Branch 51 found the aforesaid defense to be devoid of merit, hence, it granted the motion for execution. The same was affirmed by the Branch 129, Regional Trial Court, Caloocan City per its Order[14] dated June 14, 2017. An alias writ of execution was eventually served on Atty. Robielos who still refused to pay the judgment award.[15]

Consequently, this time, Kelley was compelled to file the instant administrative complaint against Atty. Robielos.[16]","Complainant Adrian M. Kelley (Kelley) charged respondent Atty. Cipriano D. Robielos III (Atty. Robielos) before the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) with grave misconduct, averring that the latter issued a worthless check and failed to pay his debt in violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR) and the Lawyer's Oath.[1]","At the outset, the Court emphasizes that the provisions of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability (CPRA), which took effect on May 30, 2023, apply to the present case by virtue of Section 1, of the General Provisions of the CPRA, viz.:

Section 1. Transitory Provision. — The CPRA shall be applied to all pending and future cases, except to the extent that in the opinion of the Supreme Court, its retroactive application would not be feasible or would work injustice, in which case the procedure under which the cases were filed shall govern.

Membership in the Bar is a privilege burdened with conditions. Time and again, the Court has imposed the penalty of suspension or disbarment for any gross misconduct that a lawyer may have committed, whether it is in his or her professional or private capacity. Good character is an essential qualification for the admission to and continued practice of law. Hence, any wrongdoing, whether professional or non-professional, indicating unfitness for the profession justifies disciplinary action,[27] as here.

Indeed, the Court has repeatedly ordained that -

Law is a noble profession, and the privilege to practice it is bestowed only upon individuals who are competent intellectually, academically and, equally important, morally. Because they are vanguards of the law and the legal system, lawyers must at all times conduct themselves, especially in their dealings with their clients and the public at large, with honesty and integrity in a manner beyond reproach.[28]

Unfortunately, Atty. Robielos failed to live up to these standards.

Atty. Robielos is guilty of violation of
Canon II of the CPRA","ACCORDINGLY, respondent Atty. Cipriano D. Robielos III is found GUILTY of violation of Canons II and III of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability. He is DISBARRED from the practice of law and his name is ORDERED stricken off from the Roll of Attorneys, effective immediately. He is also meted a FINE in the amount of PHP 35,000.00 for his repeated disobedience to the orders of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines. Finally, he is directed to PAY his debt to complainant Adrian M. Kelley and comply with the Writ of Execution dated April 3, 2017 issued by the Branch 51, Metropolitan Trial Court, Caloocan City.

Let a copy of this Decision be attached to his personal record in the Office of the Bar Confidant.

Too, furnish a copy of this Decision to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines for its information and guidance; and the Office of the Court Administrator for dissemination to all courts of the Philippines."
"G.R. No. 261107, January 30, 2024","ANA LIZA ARRIOLA PERALTA, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, REPRESENTED BY THE CAMPAIGN FINANCE UNIT, RESPONDENT.","Petitioner ran for the position of Mayor in the Municipality of San Marcelino, Zambales, during the May 10, 2010, National and Local Elections (2010 NLE).[7] At the time, there were 20,301 registered voters in the municipality.[8]

In a Letter[9] to petitioner dated October 1, 2014, Atty. Ferdinand T. Rafanan (Atty. Rafanan), Head of the Campaign Finance Unit of the COMELEC, stated that petitioner spent the amount of PHP 285,500.00 during the 2010 NLE per the Statement of Contributions & Expenditures (SOCE) which she submitted to the COMELEC on June 7, 2010. Under Section 100 of the OEC, as amended by Section 13 of Republic Act No. 7166, the maximum allowable expenditure for petitioner was PHP 3.00 per registered voter or a total of PHP 60,903.00. Thus, as petitioner appeared to have exceeded the limit set by law, Atty. Rafanan directed her to submit her written explanation as to why no charges should be filed against her for the election offense of overspending under Section 262 in relation to the OEC, Section 100, as amended by Republic Act No. 7166, Section 13.

In her letter-response[10] dated March 2, 2015, petitioner attached the respective affidavits of her contributors, along with their corresponding explanations or clarifications on the declarations made in the Schedule of Contributions Received and Reports of Contributors,[11] as follows:
Lance Stefan L. Flamiano – the amount of his tarpaulin contributions was mistakenly written as PHP 30,000.00 instead of PHP 3,000.00;[12]

Noel P. Cacho – his contribution amounting to PHP 7,000.00 partook of the nature of copying and classifying the list of voters, investigating the registered voters on the list, and printing of sample ballots; however, it was erroneously indicated as meals and snacks in the report of his contribution;[13]

Maria Christina P. Penaflor – her contribution amounting to PHP 18,000.00 partook of the nature of copying and classifying the list of voters, investigating the registered voters on the list, and printing of sample ballots; however, it was erroneously indicated as meals and snacks in the report of her contribution;[14]

Rolando A. Flamiano – he contributed PHP 10,000.00 worth of home-made sample ballots; however, in his report of contribution, he caused the word ""leaflets"" to be written in conformity with the report's suggested description and as understood by him as being the nearest description of his contribution;[15]

Daniel A. Villanueva – his contribution of PHP 12,000.00 was not for meals and snacks as reflected in his report of contribution; upon careful recollection, he contributed PHP 8,000.00 for home-made printing of sample ballots and PHP 4,000.00 for copying and classifying the lists of voters;[16]

Heidi P. Villanueva – her report of contribution erroneously reflected meals and snacks in the amount of PHP 84,000.00; however, she only contributed PHP 2,000.00 for meals and snacks while the remaining PHP 82,000.00 was for copying and classifying the lists of voters, investigating the registered voters on the list, and printing of home-made sample ballots;[17]

Isabelita Peralta – she contributed the amount of PHP 5,000.00 for copying and classifying the lists of voters; however, the description in the schedule of contributions reflected ""papers/pens"";[18]

Jonathan S. Peralta – he contributed the amount of PHP 11,000.00 for copying and classifying the lists of voters, investigating the registered voters on the list, and printing of home-made sample ballots; he denied giving PHP 3,000.00 for vehicle and PHP 8,000.00 for meals and snacks, as reflected in the schedule of contributions;[19] and

Apolinario Abelon – he contributed home-made sample ballots amounting to PHP 3,000.00 only and corrected the figure of PHP 30,000.00 for meals and snacks appearing on the schedule of contributions.[20]
Petitioner further indicated in her letter that she underwent hip stress fracture surgery on December 10, 2014, after suffering serious injuries from a vehicular accident in Cancun, Mexico, on November 10, 2014. Thus, her mobility was very restricted and limited from such date. In addition, petitioner maintained that the distance between her and her contributors restricted her from easily conducting verification considering that she was based in Makati City, while almost all of her contributors were based in the Province of Zambales. She then requested that she be allowed to submit relevant documents as soon as they become available.[21]","Before the Court is a Petition for Certiorari[1] assailing Resolution No. 18-0656[2] dated August 8, 2018, and Resolution No. 21-0472-57[3] dated July 14, 2021, issued by the respondent Commission on Elections (COMELEC) En Banc in E.O. Case No. 15-954. In the assailed issuances, the COMELEC found probable cause to hold Ana Liza A. Peralta (petitioner) for trial and directed the filing of an Information against her for election overspending under Section 100[4] in relation to Section 262[5] of Batas Pambansa No. (BP) 881, otherwise known as the Omnibus Election Code (OEC), as amended by Republic Act No. 7166.[6]","The Court grants the petition.

There was inordinate delay in the conduct of the preliminary investigation before the COMELEC which violated petitioner's right to speedy disposition of cases. Hence, the dismissal of the complaint against her is warranted.

The 1987 Constitution, Article III, Section 16,[50] guarantees the right of all persons to a speedy disposition of their cases before all judicial, quasi-judicial, or administrative bodies. This constitutional right is available not only to the accused in criminal proceedings but also to all parties in all cases, whether civil or administrative in nature, as well as all proceedings, either judicial or quasi-judicial. Pursuant thereto, any party to a case may demand expeditious action from all officials who are tasked with the administration of justice.[51]

In resolving whether petitioner's right to the speedy disposition of her case was violated, the guidelines set forth by the Court in Cagang v. Sandiganbayan,[52] find relevance:
First, the right to speedy disposition of cases is different from the right to speedy trial. While the rationale for both rights is the same, the right to speedy trial may only be invoked in criminal prosecutions against courts of law. The right to speedy disposition of cases, however, may be invoked before any tribunal, whether judicial or quasi-judicial. What is important is that the accused may already be prejudiced by the proceeding for the right to speedy disposition of cases to be invoked.

Second, a case is deemed initiated upon the filing of a formal complaint prior to a conduct of a preliminary investigation. This Court acknowledges, however, that the Ombudsman should set reasonable periods for preliminary investigation, with due regard to the complexities and nuances of each case. Delays beyond this period will be taken against the prosecution. The period taken for fact-finding investigations prior to the filing of the formal complaint shall not be included in the determination of whether there has been inordinate delay.

Third, courts must first determine which party carries the burden of proof. If the right is invoked within the given time periods contained in current Supreme Court resolutions and circulars, and the time periods that will be promulgated by the Office of the Ombudsman, the defense has the burden of proving that the right was justifiably invoked. If the delay occurs beyond the given time period and the right is invoked, the prosecution has the burden of justifying the delay.

If the defense has the burden of proof, it must prove first, whether the case is motivated by malice or clearly only politically motivated and is attended by utter lack of evidence, and second, that the defense did not contribute to the delay.

Once the burden of proof shifts to the prosecution, the prosecution must prove first, that it followed the prescribed procedure in the conduct of preliminary investigation and in the prosecution of the case; second, that the complexity of the issues and the volume of evidence made the delay inevitable; and third, that no prejudice was suffered by the accused as a result of the delay.

Fourth, determination of the length of d lay is never mechanical. Courts must consider the entire context of the case, from the amount of evidence to be weighed to the simplicity or complexity of the issues raised.

An exception to this rule is if there is an allegation that the prosecution of the case was solely motivated by malice, such as when the case is politically motivated or when there is continued prosecution despite utter lack of evidence. Malicious intent may be gauged from the behavior of the prosecution throughout the proceedings. If malicious prosecution is properly alleged and substantially proven, the case would automatically be dismissed without need of further analysis of the delay.

Another exception would be the waiver of the accused to the right to speedy disposition of cases or the right to speedy trial. If it can be proven that the accused acquiesced to the delay the constitutional right can no longer be invoked.","ACCORDINGLY, the petition is GRANTED. Resolution No. 18-0656 dated August 8, 2018, and Resolution No. 21-0472-57 dated July 14, 2021, of the Commission on Elections En Banc in E.O. Case No. 15-954, are NULLIFIED for having been issued with grave abuse of discretion. The complaint against petitioner Ana Liza Arriola Peralta for alleged election overspending is DISMISSED."
"A.M. No. P-23-077 (Formerly OCA IPI No. 20-5026-P), January 30, 2024","DANILO D. DIVINAGRACIA, COMPLAINANT, VS. MICHAEL VINCENT L. OZON, CLERK III, BRANCH 1, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, BUTUAN CITY, AGUSAN DEL NORTE, RESPONDENT.","In his Letter-Complaint dated December 27, 2019, complainant alleged that he requested from Branch 1, RTC, Butuan City, Agusan del Norte, a certificate of finality of the decision it rendered in his case for declaration of nullity of marriage. He averred that respondent, who is a son-in-law of a judge, asked him to pay PHP 25,000.00 for the release of the certificate of finality of his case. Later, he encountered and spoke with other people who shared with him the same predicament he experienced with respondent.[3]

Complainant further alleged that respondent previously worked at the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) where ""under-the-table"" and ""S.O.P."" arrangements were apparently a common practice.[4]

In the 1st Indorsement[5] dated February 7, 2020, the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) referred the matter to Executive Judge Augustus L. Calo (Executive Judge Calo), RTC, Butuan City, Agusan del Norte, for a discreet investigation and report.

In relation to the aforementioned Letter-Complaint, respondent, on June 1, 2020, received a Notice to Explain[6] dated May 28, 2020, from Executive Judge Calo directing him to submit a written explanation within five calendar days from receipt of notice.[7]

In his handwritten explanation Letter[8] dated June 5, 2020, respondent denied the accusations against him. He countered that he merely prepared the trial court's certificates of finality, and it was the Branch Clerk of Court who was in charge of releasing them.[9] He also denied complainant's allegations of his ""under-the-table"" and ""S.O.P."" dealings during his employment with the DPWH. Anent complainant's allegation of nepotism, respondent clarified that Judge Eduardo S. Casals (Judge Casals) was his relative within the 5th degree of consanguinity, and thus, the rule on nepotism does not apply to him.[10] Lastly, he challenged his accusers to appear personally to settle the issue once and for all.[11]

Thereafter, Executive Judge Calo requested Atty. Joan B. Alabat-Torralba (Atty. Alabat-Torralba), the Branch Clerk of Court of Branch 1, RTC, Butuan City, to comment on the complaint.[12]

In her Comment[13] dated June 19, 2020, Atty. Alabat-Torralba stated the following: she had heard of respondent's alleged illegal involvement in the service of decisions in cases for declaration of nullity of marriage. Sometime in 2019, Judge Casals directed her to remove the duty of releasing certificates of finality from respondent after learning that he delayed the release of the certificate of finality to a lawyer who refused to give him money. At one time, a litigant, who gave respondent PHP 500.00, came to her crying because she had been visiting the trial court repeatedly, but the requested certificate of finality had not yet been issued. She reprimanded respondent, ordered him to return the PHP 500.00, and reported the matter to Judge Casals. She found out from their legal researcher that the client of the latter's lawyer-friend was cajoled by respondent into paying PHP 5,000.00 in order that the copy of the decision for the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) could be sent via a private courier service instead of registered mail. To prevent the occurrence of similar events, Acting Presiding Judge Emmanuel E. Escatron, in a Memorandum[14] dated June 15, 2020, directed respondent to refrain and desist from having a hand in the service of decisions to parties in civil cases.[15]

Anent respondent's performance at work, Atty. Alabat-Torralba declared the following: (1) respondent was often tardy or absent and would go out of the office at any time without asking for permission; (2) respondent did not update the docket books and logbooks of cases; and (3) respondent incurred delay in the transmittal of case records to the Court of Appeals.[16]

Relative to his investigation, Executive Judge Calo obtained sworn statements from two private individuals (Affiant 1 and Affiant 2) who requested that their identities be kept confidential.[17] Atty. Alabat-Torralba's allegation that respondent offered facilitation services to litigants in exchange for PHP 5,000.00 per decision was bolstered by the sworn affidavits of Affiant 1 and Affiant 2.

In an Affidavit[18] dated June 17, 2020, Affiant 1 introduced herself as the secretary of a law practitioner in Butuan City. She narrated that: (1) respondent, at one time, called her attention and told her that he had a friend working at the OSG; (2) respondent assured her that the return card of notices of decision sent to the parties can make it back as fast as three days by mailing them through private courier, together with PHP 5,000.00; (3) she told respondent that she will discuss the latter's offer to their clients; (4) respondent further informed her that he had helped some of their clients in serving decisions to the OSG; and (5) from 2017 to February 2020, she personally gave respondent PHP 5,000.00 for each of the 10 cases he handled. Affiant 1 provided the case titles and docket numbers of these cases in her Affidavit.[19]

Atty. Brainard J. Morales, Clerk of Court V, certified that the decisions rendered in the cases enumerated by Affiant 1 involved petitions for declaration of nullity of marriage which were granted by the RTC.[20]

Meanwhile, in her Affidavit[21] dated June 19, 2020, Affiant 2 alleged that she was the petitioner in a case for declaration of nullity of marriage before the RTC. Sometime in January 2020, she went to the trial court to follow up her case and met respondent, who gave his cellphone number. In February 2020, she asked respondent, through a text message, for an update of her case. Respondent told her that if she was in a hurry, he can have the certificate of finality expedited by sending a copy of the decision of the case to the OSG through a private courier upon payment of the amount of PHP 5,000.00. Affiant 2's lawyer, however, advised her to ""refrain from doing anything that is stupid."" She asked respondent for an update of her case on May 16, 2020, but respondent merely told her that he will prioritize her case and explained that the delay was due to the mailing of the decision through the Post Office.[22]

In an Investigation Report[23] dated June 26, 2020, Executive Judge Calo found substantial evidence to hold respondent guilty of gross misconduct.","Before the Court is a Letter-Complaint[1] dated December 27, 2019, from a person under the nom de plume ""Danilo D. Divinagracia"" (complainant) charging respondent Michael Vincent L. Ozon (respondent), Clerk III, Branch 1, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Butuan City, Agusan del Norte, with Gross Misconduct and violation of Republic Act No. 6713.[2]","After a careful review of the case records, the Court affirms the findings of Executive Judge Calo and the JIB and finds respondent administratively liable for gross misconduct for (1) demanding money from litigants for the release of certificates of finality and (2) sending copies of the decision in annulment cases pending before the RTC to the OSG via a private courier in exchange for money. Accordingly, respondent should be meted out the penalty of dismissal from service.

Respondent is guilty of the serious charge of Gross Misconduct.
""Misconduct is a transgression of some established and definite rule of action, more particularly, unlawful behavior or gross negligence by the public officer.""[46] The offense becomes gross misconduct when any of the elements of corruption, clear intent to violate the law, and flagrant disregard of established rule is present.[47]

Here, the elements of corruption and clear intent to violate the law are present.

Although respondent denied ever demanding money for the release of certificates of finality, his superior, Atty. Alabat-Torralba, corroborated complainant's allegation when she attested that one litigant came crying to her after not receiving the certificate of finality from her case despite having paid PHP 500.00 to respondent for its release.

Respondent's act of demanding money from litigants for the release of certificates of finality alone constitutes gross misconduct and warrants the ultimate penalty of dismissal. His bare denial is self-serving and a weak defense vis-à-vis Atty. Alabat-Torralba's positive testimony.

Worse, Atty. Alabat-Torralba also revealed during Judge Calo's investigation that respondent offered facilitation services to litigants in order to expedite the service of and receipt of the copy of the decision by the OSG. This allegation was supported by the sworn affidavits of Affiant 1 and Affiant 2 and corroborated by the findings of the JIB that respondent mailed copies of the decisions to the OSG via a private courier and had the signed return reverted to the RTC in the same manner.

A decision granting a petition for declaration of nullity of void marriages and annulment of void marriages becomes final upon the expiration of 15 days from notice to the parties, including the OSG, and no motion for reconsideration or new trial, or appeal is filed. Pertinent is Section 19 of A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC[48] which provides:

SECTION 19. Decision. — (1) If the court renders a decision granting the petition, it shall declare therein that the decree of absolute nullity or decree of annulment shall be issued by the court only after compliance with Articles 50 and 51 of the Family Code as implemented under the Rule on Liquidation, Partition and Distribution of Properties.

(2) The parties, including the Solicitor General and the public prosecutor, shall be served with copies of the decision personally or by registered mail. If the respondent summoned by publication failed to appear in the action, the dispositive part of the decision shall be published once in a newspaper of general circulation.

(3) The decision becomes final upon the expiration of fifteen days from notice to the parties. Entry of judgment shall be made if no motion for reconsideration or new trial, or appeal is filed by any of the parties, the public prosecutor, or the Solicitor General.

(4) Upon the finality of the decision, the court shall forthwith issue the corresponding decree if the parties have no properties.

If the parties have properties, the court shall observe the procedure prescribed in Section 21 of this Rule.","WHEREFORE, the Court finds respondent Michael Vincent L. Ozon, Clerk III of Branch 1, Regional Trial Court, Butuan City, Agusan del Norte, GUILTY of the serious charge of gross misconduct and DISMISSES him from the service with forfeiture of all benefits, except accrued leave credits, and disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office including government-owned or controlled corporation."

NEMIA ALMA Y. ALMANOCHE, COURT STENOGRAPHER III, BRANCH 10, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, MALAYBALAY CITY, BUKIDNON], PETITIONER, VS. NEMIA ALMA Y. ALMANOCHE, COURT STENOGRAPHER III, BRANCH 10, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, MALAYBALAY CITY, BUKIDNON, RESPONDENT.","Judge Camannong reported that on May 3, 2018, she learned from Louie Veluz (Veluz), a legal researcher in Branch 9, that the latter had received information from a certain Dianne Balansag (Balansag), a job order worker also in Branch 9, that Almanoche had solicited PHP 20,000.00 from a certain Jean Baguio (Baguio), allegedly in exchange for the dismissal of the criminal case against Baguio's two sons pending before Judge Camannong's sala. Almanoche allegedly told Baguio that the amount was for ""the judge, the fiscal, and the PAO.""[3]

Enraged by the information, Judge Camannong called up the prosecutor handling said criminal case, Prosecutor Iris T. Panganiban (Pros. Panganiban). Pros. Panganiban told Judge Camannong that Balansag and Baguio had already told her about the matter.[4]

Judge Camannong then relayed that on May 7, 2018, Pros. Panganiban brought Baguio to Judge Camannong's chambers where Baguio narrated the entire incident involving Almanoche. The Public Attorney's Office (PAO) lawyer handling the criminal case, Atty. Thania Marie Ibañez (Atty. Ibañez), was also present. When asked by Judge Camannong if she was willing to execute an affidavit detailing the matter, Baguio acceded,[5] and her affidavit was attached to Judge Camannong's letter to Judge Cole.[6]

In Baguio's Affidavit[7] dated May 8, 2018, she stated that she is the mother of the two accused in a frustrated murder case docketed as Criminal Case No. 32244-18 pending in Branch 9. She came to know of Almanoche through Loreta ""Auring"" O. Rico (Rico), who is the aunt of another co-accused in the same criminal case as Baguio's sons. On April 27, 2018, Baguio, a certain Fe Baguio, and Rico approached Almanoche, where the latter proposed to be given PHP 15,000.00 so that Almanoche could ""take care of the Prosecutor, the Judge, and the PAO.""[8] As Baguio did not have the full amount, and believing that Almanoche could help her, she gave Almanoche PHP 1,000.00 and promised to pay the balance on April 30, 2018. On April 28, 2018, she met with Rico, who showed her a text message from Almanoche that they should add PHP 5,000.00 because the case involves three accused. On April 29, 2018, she met with Kagawad Ricky James Balansag (Kagawad Balansag) to ask for financial help, who, in turn, suggested that the amount be given to the private complainant in the criminal case instead, a certain Mr. Remelito Binalo (Binalo). Nonetheless, Kagawad Balansag gave Baguio another PHP 5,000.00 to ""make [their] money PHP 20,000.00."" Thereafter on April 30, 2018, Baguio went to the Hall of Justice with Binalo and appeared before Pros. Panganiban so that Binalo could execute an Affidavit of Desistance) during which meeting she was ""able to mention"" the agreement she had with Almanoche.[9]

Acting on the letter of Judge Camannong, Judge Cole endorsed[10] the matter to Executive Judge Isobel G. Barroso (Judge Barroso) of the RTC in Malaybalay City, who then forwarded the same to the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) for appropriate action.[11]

In its Resolution,[12] this Court treated the Letter of Judge Camannong as a regular administrative matter against Almanoche for grave misconduct and corrupt practices and directed Almanoche to submit a comment.

In her Comment,[13] Almanoche vehemently denied the allegation against her. While she admitted that Rico, together with the other mothers of those accused in the criminal case, approached her for assistance, [14] she neither proposed any arrangement to settle the case,[15] nor has she accepted a single centavo from Baguio, or anyone for the settlement of any case in any court. She accommodated them because she and Rico are both Baes[16] of the Tagoloanen tribe, an indigenous cultural community.[17] She alleged that she merely advised them to go back to the Punong Barangay of Poblacion, Lantapan, Bukidnon so that Binalo, the private complainant in the criminal case, would be compelled to execute an Affidavit of Desistance and that her advice was based on Baguio's narration that they had already paid Binalo PHP 20,000.00 before the Office of the Punong Barangay. However, when they later inquired on the status of the case with the court, they discovered that the case had not yet been dismissed, and Binalo asked for an additional PHP 20,000.00 to execute an Affidavit of Desistance.[18] After the meeting, she no longer communicated with them. Almanoche claimed that she was not notified by either Judge Cole or Judge Barroso to explain herself at ""their level;"" and that it was unlikely for her to influence a judge, a prosecutor, and a PAO lawyer, especially when they are working in a different branch, while she is a mere stenographer.[19] To corroborate the material allegations in her Comment, Almanoche attached Rico's Affidavit.[20]","This Court resolves an administrative matter involving Nemia Alma Y. Almanoche (Almanoche), a Court Stenographer III of Branch 10, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Malaybalay City, Bukidnon.
This case arose from the Letter[1] of Presiding Judge Ma. Theresa A. Camannong (Judge Camannong) of Branch 9, RTC of Malaybalay City, Bukidnon (Branch 9), to Acting Presiding Judge Eldred D. Cole (Judge Cole) of Branch 10, RTC, Malaybalay City, Bukidnon (Branch 10). In her Letter, Judge Camannong informed Judge Cole of the alleged corrupt practices involving Almanoche.[2]","Upon a review of the established facts, this Court adopts the JIB's findings and recommended imposable penalty.

Reference to this Court's recently promulgated Further Amendments to Rule 140[41] of the Rules of Court (Rule 140) is appropriate as it now also governs the discipline of officials, employees, and personnel of the Judiciary. Although the alleged acts were perpetrated prior to the effectivity of the amendments, the amendments nonetheless govern, pursuant to Section 24[42] thereof.

Section 1(2) of Rule 140 requires that the allegations against Almanoche must be supported by affidavits of persons who have personal knowledge of the facts alleged therein or by authentic documents which may substantiate its allegations.

In the instant case, despite the accounts of several individuals that were implicated, it bears noting that only Baguio had personal knowledge of the April 27, 2018 incident involving Almanoche. Indeed, Judge Camannong and Veluz separately issued Manifestations[43] expressly stating that they had no personal knowledge of the incident involving Almanoche. In any event, we lend full credence to Baguio's testimony since, as astutely raised by Justice Amy C. Lazaro-Javier, it would be inconceivable for anyone to go so far, spreading such elaborate lies on different occasions to different people.

Moreover, while Judge Camannong, Pros. Panganiban, and Atty. Ibañez did not have personal knowledge of the incident involving Almanoche, it bears emphasis that Baguio, not long after the incident, narrated the event to one or all of them on separate occasions. The consistency in Baguio's details, as recalled by Judge Camannong, Pros. Panganiban, and Atty. Ibañez, strongly corroborates Baguio's account.

As adeptly underscored by Chief Justice Alexander G. Gesmundo, we are quick to clarify that, despite the lack of personal knowledge of Judge Camannong, Pros. Panganiban, and Atty. Ibañez on the incident of April 27, 2018, their accounts may nonetheless be admitted and given credence in view of Baguio's affidavit. Re: Verified Complaint dated July 13, 2015 of Alfonso Umali, Jr. v. Justice Hernandez[44] elucidates:

The relaxation of the hearsay rule in disciplinary administrative proceedings against judges and justices where bribery proceedings are involved is not a novel thought in this Court; it has been advocated in the Separate Concurring Opinion of Justice Arturo D. Brion in the administrative case of Justice Ong before this Court. The Opinion essentially maintained that the Court could make a conclusion that bribery had taken place when the circumstances—including those derived from hearsay evidence—sufficiently prove its occurrence. It was emphasized that [t]o satisfy the substantial evidence requirement for administrative cases, hearsay evidence should necessarily be supplemented and corroborated by other evidence that are not hearsay.

In the present case, however, the hearsay allegations constituted the totality of Umali’s evidence. The records did not contain any other piece of evidence to supplement the hearsay evidence. As earlier stated, Umali did not even attach any affidavit to the complaint relating to or tending to support the alleged attempted extortion. Umali relied mainly on surmises and conjectures, and on the mere fact that the Sandiganbayan rulings penned by Justice Hernandez were adverse to him.[45] (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)

From the foregoing and because the instant case is an administrative proceeding, the hearsay rule may be relaxed as the accounts of Judge Camannong, Pros. Panganiban, and Atty. Ibañez were supplemented and corroborated by Baguio's affidavit.","ACCORDINGLY, Nemia Alma Y. Almanoche is found GUILTY of serious dishonesty. She is ordered DISMISSED from service with forfeiture of all retirement benefits, except accrued leave credits. She is also disqualified from being re-employed in the government, including government-owned and controlled corporations."
"A.M. No. CA-23-001-P [Formerly JIB FPI No. 22-013-CA-P], January 30, 2024","COURT OF APPEALS, COMPLAINANT, VS. GARRY U. CALIWAN, MESSENGER, OFFICE OF THE DIVISION CLERK OF COURT, EDMUNDO T. MALIT, RECORDS OFFICER I, ARCHIVES SECTION, JUDICIAL RECORDS DIVISION, AND FREDERICK C. MAURICIO, UTILITY WORKER II, CIVIL CASES SECTION, JUDICIAL RECORDS DIVISION, ALL OF THE COURT OF APPEALS, MANILA RESPONDENTS.","On June 28, 2022, the CA conducted a random drug test in which Garry U. Caliwan (Caliwan), Edmundo T. Malit (Malit), and Frederick C. Mauricio (Mauricio) (collectively, respondents), all tested positive for methamphetamine [hydrochloride], also known as shabu, as confirmed by Labtox Analytical Laboratory, Inc., an accredited laboratory facility by the Department of Health – Dangerous Drugs Board.[2]

Consequently, the CA Committee on Ethics and Special Concerns recommended that respondents be held administratively liable for Grave Misconduct and accordingly dismissed from the service. For Mauricio, who opted for early retirement, the CA opined that he should be sanctioned instead with the forfeiture of the retirement benefits due to him as well as his perpetual disqualification from public service.[3]

The CA, through the Letter dated October 7, 2022, of Presiding Justice Salazar-Fernando, transmitted the case records to the Judicial Integrity Board (JIB) for appropriate action. Thereafter, the Office of the Executive Director (OED), JIB, required respondents to comment on the charges against them.[4]

In their separate Comments, Caliwan and Mauricio admitted to having used prohibited drugs, but they each prayed for the Court's leniency and benevolence in the disposition of their cases.[5] For Caliwan, he cited his exemplary record as evidenced by his performance ratings and the fact that this is his first offense in order to temper the disciplinary sanction against him.[6] As for Mauricio, he pointed to his 22-year government service in the CA as a mitigating circumstance in his favor.[7]

Malit, however, did not comply with the OED's directive to file a comment despite having sought several extensions of time to do so. Thus, the OED deemed the matter submitted for resolution based on the records at hand.[8]","This administrative matter pertains to the Letter[1] dated October 7, 2022, of Presiding Justice Remedios A. Salazar-Fernando (Presiding Justice Salazar-Fernando), Court of Appeals (CA), Manila regarding the administrative cases that the CA initiated against three of its personnel for the use of prohibited drugs.","The Court concurs with the findings and recommendations of the JIB.

It is settled that the use of prohibited drugs is tantamount to Grave Misconduct as the very act itself is a flagrant violation of Republic Act No. (RA) 9165, as amended by RA 10640, or the ""Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002.""[15] Thus, in the 2021 case of Re: Louie Mark U. De Guzman,[16] the Court imposed the penalty of dismissal from the service against the erring court employee for his proven use of marijuana, a dangerous drug.

It is significant to note, however, that Rule 140 of the Rules of Court, as further amended by A.M. No. 21-08-09-SC,[17] specifically classifies the Possession and/or Use of Illegal Drugs or Substances as a serious charge under Section 14(0) thereof. In other words, while past jurisp1udence has sanctioned the use of prohibited drugs under the umbrella of Grave Misconduct, the offense now squarely falls under the Possession and/or Use of Illegal Drugs or Substances when it is committed by those under the coverage of Rule 140.

This is in consonance with Section 6(A)(i) of A.M. No. 23-02-11-SC,[18] or the ""Guidelines for the Implementation of a Drug-Free Policy in the Philippine Judiciary"" (Guidelines), which states that a positive confirmatory or challenge test result for drug use, with the exception of test results arising from a court employee's voluntary submission to drug testing under Section 7 of the Guidelines, shall constitute as a sufficient basis for an administrative charge for Possession and/or Use of Illegal Drugs or Substances under Rule 140, as further amended.

The Guidelines also provide a voluntary submission mechanism through which a court employee may willingly submit himself or herself to drug testing before the conduct of a random drug test. As mentioned above, an initial positive drug test arising from this mechanism shall not be a ground for any administrative liability, but only for the first time. This means that if a court employee, who has already undergone and completed the treatment and/or drug rehabilitation program once, is found positive for drug use a second time after voluntarily submitting to a subsequent drug test, he or she shall be charged with the Possession and/or Use of Illegal Drugs or Substances accordingly.[19]

Thus, pursuant to the Guidelines, a court employee shall be held administratively liable for Possession and/or Use of Illegal Drugs or Substances under two scenarios: first, when he or she tests positive for drug use through a random drug test; and second, when he or she voluntarily submits himself or herself to drug testing and tests positive for drug use for a second time, despite having completed the treatment and/or drug rehabilitation program prior thereto.

In this connection, Section 17(1) of Rule 140, as further amended, provides the penalty to be imposed for a serious charge as follows:","WHEREFORE, the Court:
1)
Finds Garry U. Cali wan, Messenger, Office of the Division Clerk of Court, Court of Appeals, Manila, GUILTY of the Use of Prohibited Drugs or Substances and imposes against him the penalty of DISMISSAL FROM THE SERVICE, with forfeiture of all retirement benefits, except accrued leave credits, if any, and perpetual disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office, including government-owned and/or -controlled corporations;

Malit, Records Officer I, Archives Section, Judicial Records Division, Court of Appeals, Manila, GUILTY of the Use of Prohibited Drugs or Substances and imposes against him the penalty of DISMISSAL FROM THE SERVICE, with forfeiture of all retirement benefits, except accrued leave credits, if any, and perpetual disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office, including government-owned and/or -controlled corporations; and

"G.R. No. 198425, January 30, 2024","SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, PETITIONER, VS. HON. RODOLFO R. BONIFACIO, IN HIS CAPACITY AS THE PRESIDING JUDGE OF THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, BRANCH 159, PASIG CITY, PHILIPPINE ASSOCIATION OF SECURITIES BROKERS AND DEALERS, INC. (PASBDI), MA. VIVIAN YUCHENGCO, ISMAEL G. CRUZ, NESTOR S. AGUILA, AND MARITA A. LIMLINGAN, PHILIPPINE STOCK EXCHANGE (PSE) PSE'S 2009 NOMINATIONS AND ELECTIONS COMMITTEE (NOMELEC), RESPONDENTS.","On December 23, 1992, the Makati Stock Exchange and Manila Stock Exchange merged to what is now the PSE. Pursuant to then Batas Pambansa Bilang 178 (Batas Pambansa Blg. 178), otherwise known as the Revised Securities Act,[11] only member-brokers of PSE were allowed to trade in the securities listed therein.[12]

On August 8, 2000, Republic Act No. 8799, also known as The Securities Regulation Code, was passed into law, repealing Batas Pambansa Blg. 178. Under Section 4, the SEC was mandated to administer Republic Act No. 8799 as a collegial body, ""composed of a chairperson and four (4) Commissioners[.]""[13] At the same time, Section 33.2(c) of Republic Act No. 8799 decreed that a stock exchange must be organized as a stock corporation and registered with the SEC. Consequently, the PSE was reorganized and transformed into a stock corporation and was publicly listed.[14] Section 33.2 of Republic Act No. 8799 pertinently provides:
SECTION 33. Registration of Exchanges. –

. . . .

33.2. Registration of an Exchange shall be granted upon compliance with the following provisions:

. . . .

(c) Where the Exchange is organized as a stock corporation, that no person may beneficially own or control, directly or indirectly, more than five percent (5%) of the voting rights of the Exchange and no industry or business group may beneficially own or control, directly or indirectly, more than twenty percent (20%) of the voting rights of the Exchange: Provided, however, That the Commission may adopt rules, regulations or issue an order, upon application, exempting an applicant from this prohibition where it finds that such ownership or control will not negatively impact on the exchange's ability to effectively operate in the public interest[.] (Emphasis in the original)
On September 23, 2005, the SEC issued a letter[15] to the PSE, instructing its compliance with the requirements of Section 33.2(c). According to the SEC, brokers are considered as a business industry. More, their records confirmed that at least 35.33% of the outstanding shares of the PSE were owned by such brokers. For exceeding the statutory limit of 20%, and for violating Republic Act No. 8799, the SEC required the PSE to submit an action plan for purposes of compliance with the industry ownership limit.","Cast against a similar factual backdrop are three consolidated Petitions filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) assailing the jurisdiction of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) with respect to the acts of the SEC in the exercise of its quasi-legislative powers as well as the propriety of the writ of preliminary injunction granted by it, which allowed the Philippine Association of Securities Brokers and Dealers, Inc. (PASBDI) to vote their entire shareholdings in the 2010 and 2011 Annual Stockholders' Meeting.

In particular, the Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court in G.R. No. 198425 filed by the SEC assailed the Decision[2] and the Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA), which dismissed the SEC's Petition for Certiorari of the Order[4] allowing all the brokers shareholders to vote with their entire shareholdings in the 2010 Annual Stockholders' Meeting of the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE).

Meanwhile, the Petition for Certiorari[5] under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court in G.R. No. 201174 filed by the SEC assailed the Order,[6] which granted the Urgent Motion for Issuance of a Writ of Preliminary Injunction[7] filed by the PASBDI, Ma. Vivian Yuchengco, Ismael G. Cruz, Nestor S. Aguila, and Marita A. Limlingan (PASBDI et al.) The writ similarly allowed all the brokers to vote to the extent of their entire shareholdings in the 2011 Annual Stockholders' Meeting of the PSE.

Finally, the Petition for Review on Certiorari[8] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court in G.R. No. 244462 filed by the SEC assailed the Decision[9] of the CA, which denied its appeal of the Decision[10] rendered by the RTC. The RTC Decision permanently enjoined the SEC and the PSE from imposing any limitation or restriction on the voting rights of PASBDI and the individual shareholders.","To begin with, this Court holds that pursuant to the parties' manifestations in their respective compliances; the issues arising from the consolidated petitions are moot and academic. It must be stressed, however, that PASBDI itself insists on the resolution of the case and maintains. the validity of the assailed injunction orders.

For argument's sake, while it is recognized that this Court usually stays its hand from resolving a case that has been rendered moot and academic by reason of supervening events, it nevertheless assumes jurisdiction over a case when it is capable of repetition, yet evading review.[72]

Records of the PSE show that while the voting rights of brokers and shareholders have been compliant with the 20% ownership limit for January to September 2023, such period of compliance was all too narrow, i.e., a mere nine months for the year 2023. Here, no evidence of compliance or explanation was given for the years 2012 to 2022. There was also no submission of the succeeding NOMELEC Rules to verify if the proper interpretation of Section 33.2(c) was reflected therein. Also, with the continuous exchanges in the PSE, there is no guarantee that the shareholdings of the brokers as stated in the parties' compliance would remain as it is.

Taken together, such pieces of evidence are by no means conclusive to ensure that the erroneous interpretation and implementation of Section 33.2(c) by the PSE would never again arise. Thus, there is much significance and practical value for this Court to resolve the issues invoked in this case, if only to prevent similar questions from re-emerging. Aside from laying down the proper interpretation and implementation of Section 33.2(c), this Court lays down a definitive delineation as to the jurisdiction of the RTC on questions regarding the quasi-legislative functions vis-à-vis the quasi-­judicial functions of administrative agencies.

After a circumspect study of the consolidated petitions and its records, this Court finds them partly meritorious. The issues shall be tackled in seriatim.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari in G.R. No. 198425 is PARTLY GRANTED. The assailed Court of Appeals April 11, 2011 Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 114413, insofar as it grants the petition for a writ of preliminary injunction against the Securities and Exchange Commission, is REVERSED and SET ASIDE. However, the grant of the writ of preliminary injunction as against the Philippine Stock Exchange and the Nominations and Elections Committee is AFFIRMED.

The Petition for Certiorari in G.R. No. 201174 is GRANTED. The May 5, 2011 Order issued in SEC Case No. 10-139 granting the Urgent Motion for Issuance of a Writ of Preliminary Injunction against the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Philippine Stock Exchange, and the Nominations and Elections Committee is REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

The Petition for Review on Certiorari in G.R. No. 244462 is PARTLY GRANTED. The assailed Court of Appeals January 23, 2019 Decision in CA-G.R.

However, the grant of the writ of preliminary injunction against the Philippine Stock Exchange and the Nominations and Elections Committee with regard to Rule 2 of the 2010 Nominations and Elections Committee Rules is AFFIRMED.

The Philippine Stock Exchange and its Nominations and Elections Committee are enjoined from limiting the voting rights of brokers to 20% of their total shareholdings so long as the voting rights of brokers as an industry group, do not exceed 20% of the total outstanding capital stock of the Philippine Stock Exchange. A shareholder seeking for exemption from the 20% limitation on the voting rights of brokers, as an industry group, must file the corresponding application with the Securities and Exchange Commission."
"G.R. No. 246787, January 30, 2024","SPOUSES ENRIQUE LLONILLO AND MARITES LLONILLO, PETITIONERS, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","Spouses Llonillo were charged with the crime of Estafa under Article 318 of the Revised Penal Code (Other Deceits) before the MeTC in an Information[6] dated December 17, 2012, which reads:

On the 30th day of March 2009, in the city of Makati, [] Philippines, accused[,] conspiring and confederating together and both of them mutually helping and aiding one another, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously defraud complainant Pedro Joel V. Caspillo in the following manner; accused by means of false manifestation and fraudulent representations they made to complainant to the effect that Unit H[,] at No. 236 Aguho St., was free from any encumbrances whatsoever and that by way of interest for loan extended, complainant is entitled to collect the rental directly from the occupants of the said unit, which representation they know for a fact to be false considering that the unit is already encumbered in violation of the Deed of Mortgage they executed, and that the rental cannot be collected as the occupant has previously entered into a similar agreement with accused and there appears to be no other reason but only to convince the complainant to part with his [PHP] 300,000.00 and in fact complainant delivered the amount to the accused, to his damage and prejudice.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[7]

Upon arraignment, spouses Llonillo pleaded not guilty to the crime charged.[8]

Pre-trial was conducted and thereafter, trial on the merits ensued.[9]

The facts, according to the prosecution,[10] are as follows:

Sometime in March 2009, spouses Llonillo approached private complainant Pedro Joel Caspillo (Caspillo) through Grace Pangan (Grace), their purported agent, and offered Caspillo a sangla-tira arrangement on several units of the two buildings they own located at 236 Aguho Street, Barangay Comembo, Makati City. Spouses Llonillo explained that they were looking for persons who could lend them money for a fixed period. They would enter into a written contract with the lender, and in consideration, the lender will be entitled to the rent of the apartment unit as interest, in the amount of PHP 10,000.00 per month. The loan will be paid in full at the end of the period agreed upon.[11]

Spouses Llonillo assured Caspillo that the buildings and lots where the apartment units were built had no prior liens or encumbrances and showed him the Transfer Certificates of Title (TCT) covering the said properties.[12]

Enticed with spouses Llonillo's offer and assured that the properties were unencumbered, Caspillo lent them PHP 300,000.00 on March 30, 2009. Caspillo chose apartment unit H, which was unoccupied at that time. Simultaneously, Caspillo and spouses Llonillo executed a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), where spouses Llonillo acknowledged receipt of the money, to be paid on or before March 20, 2010. The agreement as to the interest of PHP 10,000.00 per month was not indicated in the MOA since Caspillo himself occupied the unit.[13]

After 10 days, Caspillo put up unit H for rent and leased it to a friend, who only occupied it for a month. Caspillo then decided to use the unit by putting up a mini store, but it turned out to be unprofitable. Marites offered to find a lessee for unit H and assured Caspillo about the payment of the PHP 10,000.00 monthly rental.[14]

Unit H was thereafter occupied, but Caspillo failed to collect the monthly rentals thereon. Caspillo investigated the property and discovered that spouses Llonillo and the occupants of unit H, Germalyn Josol (Josol) and Rodrigo Arevalo, Jr. (Arevalo, Jr.), also entered into a sangla-tira arrangement over the same unit. Upon verification with the Registry of Deeds of Makati City, Caspillo also discovered that the properties involved in the sangla-tira arrangement were mortgaged to different banks, contrary to spouses Llonillo's representation during the negotiation.[15]

The period agreed upon in the MOA for the payment of the PHP 300,000.00 lapsed without any payment from the spouses Llonillo. Thus, Caspillo filed a complaint against spouses Llonillo for estafa under Article 318 of the Revised Penal Code.[16]

Spouses Llonillo denied the charges against them and interposed the following narrative[17] in their defense:","Before the Court is a Petition for Review[1] (Petition) on certiorari of the Decision[2] and Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA) which affirmed the Decision[4] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC). The RTC affirmed the Decision[5] of the Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC), which found petitioners, spouses Enrique Llonillo (Enrique) and Marites Llonillo (Marites; collectively, spouses Llonillo), guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Other Deceits defined and penalized under Article 318, first paragraph of the Revised Penal Code.","The Petition is meritorious. While the MeTC had jurisdiction to hear, try, and decide the case, spouses Llonillo cannot be convicted of the crime charged.

At the outset, spouses Llonillo's arguments require the Court to examine the facts anew, which is beyond the ambit of a petition for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. The determination of guilt is a question of fact, not entertained in a petition for review under Rule 45. Time and again, jurisprudence has established that the Court is not a trier of facts. Indeed, ordinarily, a petition for review on certiorari is limited only to questions of law.[43]

Nonetheless, under exceptional circumstances, this Court admits and reviews questions of fact under Rule 45, which exceptions include: (1) when the conclusion is a finding grounded entirely on speculation, surmises or conjectures; (2) when the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible; (3) where there is a grave abuse of discretion; (4) when the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts; (5) when the findings of fact are conflicting; (6) when the CA, in making its findings, went beyond the issues of the case and the same is contrary to the admissions of both appellant and appellee; (7) the findings of the CA are contrary to those of the trial court; (8) when the findings of fact are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based; (9) when the facts set forth in the petition, as well as in the petitioner's main and reply briefs are not disputed by the respondents; and (10) the finding of fact of the CA is premised on the supposed absence of evidence and is contradicted by the evidence on record.[44] The Court finds that the fourth exception applies to the case.

The Information herein sufficiently conferred upon the MeTC the authority to hear, try, and decide the case
Spouses Llonillo rely on Quisay in arguing that the criminal case against them should have been dismissed due to the lack of written authority of the chief prosecutor and/or deputy prosecutors in the Information.

Spouses Llonillo's argument is without merit. The doctrine in Quisay was abandoned by the Court in Gomez v. People,[45] as follows:

All told, the handling prosecutor's authority, particularly as it does not appear on the face of the Information, has no connection to the trial court's power to hear and decide a case. Hence, Sec. [3(d)], Rule 117, requiring a handling prosecutor to secure a prior written authority or approval from the provincial, city or chief state prosecutor before filing an Information with the courts, may be waived by the accused through silence, acquiescence, or failure to raise such ground during arraignment or before entering a plea. If, at all, such deficiency is merely formal and can be cured at any stage of the proceedings in a criminal case.

Moreover, both the State and the accused are entitled to the constitutional guarantee of due process — especially when the most contentious of issues involve jurisdictional matters. A denial of such guarantee against any of the parties of the case amounts to grave abuse of discretion. Consequently, a judgment of acquittal or order of dismissal amounting to an acquittal which is tainted with grave abuse of discretion becomes void and cannot amount to a first jeopardy.

Henceforth, all previous doctrines laid down by this Court, holding that the lack of signature and approval of the provincial, city or chief state prosecutor on the face of the Information shall divest the court of jurisdiction over the person of the accused and the subject matter in a criminal action, are hereby abandoned. It is sufficient for the validity of the Information or Complaint, as the case may be, that the Resolution of the investigating prosecutor recommending for the filing of the same in court bears the imprimatur of the provincial, city or chief state prosecutor whose approval is required by Sec. 1 of R.A. No. 5180 and is adopted under Sec. 4, Rule 112 of the Rules of Court.[46]

Accordingly, the MeTC had jurisdiction to hear, try, and decide the instant case.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is GRANTED. The July 30, 2018 Decision and the April 15, 2019 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR. No. 38855 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

Otherwise, the decision is incomplete and cannot be the subject of execution.","It is rather unfortunate that the present case reached this stage when the controversy could have been averted if only the courts a quo had properly applied Rules 68, Sections 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court. On account of this inadvertence, the Petition is partially impressed with merit.

A judgment on judicial foreclosure should render judgment for the sum due and order the same to be paid within a period of 90-120 days from entry of judgment
Rule 68, Section 2 of the Rules of Court provides for the manner of resolving an action for foreclosure and enumerates the contents of the judgment thereon. Section 2 reads as follows:

Section 2. Judgment on foreclosure for payment or sale. — If upon the trial in such action the court shall find the facts set forth in the complaint to be true, it shall ascertain the amount due to the plaintiff upon the mortgage debt or obligation, including interest and other charges as approved by the court, and costs, and shall render judgment for the sum so found due and order that the same be paid to the court or to the judgment obligee within a period of not less than ninety (90) days nor more than one hundred twenty (120) days from the entry of judgment, and that in default of such payment the property shall be sold at public auction to satisfy the judgment. (Emphasis supplied)

Section 2 expressly mandates the trial court (1) to render judgment on the amount due and thereafter (2) order the judgment debtor to pay the sum within 90 days, but no longer than 120 days from entry of judgment. It is only when the judgment debtor defaults from paying the amount that the trial court shall order the property sold at public auction following the guidelines under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court.

A plain reading of the fallo of the February 17, 2011 Decision shows that the RTC, Branch 153 merely declared the disputed property as foreclosed, and ordered spouses Tiglao to pay for attorney's fees in the amount of PHP 60,000.00. Evident therefrom that it failed to strictly adhere to the requirements laid down in Section 2 by indicating the amount as well as the period to pay the same. It bears emphasis that there was nothing erroneous with the decision, only that it was incomplete in view of the requirements laid down by Rule 68, Section 2 of the Rules of Court.

Interestingly, the RTC, Branch 153 had been sufficiently apprised of such omission when spouses Tiglao ironically moved for the execution of the February 17, 2011 Decision. Spouses Tiglao pointed out that the said Decision was silent as to how it can be executed pursuant to Rule 68, Section 2. Despite this information, the RTC, Branch 153 merely granted the Motion mainly because of spouses Tiglao's averments and spouses Lontoc's manifestation that they had no objection against the Motion. It was at this point that the RTC, Branch 153 committed the error of granting the Motion instead of merely amending its February 17, 2011 Decision.

The ruling in Rodriguez v. Caoibes,[49] which the Court reiterated in Philippine Trust Company v. Policarpio,[50] finds relevance in the case at bar. Rodriguez dealt with the incomplete disposition of the trial court in a foreclosure proceeding when it failed to indicate the period within which the judgment obligee should pay. In resolving the matter, the Court said that the trial court may still amend the incomplete decision despite having attained finality, in order to conform with the rules. The Court also clarified that instead of appealing the incomplete decision, the parties should have merely invited the attention of the court to the flaw in its judgment:

The case at hand is for the foreclosure of a mortgage. It was tried as such in the Court of First Instance of Batangas as well as in this court on appeal. In reversing the appealed decision, by an involuntary omission it was not ordered to deposit the amount of the judgment with the clerk of the court of origin, within a period of not less than three months, and, in default thereof, to sell the mortgaged properties to pay the mortgage indebtedness and the costs. This involuntary omission of an imperative mandate of section 256 of the Code of Civil Procedure, . . . cannot alter the nature of the action, and the amendment of the decision may be asked to correct the defect, inasmuch as said provision is a necessary part hereof.

On this point the American jurisprudence has laid down the following doctrine:","ACCORDINGLY, the Court GRANTS IN PART the Petition for Review on Certiorari; REVERSES and SETS ASIDE the September 10, 2014 Decision and the April 6, 2015 Resolution rendered by the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 125188; and AMENDS the February 17, 2011 Decision of Branch 153, Regional Trial Court of Pasig City in SCA Case No. 3340-TG, to read as follows:

"G.R. No. 246489, January 29, 2024","SPOUSES CHRISTOPHER AND CARMEN NUÑEZ, PETITIONERS, VS. DR. HENRY DAZ, RESPONDENT.","On June 27, 2006, 2-year old John Ray Nuñez (John Ray) underwent a craniectomy[6] to remove a cancerous tumor from his brain.[7] During the surgery, John Ray experienced hypothermia that necessitated his resuscitation. Petitioners alleged that Dr. Daz, the anesthesiologist, applied a hot water bag on John Ray's legs to address his decreased temperature.[8] However, the water bag burst, and the hot water spilled on John Ray ""causing him to suffer third-degree (sic) burns on his right thigh, supra-pubic area and hands.""[9]

After the surgery, Dr. Jesus Nigos (Dr. Nigos), one of the neurosurgeons, informed Christopher that the removal of his son's tumor was close to a success, were it not for the bursting of the hot water bag, which lead to the scalding of parts of John Ray's body.[10] Due to the burns, his right fifth digit and left thumb were amputated.[11] He also underwent skin grafting surgery for his third degree burns. These delayed the chemotherapy which was supposed to be conducted within 15 to 30 days after the surgery to remove whatever is left of the tumor.[12]

During the time when the burns were being treated, it was discovered that the brain tumor recurred. Hence, On October 3, 2006, John Ray underwent another operation. During the surgery, however, John Ray succumbed to death.[13]

His death certificate reads:

I.
Immediate cause:
a.
Cardiorespiratory Arrest

Antecedent [c]ause:
b.
Brain Herniation

Underlying cause:
c.
Intracranial teratoma S/P Craniectomy, Excision of Tumor




II.	Other significant conditions	 	 
 	Contributing to death:	 	Pneumonia



Tumor blood[14]
The petitioners filed before the Office of the City Prosecutor-Baguio City a case for Reckless Imprudence Resulting in Homicide, docketed as I.S. No. 07-1117, against Dr. Nigos, Dr. Joey Lucas, and the assisting nurses, which was, however, dismissed. Elsewhere in said charge, it was stated that Dr. Daz was the child's anesthesiologist. It was further narrated that the scaled burns were allegedly sustained by John Ray when the hot water bag used to resuscitate John Ray from hypothermia, allegedly under the administration of Dr. Daz, may have allegedly ruptured.[15]

Thus, an Information[16] for Reckless Imprudence Resulting in Homicide was filed on January 29, 2008, where Dr. Daz stood charged and was tried.","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court filed by spouses Christopher (Christopher) and Carmen Nuñez (collectively, the petitioners), assailing the Court of Appeals (CA) Decision,[2] dated July 13, 2018, and the Resolution,[3] dated March 19, 2019, in CA-G.R. CV No. 104749. The assailed Decision affirmed with modification the Decision,[4] dated September 17, 2014, and the Order,[5] dated October 27, 2014, of Branch 3, Regional Trial Court, Baguio City (RTC) in Criminal Case No. 27961-R, finding Dr. Henry Daz (Dr. Daz) not guilty of Reckless Imprudence Resulting in Homicide.","The Court denies the Petition for failing to show that the CA committed a reversible error.

Scope of a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45
It is settled that the Court is not a trier of facts. In a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, the function of the Court is limited to reviewing the errors of law which lower courts may have committed.[27] Where the issues are factual in nature, its determination should be left to the trial courts.[28] The factual findings of the trial court, especially when affirmed by the CA, are generally binding and conclusive on this Court.[29]

Here, the petitioners argue that this case is covered by the following exceptions to the general rule that this Court is not a trier of facts: (1) when the CA's findings are contrary to that of the trial court; and (2) when the CA manifestly overlooked certain relevant facts not disputed by the parties, which if properly considered, would justify a different conclusion.[30]

Dr. Daz, in his Comment,[31] counters that aside from the award of damages, both the RTC and the CA are unanimous in acquitting Dr. Daz.[32]

The petitioners' argument is erroneous.

As to the first exception, the CA did not disagree with the findings of fact by the RTC. What the CA disagreed with is the award of damages in favor of the petitioners. As to the second exception, all relevant facts were sufficiently passed upon by the CA.

For these reasons alone, the Petition for Review on Certiorari should be denied.

The rules on appeals from a judgment of acquittal
When an accused has been acquitted, or the case against her or him is dismissed by a court of competent jurisdiction, upon a valid complaint or information, and after the accused had pleaded to the charge, the acquittal of the accused or the dismissal of the case shall be a bar to another prosecution for the offense charged.[33] This principle is also known as double jeopardy. The existence of double jeopardy calls for the application of the ""finality-of-acquittal"" rule, which makes a judgment of acquittal unappealable and immediately executory upon its promulgation.[34]

Here, while the petitioners are questioning the deletion of the award of damages, they were essentially questioning the criminal aspect of the case, and corollarily Dr. Daz' acquittal. Although a Rule 65 petition for certiorari is allowed to question such a dismissal if committed with grave abuse of discretion, such action may only be filed by the Office of the Solicitor General on behalf of the People of the Philippines.[35]

The private complainant is only allowed to initiate the same if the question raised pertains solely to the civil aspect.[36]

Here, clearly, the petitioners were challenging the acquittal of Dr. Daz in their action before the CA. The Court agrees with Dr. Daz that a reading of the present Petition is actually an appeal of the judgment of acquittal since the Petition essentially prays for the Court to revisit the facts established by the RTC.[37] This is not allowed.

Dr. Daz was not found to be the author of the act or omission complained of
The Court has consistently held that there are two kinds of acquittal: (1) that the accused is not the author of the act or omission complained of; and (2) that the prosecutor failed to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. Although they have the same effect on the acquittal of the accused, their effects differ as to the accused' civil liability. The Court held in Manantan v. Court of Appeals:[38]

Our law recognizes two kinds of acquittal, with different effects on the civil liability of the accused. First is an acquittal on the ground that the accused is not the author of the act or omission complained of. This instance closes the door to civil liability, for a person who has been found to be not the perpetrator of any act or omission cannot and can never be held liable for such act or omission. There being no delict, civil liability ex delicto is out of the question, and the civil action, if any, which may be instituted must be based on grounds other than the delict complained of. This is the situation contemplated in Rule 111 of the Rules of Court. The second instance is an acquittal based on reasonable doubt on the guilt of the accused. In this case, even if the guilt of the accused has not been satisfactorily established, he is not exempt from civil liability which may be proved by preponderance of evidence only[.][39] (Citations omitted)

Moreover, in Daluraya v. Oliva[40] citing Dayap v. Sendiong:[41]

The acquittal of the accused does not automatically preclude a judgment against him on the civil aspect of the case. The extinction of the penal action does not carry with it the extinction of the civil liability where: (a) the acquittal is based on reasonable doubt as only preponderance of evidence is required; (b) the court declares that the liability of the accused is only civil; and (c) the civil liability of the accused does not arise from or is not based upon the crime of which the accused is acquitted. However, the civil action based on delict may be deemed extinguished if there is a finding on the final judgment in the criminal action that the act or omission from which the civil liability may arise did not exist or where the accused did not commit the acts or omission imputed to him.[42]

The present case falls under the first kind of acquittal, i.e., the accused is not the author of the act or omission complained of. In its Decision, the RTC clearly and categorically found that ""Dr. Daz could not be blamed on the mere fact that the hot water bag gave way or may have been ruptured."" Worse, the prosecution miserably failed to offer any evidence that a hot water bag broke:","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari filed by petitioners spouses Christopher and Carmen Nuñez is DENIED.

Adriatico, with the effect of restricting her movement or conduct, to her damage and prejudice.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[9]
Upon arraignment, petitioner pleaded ""Not Guilty"" to the charges.[10]

Trial on the merits ensued.[11]","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court filed by Rommel Z. Borja (petitioner) which assails the Decision[2] dated October 13, 2020, and the Resolution[3] dated November 22, 2021 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR No. 41059. The CA affirmed the Judgment[4] dated January 5, 2018, of Branch 93, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Balanga City, Bataan in Criminal Case No. 16965 that found petitioner guilty of violation of Section 5 (a) of Republic Act No. 9262 otherwise known as the ""Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act of 2004,""[5] committed against his live-in partner and herein private complainant Aileen Joy G. Adriatico (Aileen).[6]

Meanwhile, in Criminal Case No. 16966, the RTC acquitted petitioner of violating Section 5(e)(4)[7] of the same law for failure of the prosecution to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.","The Court denies the petition.

The Court finds no reason to deviate from the factual findings of the RTC and the CA. The RTC's findings, when adopted and confirmed by the CA, are binding and conclusive on the Court. In the case, the issue on which the petition is hinged is purely factual and not appropriate in a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45.[34]

In any case, Aileen's testimony was categorical and unequivocal. She narrated that on August 3, 2016, at about 1:30 a.m., she asked petitioner to face her as they were about to go to sleep. However, petitioner got furious; he took a gun from the cabinet at the right side of the bed and tucked it on his waist. He then went near Aileen, pulled her shirt, and squeezed her collar. At that point, he held Aileen's hands and punched her leg as he berated her and shouted: ""putang ina mo!""[35] The RTC's determination of the credibility of the witness is seldom disturbed on appeal unless significant matters were overlooked. Absent any indication that the RTC committed any error in the evaluation of the evidence, the Court sees no reason to deviate from the following factual findings:[36]
In Criminal Case No. 16965, the prosecution was able to establish that the accused caused physical harm upon Aileen on August 03, 2016 at around 1:30 in the morning. At that particular time, Aileen and the accused were inside the room of the accused in the latter's house located at Brgy. Lati, Orion, Bataan. They just arrived from Manila and they were about to sleep when the accused got angry when Aileen wanted him to face her. The accused suddenly got furious[,] took a gun from the cabinet and tucked the same in his waist. The accused held her hands and then punched her leg. On August 4, 2016, Aileen reported the incident to the police. At 3:56 in the afternoon on August 4, 2016, Aileen went to Bataan General Hospital where she was treated and was diagnosed to have suffered hematoma in her right and hematoma in the lateral side of her left leg which injuries required medical attention or incapacitated her for three to nine days. The accused's bare denial cannot prevail over the positive testimony of the accused.[37]

" G.R. No. 266754, January 29, 2024","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. MARIVIC SALDIVAR Y REGATCHO, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","The case stemmed from an Information[4] filed against Saldivar, the accusatory portion of which reads:
On or about and sometime during period from March 2016 through May 2017, in the xxxxxxxxxxx,* the [sic] Philippines, accused taking advantage of the vulnerability of complainant [AAA266754], a street child, 14 years of age, a minor, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously take custody of and shelter in, harbor and recruit said minor for the purpose of prostitution and sexual exploitation, by acting as procurer for different customers, for money, profit or any other consideration, in violation of the above-cited law.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[5]
Upon arraignment, Saldivar pleaded not guilty to the charge. Pre-trial followed, and trial on the merits subsequently ensued.[6]

The prosecution narrated that AAA266754, a 14-year-old minor, became a vagrant after running away from home. She and her friends ended up staying in xxxxxxxxxxx where they solicited money from passengers. Later, AAA266754 was introduced by her friend, Fordelyn Ayala (Ayala), to Saldivar whom AAA266754 started to live with. However, Saldivar would often pimp AAA266754 to the men who also bought drugs from her. AAA266754 even saw Saldivar receive money from these men before she was sexually abused. The abuses continued for a year until AAA266754 was rescued by the Emergency Welfare Section of the xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.[7]

During the investigation, Social Welfare Officer I Genesis M. Panganiban (SWO1 Panganiban) interviewed Saldivar[8] who claimed that it was AAA266754's own decision to subject herself to prostitution.[9] It was even AAA266754 who handed her money earned from sex work when she arrived home from these.[10] Saldivar nonetheless admitted that there were times that she would point men to AAA266754 if they asked her where they could find girls to have sex with. However, Saldivar insisted that it was still AAA266754's decision to accept or decline the offer.[11]

Upon examination, Dr. Voltaire P. Nulud (Dr. Nulud) issued an Initial Medico-Legal Report,[12] which found that AAA266754 sustained deep healed lacerations in the hymen. The report also indicated that there was clear evidence of blunt penetrating trauma to the hymen.[13]

On the part of the defense, Saldivar denied the allegations.[14] She claimed that AAA266754 voluntarily engaged in prostitution, and that when Saldivar's male friends would come to her looking for women they could pay for sexual acts, AAA266754 volunteered herself.[15] Saldivar also alleged that AAA266754 was angry at her for asking her to leave, as Saldivar and her family would often be affected when the police officers ask AAA266754 and her friends, who were allegedly rugby sniffers, to evacuate the area there Saldivar and her family lived.[16] Finally, Saldivar narrated that officers of the MSWD had a motive for fabricating a case against her. She pointed to Maria Luisa Mangili, the social welfare officer who assisted AAA266754 in filing her complaint, as the same person who previously filed a complaint for human trafficking against her before the Office of the City Prosecutor of xxxxxxxxxxx.[17] Saldivar also recalled another incident when SWO1 Panganiban told her that she was so hardheaded in going back to the streets that she needed to be taught a lesson.[18]

In its Decision,[19] the RTC found Saldivar guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 6(a) of Republic Act No. 9208, as amended by Republic Act No. 10364, the dispositive portion of which reads:
WHEREFORE, the Court renders judgment finding accused Marivic [Saldivar y Regatcho] GUILTY of the crime of violation of Section 6 paragraph (a) of Republic Act No. 9208, as amended.

The crime of qualified trafficking in persons is defined by Section 4(a) and Section 6 of Republic Act No. 9208, as amended by Republic Act No. 11862, as follows:
SECTION. 4. Acts of Trafficking in Persons. – It shall be unlawful for any person, natural or juridical, to commit any of the following acts:

(a) To recruit, obtain, hire, provide, offer, transport, transfer, maintain, harbor, or receive a person by any means, including those done under the pretext of domestic or overseas employment or training or apprenticeship, for the purpose of prostitution, pornography, sexual abuse or exploitation, production, creation, or distribution of CSAEM or CSAM, forced labor, slavery, involuntary servitude, or debt bondage;

. . . .

SECTION. 6. Qualified Trafficking in Persons. – Violations of Section 4 of this Act shall be considered as qualified trafficking:

(a) When the trafficked person is a child: Provided, That acts of online sexual abuse and exploitation of children shall be without prejudice to appropriate investigation and prosecution under other related laws[.] (Emphasis supplied)
In People v. Casio,[35] this Court enumerated the elements of trafficking in persons as follows:
The elements of trafficking in persons can be derived from its definition under Section 3(a) of Republic Act No. 9208, thus: 
 
(1)
The act of ""recruitment, transportation, transfer or harbouring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders[;]""


(2)
The means used which include ""threat or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the person, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another; [sic] and


(3)
The purpose of trafficking is exploitation which includes ""exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs.""[36] (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)
All the elements of qualified trafficking in persons are present in this case, as proven by the testimony of AAA266754, who clearly narrated how accused-appellant recruited her, taking advantage of her minority and financial need as a vagrant child, for the purpose of prostitution. AAA266754 categorically testified that accused-appellant gave her to male customers, thus:","ACCORDINGLY, the Appeal is DISMISSED. The July 16, 2021 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

That in May 2004 or sometime prior or subsequent thereto, in the Municipality of Barugo, Leyte and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, accused public officers, Juliana Acuin Villasin, Aluino Otibar Ala and Reynaldo Agner Bodo, being the Municipal Mayor, Municipal Accountant, and Municipal Agriculturist, respectively, of the Municipality of Barugo Leyte, while in the performance of their official functions and committing the offense in relation to office, taking advantage of their official position, acting with manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence, conspiring and confederating with one another, did then and there willfully, unlawfully, and criminally gave Bals Enterprises unwarranted benefits, privilege and advantage by causing and/or approving the procurement of 3,900 liters of Fil-Ocean liquid fertilizer from Bals Enterprises without the participation of Municipality's Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) and without public bidding, in violation of the provisions of [Republic Act No.] 9184 (The Government Procurement Act); making reference to the brand name Fil-Ocean liquid fertilizer in the invitation to bid, purchase request, and purchase order, in violation of Section 18 of [Republic Act No.] 9184; and causing the payment of [PHP ]500.00 per liter of Fil-Ocean liquid fertilizer or the total amount of [PHP ]1,950,000.00 or [PHP ]1,879,090.92 net of tax, and causing undue injury to the local government of Barugo, Leyte in the total amount of [PHP ]1,879,090.92 more or less.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[8]
On November 28, 2016, Villasin, Ala, and Bodo were arraigned and pleaded ""not guilty:""[9]","Before the Court is an ordinary appeal[1] by the accused-appellant, Juliana Acuin Villasin (Villasin), from the Decision[2] dated January 29, 2021 rendered by the Sandiganbayan Second Division (Sandiganbayan) in Crim.

The assailed Decision found Villasin guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Section 3(e) of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act or Republic Act No. 3019, as amended.","The appeal is meritorious.

In the En Banc case of Martel v. People[41] (Martel), it was categorically held that a violation of procurement laws does not ipso facto give rise to a violation of Republic Act No. 3019.[42] Martel likewise emphasized that any finding of a violation of Republic Act No. 3019 must be grounded on graft and corruption, or the acquisition of gain in dishonest ways.[43]

To convict an accused under Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019, the prosecution must sufficiently establish the following elements: (1) that the accused must be a public officer discharging administrative, judicial, or official functions; (2) that the accused must have acted with manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence; and (3) that the action of the accused caused undue injury to any party, including the government, or gave any private party unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of the functions of the accused.[44]

While Villasin, being Mayor of the Municipality at the time the alleged offense occurred, fulfills the first element, the second and third elements are wholly absent.","ACCORDINGLY, the appeal is GRANTED.

CONTRARY TO LAW.""[11]

Margaret pleaded not guilty in Criminal Case No. O-670. During her arraignment, Margaret's counsel de parte manifested that Cipriano already died and presented the certified true copy of his death certificate. The People, through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), confirmed Cipriano's name on the death certificate and interposed no objection to dismissing the case against him. As such, the case against Cipriano was ordered dismissed. Thereafter, Criminal Case No. O-671 was consolidated with Criminal Case No. O-670.[12]

Upon her arraignment in Criminal Case No. O-671, Margaret likewise pleaded not guilty. Meanwhile, the second case against Cipriano was also dismissed due to his death.[13] Trial then ensued.

After the presentation of all the prosecution's evidence, the accused filed a Demurrer to Evidence.[14] They claimed that first, the prosecution failed to prove that Margaret is a responsible officer of E & D; second, the tax assessments were void for being issued without a valid Letter of Authority (LOA); third, the prosecution failed to prove that E & D duly authorized the person who received the assessment notices; and lastly, the prosecution did not prove willful failure to pay the assessed deficiency taxes.[15]

The prosecution failed to file its comment on the Motion.[16]

On September 5, 2019, the CTA Division issued a Resolution[17] granting the accused's Demurrer to Evidence. The CTA ruled that the penal liability for violating Section 255 of the Tax Code devolved on the responsible officers of the corporation. In this case, the documentary evidence presented by the prosecution did not show that Margaret was one of E & D's responsible officers. Without any proof of Margaret’s role or position in E & D, she cannot be held criminally liable for the alleged acts of the corporation.[18] Accordingly, Criminal Case Nos. O-670 and O-671 were dismissed on the ground of insufficiency of evidence, thus:

In view of the foregoing, the Motion for Leave of Court to file Demurrer to Evidence and to Admit Attached Demurrer to Evidence filed on July 1, 2019 is hereby GRANTED.","The acquittal of the taxpayer-accused in the criminal case for tax laws violation will not necessarily result in the obliteration of the civil liability for deficiency taxes relative to the criminal case since the duty to pay the tax is imposed by law prior to and independently of any attempts of the taxpayer to evade payments.[1]
Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[2] assailing the Decision[3] dated July 5, 2021 and the Resolution[4] dated February 22, 2022 of the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) in CTA EB Crim. Case No. 075. The CTA En Banc affirmed the CTA Division[5] in ruling that E & D Parts Supply, Inc. (E & D) could not be civilly liable for deficiency taxes under Section 255[6] of the Tax Code because of its acquittal in the criminal action.","The petition lacks merit. The CTA properly dismissed the criminal cases against Margaret and E & D and aptly found that E & D is not liable to pay the assessed deficiency taxes. However, the Court clarifies that the exoneration of E & D from the liability to pay taxes is not due to its acquittal in the criminal cases.

Margaret's acquittal in the criminal case was proper.
To secure a conviction under Section 255 in relation to Sections 253(d) and 256 of the Tax Code, the following elements must be established: (1) the corporate taxpayer is required by law to pay the tax; (2) the corporate taxpayer failed to pay the tax at the time or times required by law or rules and regulations; and (3) the accused, as the employee responsible for the violation, willfully failed to pay such tax at the time or times required by law or rules and regulations.[32]

In Suarez v. People,[33] the Court explained the criminal liability of corporate officers for acts committed by the corporation:

A corporation is an artificial being created by fiction of law. By the corporation's nature as an abstract being, it cannot be arrested and imprisoned; hence, it cannot be penalized for a crime punishable by imprisonment. As early as 1930 in the case of People v. Tan Boon Kong, the Court already held that for crimes committed by a corporation, the responsible officers thereof would personally bear the criminal liability. This is because a corporation can act only through its officers and agents.

In Ching v. Secretary of Justice (Ching), the Court upheld the finding of probable cause and the filing of Informations for violation of Presidential Decree No. 115 or the Trust Receipts Law against petitioner Ching as the one who signed the trust receipts, on behalf of the corporation.

In Ching, the Court had the occasion to discuss the liability of corporate officers for acts committed by the corporation as follows:

A crime is the doing of that which the penal code forbids to be done, or omitting to do what it commands. A necessary part of the definition of every crime is the designation of the author of the crime upon whom the penalty is to be inflicted. When a criminal statute designates an act of a corporation or a crime and prescribes punishment therefor, it creates a criminal offense which, otherwise, would not exist and such can be committed only by the corporation. But when a penal statute does not expressly apply to corporations, it does not create an offense for which a corporation may be punished. On the other hand, if the State, by statute, defines a crime that may be committed by a corporation but prescribes the penalty therefor to be suffered by the officers, directors, or employees of such corporation or other persons responsible for the offense, only such individuals will suffer such penalty. Corporate officers or employees, through whose act, default or omission the corporation commits a crime, are themselves individually guilty of the crime.

The principle applies whether or not the crime requires the consciousness of wrongdoing. It applies to those corporate agents who themselves commit the crime and to those, who, by virtue of their managerial positions or other similar relation to the corporation, could be deemed responsible for its commission, if by virtue of their relationship to the corporation, they had the power to prevent the act. Moreover, all parties active in promoting a crime, whether agents or not, are principals. Whether such officers or employees are benefited by their delictual acts is not a touchstone of their criminal liability. Benefit is not an operative fact.

In ABS-CBN v. Gozon. . . the Court discussed that although corporate officers may be held liable for a crime committed under the Intellectual Property Code, their criminal liability stems from their active participation in the commission of the wrongful act. Hence, in ABS-CBN, the Court affirmed the finding of probable cause against two of GMA's executives for copyright infringement of ABS-CBN's news footage because of their positions as Head of News Operations and Program Manager. However, the Court excluded from the filing of Information other GMA corporate officers because:

Mere membership of the Board or being President per se does not mean knowledge, approval, and participation in the act alleged as criminal. There must be a showing of active participation, not simply a constructive one.

This same doctrine was reiterated in SEC v. Price Richardson Corporation where the Court stated that to be criminally liable for the acts of a corporation, there must be a showing that its officers, directors, and shareholders actively participated in or had the power to prevent the wrongful act.[34] (Citations omitted)

Here, the prosecution did not only fail to prove Margaret's active participation in the non-payment of E & D's alleged deficiency income tax and VAT for taxable year 2006. It also failed to prove Margaret's role in the corporation when the crime was supposedly committed. The CTA found that the prosecution did not present proof to identify any of the officers of E & D.[35] Absent any evidence that Margaret had any direct and active participation in the alleged criminal violation, the CTA correctly acquitted her of the crimes charged.

Likewise, the CTA aptly held that Margaret was not civilly liable for the deficiency taxes assessed by the BIR. It must be remembered that while it was Margaret who was indicted for criminal violation of the Tax Code as the alleged responsible officer of the corporation, the deficiency taxes pertained to the corporation E & D. Taxes are personal to the taxpayer. In the case of corporations, liability for deficiency taxes cannot generally be imposed on the corporate officers or its stockholders for this will violate the principle that a corporation has a personality separate and distinct from the persons constituting it.[36] Here, the prosecution failed to prove the existence of an exception to the general rule.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DENIED.

"G.R. No. 261666, January 24, 2024","ROMMEL GENIO Y SANTOS, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT","In the Information[7] dated June 21, 2016 filed with the RTC and docketed as Criminal Case No. 4355-G, Rommel was charged with the crime of Bigamy under Article 349 of the RPC, as follows:
That sometime on September 7, 2013 in Guimba, Nueva Ecija, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused, being legally married to MAGDALENA ESLER GENIO on May 20, 2006 at Canatuan [sic] City and without having said marriage legally dissolved pursuant to law, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously contract a second or subsequent marriage to one Maricar Santos Galapon, to the damage and prejudice of said Magdalena Esler Genio.

Contrary to law.[8]
Upon arraignment, Rommel entered a plea of ""Not Guilty.""[9]

Pre-Trial was thereafter conducted, where the defense stipulated on the existence and authenticity of the Marriage Certificate[10] between Rommel and Maricar Santos Galapon (Maricar).[11]

Trial on the merits followed.[12]

The prosecution presented the private complainant, Magdalena Esler Genio (Magdalena), as its witness.[13] Magdalena averred that she and Rommel were married on May 20, 2006, before the Mayor of Cabanatuan City, Nueva Ecija, and that they had three children, two of whom are alive.[14] She narrated that she had been living separately from Rommel since 2013 because he had been with another woman.[15] However, their marriage was still subsisting and was never dissolved.[16]

Later, Magdalena heard of rumors that Rommel contracted a second marriage with another woman.[17] She sought to verify this information by accessing Facebook, where she saw several photos of Rommel appearing to be a groom in a wedding with another woman, who turned out to be Maricar.[18] Through her cousin, Magdalena subsequently discovered that Rommel was residing at a house located in Guimba, Nueva Ecija.[19] When Magdalena visited the place, she saw Rommel sleeping inside the house with Maricar, who appeared to be pregnant.[20]

In addition, Magdalena secured from the Civil Registry of Cabanatuan City a copy of the Birth Certificate of the child of Rommel and Maricar.[21] She also obtained from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) a certified true copy of the Marriage Certificate[22] between Rommel and Maricar.[23] In the Marriage Certificate bearing the signatures of Rommel and Maricar, it was stated that the two were married on September 7, 2013, before the Mayor of Guimba, Nueva Ecija, at his office and in the presence of three witnesses.[24]

Magdalena then communicated with Rommel and asked him if he contracted a second marriage with Maricar, but Rommel denied it.[25] On cross-examination, Magdalena admitted that she was not present during the celebration of the marriage between Rommel and Maricar.[26]

No other witness was presented by the prosecution.[27] Upon termination of Magdalena's testimony, the prosecution proceeded with its Formal Offer of Evidence, wherein it offered in evidence the following: (1) the Complaint-Affidavit[28] of Magdalena; (2) the Marriage Certificate[29] between Magdalena and Rommel, as proof of the first marriage; (3) the Birth Certificates of the children of Magdalena and Rommel, also to prove the first marriage;[30] (4) a copy of the Birth Certificate of the child of Rommel and Maricar, to prove the second marriage;[31] and (5) the certified true copy of the Marriage Certificate[32] between Maricar and Rommel issued by the PSA, to prove the second marriage and the solemnities observed therefor,[33] all of which were admitted in evidence by the RTC.[34]",The constitutional right of the accused to be presumed innocent is not an empty platitude so quickly abrogated by a legal presumption seeking to establish guilt. An evidentiary presumption may be utilized by the State and appreciated by the courts as long as it does not result in the abatement of the prosecution's burden of proving guilt and each element of the crime charged with evidence beyond reasonable doubt.,"The Court grants the Petition in part and modifies the CA Decision and Resolution in that Rommel is not found guilty of Bigamy on the ground of reasonable doubt.

However, the Court finds that Rommel is guilty of violating Article 350[74] of the RPC for knowingly contracting a marriage with Maricar against the provisions of laws.

The accused in a criminal case for Bigamy
may raise the defense that the second
marriage is void ab initio.

At the outset, the Court reiterates its ruling in Pulido v. People,[75] that the ""accused in bigamy may validly raise [the defense of] a void ab initio second or subsequent marriage even without a judicial declaration of nullity.""[76] Certainly, if the second marriage was void ab initio on grounds other than being bigamous, then it is inexistent from the beginning; thus, the element of entering into a second or subsequent marriage would be lacking, warranting the acquittal of the accused for the felony of Bigamy.[77]

The essential and formal requisites of a valid marriage are enumerated in Articles 2[78] and 3 of the Family Code, respectively. Among the formal requisites of marriage are the authority of the solemnizing officer and a marriage ceremony, ""which takes place with the appearance of the contracting parties before the solemnizing officer and their personal declaration that they take each other as husband and wife in the presence of not less than two witnesses of legal age.""

In connection with the above, Article 4 of the Family Code provides that ""[t]he absence of any of the essential or formal requisites shall render the marriage void ab initio, except as stated in Article 35(2).""[79] Relevantly, in Morigo v. People,[80] the Court acquitted the accused therein of the crime of Bigamy because his purported first marriage did not, in fact, exist, given that it was not celebrated in a marriage ceremony before a duly authorized solemnizing officer, and therein accused and his supposed first wife merely signed a marriage contract by themselves, without any solemnizing officer present.[81]

Thus, in support of his acquittal for Bigamy, Rommel validly raised the defense that his second marriage to Maricar is void ab initio due to the absence of formal requisites required for its validity-the authority of the solemnizing officer and a marriage ceremony.

The prosecution may use evidentiary
presumptions to prove any element of the
crime charged.

The proceedings a quo readily reveal that the issues in the present case are founded on the prosecution's use of an evidentiary presumption against Rommel, i.e., that the Marriage Certificate, being a public record, is prima facie evidence of its contents, and may therefore serve as proof that the second marriage has all the essential requisites for its validity. Both the RTC and the CA relied on the Marriage Certificate in holding that the prosecution was able to prove, beyond reasonable doubt, that Rommel committed Bigamy.

The Court disagrees with the RTC and the CA. The prosecution's evidence is insufficient to warrant Rommel's conviction for Bigamy.","WHEREFORE, the Petition is GRANTED IN PART. The Decision dated July 16, 2021, and the Resolution dated June 7, 2022, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

"G.R. No. 253003, January 24, 2024","COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, PETITIONER, VS. MINDANAO II GEOTHERMAL PARTNERSHIP, RESPONDENT.","was engaged in the generation, collection, and distribution of electricity and registered with the BIR Regional District Office (RDO) of Kidapawan City, with Tax Identification No. 004-766-953.[6]

On March 11, 1997, M2GP entered into a Build-Operate-Transfer contract with the Philippine National Oil Company-Energy Development Corporation (PNOC-EDC) for the financing, engineering, supply, installation, testing, commissioning, operation, and maintenance of a 48.25-megawatt geothermal power plant. PNOC-EDC would supply and deliver steam to M2GP at no cost. In turn, M2GP would convert the steam into electric capacity and energy for the PNOC-EDC and deliver the same to the National Power Corporation (NPC) for and on behalf of the PNOC-EDC.[7]

Ensuingly, M2GP filed its respective quarterly VAT returns with the BIR on April 24, 2008, July 25, 2008, October 24, 2008, and January 26, 2009, for taxable year 2008.[8] On December 28, 2009, it lodged an administrative claim for refund or issuance of tax credit certificate of its unapplied and unutilized input taxes for taxable year 2008 in the amount of PHP 6,149,256.25 before the BIR RDO No. 108 of Kidapawan City. With this, the CIR issued a Letter of Authority for the examination of M2GP's books of account and other accounting records for VAT covering the period January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008.[9]

M2GP was dissolved on March 29, 2010.[10]

On April 15, 2010, M2GP filed a petition for review with the CTA, docketed as CTA Case No. 8082, appealing its administrative claim as regards the excess and unutilized creditable input tax covering the 1st quarter of taxable year 2008. It then filed another petition for review with the CTA on 27 May 2010, docketed as CTA Case No. 8106, entreating its administrative claim in relation to the excess and unutilized creditable input tax covering the 2nd, 3rd and 4th quarters of taxable year 2008. The CTA Second Division consolidated these two cases.[11]

The CTA Second Division, in its Resolution dated January 20, 2011, initially dismissed CTA Case No. 8082 for being filed prematurely. Thenceforth, M2GP moved for reconsideration but the CTA Second Division gave it short shrift in its March 15, 2011 Resolution.[12]

Nonplussed, M2GP elevated the matter to the CTA En Banc, which affirmed the ruling of the CTA Second Division through its Decision dated July 5, 2012. Again, M2GP sought reconsideration but was likewise rebuffed in the CTA En Banc's Resolution dated 29 November 2012.[13]

Disgruntled, M2GP filed a Petition for Review before the Court, docketed as G.R. No. 204745, praying for the reversal of the CTA En Banc's July 5, 2012 Decision and the November 29, 2012 Resolution, and that judgment be rendered reinstating its Petition for Review in CTA Case No. 8082.[14]","At the threshold of this Petition for Review[1] is the claim for tax refund or issuance of tax credit certificate of input value-added tax (VAT) for taxable year 2008 filed by respondent Mindanao II Geothermal Partnership (M2GP). Through this Petition, the petitioner Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) seeks to set aside the Decision[2] and the Resolution[3] of the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) En Banc in CTA EB Nos. 1777 and 1779, which affirmed the Decision and Resolution of the CTA Second Division, in CTA Case Nos. 8082 and 8106, granting the M2GP's claim in the amount of PHP 220,700.89 and the motions for reconsideration thereof, respectively.[4]

During the period of time material to this case, the CIR was the duly appointed Commissioner of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) empowered to perform the duties of its office, including the power to decide refunds of internal revenue taxes.[5]","This Court shall endeavor to put finis to this niggling controversy.

Petitioner CIR cashes in on the Court's pronouncements in Atlas Consolidated Mining and Development Corporation v. CIR[27] (2011 Atlas case) and Atlas Consolidated Mining and Development Corporation v. CIR[28] (2007 Atlas case). It postulates that direct attributability between input tax and zero-rated sales must be established in claims for refund or issuance of tax credit certificate. To be sure, the input tax must come from purchases of goods and services that form part of the finished product of the taxpayer and must be directly used in the production chain.[29] Here, M2GP failed to prove that the amount sought to be refunded is directly attributable to its zero-rated sales.[30]

On the other hand, respondent M2GP bemoans that the arguments raised by the CIR have already been considered and denied for lack of merit by CTA En Banc. In any case, M2GP has fully complied with the requisites to claim for tax refund or issuance of tax credit certificate for its unutilized input VAT attributable to its zero-rated sales based on Section 112(A)[31] of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended by Republic Act (R.A.) No. 8424.[32] Moreover, the 2007 and 2011 Atlas Cases do not apply in the case at bench as M2GP was able to establish direct attributability of its unutilized input VAT to its zero-rated sales, through the VAT-compliant official receipts and invoices it presented. At any rate, the doctrine of strictissimi juris should be relaxed in the present case as M2GP has sufficiently established its claim by competent preponderance of evidence. What is more, technicalities should not be misused to defeat its claim in light of competent evidence clearly establishing that there was a VAT and the VAT was indeed actually paid.[33]

Petitioner's contention holds no water.

Incipiently, the Court notes that while decisions of the CTA do not bind this Court, at most, they have a persuasive effect. Illumined by the ruling in San Roque Power Corp. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue,[34] only final decisions of the Court are considered binding precedents. The Court declared, thus—
""We further held in said case that Article 8 of the Civil Code enjoins adherence to judicial precedents. The law requires courts to follow a rule already established in a final decision of the Supreme Court. Contrary to the petitioner's view, the decisions of the CTA are not given the same level of recognition.""[35]
In a line of cases[36] involving claims for input tax refund or claims for issuance of tax credit certificate, the CTA is unwavering in its position that Section 112 of the Tax Code does not require direct attributability of input taxes to zero-rated sales.

To be sure, the grounds when input tax may be refunded or claimed as tax credit in cases of zero-rated sales are laid down in Section 112(A) of the Tax Code. To wit:
SEC. 112. Refunds of Input Tax. —

(A) Zero-rated or Effectively Zero-rated Sales. — Any VAT-­registered person, whose sales are zero-rated or effectively zero-rated may, within two (2) years after the close of the taxable quarter when the sales were made, apply for the issuance of a tax credit certificate or refund of creditable input tax due or paid attributable to such sales, except transitional input tax, to the extent that such input tax has not been applied against output tax: Provided, however, That in the case of zero-rated sales under Section 106(A)(2)(a)(1), (2) and (B) and Section 108(B)(1) and (2), the acceptable foreign currency exchange proceeds thereof had been duly accounted for in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP): Provided, further, That where the taxpayer is engaged in zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sale and also in taxable or exempt sale of goods of properties or services, and the amount of creditable input tax due or paid cannot be directly and entirely attributed to any one of the transactions, it shall be allocated proportionately on the basis of the volume of sales. Provided, finally, That for a person making sales that are zero-rated under Section 108(B) (6), the input taxes shall be allocated ratably between his zero-rated and non-zero-rated sales.
Plain as a pikestaff, there is nothing in the provision that requires input tax to be directly attributable or a factor in the chain of production to the zero-­rated sale for it to be creditable or refundable. The law even allows as tax credit an allocable portion of a taxpayer's input tax that is not directly and entirely attributable to the zero-rated sales. What the law requires is that creditable input VAT should be attributable to the zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sales. To attribute is to explain something by indicating a cause, or simply caused by. Thus, when the law states that the input VAT must be attributable to the zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sales, it simply means that the input VAT must be regarded as being caused by such sales.

What is more, Section 110, as amended, does not limit creditable input tax to purchases that form part of the finished product of the taxpayer. The provision enumerates the instances that give rise to creditable input taxes, to wit:

The rule on chain of custody in drugs cases
To sustain a conviction for the offense of illegal sale of dangerous drugs under Section 5, and illegal possession of dangerous drugs under Section 11, Article II of R.A. No. 9165, the prosecution must be able to establish with moral certainty the identity of the confiscated drug.[43] To remove any doubt or uncertainty as to the identity and integrity of the seized drug, it must be proven that the substance illegally sold by the accused is the same substance offered and identified in court.[44] This requirement is known as the chain of custody rule. Chain of custody has been defined as ""the duly recorded, authorized movements, and custody of the seized drugs at each stage, from the moment of confiscation to the receipt in the forensic laboratory for examination until it is presented to the court.""[45]

The chain of custody rule is provided for under Section 21, Article II of R.A. No. 9165, as amended by R.A. No. 10640,[46] which was passed on July 15, 2014. Considering that the illegal acts of selling and/or possessing dangerous drugs were allegedly committed by Edwin and Taladua on January 17, 2019, the revised chain of custody rule applies in this case. In this regard, Section 21, Article II of R.A. No. 9165, as amended by R.A. No. 10640, provides that:

SEC. 21. Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized, and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment. – The PDEA shall take charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment so confiscated, seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the following manner:","ACCORDINGLY, the appeal is GRANTED.

"G.R. No. 268399, January 24, 2024","FRANCHESKA ALEEN BALABA BUBAN, PETITIONER, VS. NILO DELA PEÑA,* RESPONDENT.","On November 11, 2014, Buban was hired as Customer Care Senior Specialist in Xerox Business. On March 22, 2015, between 6:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m., Buban arrived at the office and went directly to the workstation of Team Leader Kiko[10] to get her headset. However, the latter was on leave and left his pedestal locked. As a result, Buban was constrained to get a temporary headset in the storage room. She tried them on three computers, but was unsuccessful due to a system error. Buban promptly informed Dela Peña, the assigned team leader at the time, and asked for assistance in reporting the system issue to the Information Technology Department. Dela Peña told Buban that the error might be due to the headset and directed her to get a replacement headset from the storage room.[11]

While inside the storage room, Dela Peña suddenly appeared and told Buban, ""Baby tigas na tigas na ako, kelan mo ba talaga ako pagibigyan [sic]?"" Startled and feeling uneasy, Buban tried to make light of the situation by answering, ""TL ano kaba? Para kang tanga dyan."" Then, she grabbed the nearest headset and ran out of the room back to her station.[12]

Unfortunately, the headset that Buban took was similarly defective. Buban had to get another headset without an ""enabler."" Thinking that Dela Peña already left the storage area, Buban went back inside. To her surprise, Dela Peña approached her. Trying to avoid further contact, Buban hurriedly moved away, but Dela Peña grabbed her by the waist and tried to kiss her. She struggled to push him away, but Dela Peña was stronger. Dela Peña was able to hug her and he started groping her breasts. Mustering all her strength, Buban was able to break free from Dela Pena's hold and race out of the room.[13]

Buban's ordeal did not end here. While she was at her workstation, Dela Peña approached her and told her to reboot her tools and get a replacement headset, so she can start making calls instead of using system error as an excuse to slack off. Distressed at being put on the spot, Buban complied and went back to the storage room to get another headset. To her horror, Dela Peña followed her inside, closed the door, and blocked the exit. Again, Dela Peña made sexual advances on Buban, telling her, ""Sige na Baby, pagkahawak mo at itatago ko din agad."" Despite her vehement protestations and warnings that he would be caught by the closed-circuit television camera, Dela Peña still forced himself upon Buban. When she found an opportunity, she ran out of the room. Shocked at what she had just experienced, she was only able to tell her teammates about the incident during their break.[14]

From then on, she detested going to work for fear of running into Dela Peña. As a result, her health deteriorated. At work, she became anxious and paranoid, and would find herself uncontrollably crying whenever she saw Dela Peña. However, as a single parent, she could not afford to quit. Thus, she was left with no choice but to continue working.[15]

She reported the incident and filed a formal complaint with the Human Resources Department. However, her case was never heard, and no protective measure was afforded to her by the management. Dela Peña continued to work in the same area and same shift with her, magnifying her distress. To her consternation, Dela Peña acted condescendingly and even insinuated that it was Buban who wanted or asked for what happened between them. To make matters worse, Xerox Business withheld three days of Buban's salary earned in May 2015.[16]

On September 15, 2015, Buban filed a Complaint before the Labor Arbiter against Xerox Business, Rojan, and Dela Peña for sexual harassment, with prayer for payment of unpaid salary, moral damages, exemplary damages, and attorney's fees.[17]

In response, Xerox Business filed its Position Paper[18] admitting that Buban was its employee with the position of Customer Care Senior Specialist. However, Xerox Business denied Buban's allegations that the incident report was never investigated. It claimed that the security incident report was promptly referred to Megaforce Security Services, the security group handling the overall security concerns of the company. In addition, Xerox Business conducted an administrative investigation where a Show Cause Notice[19] was issued against Dela Peña, directing him to explain in writing the charges against him within five days. The administrative investigation, however, did not find convincing evidence to warrant the imposition of the penalty of termination against Dela Peña. Xerox Business further claimed that it was only upon such conclusion that Buban filed her Complaint before the Labor Arbiter.[20]

In its Decision,[21] Labor Arbiter ruled in favor of Buban. It held Xerox Business solidarity liable in the payment of damages for its failure to create a Committee on Decorum and Investigation and investigate the alleged sexual harassment incident. In so failing, Xerox Business perpetrated a hostile, offensive, and intimidating work environment that ultimately led to the constructive dismissal of Buban. The dispositive portion of the Labor Arbiter's Decision reads:","This Court resolves the Petition for Review[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court from the Decision[2] and Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA), which affirmed with modifications the Decision[4] and Resolution[5] of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC), that affirmed the Decision[6] of the Labor Arbiter finding Xerox Business Services Philippines Inc. (Xerox Business) and Nilo Dela Peña (Dela Peña) solidarily liable for payment of damages resulting from sexual harassment as defined and penalized under Republic Act No. 7877,[7] otherwise known as the Anti-Sexual Harassment Act of 1995.
This case stemmed from an Amended Complaint[8] filed by Francheska Aleen Balaba Buban (Buban) against Xerox Business, Human Resources Manager Rojan Gonzales (Gonzales), and Dela Peña for sexual harassment, non-payment of salary, payment of moral and exemplary damages, and attorney's fees, before the Labor Arbiter. To support her claim, Buban executed an Affidavit[9] narrating the incidents of sexual harassment.","The Petition is denied for lack of merit.

As a rule, this Court's jurisdiction in a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court is limited to the review of pure questions of law. In labor cases, when the CA decision is brought to the Court through a Petition for Review on Certiorari, as in this case, the question of law presented to this Court is whether the CA correctly found that the NLRC acted with grave abuse of discretion in rendering its judgment.[39] There is grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC when its findings of fact and conclusions of law are not supported by substantial evidence, that is, such amount of relevant evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion.[40]

On this note, the pronouncement of this Court in Traveloka Philippines, Inc. v. Ceballos, Jr.[41] is instructive:

Preliminarily, the Court stresses the distinct approach in reviewing a CA's ruling in a labor case. In a Rule 45 review, the Court examines the correctness of the CA's Decision in contrast with the review of jurisdictional errors under Rule 65. Furthermore, Rule 45 limits the review to questions of law. In ruling for legal correctness, the Court views the CA Decision in the same context that the petition for certiorari was presented to the CA. Hence, the Court has to examine the CA's Decision from the prism of whether the CA correctly determined the presence or absence of grave abuse of discretion in the NLRC decision.

Case law states that grave abuse of discretion connotes a capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment, done in a despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility, the character of which being so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined by or to act at all in contemplation of law.[42] (Citations omitted)

In the case at hand, Buban raises that Dela Peña has already waived his right to participate and intervene in the present labor complaint on account of: first, non-submission of position papers and non-participation in the proceedings before the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC; and second, filing a petition before a court of law without the assistance of a legal counsel. As a consequence, Dela Peña has lost his legal standing to seek any affirmative relief. Further, Dela Peña signed and filed his own pleading before the CA, without any legal representation. Buban argues that his Petition should have been considered a mere scrap of paper for failing to observe the formalities required by the Rules. Thus, the CA should have dismissed his Petition outright.[43]

We cannot countenance Buban's arguments. To do so would run contrary to the well-settled principle that the application of technical rules of procedure and evidence are not strictly observed in labor cases to serve the demands of substantial justice. It is the spirit and intention of the Labor Code that in the adjudication of labor disputes, every and all reasonable means shall be employed to ascertain the facts in each case speedily and objectively, without regard to technicalities of law or procedure, all in the interest of due process.[44]

Pertinently, the Labor Code provides that:

Article 227 [221]. Technical rules not binding and prior resort to amicable settlement.— In any proceeding before the Commission or any of the Labor Arbiters, the rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity shall not be controlling, and it is the spirit and intention of this Code that the Commission and its members and the Labor Arbiters shall use every and all reasonable means to ascertain the facts in each case speedily and objectively, without regard to technicalities of law or procedure, all in the interest of due process[.][45]","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review is DENIED. The Decision dated May 31, 2019 and the Resolution dated November 23, 2020 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 147443 are AFFIRMED. Petitioner Francheska Aleen B. Buban is found to have been constructively dismissed. She is entitled to the payment of her unpaid salary amounting to PHP 2,630.58. Respondent Nilo Dela Peña is solidarily liable with Xerox Business Services Philippines, Inc. to pay the unpaid salary of Francheska Aleen B. Buban, and to pay: (1) PHP 100,000.00 as moral damages; and (2) PHP 50,000.00 as exemplary damages. All monetary awards shall be subject to legal interest at the rate of 6% per annum, from the finality of this Decision until full payment.

The case is REMANDED to the Labor Arbiter for the determination of whether the total monetary award has already been fully or partially satisfied. Any unpaid amount should be further satisfied in accordance with this Decision."
"G.R. No. 246434, January 24, 2024","HERNALD BERMILLO Y DE VERA, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","Bermillo was indicted m an Information, the accusatory portion of which reads as follows:
That on or about March 21, 2015, at around 5:35 in the afternoon, in the Municipality of Camiling, Province of Tarlac, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused did then and there have in his possession and control one (1) piece heat-sealed transparent plastic sachet containing Methamphetamine Hydrochloride, known as Shabu, a dangerous drug, weighing 0.019 gram.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[4]
Upon arraignment, Bermillo pleaded ""not guilty"" to the crime charged. Pre-trial was conducted, and trial on the merits then ensued.[5]

The prosecution presented the testimonies of arresting police officers Mark Anthony Alviar (PO1 Alviar), Tirso Navero (PO3 Navero), and Barangay Chaiperson Renato de Mayo (Brgy. Chairperson de Mayo). Their combined testimonies show that at around 5:00 p.m. on March 21, 2015, a confidential agent arrived at the Municipal Anti-Illegal Drugs Special Operation Task Group of the Camiling Police Station to inform the deputy chief of police, Police Senior Inspector Manolito S. Jandoc (PSINSP Jandoc), that a certain Vilma Matias (Matias) was engaged in the illegal sale of dangerous drugs. Based on this information, PSINSP Jandoc summoned his team to a meeting for purposes of conducting an anti-illegal drugs operation. PO1 Alviar was designated as the poseur-buyer while PO3 Navero, Senior Police Officer 1 Librada Calma (SPO1 Calma), PO3 Nestor Agustin, PO2 Alexander Juan, and PO1 Abel Corpuz (PO1 Corpuz) were designated as back-up operatives. A 500-peso bill was also handed to PO1 Alviar for the buy-bust operation, which the latter marked with his initials ""MA"" and was then photographed by PO2 Alexander Juan.[6]

Together with the confidential informant, the buy-bust team proceeded to Barangay Caarosipan, Palimbo, Camiling, Tarlac to await the arrival of Matias. Not long after, Matias arrived with Bermillo on board a tricycle. After approaching Matias, the confidential agent introduced PO1 Alviar to the latter as the buyer of shabu. PO1 Alviar then gave the marked money to Matias and the latter responded by giving PO1 Alviar a transparent plastic sachet containing white crystalline substance. Upon assessing the contents to be shabu, PO1 Alviar gave the pre-arranged signal and the back-up team accosted Matias:[7]

As the arresting officers approached Bermillo, they saw him drawing something out of his pocket and apprehended him as he was about to throw it and board his tricycle. Later, they discovered that the plastic sachet he attempted to throw also contained white crystalline substance.[8] The drugs seized from Bermillo were then given to PO1 Alviar.[9]

Matias and Bermillo were brought to the police station where they were informed of their constitutional rights and the two sachets seized from them were marked by PO1 Alviar. The sachet confiscated from Matias was marked with the initials ""VM"" while the sachet seized from Bermillo was marked with his initials ""HB.""[10] The confiscated sachets were inventoried and photographed in the presence of Brgy. Chairperson de Mayo, Billy Nuqui, a media representative, and Juning Guiang, a representative from the Department of Justice (DOJ).[11]

PO1 Alviar and PO3 Edgar brought the sachets to the Philippine National Police (PNP) Crime Laboratory in Camp Makabulos, Tarlac City and handed them over to Police Forensic Chemist Angelito Angel (Forensic Chemist Angel), who conducted an examination. The contents of the seized sachets yielded positive results for the presence of methamphetamine hydrochloride or shabu, a dangerous drug,[12] as stated in Chemistry Report Nos. D-088-15 and D-089-15.[13]

On the part of the defense, Matias and Bermillo both testified that at 5:00 p.m. of March 21, 2015, they went to the house of a certain Sergeant Wawas at Barangay Caarosipan, Palimbo, Camiling, Tarlac to butcher a pig. Upon seeing, however, that there was no one inside Sargeant Wawas' house, they returned home on board a tricycle driven by Bermillo. On their way home along Romulo Highway, they noticed someone following them and so Matias instructed Bermillo to park the tricycle at the shoulder of the road. Upon reaching them, PO1 Corpuz ordered them to alight from the tricycle and proceeded to search the vehicle, while PO3 Esteban frisked them. Although PO3 Esteban did not discover anything illegal, PO1 Corpuz showed them a plastic sachet of shabu which he claimed was found in their tricycle. PO1 Corpuz then left them standing near the tricycle under the guard of SPO1 Calma. Thirty minutes later, PO1 Corpuz returned with PO1 Alviar and the two showed them a marked 500-peso bill and plastic sachets containing shabu. They testified that, out of fear of being harmed, they followed the instructions of the police officers to point at the items while being photographed. Matias and Bermillo were taken to the police station then to the PNP Crime Laboratory for drug test and examination of the items purportedly confiscated from them, and finally to the Office of the Provincial Prosecutor of Tarlac for investigation.[14]

On July 28, 2017, the Regional Trial Court (RTC) rendered its Decision[15] finding Bermillo guilty beyond reasonable doubt, the dispositive portion of which states:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, accused Hernald Bermillo y De Vera is hereby found guilty beyond reasonable doubt for violation of Section 11, Article [II] of [R.A. No.] 9165 and hereby sentences him to an indeterminate prison term of twelve (12) twelve years and eight (8) months, as minimum[,] to seventeen (17) years and eight (8) months[,] as maximum, and to pay a Fine of Php300,000.00.

The Clerk of Court of this Court is hereby ordered to forward the subject stuffs to the PDEA Regional Office, San Fernando Pampanga for proper disposal.","This Court resolves the Motion for Reconsideration[1] filed by petitioner Hernald Bermillo y de Vera (Bermillo) assailing this Court's Resolution,[2] the dispositive portion of which provides:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, the petition is DENIED. The assailed Decision dated October 31, 2018 and the Resolution dated April 2, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 40482, affirming the conviction of Hernald Bermillo y De Vera by the Regional Trial Court of Camiling, Tarlac, Branch 68, for violation of Section 11, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165, are AFFIRMED.

Petitioner is sentenced to an indeterminate prison term of twelve (12) years and eight (8) months, as minimum, to seventeen (17) years and eight (8) months, as maximum, and to pay a Fine of Three Hundred Thousand Pesos ([PHP] 300,000.00).","The instant Motion fails on the first issue. An in flagrante delicto arrest requires the existence of probable cause to effect such an arrest. For both the arrest and the confiscation of items, probable cause is explained in jurisprudence as follows:
The conventional view is that probable cause, while largely a relative term the determination of which must be resolved according to the facts of each case, is understood as having reference to such facts and circumstances which could lead a reasonable, discreet, and prudent man to believe and conclude as to the commission of an offense, and that the objects sought in connection with the offense are in the place sought to be searched.[26] (Citation omitted)
Here, the record states that petitioner was arrested almost immediately after the culmination of the buy-bust operation against Matias. The CA noted that Bermillo and Matias had arrived together at the buy-bust site, and that the police officers had seen Bermillo trying to draw and throw something from his clothes during Matias's arrest. We agree with the CA that, given the circumstances, it was not farfetched for the police officers to conclude that petitioner and Matias were selling illegal drugs together, or at the very least, that petitioner was likewise engaged in the drug trade.[27]

In any case, this Court gives credence to the narration of police officers in cases involving violations of the Dangerous Drugs Act, and police officers are presumed to have performed their duties in a regular manner, unless there is evidence to the contrary.[28] Without any allegation or proof by petitioner that the police officers had ill motive or an odious intent in arresting him, we affirm the findings of the RTC and CA that there was indeed probable cause to arrest petitioner and the subsequent seizure by the police officers of the illegal items were valid.

Apart from the validity of petitioner's arrest, however, the prosecution in drug cases must contend with Section 21 of Republic Act No. 9165, as amended by Republic Act No. 10640, which details the procedure for the observance of the chain of custody in seizures of illegal drugs:
SEC. 21. Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized, and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment. — The PDEA shall take charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment so confiscated, seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the following manner:

(1) The apprehending team having initial custody and control of the dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, conduct a physical inventory of the seized items and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, with an elected public official and a representative of the National Prosecution Service or the media who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof: Provided, That the physical inventory and photograph shall be conducted at the place where the search warrant is served; or at the nearest police station or at the nearest office of the apprehending officer/team, whichever is practicable, in case of warrantless seizures: Provided, finally, That noncompliance of these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizures and custody over said items.

(2) Within twenty-four (24) hours upon confiscation/seizure of dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment, the same shall be submitted to the PDEA Forensic Laboratory for a qualitative and quantitative examination;

(3) A certification of the forensic laboratory examination results, which shall be done by the forensic laboratory examiner, shall be issued immediately upon the receipt of the subject item/s: Provided, That when the volume of dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, and controlled precursors and essential chemicals does not allow the completion of testing within the time frame, a partial laboratory examination report shall be provisionally issued stating therein the quantities of dangerous drugs still to be examined by the forensic laboratory: Provided, however, That a final certification shall be issued immediately upon completion of the said examination and certification[.]
For crimes involving drugs, case law instructs that it is essential for the identity of the prohibited drug to be established with moral certainty, considering that the dangerous drug itself forms an integral part of the corpus delicti of the crime. Thus, to obviate any unnecessary doubt on the identity of the dangerous drugs, the prosecution must show an unbroken chain of custody over the same and account for each link in the chain of custody from the moment the drugs are seized up to their presentation in court as evidence of the crime.[29]

This Court has previously explained that the chain of custody is divided into four links:
[F]irst, the seizure and marking of the illegal drug recovered from the accused by the apprehending officer; second, the turnover of the illegal drug seized by the apprehending officer to the investigating officer; third, the turn over by the investigating officer of the illegal drug to the forensic chemist for laboratory examination; and fourth, the turn over and submission of the marked illegal drug seized by the forensic chemist to the court.[30]
Upon a review on the facts and circumstances surrounding the instant case, we find that the prosecution failed to comply with the fourth 1ink. For cases where the parties dispense with the attendance and testimony of the forensic chemist, jurisprudence dictates that these points must be included in the stipulation in order to ensure the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized item: (1) that the forensic chemist received the seized article as marked, properly sealed, and intact; (2) that he resealed it after examination of the content; and (3) that he placed his own marking on the same to ensure that it could not be tampered with pending trial.[31]","FOR THESE REASONS, the Motion for Reconsideration is GRANTED. The November 18, 2021 Resolution of this Court is REVERSED. Accordingly, petitioner Hernald Bermillo y de Vera is ACQUITTED of the charge of violation of Section 21 of Republic Act No. 9165 in Criminal Case No. 15-93. He is ORDERED IMMEDIATELY RELEASED from detention unless he is being held for some other legal ground.

Let a copy of this Resolution be furnished to the Director General of the Bureau of Corrections, Muntinlupa City for immediate implementation. The Director General of the Bureau of Corrections is DIRECTED to report to this Court, within five days from receipt of this Resolution, the action he has taken. Copies shall also be furnished to the Chief of the Philippine National Police and the Director General of the Philippine Drugs Enforcement Agency for their information.

Let entry of judgment be issued immediately."
"G.R. No. 257685, January 24, 2024","COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS, REP. BY COMMISSIONER KAREN S. GOMEZ-DUMPIT, PETITIONER, VS. OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSMAN, PSUPT ROBERT C. DOMINGO, PO2 DYLAN VERDAN, PO2 JONATHAN UBARRE, PO1 BERLY APOLONIO, AND OTHER JOHN DOES, RESPONDENTS.","This case stemmed from a Complaint[4] filed by the CHR before the Ombudsman charging respondents with violations of: (i) the Revised Penal Code, specifically arbitrary detention, delay in the delivery of detained persons, grave threats, grave coercion, and robbery/extortion; (ii) Republic Act No. 9745,[5] also known as the Anti-Torture Act of 2009, specifically Section 4(a)(1) to (4) and Section 4(b)(3) and (11); and (iii) the 2013 Revised Philippine National Police (PNP) Operational Procedures (2013 RPNPOP).[6]

The Complaint arose after the CHR visited the Raxabago Police Station 1 (Raxabago PS 1) located in Tondo, City of Manila, then under the command of PSUPT Domingo, in the early evening of April 27, 2017, after taking cognizance of an information about a secret detention cell in the station.

During their visit, the CHR found a room, which it called a ""secret detention cell,"" inside the Drug Enforcement Unit's (DEU) office measuring one meter by five meters with a wooden shelf covering its entrance. The CHR described the secret detention cell as cramped, dingy, fetid, and dark, with no lights and windows. Since it only had one male urinal, the CHR claimed that some detainees urinated and defecated in plastic bags.

Inside the secret detention cell were three women and nine men who were allegedly arrested for various violations of Republic Act No. 9165, otherwise known as the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002, namely:[7]","Assailed in this Petition for Certiorari[1] under Rule 65 is the criminal aspect of the Joint Resolution[2] dated July 28, 2020 and the Joint Order[3] dated May 18, 2021 rendered by the Office of the Ombudsman (Ombudsman) in OMB-P-C-17-0193 and OMB-P-A-17-0211 dismissing the criminal and administrative Complaint filed by petitioner Commission on Human Rights (CHR) against respondents Police Superintendent (PSUPT) Robert C. Domingo (PSUPT Domingo), Police Officer 2 (PO2) Dylan Verdan (PO2 Verdan), PO2 Jonathan Ubarre (PO2 Ubarre), Police Officer 1 (PO1) Berly Apolonio (PO1 Apolonio), and other John Does (collectively, respondents) for lack of probable cause.","The Petition is denied.

Preliminarily, the Court notes that the CHR failed to include in its Petition the attachments to the Counter-Affidavit of PSUPT Domingo, which are considered documents relevant and pertinent to this case. This failure is in violation of Rule 65, Section 1, second paragraph of the Rules of Court. It was PSUPT Domingo who provided the attachments on the Counter-Affidavit in his Supplemental Comment.

Nevertheless, it is well-settled that ""[t]he Ombudsman has the discretion to determine whether a criminal case, given its attendant facts and circumstances, should be filed or not. The Ombudsman may dismiss the complaint should the Ombudsman find the complaint insufficient in form or substance, or the Ombudsman may proceed with the investigation if, in the Ombudsman's view, the complaint is in due form and substance. Hence, the filing or non-filing of the information is primarily lodged within the 'full discretion' of the Ombudsman.""[32]

The Court has consistently adopted a policy of non-interference in the exercise of the Ombudsman's constitutionally mandated powers. The Ombudsman, which is ""beholden to no one, acts as the champion of the people and the preserver of the integrity of the public service.""[33]

In Arroyo v. Sandiganbayan,[34] the Court, through now Senior Associate Justice Marvic M.V.F. Leonen, held:

""The Ombudsman is endowed with a wide latitude of investigatory and prosecutory prerogatives in the exercise of its power to pass upon criminal complaints."" As a general rule, this Court does not interfere with the Office of the Ombudsman's exercise of its constitutional mandate. It is an executive function, which must be respected consistent with the principle of separation of powers[.][35]

While the Court is not precluded from reviewing the Ombudsman's action when it is tainted with grave abuse of discretion—which implies a capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment tantamount to lack of jurisdiction—the Court's certiorari jurisdiction pursuant to Article VIII, Section 1, paragraph 2 of the Constitution may be invoked. However, it must be shown that ""[t]he Ombudsman's exercise of its powers must have been done in an arbitrary or despotic manner which must be so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of a positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined or to act at all in contemplation of law.""[36]

In this case, it goes without saying that the CHR has the burden of proving that the Ombudsman gravely abused its discretion when it did not indict respondents of the crimes they were accused of committing. In this regard, the CHR argues that the Ombudsman committed grave abuse of discretion in using clear and convincing evidence instead of probable cause as quantum of evidence in the filing or non-filing of information. With probable cause as standard evidence, the CHR alleges that it has established its criminal complaint.

The Court disagrees.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DENIED. The Joint Resolution dated July 28, 2020 and the Joint Order dated May 18, 2021 of the Office of the Ombudsman in OMB-P-C-17-0193 are hereby AFFIRMED.

Let copies of this Decision be furnished to the Congress, the Office of the President, the Department of Interior and Local Government, the National Police Commission, and the Philippine National Police."

No. 260708, January 23, 2024","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. ABC260708,* ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","ABC260708 was charged with qualified rape and rape through sexual assault committed against his minor daughter, AAA260708,[1] in two separate Informations filed before the Regional Trial Court of xxxxxxxxxxx[2] Cagayan xxxxxxxxxxx (RTC) which were docketed as Criminal Case Nos. 17006 and 17007, respectively,[3] the accusatory portions of which read:
Criminal Case No. 17006

That on March 17, 2015, in the xxxxxxxxxxx, Province of Cagayan, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the accused [ABC260708], with lewd design, and by means of force, threat and intimidation, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously, have sexual intercourse with the private complainant [AAA260708], who is [his] daughter and a minor being only a 7-year[-]old minor, against her will.

That the acts of the accused was aggravated by the fact that the private complainant was only a 7[-]year[-]old minor when the offense was committed and the accused was [her] father.

That due to the incident, the accused was immediately apprehended and was placed under custody of the law.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[4] (Emphasis supplied)

Criminal Case No. 17007

That on March 17, 2015, in the xxxxxxxxxxx, Province of Cagayan, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the accused [ABC260708], with lewd design, and by means of force, threat and intimidation, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously, abuse sexually the private complainant [AAA260708], who is a 7-year[­-]old minor and his own daughter, by inserting his penis into the private complainant's mouth; that the acts of the accused were done against the will of the private complainant.

That the incident was aggravated by the fact that the private complainant was only a 7-year[-]old minor when the offense was committed and that the accused was [her] father.

That due to the incident[.] the accused was immediately apprehended and was placed under the custody of the law.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[5] (Emphasis supplied)
When arraigned, ABC260708 pleaded not guilty to the offenses charged. After pretrial was terminated, joint trial ensued. AAA260708 testified that on March 15, 2015[6] at around 5:00 p.m., ABC260708 called her to enter their room. ABC260708 removed AAA260708's underwear and directed her to tie on the bed. ABC260708 laid on top of AAA260708 and spread her legs. ABC260708 pulled out his penis and inserted it into AAA260708's vagina. Thereafter, while AAA260708 was already standing, ABC260708 inserted his penis into her mouth. ABC260708 threatened to kill AAA260708 if she would report the matter to the police. BBB260708, AAA260708's older sister, corroborated the incident. BBB260708 recalled that on March 17, 2015 at around 5:00 p.m., she just arrived home, but could not open the front door because it was locked. BBB260708 entered the house through an unfinished window in their kitchen. Thereat, BBB260708 saw AAA260708 with her shirt without undergarments and ABC260708 wearing a shirt and brief. BBB260708 told her aunt what happened. On even date, AAA260708 and her uncle reported the matter to the authorities and the incident was recorded in a police blotter. On March 18, 2015, AAA260708 was brought to the hospital for physical examination. The medical report revealed that AAA260708 had fresh hymenal laceration incurred within 24 hours from penetration.[7]

ABC260708 denied the accusations, and claimed that he usually bathed his daughter AAA260708 because his wife was abroad. On March 17, 2015, ABC260708 bathed AAA260708 who gathered dust after helping him harvest corn. ABC260708 then piled the corn in the living room while wearing a sando and underwear. BBB260708 arrived at that moment. Afterwards, BBB260708's aunt whipped ABC260708 based on the report that he molested AAA260708.[8]","The meticulous study of a crime begins with the understanding of its definition, nature, and penalty, and ends with an accurate nomenclature or designation of the offense. Here, the Court pedagogically embarks on a quest to settle the proper taxonomy of the crime when the elements of both statutory rape, i.e., the victim is below the statutory age or is suffering from mental retardation comparable to the intellectual capacity of a child below the statutory age, and qualified rape, i.e., twin circumstances of minority and relationship, or the accused's knowledge of the mental disability of the victim at the time of the commission of rape, or the age of the victim being below 7 years old, are present.","The appeal is unmeritorious.

The prosecution established that
ABC260708 had carnal knowledge of
his 8-year-old daughter, AAA260708,
against the latter's will in Criminal
Case No. 17006

ABC260708 assailed his conviction on the ground that AAA260708's testimony is unbelievable. On this point, we stress that the CA and the RTC's assessment on the credibility of the prosecution witness and the veracity of her testimony are given the highest degree of respect,[20] especially if there is no fact or circumstance of weight or substance that was overlooked, misunderstood, or misapplied, which could affect the result of the case.[21] The trial court had the best opportunity to determine the credibility of the prosecution witness, having evaluated her emotional state, reactions, and overall demeanor in open court.[22] Here, AAA260708 positively identified ABC260708 as her ravisher and vividly recounted how he had sexual intercourse with her and thereafter, inserted his penis into her mouth, thus:","ACCORDINGLY, the appeal is DENIED. The Decision dated October 14, 2020 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 13463 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATIONS as to the proper designation of the crimes and the amounts of civil indemnity and damages.

In Criminal Case No. 17006, ABC260708 is found GUILTY of qualified rape of a minor and is sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua without eligibility for parole. He is also DIRECTED to pay the victim the amounts of PHP 150,000.00 as civil indemnity, PHP 150,000.00 as moral damages, and PHP 150,000.00 as exemplary damages, all with legal interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the finality of this Decision until full payment.

In Criminal Case No. 17007, ABC260708 is found GUILTY of sexual assault under Article 266-A(2) of the RPC in relation to Section 5(b) of Republic Act No. 7610. He is sentenced to suffer an indeterminate penalty of 13 years, 9 months and 11 days of reclusion temporal, as minimum, to 16 years, five months, and 10 days of reclusion temporal, as maximum, and to pay a fine of PHP 15,000.00. Also, he is ordered to pay the victim PHP 50,000.00 civil indemnity, PHP 50,000.00 moral damages, and PHP 50,000.00 exemplary damages, which shall all earn interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of finality of this Decision until full payment."
"G.R. No. 266552, January 22, 2024","RICO B. ESCAURIAGA, CRISTINE DELA CRUZ, RENE B. SEVERINO, RALPH ERROL MERCADO, AND GERALDINE GUEVARRA, PETITIONERS, VS. FITNESS FIRST, PHIL., INC., AND LIBERTY CRUZ, RESPONDENTS.","In their Complaint[3] dated June 9, 2017, petitioners sued respondents Fitness First Phil., Inc. (Fitness First) and its Senior Human Resource Manager Liberty Cruz (Cruz) for illegal dismissal, regularization, and other monetary claims.[4] They alleged:[5]

On different dates, respondents engaged them as fitness trainers:[6]
i) Rico Escauriaga	-	May 1, 2008
ii) Junnie Ordoña	-	September 24, 2012
iii) Rene Severino	-	February 1, 2007
iv) Geraldine Guevarra	-	April 1, 2012
v) Cristine Dela Cruz	-	May 26, 2003
vi) Peter John Fullante	-	August 28, 2012
vii) Ralph Errol Mercado	-	September 1, 2006[7]
As fitness trainers, they sold and marketed respondents' physical health training programs and packages. With respondents' equipment, they also conducted actual training sessions for their clients and were paid fixed monthly salaries, 13th month pay, and commissions.[8] On different dates, however, they were reclassified as freelance trainers:
i) Rico Escauriaga	-	May 1, 2012
ii) Junnie Ordoña	-	October 1, 2013
iii) Rene Severino	-	January 1, 2008
iv) Geraldine Guevarra	-	December 1, 2013
v) Cristine Dela Cruz	-	May 1, 2012
vi) Peter John Fullante	-	July 1, 2013
vii) Ralph Errol Mercado	-	July 1, 2007[9]
As freelance fitness trainers, they were paid their salaries but the other labor benefits, i.e. 13th month pay, overtime pay, holiday pay, and rest day pay were discontinued. They were allowed to work at their own choice of time so long as they trained clients for a minimum of 90 hours per month and PHP 80,000.00 worth of physical training program or package. Hours in between trainings were excluded in the 90-hour cap and failure to meet quota translated to salary deduction, or worse, disciplinary action such that repeated failure to meet the quota may subject them to warning, suspension, and even termination of employment.[10]

On March 20, 2017, respondents required them to register their alleged freelance business as required by Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) Regulation No. 4-2014[11] re: Guidelines and Policies for the Monitoring of Service Fees of Professionals. They were assured a 3% increase in their commission upon compliance. Non compliance, on the other hand, was penalized with 20% deduction in their commission and termination or non­ renewal of their freelance agreement. Believing they were regular employees, they did not comply.[12]

Though they did not possess substantial capital or investment in the form of tools, machinery, and work premises, they were engaged to perform activities necessary and desirable in the usual business or trade of respondents—to conduct physical training for the clients of respondents.[13] Lastly, the agreement was a contract of adhesion, and they had no idea about the legal consequences thereof.[14]

Respondents[15] countered that petitioners, who were initially hired as instructors, were later on promoted as freelance personal trainers. As such, they were independent contractors who were not required to observe fixed hours of work. They were required, however, one, to guarantee a minimum fixed monthly sale and conduct 90 hours of training; and two, to observe relevant house rules in dealing with their clients. Petitioners since then renewed their contract until February 1, 2016. This type of employment arrangement is distinguished from fitness instructors who were required to render work nine hours a day, six days a week.[16]

All trainers start as full-time instructors. A progressive commission scheme allows instructors who have obtained a certain level of skill and training to get promoted as freelance personal trainers to take advantage of the higher commissions and flexible working hours. A freelance personal trainer though may revert to being an instructor by manifesting his or her decision to the human resource department.[17]

In compliance with BIR Revenue Regulation No. 4-2014,[18] it offered a 3% increase in commission for those who will register their freelance business with the BIR. Those who fail to register by October 30, 2017, shall suffer termination or non-renewal of their agreement. Only 62 of its freelance trainers complied. Hence, on March 20, 2017, it revoked its offer of higher commission. On June 29, 2017, they then offered petitioners to revert to being instructors. Petitioners, however, would want to enjoy the benefits of both an instructor and freelance trainer. They reiterated their offer on July 18, 2017 but to no avail.[19]","
Petitioners Rico B. Escauriaga (Escauriaga) Cristine Dela Cruz (Dela Cruz), Rene B. Severino (Severino), Ralph Errol Mercado (Mercado), and Geraldine Guevarra (Guevarra) assail the following dispositions of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 165342 titled Rico B. Escauriaga, Cristine Dela Cruz, Rene B. Severino, Ralph Errol Mercado, and Geraldine Guevarra v. The Honorable National Labor Relations Commission (Fourth Division), Fitness First, Phil., Inc.[,] and Liberty Cruz:
1) Decision[1] dated August 18, 2022 affirming the finding of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) that petitioners are independent contractors and the dismissal of petitioners' petition for relief from judgment; and

2) Resolution[2] dated March 24, 2023 denying petitioners' motion for reconsideration.","The Petition is meritorious.

Procedural considerations

Respondents move for the dismissal of the Petition on the following grounds: one, only petitioner Escauriaga signed the Petition sans proof that he was duly authorized to sign on behalf of his co-petitioners; two, not all the counsels of petitioners signed the pleading; three, petitioners erroneously impleaded the NLRC as respondent in violation of Rule 45, Section 4,[53] of the Rules of Court; and lastly, the assailed Decision and Resolution dated December 28, 2018 and February 28, 2019 of the NLRC long attained finality.

Generally, the verification and certification against forum shopping must be signed by all petitioners in a case; otherwise, those who did not sign will be dropped as parties to the case. Under reasonable or justifiable circumstances, however, as when all the plaintiffs or petitioners share a common interest and invoke a common cause of action or defense, the signature of only one of them in the certification against forum shopping substantially complies with the rule.[54] Here, Dela Cruz, Severino, Mercado, and Guevarra share the same cause with Escauriaga in advancing their right to regular employment against respondents.

As for the fact that not all the counsels of petitioners signed the pleading before the Court, the same deserves scant consideration since a genuine signature of one counsel suffices to consider a pleading signed.[55]

The NLRC, however, must be dropped as a party following Rule 45, Section 4[56] of the Rules of Court. A petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45, unlike a petition for certiorari under Rule 65, does not require that the court a quo be impleaded. This distinction proceeds from the nature of these proceedings: a Rule 45 petition involves an appeal from the ruling a quo; a Rule 65 petition is an original special civil action that must implead the lower tribunal alleged to have acted in excess of its jurisdiction.[57]

As for the alleged finality of the assailed NLRC Resolutions, the doctrine on immutability of judgment must yield to substantial justice. True, a final and executory judgment can no longer be attacked by any of the parties or be modified, directly or indirectly, even by the highest court of the land. This Court, however, has relaxed this rule to serve substantial justice considering (a) matters of life, liberty, honor, or property, (b) the existence of special or compelling circumstances, (c) the merits of the case, (d) a cause not entirely attributable to the fault or negligence of the party favored by the suspension of the rules, (e) a lack of any showing that the review sought is merely frivolous and dilatory, and (f) the other party will not be unjustly prejudiced thereby.[58]","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review is GRANTED. The Decision and Resolution dated August 18, 2022 and March 24, 2023, respectively, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 165342 are REVERSED.

"G.R. No. 214741, January 22, 2024 ","PRIVATIZATION AND MANAGEMENT OFFICE, PETITIONER, VS. FIRESTONE CERAMIC, INC.,• RESPONDENT.","Under Republic Act No. 1160[6] and Executive Order No. 60,[7] series of 1954, the Board of Liquidators (BOL) was created as a government agency tasked to liquidate the assets of the defunct Land Settlement and Development Corporation (LASEDECO). Among the assets of LASEDECO that were turned over to the BOL for administration and liquidation is a building designated as Bodega 2 (the subject property) with a floor area of 1,285 square meters (sq. m.) situated inside the compound of the National Development Company (NDC) in Pureza Street, Sta. Mesa, Manila. This property was the subject of a contract of lease between the BOL and respondent Firestone Ceramic, Inc. (FCI) and its predecessors-in-interest since 1965.[8]

On November 17, 2005, the President of the Philippines issued Executive Order No. 471[9] directing the merger of the BOL and PMO, with the latter being the surviving entity. Consequently, the administration over the subject property was turned over to PMO.[10]

On October 11, 2006, FCI and PMO renewed the Contract of Lease[11] over the subject property for the period of January 1, 2006 up to December 31, 2008. Under the Contract of Lease, FCI agreed to pay PMO Five Thousand Five Hundred Pesos (PHP 5,500.00) as monthly rental. The Contract of Lease also had a renewal clause, as follows:

TERM – This Contract of Lease shall be for a term of two years beginning January 1, 2006 up to December 31, 2008 renewable under such terms and conditions as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties, provided, that the LESSEE shall within sixty (60) days before the expiration of this Contract, give notice in writing to the LESSOR of its intention to renew this Contract otherwise the LESSOR shall have the right to enter into an agreement with third parties.[12]
On November 12, 2007, FCI notified PMO in writing of the former's intention to renew the Contract of Lease for another term of two years or from January 1, 2008 up to December 31, 2009. FCI later clarified its November 12, 2007 letter in another letter dated December 17, 2008 stating that the renewal term was for three years beginning January 1, 2009 up to December 31, 2011.[13]

On December 23, 2008, PMO replied to FCI's letter dated December 17, 2008 and informed the latter that PMO noted FCI's intention to renew the Contract of Lease but also informed FCI that PMO was still in the process of conducting a market survey on the lease rentals on bodegas/warehouses in the area to determine the prevailing rental rate and that PMO shall thereafter notify FCI regarding the new rental rates on the leased premises.[14] PMO further added that ""after December 31, 2008, the lease will be treated on a month[-]to[-]month basis until such time that the parties will enter into a new contract of lease under mutually agreed terms and conditions.""[15]

In the meantime, PMO issued a Memorandum[16] dated February 11, 2009 providing its in-house appraisal of the ""Fair Rental Value of the LASEDECO Bodega No. 2"" at ""Php 20/sq.m./mo. for the 1,285 sq. m. or Php 25,700.00 per month.""[17] In preparing the Memorandum, PMO ""searched the market for comparable properties in Manila"" and ""consulted with knowledgeable persons conversant with the fair rental rates in the vicinity such as bank appraisers and real estates [sic] brokers and listings from classified ads.""[18]

After reviewing its in-house appraisal of the subject property, in a letter dated April 27, 2009, PMO offered to renew the Contract of Lease with FCI at the rental of PHP 35/sq. m./month or PHP 44,975.00 per month because PHP 35/sq. m./month was ""the median of the range provided for in the appraisal report [(i.e., the Memorandum dated February 11, 2009)].""[19] PMO also required the conformity of FCI within 15 days upon receipt of this letter; otherwise, PMO would be compelled to offer the subject property to other interested parties.[20]","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] (Petition) under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court filed by petitioner Privatization and Management Office (PMO), assailing the Decision[2] dated March 20, 2014 (assailed Decision) and Resolution[3] dated September 25, 2014 (assailed Resolution) promulgated by the Court of Appeals[4] (CA) in CA-G.R.

I.
First-level courts are vested with provisional authority to decide questions concerning the interpretation of provisions in a contract to resolve the issue of possession in cases of unlawful detainer.
It is established that jurisdiction is conferred by law and determined by the material allegations of the complaint.[48] This principle applies in cases of unlawful detainer. In Spouses Santiago v. Northbay Knitting, Inc.,[49] the Court declared:

Settled is the rule that jurisdiction over the subject matter is conferred by law and is determined by the material allegations of the complaint. It cannot be acquired through, or waived by, any act or omission of the parties, neither can it be cured by their silence, acquiescence, or even express consent. In ejectment cases, the complaint should embody such statement of facts as to bring the party clearly within the class of cases for which the statutes provide a remedy, as these proceedings are summary in nature. The complaint must show enough on its face to give the court jurisdiction without resort to parol evidence.

A complaint sufficiently alleges a cause of action for unlawful detainer if it states the following:

1)
possession of property by the defendant was initially by contract with or by tolerance of the plaintiff;
 	 
2)
eventually, such possession became illegal upon notice by plaintiff to defendant of the termination of the latter's right of possession;
 	 
3)
thereafter, the defendant remained in possession of the property and deprived the plaintiff of the enjoyment of the same; and
 	 
4)
within one (1) year from the last demand on defendant to vacate the property, the plaintiff instituted the complaint for ejectment.[50] (Citations omitted)
Moreover, once jurisdiction is vested by the allegations in the complaint, jurisdiction remains vested in the trial court irrespective of whether or not the plaintiff is entitled to recover upon all or some of the claims asserted therein.[51]

In Vda. de Murga v. Chan[52] (Vda. de Murga), the Court ruled that where the controversy hinges on the correct interpretation of a clause of a contract of lease, that is, whether or not it contemplated an automatic renewal of the lease, the action was not for unlawful detainer but one not capable of pecuniary estimation and, therefore, beyond the competence of a municipal court.[53] Decided in 1968, the pronouncement by the Court in Vda. de Murga has evolved into more recent rulings in favor of having first-level courts resolve all issues related to possession even in a provisional manner. This is consistent with the summary nature of unlawful detainer cases and the amendments of the applicable provisions from Rules 72 and 70 of the 1940 and 1964 Rules of Court, respectively, by Rule 70, Section 16 of the present Rules of Court, as follows:","ACCORDINGLY, premises considered, the instant Petition is hereby GRANTED. The Decision dated March 20, 2014 and Resolution dated September 25, 2014 promulgated by the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 126940 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE and the Decision dated May 7, 2012 of Branch 26, Regional Trial Court of Manila, in Civil Case No. 10-124494 is AFFIRMED. Respondent Firestone Ceramic, Inc. is ordered to immediately vacate the subject property and to restore the peaceful possession thereof to petitioner Privatization and Management Office and to pay the latter the reasonable compensation for the use of the subject property from July 3, 2009 until it has fully vacated the same, as determined pursuant to the last paragraph below.

This case is ordered REMANDED to Branch 3, Metropolitan Trial Court of Manila, to determine the amount of reasonable compensation due to petitioner Privatization and Management Office for respondent Firestone Ceramic, Inc.'s use of the subject property."
"G.R. Nos. 258182 and 259950, January 22, 2024","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. ROMEO CHAN REALES, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","In 2001, then Governor Milagrosa T. Tan (Governor Tan) of the Province of Samar designated Reales as the Officer-in-Charge of the Office of the Provincial Administrator, in addition to his duties as Provincial Accountant.[11] His authority to sign or approve papers and documents as officer-in-charge was limited to the following:
Payroll for salaries and wages;
Disbursement vouchers for payments of light, water, telephone[,] and internet subscription; and
Personnel remittances to GSIS, PhilHealth, BIR, PAG-IBIG, Land Bank of the Philippines[,] and Philippine National Bank.
All other documents and pertinent papers for signature of the Governor shall be forwarded to this office for appropriate action.[12]
As it turned out, Reales created and enrolled fictitious job order workers in the payrolls and took possession of the public monies earmarked for their wages. He particularly facilitated the disbursement of public funds amounting to PHP 76,500.00 for 25 job order workers. He likewise approved the Summary of Payrolls,[13] the Daily Time Records,[14] and the Time Book and Payroll[15] of the job order workers in Catbalogan, Samar covering the periods October 1-31, 2005 and November 1-30, 2005, which gave the green light to Winifreda A. Estremera (Estremera), the Municipal Treasurer, who was also the Special Disbursing Officer/Paymaster, to release the wages of the said workers.[16]

Reales also affixed his signature above the names ""Milagrosa T. Tan, Governor"" and ""Romeo C. Reales, Provincial Accountant"" on the Summary of Payrolls as well as the names ""Milagrosa T. Tan, Foreman or Timekeeper"" and ""Milagrosa T. Tan, Superintendent or Foreman-in-Charge"" on the Time Book and Payroll. He signed each of the 25 Daily Time Records of the job order workers. By doing so, he certified as to the services rendered by the employees concerned and the correctness of the payroll, thus approving their wages. However, none of the 25 job order personnel named in the Daily Time Records and the Time Book and Payroll truly reported for work, and yet their wages were released. The foregoing caused pecuniary damage to the government, to the Province of Samar, in particular.[17]

Eventually, Aurelio A. Bardaje, Jr. (Bardaje) of the Provincial Health Office, instituted an Affidavit/Complaint[18] against Reales 's purported ""illegal transactions of disbursing public money in the guise of Contract of Services of employees.""[19]

After investigation, the Field Investigation Group of the Office of the Ombudsman-Visayas filed a complaint against him and Bienvenido Sabenecio, the Provincial Treasurer, in violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019 and malversation through falsification of public documents under Article 217, in relation to Articles 48 and 171 of the RPC. The investigation revealed the salary payment scam which was presumably perpetrated by the said provincial officials.[20]

Expostulating against the accusations hurled against him,[21] Reales averred that the subject wages were actually received by the respective employees according to the Summary of Payrolls, and that he relied in good faith that the Daily Time Records and payrolls underwent scrutiny by the officers concerned. He maintained his innocence, arguing that he was not charged with the responsibility of ascertaining the correctness of all the details in the approval of the payroll, and that there was no direct proof that he falsified public documents.[22]

With the finding of probable cause against him for the crimes of (1) malversation of public funds through falsification of public/officials documents, defined and penalized under Article 217, in relation to Articles 48 and 171 of the RPC, and (2) violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019,[23] the Office of the Ombudsman filed two separate Informations[24] before the Sandiganbayan, docketed as SB-17-CRM-197 and SB-17-CRM-198. The inculpatory averments thereof state:","Before this Court is an ordinary appeal filed by accused-appellant Romeo Chan Reales (Reales) pursuant to Section 1(a), Rule XI[1] of the 2018 Revised Internal Rules of the Sandiganbayan,[2] assailing the Decision[3] and the Resolution[4] of the Sandiganbayan, in SB-17-CRM-2197 to 2198.
 
In the impugned Decision, the Sandiganbayan convicted Reales of: (1) violation of Section 3(e),[5] Republic Act No. 3019[6] and (2) malversation through falsification of public documents under Article 217,[7] in relation to Articles 48[8] and 171[9] of the Revised Penal Code (RPC). The challenged Resolution, on the other hand, denied his motion for reconsideration[10] thereof.","The Appeal carries weight and conviction.

Criminal Case No.
SB-17-CRM-2197

At the outset, it is settled that in criminal cases, the burden is on the prosecution to prove an accused's guilt beyond reasonable doubt. This is demanded by the due process clause of the Constitution, which protects an accused from conviction except upon proof beyond reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he or she is charged. Unless the prosecution can discharge its burden, the accused need not even offer evidence on his or her behalf, and he or she would be entitled to an acquittal.[50]

An evaluation of the Information in Criminal Case No. SB-17-CRM-2197 readily shows that accused-appellant Reales was charged with violating Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019 for ""acting with evident bad faith, manifest partiality, and/or gross inexcusable negligence,""[51] with the undermentioned overt acts imputed against him:
Causing or approving the disbursement of Php76,500.00 supposedly intended for the wages of the job order employees of the province for the period October 1, 2005 to November 30, 2005, when in truth they had not rendered such services;

Making it appear that they had received the said wages, when in truth and in fact such amount was misappropriated by the accused himself, to the damage and prejudice of the government.[52]
Evidently, the charges against accused-appellant ultimately hinge on the existence of the purported ""ghost"" employees, and whether they had indeed failed to render services. Yet, a review of the evidence on record evinces that the Office of the Ombudsman failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the job order workers did not render work, or that it was accused-appellant who misappropriated the wages supposedly due them.

In convicting him, the Sandiganbayan concluded that the prosecution was successful in proving its claim that the 25 job order workers failed to render work, thus:
Clearly, the Information (SB-CRM-17-2197) shows that the Prosecution anchors its theory on the negative allegation that the job order personnel ""had not rendered"" any work. The Court must perforce begin with a determination of this issue as its resolution is decisive for both cases.

. . . .

By all accounts, the Prosecution had proven its negative allegation that twenty-five (25) job order workers never actually worked. A ""smoking gun"" was revealed in the form of documents formally offered by the Prosecution. The Summary of Payrolls, the Daily Time Records (DTRs) for the periods October 1-31, 2005, and November 1-30, 2005, as well as the Time Book and Payroll for job order workers (i.e., emergency laborers) at [sic] Catbalogan, Samar, for said periods, as certified by Wenifreda A. Estremera, the Special Disbursing Officer/ Paymaster, point to [accused-­appellant] as the fraudster who perpetrated the white-collar crime. Further, OIC-HRMO Juliet T. Dayap attested that [accused-appellant] was –

"". . . authorized to sign payrolls, purchase requests, daily time records of personnel and other vouchers for the operation of the Office of the Provincial Agriculturist."" (Emphasis and Underscoring Supplied.)

Notably, however, said authorization took effect on March 13, 2006, not in 2005. Curiously, Ms. Dayap cannot find, despite diligent search, Personal Data Sheets (PDS), Contracts of Services[,] or any document relative to the hiring of emergency workers for CY 2005.

Furthermore, Julius N. Oballo, the investigator is cocksure about [accused-appellant's] culpability. Oballo's certitude is manifest in his testimony, viz[.]: ","ACCORDINGLY, finding the evidence insufficient to establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt, the Court hereby GRANTS the Appeal. The Decision dated June 25, 2021 and the Resolution dated November 9, 2021 of the Sandiganbayan in SB-17-CRM-2197 to 2198 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE in that accused-appellant Romeo Chan Reales is ACQUITTED of the charges hurled against him.

"G.R. Nos. 242353 & 253530, January 22, 2024","CECILIA QUE YABUT, EUMIR CARLO QUE CAMARA, AND MA. CORAZON QUE GARCIA, PETITIONERS, VS. CAROLINA QUE VILLONGCO, ANA MARIA QUE TAN, ANGELICA QUE GONZALES (NOW DECEASED AND SUBSTITUTED BY HER HEIR ROSA MARIA QUE GONZALES), ELAINE VICTORIA QUE TAN, AND EDISON WILLIAMS QUE TAN, RESPONDENTS.","According to the CA, the Order dated January 26, 2016 of Branch 74 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Malabon City in SEC Case No. SEC-15-001-MN was void for its failure to clearly and distinctly state the facts and the law on which it was based, in violation of Section 1, Rule 36 of the Rules of Court.[4] Moreover, the CA declared as invalid, for lack of quorum, Phil-Ville's annual stockholders' meeting held by petitioners in 2015, as well as the election of the members of the board of Phil-Ville's directors and officers conducted during the said invalid meeting.[5]

On the other hand, this Court issued on January 20, 2021 a Resolution[6] in G.R. No. 253530 denying petitioners' Petition for Review on Certiorari[7] for their failure to show that the CA committed any reversible error when it issued its Decision[8] and Resolution[9] in CA-G.R. SP No. 154888.

In CA-G.R. SP No. 154888, the appellate court held that the Decision dated February 13, 2018 of Branch 74 of the RTC of Malabon City in SEC Case No. SEC-17-0001-MN was bereft of any factual or legal mooring, and thus, void.[10] All the same, instead of ruling on the validity of the annual stockholders' meeting conducted by petitioners in 2017, the CA ordered the remand of the case to the RTC for the commencement of the proceedings.[11]

Fulminating against this Court's January 20, 2021 Resolution, petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration.[12]

To avoid the possibility of conflicting rulings and in light of the similarity in the factual milieux of the aforementioned cases, as well as the grounds relied upon in the Petition for Review and Motion for Reconsideration, the Court deemed it procedurally expedient to consolidate the cases and jointly resolve the matters involved therein.[13]

The undisputed facts binding the consolidated cases follow.

Phil-Ville is a family corporation founded by Geronima Gallego Que (Geronima) for the purpose of engaging in the real estate business.[14] Its authorized capital stock is PHP 20,000,000.00 divided into 200,000 shares with a par value of PHP 100.00 each.[15]

During Geronima's lifetime, she owned 3,140 shares of stock while the remaining 196,860 shares were equally divided among her six children, namely: Carolina, Ana Maria, Angelica, Cecilia, Corazon, and Maria Luisa Que Camara (Luisa), each having 32,810 shares.[16]

Two years prior to Geronima's death on August 31, 2007, she purportedly executed a document captioned as ""Sale of Shares of Stocks"" and dated June 11, 2005,[17] wherein Cecilia acted as her attorney-in-fact. The instrument effected a distribution of her 3,140 shares in the following manner—

a)
Carolina's children were given a total of 523 shares, distributed as follows: Francis Villongco– 131 shares; Carlo Villongco– 131 shares; Michael Villongco– 131 shares; and Marcelia Villongco– 130 shares;
 	 
b)
Ana Maria's daughter, Elaine– 523 shares;
 	 
c)
Angelica– 523 shares;
 	 
d)
Cecilia's children were given a total of 524 shares distributed as follows: Geminiano Yabut– 131 shares; Carlos Yabut– 131 shares; Geronimo Yabut– 131 shares; and John Elston Yabut– 131 shares;
 	 
e)
Corazon's son, Anthony Garcia– 523 shares;
 	 
f)
Luisa's children were given a total of 524 shares distributed as follows: Eumir– 174 shares; Paolo Camara (Paolo) – 175 shares; and Abimar Camara (Abimar) – 175 shares.[18]
Based on the apportionment, Carolina, Ana Maria, and Angelica, by themselves or through their children (Villongco Group), individually received 523 shares from the distribution. Meanwhile, Cecilia, Corazon, and Luisa, through their children (Yabut Group) received either 523 or 524 shares each.","These consolidated cases are set in the context of a familial dispute apropos the validity of the transfer of certain shares of stock of Phil-Ville Development and Housing Corporation (Phil-Ville), which consequently spawned a seemingly endless cycle of litigation concerning its annual stockholders' meetings, as well as the ensuing election of its board of directors and officers.
In G.R. No. 242353, petitioners Cecilia Que Yabut (Cecilia), Eumir Carlo Que Camara (Eumir), and Ma. Corazon Que Garcia (Corazon) filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari,[1] impugning the Decision[2] and the Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA), which granted the petition of respondents Carolina Que Villongco (Carolina), Ana Maria Que Tan (Ana Maria), Angelica Que Gonzales (Angelica) (now deceased and substituted by her heir Rosa Maria Que Gonzales), Elaine Victoria Que Tan (Elaine), and Edison Williams Que Tan (Edison) and denied the motion for reconsideration thereof, respectively, in CA-G.R. SP No. 144363.","After ploughing through the diametrically opposed postulations of the parties, this Court resolves to partly grant the Petition for Review on Certiorari in G.R. No. 242353 and deny the Motion for Reconsideration in G.R. No. 253530.

The 2015 and 2017 Election Contest Orders are void for their abject failure to state the legal or factual bases for their disposition.
The matters raised before this Court are neither complex nor unfamiliar. Only recently, in the aforecited case of Villongco,[69] the Court had already untangled some of the issues which plagued the long-drawn-out dispute between the parties.

In Villongco, the Court explicated that the Decision[70] of the RTC in the 2014 election contest was void for precisely the same reason the 2015 and 2017 Election Contest Orders had been nullified by the CA, i.e., failure to state the factual and legal moorings for its disposition. Citing De Leon v. People,[71] the Court thus elucidated:

Under Section 14, Article VIII of the Constitution, no decision shall be rendered by any court without expressing therein clearly and distinctly the facts and the law on which it is based. Section l of Rule 36 of the Rules of Court provides that a judgment or final order determining the merits of the case shall be in writing personally and directly prepared by the judge, stating clearly and distinctly the facts and the law on which it is based, signed by him and filed with the clerk of the court.

Faithful adherence to the requirements of Section 14, Article VIII of the Constitution is indisputably a paramount component of due process and fair play. A decision that does not clearly and distinctly state the facts and the law on which it is based leaves the parties in the dark as to how it was reached and is precisely prejudicial to the losing party, who is unable to pinpoint the possible errors of the court for review by a higher tribunal. More than that, the requirement is an assurance to the parties that, in arriving at a judgment, the judge did so through the processes of legal reasoning. It is, thus, a safeguard against the impetuosity of the judge, preventing him from deciding ipse dixit.

The standard ""expected of the judiciary"" is that the decision rendered makes clear why either party prevailed under the applicable law to the facts as established. Nor is there any rigid formula as to the language to be employed to satisfy the requirement of clarity and distinctness. The discretion of the particular judge in this respect, while not unlimited, is necessarily broad. There is no sacramental form of words which he must use upon pain of being considered as having failed to abide by what the Constitution directs.[72]

While the RTC Decision in Villongco was nullified for merely adopting the allegations of the plaintiffs therein, the 2015 and 2017 Election Orders are in no better shape.

To recall, the 2015 and 2017 Election Contest Orders dismissed respondents' complaints by merely referencing the pendency of Civil Case No. CV-940-MN and holding that a resolution of the issues in the former would prejudge the latter. However, the discussion and substantiation of these findings are so perfunctory that they are presented as neither legitimate nor capable of withstanding judicial scrutiny. The entirety of the 2015 Election Contest Order[73] states as follows:

Submitted for resolution by this Court is the instant Election Contest filed by plaintiffs, praying inter alia that:

a) On the First Cause of Action, declaring as null and void and of no effect whatsoever the election of [petitioners] Cecilia Que Yabut, Ma. Corazon Que Garcia, and Eumir Que Camara as Directors of Phil-Ville considering the invalidity and illegality of the holding of the alleged annual meeting of the stockholders on 31 January 2015 at Max’s Restaurant, Gov. Pascual cor M.H. Del Pilar, Tugatog, Malabon City at 5:00 o’clock in the afternoon, the lack of quorum therein, the questionable manner by which it was conducted. including the invalid inclusion in the voting of the disputed 3,142 shares of stock of Phil-Ville, the questionable validation of proxies and the presentation and exercise of voting rights by any alleged proxy or proxies and the representation and exercise of voting rights by any alleged proxy of the stockholders who was/were not personally present at the said meeting and the invalidity of the proclamation of the winners in the said election;

. . . .

After perusing the arguments raised by parties vis-à-vis the judicial affidavits of their respective witnesses, the Court is of the considered view that the reliefs prayed for may not be granted without prejudging the factual and legal issues duly raised by the parties and are still pending before this Court in Civil Case No. CV-940-MN, more particularly, the validity of the 3,142 disputed shares of stock of corporation.","WHEREFORE, the Petition for Review on Certiorari in G.R. No. 242353 is hereby PARTLY GRANTED. Consequently, the Decision dated October 20, 2017 and the Resolution dated October 2, 2018 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 144363 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The case is ordered REMANDED to Branch 74 of the Regional Trial Court, Malabon City, for further proceedings in accordance with this Resolution.

The Motion for Reconsideration in G.R. No. 253530 is DENIED. The Resolution of this Court dated January 20, 2021 is AFFIRMED."
"G.R. No. 266921, January 22, 2024","NATIONAL TRANSMISSION CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. SPOUSES LOUIS MARCO S. MANALO AND ROWENA MARIE T. MANALO, REPRESENTED BY FREDDIE M. ARGUELLES, AND NONYLON D. PEDRAJA AND NONNA D. PEDRAJA, REPRESENTED BY JULIANITO B. MONCAYO, RESPONDENTS.","This case stemmed from a Complaint[6] for Inverse Condemnation under Rule 67 of the Rules of Court, as amended by Republic Act No. 8974[7] and later by Republic Act No. 10752 dated February 24, 2020 (Complaint), filed by respondents against TRANSCO before the RTC. In the said Complaint, respondents prayed, inter alia, that judgment be rendered determining and fixing the fair market value of the lots subject of this case pursuant to Republic Act No. 10752.

The records show that respondents are the owners of parcels of land located in Tanauan City, Batangas. Specifically, spouses Manalo and the Pedrajas own Lot No. 1374-B-2 in Barangay Banjo East and Lot No. 1465-J in Barangay Bagumbayan, respectively.[8] TRANSCO, on the other hand, is a government corporation organized to acquire all the transmission assets of the National Power Corporation (NAPOCOR), which shall assume the electrical transmission function of the NAPOCOR, and have the powers and functions granted by law. Corollary to this, TRANSCO is given the right to exercise the power of eminent domain subject to the requirements of the Constitution and existing laws.[9]

Pursuant to this power, NAPOCOR, the predecessor of TRANSCO, constructed 500-kilovolt (KV) transmission line traversing respondents' properties for the purpose of transmitting electric power from Batangas to Laguna and Metro Manila in 1998. As alleged by respondents, the areas affected by the power transmission facility are the 2,376 square meters of Lot No. 1374-B-2 and 10,534 square meters of Lot No. 1465-J (subject lots), respectively in favor of spouses Manalo and the Pedrajas. According to TRANSCO, no expropriation proceedings were initiated at the time of taking of the subject lots.[10]

On August 3, 2020, TRANSCO filed its Answer (with Special and Affirmative Defenses and Counterclaim), praying that the Complaint be dismissed for lack of merit.[11]

Subsequently, on September 15, 2020, respondents filed a Motion to Require Defendant to Comply with Republic Act No. 10752 (Motion).[12] In their Motion, respondents argued that while the procedural aspect of the inverse condemnation case is governed by Rule 67 of the Rules of Court, the determination of the amount of compensation should be sanctioned by Republic Act No. 10752. Concomitantly, Section 6 of Republic Act No. 10752 dictates that TRANSCO should be ordered to deposit to the RTC the amount equivalent to the Bureau of Internal Revenue's (BIR) current zonal valuation of the subject lots as provisional compensation.[13] Moreover, respondents averred that under Zoning Ordinance No. 2018-12 dated March 12, 2018, both the properties of spouses Manalo and the Pedrajas are classified as residential properties with zonal values at PHP 3,500.00 per square meter and PHP 3,750.00 per square meter, respectively. Hence, respondents prayed that an order be issued directing TRANSCO to deposit as provisional compensation the amounts of PHP 8,316,000.00 to spouses Manalo and PHP 39,502,500.00 to the Pedrajas.[14]

On November 25, 2020, TRANSCO submitted its Comment/Oppositions, where it countered that Republic Act No. 10752 and its provisions on provisional deposit apply only to new projects and not to old or existing transmission lines constructed long before the enactment of the said law. Thus, in the event that the payment of provisional deposit is granted, it should be based on the assessed value of the subject lots as provided under Rule 67 of the Rules of Court.[15]","Assailed in this Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court are the Decision[2] dated December 12, 2022 and the Resolution[3] dated April 4, 2023 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 171202, which affirmed the Order[4] dated January 14, 2021 of the Regional Trial Court of Tanauan City, Batangas, Branch 66 (RTC), which, in turn, granted the Motion to Require Defendant to Comply with Republic Act No. 10752[5] filed by respondents spouses Louis Marco S. Manalo and Rowena Marie T. Manalo, represented by Freddie M. Arguelles (spouses Manalo), and Nonylon D. Pedraja and Nonna D. Pedraja, represented by Julianito L. Moncayo (the Pedrajas; collectively, respondents) against petitioner National Transmission Corporation (TRANSCO).","The Petition lacks merit.

At the outset, it bears stressing that both Rule 67 of the Rules of Court and Republic Act No. 8974 govern expropriation proceedings for national infrastructure projects.[37] Notably, Republic Act No. 8974 was later repealed by Republic Act No. 10752, which was issued on March 7, 2016.

On this score, Rule 67, Section 2 of the Rules of Court allows the expropriating agency's entry into the real property upon deposit of an amount equivalent to the assessed value of the property for purposes of taxation, viz.:

SECTION 2. Entry of plaintiff upon depositing value with authorized government depositary. – Upon the filing of the complaint or at any time thereafter and after due notice to the defendant, the plaintiff shall have the right to take or enter upon the possession of the real property involved if he deposits with the authorized government depositary an amount equivalent to the assessed value of the property for purposes of taxation to be held by such bank subject to the orders of the court. Such deposit shall be in money, unless in lieu thereof the court authorizes the deposit of a certificate of deposit of a government bank of the Republic of the Philippines payable on demand to the authorized government depositary. (Emphasis supplied)

On the other hand, Republic Act No. 8974, enacted on November 7, 2000, requires a deposit of the amount equivalent to 100% of the value of the property based on the current relevant zonal valuation of the BIR before the implementing agency may be ordered to take possession of the property, to wit:

SECTION 4. Guidelines for Expropriation Proceedings. – Whenever it is necessary to acquire real property for the right-of-way, site or location for any national government infrastructure project through expropriation, the appropriate implementing agency shall initiate the expropriation proceedings before the proper court under the following guidelines:

(a) Upon the filing of the complaint, and after due notice to the defendant, the implementing agency shall immediately pay the owner of the property the amount equivalent to the sum of (1) one hundred percent (100%) of the value of the property based on the current relevant zonal valuation of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR); and (2) the value of the improvements and/or structures as determined under Section 7 hereof; (Emphasis supplied)

The guidelines for expropriation proceedings provided under Republic Act No. 8974 were, thereafter, substantially maintained by Republic Act No. 10752. Hence, Section 6(a)(1) of Republic Act No. 10752 reads:

SECTION 6. Guidelines for Expropriation Proceedings. – Whenever it is necessary to acquire real property for the right-of-way site or location for any national government infrastructure through expropriation, the appropriate implementing agency, through the Office of the Solicitor General the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel, or their deputized government or private legal counsel, shall immediately initiate the expropriation proceedings before the proper court under the following guidelines:

(a)
Upon the filing of the complaint or at any time thereafter, and after due notice to the defendant, the implementing agency shall immediately deposit to the court in favor of the owner the amount equivalent to the sum of:




(1)
One hundred percent (100%) of the value of the land based on the current relevant zonal valuation of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) issued not more than three (3) years prior to the filing of the expropriation complaint subject to subparagraph (c) of this section; (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)
Relatedly, Felisa made a comparison of the foregoing rules in this wise:

The general rule is that upon the filing of the expropriation complaint, the plaintiff has the right to take or enter into possession of the real property involved if he deposits with the authorized government depositary an amount equivalent to the assessed value of the property. An exception to this procedure is provided by [Republic Act No.] 8974 with respect to national government projects, which requires the payment of 100% of the zonal value of the property to be expropriated as the provisional value. ...

Section 2, Rule 67 of the Rules of Court requires the expropriator to deposit the amount equivalent to the assessed value of the property to be expropriated prior to entry. The assessed value of a real property constitutes a mere percentage of its fair market value based on the assessment levels fixed under the pertinent ordinance passed by the local government where the property is located. In contrast, [Republic Act No.] 8974 requires the payment of the amount equivalent to 100% of the current zonal value of the property which is usually a higher amount.[38]

It is worthy to note, at this point, that Felisa has a stark similarity with the facts of this case. There, Felisa Agricultural Corporation initiated inverse condemnation proceedings against TRANSCO which had long entered its property and constructed transmission towers and lines. At the time the said initiatory pleading was filed, Republic Act No. 8974 was already in effect; hence, the Court declared that said law should apply in the determination of the provisional value of the expropriated property.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DENIED. The Decision dated December 12, 2022 and the Resolution dated April 4, 2023 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 171202 are AFFIRMED."
" G.R. No. 253450, January 22, 2024","LANI NAYVE-PUA, PETITIONER, VS. UNION BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","Lani filed a Complaint for annulment of the REM, foreclosure mortgage, and certificate of sale before the RTC against International Exchange Bank (now Union Bank) and Spouses Cromwell and Catherine Uy (Spouses Uy).[6]

Lani alleged that she and Stephen Pua (Stephen) began living together as husband and wife in December 1975. During their cohabitation, all four of their children were born: (1) Steven Pua born in November 1976; (2) Brian Pua born in November 1978; (3) Mark Pua born in January 1981; and (4) Kristine Pua born in April 1982. In March 1978, Lani and Stephen bought a property inside a subdivision in Diliman, Quezon City covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. RT-117283 (275199).[7] Lani claimed that they acquired the property through their joint efforts. However, the title was registered under the name of Stephen Pua, ""of legal age, Filipino, single[.]""[8] In July 1983, Lani and Stephen got married. The house constructed on the property allegedly became their family home.[9]

In January 2004, Lani learned that the property was mortgaged to and foreclosed by Union Bank, which notified them that the period to redeem the property was set to expire by February 2004. Upon verification, Lani discovered that Spouses Uy mortgaged their family home in favor of Union Bank. Spouses Uy used it as collateral for their loan by way of credit accommodation.[10] This arrangement happened because Cromwell Uy is the son of Stephen's brother, George Pua.[11]

When Spouses Uy failed to pay their loan, Union Bank foreclosed the mortgage. The property was sold at a public auction. Later, Lani learned that in executing the loan agreement and mortgage, Spouses Uy submitted a Special Power of Attorney[12] (SPA) indicating that Lani and Stephen granted them the authority to mortgage the property. However, Lani denied affixing her name and signature on the SPA, claiming forgery. She maintained that she did not consent to the mortgage.[13]

On the other hand, Union Bank averred that since Lani and Stephen were married on July 20, 1983, their property regime under the Civil Code was conjugal partnership of gains. The property was Stephen's exclusive property because it was acquired before their marriage, and the title covering the property indicates that the registered owner is ""STEPHEN PUA, of legal age, Filipino, single[.]"" Consequently, Lani has no cause of action against it.[14]

Union Bank also stressed that the duly notarized SPA, which Spouses Uy presented, bore both signatures of Lani and Stephen. The REM and the SPA were annotated at the back of the title of the property, including Spouses Uy's outstanding loan of PHP 9,259,277.96. Since Spouses Uy reneged on their payments, Union Bank foreclosed the REM. Thereafter, the property was sold in a public auction. On February 10, 2003, a certificate of sale was issued to Union Bank as the highest bidder. Union Bank informed Stephen that he had until February 10, 2004 to redeem the property. But a day before the redemption period expired, Lani filed a complaint against Union Bank and Spouses Uy, seeking to annul the mortgage and the foreclosure proceedings.[15]

On August 30, 2016, the RTC dismissed the complaint. It ruled that Lani failed to prove that she was a co-owner.[16] The RTC reasoned that since Lani and Stephen were married in 1983 (or before the effectivity of the Family Code), their property regime, as governed by the Civil Code, is conjugal partnership of gains. Under this type of property relation, all properties acquired during the marriage shall be part of the conjugal fund and will be enjoyed by both spouses. They will, however, continue to enjoy their respective ownership rights over their separate properties. Since the property involved was acquired before their marriage, and the certificate of title indicates that it is owned by ""STEPHEN PUA, of legal age, Filipino, single,"" there is a strong presumption that Stephen is its exclusive owner. Thus, Lani's signature in the SPA is unnecessary for the validity of the mortgage contract.[17]

Lani disagreed and appealed to the CA. She invoked Article 147[18] of the Family Code. She insisted that she and Stephen are co-owners of the property because it was acquired during their cohabitation as husband and wife and through their joint efforts.[19] To support her claim, Lani presented their marriage contract[20] to prove that she and Stephen cohabited and were exempted from securing a marriage license. Lani further presented the birth certificates[21] of her children, who were all born before their marriage in 1983.

On December 20, 2019, the CA affirmed the findings of the RTC. It ruled that the presumption under Article 147 of the Family Code is only prima facie and cannot prevail over a valid title registered under the Torrens system. The CA also ruled that Lani failed to establish that she and Stephen lived exclusively as husband and wife, without the benefit of marriage. The CA found that Stephen's address in the Deed of Sale, and his children's birth certificates, all indicate that Stephen is a resident of Cauayan, Isabela, where he runs his business of operating a movie house. Lani did not show that she ""actually"" contributed to purchase the property,[22] thus:

Aside from the bare allegations of the appellant Lani, the appellant Lani did not present any evidence that: she (the appellant Lani) and Stephen lived exclusively as husband and wife, without the benefit of marriage, and that each one of them was not incapacitated to marry; and that the appellant Lani had made an actual contribution to purchase the Subject Property. Further, the appellant Lani's claim of having administered the Subject Property was unsubstantiated.

Clearly, the appellant Lani did not prove that she (the appellant Lani) was a co-owner of the Subject Property. Thus, the appellant Lani had no cause of action against the appellees.

We DISMISS the appeal.","If a couple's property regime is conjugal partnership of gains and, before getting married, they cohabited as husband and wife without any legal impediment to marry, a property bought with the exclusive money of one party before the marriage and brought into the marriage will belong only to that party, as long as there is no proof that the other party contributed in any manner to the property's acquisition.
We resolve this Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assailing the Decision[2] dated December 20, 2019 and the Resolution[3] dated September 2, 2020 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 108917.

The assailed issuances affirmed the findings of the Decision[4] dated August 30, 2016 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 216 (RTC) in Civil Case No. Q-04-51749, which dismissed Lani Nayve-Pua's (Lani) complaint and upheld the validity of the real estate mortgage[5] (REM) in favor of Union Bank of the Philippines (Union Bank).","We deny the Petition.

At the outset, we have consistently declared that factual findings of the trial court, when adopted and confirmed by the CA, are binding and conclusive upon this Court. We are not triers of facts. It is not this Court's function to analyze or weigh evidence all over again.[35] While these rules do admit exceptions, Lani failed to prove any of the established exceptions that would compel us to go over and rule on the factual evidence. As such, this Court will refrain from probing the factual conclusions, especially that the questioned findings are supported by sufficient evidence.[36]

Lani failed to prove that the mortgaged property is conjugal. Significantly, Stephen acquired the property before he married Lani
The mortgaged property was acquired in 1978, under the name of ""STEPHEN PUA, of legal age, Filipino, single,"" when Lani and Stephen were cohabiting without the benefit of marriage. When Lani and Stephen married on July 1983, the Civil Code[37] provides that their property relations shall be governed by the rules on conjugal partnership of gains, absent any proof showing that the spouses entered into a marriage settlement. Under this property arrangement, all property of the conjugal partnership of gains is owned in common by the husband and wife.[38]

In Malabanan v. Malabanan, Jr.,[39] we explained that property acquired during the marriage is presumed to be conjugal,[40] and it is unnecessary to prove that the money used to purchase a property came from the conjugal fund. What must be established is that the property was acquired during the marriage.[41] This presumption was reiterated in Alexander v. Escalona,[42] wherein we held that this presumption may only be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence. Notably, the presumption will still apply even if the property is under the name of only one spouse.[43] Hence, when the property is acquired during the marriage, the burden of proof is upon the spouse claiming the property's exclusivity to establish it.[44]

Here, however, Lani admitted that the property was acquired before her marriage to Stephen in 1983. Consequently, the presumption that the property is conjugal shall not apply, especially since the property is under Stephen's name alone. Lani bears a heavier onus to prove that the property is indeed conjugal.

Under the Civil Code, the following are considered as paraphernal or exclusive property of each spouse in a conjugal partnership of gains:

Article 148. The following shall be the exclusive property of each spouse:

(1)
That which is brought to the marriage as his or her own;
 	 
(2)
That which each acquires, during the marriage, by lucrative title;
 	 
(3)
That which is acquired by right of redemption or by exchange with other property belonging to only one of the spouses;
 	 
(4)
That which is purchased with exclusive money of the wife or of the husband. (Emphasis supplied)
This was echoed by the Family Code, which applies suppletorily to the provisions of the Civil Code concerning the conjugal partnership of gains, viz.:

Article 109. The following shall be the exclusive property of each spouse:

(1)
That which is brought to the marriage as his or her own;
 	 
(2)
That which each acquires during the marriage by gratuitous title;
 	 
(3)
That which is acquired by right of redemption, by barter or by exchange with property belonging to only one of the spouses; and
 	 
(4)
That which is purchased with exclusive money of the wife or of the husband.
Under the conjugal partnership of gains, the mortgaged property is Stephen's exclusive property, which was brought into their marriage as his own. Yet under Article 158 of the Civil Code, a paraphernal or separate property could turn into conjugal when it was brought into the marriage without awaiting reimbursement before or at the liquidation of the partnership, upon the construction of the building on it at the expense of the partnership, viz.:
","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DENIED. The Decision dated December 20, 2019 and the Resolution dated September 2, 2020 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 108917 are AFFIRMED."
"G.R. No. 253448, January 22, 2024","MARK FRANKLIN A. LIM II, PETITIONER, VS. FIELD INVESTIGATION BUREAU, OFFICE OF THE DEPUTY OMBUDSMAN FOR THE MILITARY AND OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICES [MOLEO], RESPONDENT.","At the time that the complaint was filed against him by the OMB-MOLEO's Field Investigation Bureau (FIB), Lim was Head of the Coast Guard Special Service Office (CGSSO) for the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG). According to the FIB, sometime in 2014, the PCG released several Special Cash Advances (SCA) to its 21 Special Disbursing Officers (SDO), including Lim. Of the total amount released, PHP 500,000.00 was released to Lim for the procurement of office supplies and information technology (IT) equipment.[6]

Subsequently, the Commission on Audit (COA) issued its Audit Observation Memorandum No. (AOM) PCG-2015-018[7] dated April 15, 2015. The COA noted that the cash advances lacked the following: (1) the requisite office orders duly designating the SDOs as such; (2) the addresses of some of the dealers and suppliers were not indicated in the sales invoices, cash invoices, and official receipts; (3) and that when contacted by the COA, some of these dealers and suppliers denied issuing the invoices and receipts.[8]

Based on AOM PCG-2015-018, the FIB criminally charged Lim and the other SDOs, as well as the Commandant, Deputy Chief for Comptrollership, Internal Auditor, and Accounting Head of the PCG with malversation of public funds through falsification under Article 217 of the Revised Penal Code and violation of Section 3(e)[9] of Republic Act No. 3019,[10] in relation with Republic Act No. 9184.[11] They were also administratively charged with serious dishonesty, grave misconduct, and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service. With regard to Lim, the FIB alleged that as with all the other SDOs, the disbursement of PHP 500,000.00 to him was not supported by any office order duly designating him as an SDO. Further, the procurement for which the amount was disbursed did not go through public bidding, with no justification for resorting to alternative methods of procurement.[12]

For his defense, Lim countered that he was duly designated as the SDO of the Special Service Office (SSO) through Special Order No. 48 dated March 18, 2013,[13] with an authorization to disburse a maximum amount of PHP 500,000.00. Of that amount, he claimed that only PHP 77,166.25 was found by the COA to be supported by ""questionable receipts,"" and that he has since settled that amount. He also justified the resort to emergency procurement by claiming that it was done amidst the relief operations after the onslaught of Typhoon Yolanda.[14] Further, the criminal cases filed against him and the other PCG officials in relation to these disbursements were dismissed through a Consolidated Resolution[15] issued by the Ombudsman.","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assailing the Decision[2] dated September 26, 2019 and the Resolution[3] dated September 14, 2020 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 153962, which affirmed the Consolidated Decision[4] dated July 19, 2017 and the Consolidated Order[5] dated November 6, 2017 of the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for the Military and Other Law Enforcement Offices (OMB-MOLEO) in OMB-P-A-16-0545. The OMB-MOLEO found petitioner Mark Franklin A. Lim II (Lim) guilty of serious dishonesty, grave misconduct, and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service, and accordingly, imposed upon him the penalty of dismissal from service.","The petition is partly meritorious.

As will be explained here, the Court affirms with modification the finding of administrative liability against Lim.

Generally, only questions of law are permitted in petitions for review on certiorari filed under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, as this Court is not a trier of facts.[31] Further, owing to the special knowledge and expertise of the Ombudsman of matters within their jurisdiction, their factual findings, when supported by substantial evidence, are accorded great respect, if not finality.[32]

Nevertheless, the rule preventing factual review admits numerous exceptions, such as when there is a misapprehension of the facts on the part of the Ombudsman or the CA.[33] Here, Lim is charged with two acts from which the offenses of serious dishonesty, grave misconduct, and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service are derived: first, that he acted as an SDO and disbursed the amount of PHP 500,000.00 without authority; and second, that he allowed the procurement of office supplies and IT equipment without public bidding as required by Republic Act No. 9184.

On the first act, the Court finds that the Ombudsman, as affirmed by the CA, incorrectly found that Lim was not authorized nor duly designated as the SDO. On the contrary, Special Order No. 48 is the written authority for Lim to act as SDO. The order states in part:","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is PARTLY GRANTED. The Decision dated September 26, 2019 and the Resolution dated September 14, 2020 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 153962 are hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. Petitioner Mark Franklin A. Lim II is found GUILTY of the administrative offense of simple misconduct. He is meted with the penalty of SUSPENSION for a period of one month and one day. In case suspension may no longer be enforced, he is meted a FINE in the amount equivalent to his salary for the aforesaid period."
"G.R. No. 228980, January 22, 2024","MARVIN VILLANUEVA Y IRODISTAN, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","This case stemmed from an Information[7] filed before the RTC, charging Villanueva with the said crime, the accusatory portion of which reads:
The undersigned Asst. State Prosecutor accuses MARVIN VILLANUEVA y IRODISTAN, of the crime of violation of Sec. 5 (b), RA 7610, committed as follows:

That on or about the 25th day of November, 2010, in the City of xxxxxxxxxxx, Philippines[,] within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with lewd design, did, then and there, willfully, unlawfully[,] and feloniously pull up the skirt and touch the buttocks of [AAA],[8] a lascivious conduct constituting sexual abuse.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[9] (Emphasis in the original)
Upon arraignment, Villanueva pleaded not guilty to the crime charged. Thereafter, trial on the merits ensued.[10]

The prosecution presented the following witnesses to establish the guilt of Villanueva: (a) the private complainant, AAA; (b) the private complainant's friend, BBB; (c) Traffic Enforcer Ronald Tolentino (Enforcer Tolentino); and (d) Police Officer III Wirrel P. Jualo (PO3 Jualo) and Police Officer I Anthony D. Antoyne (PO1 Antoyne).[11]

The prosecution alleged that at around 4:00 p.m. of November 25, 2010, AAA—who was then 15 years old, being born on December 31, 1994, as evidenced by her Certificate of Live Birth,[12] together with her friend, BBB, and BBB's 11-year-old sister, CCC, were on their way home from school. They were ascending the nonworking escalator of the overpass in xxxxxxxx, xxxxxxxxx, when suddenly, Villanueva stood behind AAA. BBB noticed Villanueva and told AAA to hurry. AAA then felt her skirt being lifted and her buttocks being touched by the person behind her. When AAA looked behind her, she saw Villanueva holding a mirror below her skirt. She confronted Villanueva, but the latter hurriedly left and ran towards the highway. AAA was shocked. BBB then shouted ""May manghihipo! Tulong, tulong! Magnanakaw!” BBB was of the notion that Villanueva took AAA's cellphone. The bystanders tried to chase Villanueva upon hearing BBB's call for help. Enforcer Tolentino heard the commotion and apprehended Villanueva. Later, Villanueva was turned over to PO3 Jualo and PO1 Antoyne, who brought him to the police station for further investigation.[13]

In defense, Villanueva denied the allegation against him and offered a different version of the events. He averred that on the date of the incident, his mother directed him to buy pancit. Villanueva boarded a tricycle and got off in xxxxxxxxxxx, xxxxxxxxxxx. At the foot of the nonworking escalator in xxxxxxxxxxx overpass, Villanueva saw a group of female students giving each other beso-beso (kiss on the cheeks). He climbed the escalator while holding his two cellular phones and when he was about two steps behind from AAA, he tried to overtake the latter from her left side. At this point, he heard someone shouting ""Snatcher, snatcher!"" Villanueva then put his two cellphones inside his pockets and hurriedly ran down the escalator for fear that the bystanders would mob him. He continued to run while the bystanders were chasing him. Villanueva asked Enforcer Tolentino for help, but the bystanders began to maul him. Enforcer Tolentino handcuffed him and requested for police assistance. Later, PO3 Jualo and PO1 Antoyne arrived and brought him to the police station.[14]","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the Decision[2] dated October 28, 2016 and the Resolution[3] dated January 4, 2017 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR No. 35988, which affirmed with modification the Decision[4] dated August 28, 2013 of xxxxxxxxxxx Regional Trial Court, xxxxxxxxxxx (RTC) in Crim. Case No. 10-0985, finding petitioner Marvin Villanueva y Irodistan (Villanueva) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Article III, Section 5(b)[5] of Republic Act (RA) No. 7610.[6","The Petition has no merit.

Article III, Section 5(b) of RA No. 7610, provides:
Section 5. Child Prostitution and Other Sexual Abuse. – Children, whether male or female, who for money, profit, or any other consideration or due to the coercion or influence of any adult, syndicate or group, indulge in sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct, are deemed to be children exploited in prostitution and other sexual abuse.

The penalty of reclusion temporal in its medium period to reclusion perpetua shall be imposed upon the following:

. . . .

(b) Those who commit the act of sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct with a child exploited in prostitution or subject to other sexual abuse; Provided, That when the victims is under twelve (12) years of age, the perpetrators shall be prosecuted under Article 335, paragraph 3, for rape and Article 336 of Act No. 3815, as amended, the Revised Penal Code, for rape or lascivious conduct, as the case may be: Provided, That the penalty for lascivious conduct when the victim is under twelve (12) years of age shall be reclusion temporal in its medium period;

. . . .
The elements of sexual abuse under the said provision are as follows: (a) the accused commits the act of sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct; (b) the said act is performed with a child exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse; and (c) the child, whether male or female, is below 18 years of age.[34]

Relatedly, lascivious conduct is defined in Section 2(h) of the Implementing Rules and Regulations[35] (IRR) of RA No. 7610 as ""the intentional touching, either directly or through clothing, of the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks, or the introduction of any object into the genitalia, anus or mouth, of any person, whether of the same or opposite sex, with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person, bestiality, masturbation, lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of a person.""

In People v. Tulagan,[36] the Court, through Associate Justice Diosdado M. Peralta, held that the term ""other sexual abuse"" is a broad term that includes all other acts of sexual abuse other than prostitution, to wit:
The term ""other sexual abuse,"" on the other hand, is construed in relation to the definitions of ""child abuse"" under Section 3, Article I of R.A. No. 7610 and ""sexual abuse"" under Section 2(g) of the Rules and Regulations on the Reporting and Investigation of Child Abuse Cases. In the former provision, ""child abuse"" refers to the maltreatment, whether habitual or not, of the child which includes sexual abuse, among other matters. In the latter provision, ""sexual abuse"" includes the employment, use, persuasion, inducement, enticement or coercion of a child to engage in, or assist another person to engage in, sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct or the molestation, prostitution, or incest with children. Thus, the term ""other sexual abuse"" is broad enough to include all other acts of sexual abuse other than prostitution. Accordingly, a single act of lascivious conduct is punished under Section 5(b), Article III, when the victim is 12 years old and below 18, or 18 or older under special circumstances.[37] (Emphasis supplied)
Given the foregoing legal parameters, the Court finds that the prosecution has duly proven all the elements of lascivious conduct punishable under Article III, Section 5(b) of RA No. 7610. Notably, AAA's minority was sufficiently established with the presentation of her Certificate of Live Birth. The RTC, as sustained by the CA, also found her testimony clear, candid, and categorical when she relayed that Villanueva lifted her skirt and touched her buttocks. Accordingly, the overt act of Villanueva is tantamount to a lascivious conduct.

Moreover, Villanueva's defense that it was impossible for him to commit the alleged act, considering that he was holding his two cellphones in both hands at a crowded place in broad daylight, was not only unsubstantiated, but was also successfully belied by AAA and the other witnesses. AAA testified that she felt her skirt being lifted and her buttocks being touched by the person behind her. Moreover, BBB testified that Villanueva in fact approached AAA from behind and even warned the latter to hurry. The Court has repeatedly held that when the offended parties are young and immature girls, as in this case, courts are inclined to lend credence to their version of what transpired, considering not only their relative vulnerability, but also the shame and embarrassment to which they would be exposed if the matter about which they testified were not true.[38]

Relevantly, denial is inherently a weak defense, which cannot outweigh positive testimony. A categorical statement that has the earmarks of truth prevails over a bare denial, which can easily be fabricated and is inherently unreliable.[39] Denial, if unsubstantiated by clear and convincing evidence, is a self-serving assertion that deserves no weight in law,[40] as in this case. Hence, Villanueva's denial cannot prevail over the positive testimony of the private complainant.","
ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DENIED. The Decision dated October 28, 2016 and the Resolution dated January 4, 2017 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 35988 are hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. Petitioner Marvin Villanueva y Irodistan is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of lascivious conduct under Article III, Section 5(b) of Republic Act No. 7610. He is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of imprisonment for an indeterminate period of 14 years and eight months of reclusion temporal, as minimum, to 20 years of reclusion temporal, as maximum, and to pay a fine in the amount of PHP 15,000.00. Moreover, he is ordered to pay private complainant AAA the amounts of PHP 50,000.00 as civil indemnity, PHP 50,000.00 as moral damages, and PHP 50,000.00 as exemplary damages. All monetary awards shall earn legal interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of finality of this Decision until full payment.

Pursuant to Article 5 of the Revised Penal Code, the Court TRANSMITS the case to the Chief Executive, through the Department of Justice, for study and consideration of the mitigation of the penalty of petitioner Marvin Villanueva y Irodistan."

Ordering respondents to jointly and severally pay complainant for the foregone opportunity of pursuing studies in the United Kingdom under the British Chevening Scholarship Award, in the sum of 20,189.00 British Pounds or Peso 1,982,727.37.

Ordering respondents to jointly and severally pay complainant moral damages in the amount of P2Million, exemplary damages in the amount of P2Million and attorney's fees equivalent to 10% of the judgment award.","This Petition for Partial Review on Certiorari[1] seeks to annul the Resolutions[2] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 115794 insofar as it ordered petitioner Jose Leni Z. Solidum (Solidum) to refund respondent Smart Communications, Inc. (Smart) the additional wages and benefits he received by virtue of the 10th Alias Writ of Execution[3] issued in NLRC Case No. NCR-00-11-09564-05.","After a judicious deliberation, We find the petition meritorious.

The Court's authority in a Rule 45 Petition for Review on Certiorari is confined to addressing questions of law.[65] In this context, the present petition essentially poses the question of whether Smart may recover Solidum's wages and benefits which accrued before the NLRC's reversal of the July 3, 2006 Decision of the arbiter. This is a question of law well within the Court's purview in a Rule 45 petition.

Incidentally, the Court may nevertheless entertain the factual question of whether delay, if any, is properly attributable to Solidum or Smart. Although questions of fact are not entertained in a Rule 45 review, this admits several exceptions, such as when: (1) the findings and conclusions of the CA differ from the labor tribunals, (2) the rulings of the antecedent deciding bodies are conflicting, or (3) there is a misapprehension of facts.[66] Notably, these exceptions are all present in the instant case. The Court is thus compelled to address certain factual issues raised in this instant petition.
 
The immediately executory nature of the arbiter's decision mandates Smart to reinstate Solidum until reversal by the NLRC. Smart's non-compliance of the arbiter's order of reinstatement resulted to Solidum's unpaid wages and benefits under the 10th Alias Writ
 

An order of reinstatement issued by the labor arbiter is self-executory or immediately executory even pending appeal. In fact, this right is statutorily enshrined in the Labor Code:
In any event, the decision of the Labor Arbiter reinstating a dismissed or separated employee, insofar as the reinstatement aspect is concerned, shall immediately be executory, even pending appeal. The employee shall either be admitted back to work under the same terms and conditions prevailing prior to his dismissal or separation or, at the option of the employer, merely reinstated in the payroll. The posting of a bond by the employer shall not stay the execution for reinstatement provided herein.[67]
Aligning with this principle, both the 2005 and 2011 NLRC Rules of Procedure (2005 NLRC Rules and 2011 NLRC Rules, respectively) specify that the perfection of an appeal suspends the execution of the labor arbiter's decision, with the exception of the reinstatement aspect pending appeal.[68] Owing to the immediately executory nature of the decision, the employer is obligated to reinstate and compensate the dismissed employee throughout the appeal process until reversal by the higher court.[69]","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Partial Review on Certiorari is GRANTED. The November 23, 2012 and April 23, 2013 Resolutions of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 115794, insofar as it ordered petitioner Jose Leni Z. Solidum to refund respondent Smart Communications, Inc. the additional wages and benefits he received by virtue of the 10th Alias Writ of Execution issued by the Labor Arbiter in NLRC Case No. NCR-00-11-09564-05, are REVERSED and SET ASIDE."
"G.R. No. 249540, February 28, 2024","COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, PETITIONER, VS. ARTURO E. VILLANUEVA, JR., RESPONDENT.","The facts as summarized by the CTA EB are as follows:
[Respondent] is engaged in the business of providing hauling services under the name Producers Connection Logistics, with registered address at No. 324 Younger St., Balut, Tondo, Manila.

. . . .

For taxable year 2006, [respondent] filed with the Bureau of Internal Revenue his Annual Income Tax Return (ITR) and Quarterly VAT Returns, among other tax returns, on the dates prescribed by law.

On July 11, 2008, [respondent] received Letter Notice No. 029-WE-­I-00-00041 dated June 20, 2008. Meanwhile, on May 14, 2009, he received a follow-up letter (Tax Reconciliation System). Thereafter, on June 15, 2009, [respondent] received Letter of Authority No. 2001-00012853 dated June 8, 2009 and the First Request for Presentation of Records.

[Respondent] then received the 1st Call-up dated May 23, 2011 from Revenue District Office (RDO) No. 29 for the collection of deficiency income tax and VAT in the amounts of [PHP] 23,349,944.59 and [PHP] 7,374,006.51, respectively.

On June 21, 2011, [respondent] received a Final Notice Before Seizure (FNBS) dated June 6, 2011, issued by RDO No. 29 of Revenue Region No. 6-Manila.

On July 13, 2011, [respondent] sent a reply-letter to RDO No. 29, seeking clarification with regard to the 1st Call-up and FNBS, and requesting a clarification and re-investigation of his case.

On September 6, 2011, [respondent] received a letter dated August 31, 2011 from the Regional Director of Revenue Region No. 6-Manila.

[Respondent] received a Collection Notice dated October 29, 2012 from the BIR. [On November 14, 2012, respondent] then requested for the revocation of the Collection Notice . . . but the same was denied in a letter issued by [the CIR] through the Chief of Collection Division of Revenue Region No. 6-Manila.

On December 13, 2013, [respondent] sent a letter dated December 11, 2013 to the Regional Director of Revenue Region No. 6-Manila, requesting reconsideration of the denial of the request for revocation of the collection notices issued by [the CIR]. Then, on October 31, 2014, [respondent] received a letter dated October 14, 2014, issued by the Regional Director of Revenue Region No. 6-Manila, denying [respondent]'s request for reconsideration and reinvestigation.[7]

Accordingly, on November 25, 2014, [respondent] filed [a] Petition for Review [with the CTA Division; and the CIR filed an Answer thereto].","Before the Court is the Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] (Petition) under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court filed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR), assailing the Decision[2] dated March 13, 2019 and Resolution[3] dated September 16, 2019 of the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc (CTA EB) in CTA EB No. 1771, which affirmed the Decision[4] dated August 18, 2017 and Resolution[5] dated January 10, 2018 of the Court of Tax Appeals First Division (CTA Division) in CTA Case No. 8935. The CTA Division cancelled the assessments for deficiency income tax and value-added tax (VAT) for taxable year 2006 issued against respondent Arturo E. Villanueva Jr. (respondent) on the ground of prescription.[6]","The Petition lacks merit.

Preliminarily, the Court emphasizes the settled rule that findings of fact and conclusions of law by the CTA are accorded with the highest respect and will not lightly be set aside.[23] As a matter of principle, the Court will not set aside the ruling of the CTA, which is, by the very nature of its function, dedicated exclusively to the study and consideration of tax problems and has necessarily developed an expertise on the subject unless there has been an abuse or improvident exercise of authority.[24] Findings and conclusions of the CTA can only be disturbed on appeal if they are not supported by substantial evidence or there is a showing of gross error or abuse on the part of the CTA—these are not present in this case. 
 
The CIR failed to prove that the assessment notices were properly served and received by respondent
 

Section 228 of the 1997 NIRC, as implemented by Revenue Regulation No. 12-99,[25] outlines the due process requirements for the issuance of deficiency tax assessments. In the case of Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Avon Products Manufacturing, Inc.[26] (Avon), the Court summarized these requirements as follows:
. . . Under Section 228, it is explicitly required that the taxpayer be informed in writing of the law and of the facts on which the assessment is made; otherwise, the assessment shall be void. Section 3.1.2 of Revenue Regulations No. 12-99 requires the Preliminary Assessment Notice to show in detail the facts and law, rules and regulations, or jurisprudence on which the proposed assessment is based. Further, Section 3.1.4 requires that the Final Letter of Demand must state the facts and law on which it is based; otherwise, the Final Letter of Demand and Final Assessment Notices themselves shall be void. Finally, Section 3.1.6 specifically requires that the decision of the Commissioner or of his or her duly authorized representative on a disputed assessment shall state the facts and law, rules and regulations, or jurisprudence on which the decision is based. Failure to do so would invalidate the Final Decision on Disputed Assessment.

. . . .

On the other hand, the taxpayer is explicitly given the opportunity to explain or present his or her side throughout the process, from tax investigation through tax assessment. Under Section 3.1.1 of Revenue Regulations No. 12-99, the taxpayer is given 15 days from receipt of the Notice for Informal Conference to respond; otherwise, he or she will be considered in default and the case will be referred to the Assessment Division for appropriate review and issuance of deficiency tax assessment, if warranted. Again, under Section 228 of the Tax Code and Section 3.1.2 of Revenue Regulations No. 12-99, the taxpayer is required to respond within 15 days from receipt of the Preliminary Assessment Notice; otherwise, he or she will be considered in default and the Final Letter of Demand and Final Assessment Notices will be issued. After receipt of the Final Letter of Demand and Final Assessment Notices, the taxpayer is given 30 days to file a protest, and subsequently, to appeal his or her protest to the Court of Tax Appeals.[27]
Essentially, to comply with the requirements of due process, the CIR is required to inform the taxpayer of the factual and legal bases of the deficiency tax assessment and provide him or her the opportunity to protest such assessment, present his or her case, and adduce supporting evidence.[28] Avon further underscored that the CIR must give due consideration to the taxpayer's evidence and explanation; otherwise, the right to be heard is rendered meaningless.[29] Certainly, as ""between the power of the State to tax and an individual's right to due process, the scale favors the right of the taxpayer to due process.""[30]","ACCORDINGLY, the instant Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED. The Decision dated March 13, 2019 and Resolution dated September 16, 2019 of the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc in CTA EB No. 1771 are hereby AFFIRMED."
" G.R. No. 262579, February 28, 2024","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. ROSSANO SAMSON Y TIONGCO, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","The case stemmed from an Information charging accused-appellant with Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code for killing Abegail Tobias y Dela Torre (Abegail). The accusatory portion of the Information reads:

That on or about the 8th day of October, 2014, in the municipality of Norzagaray, province of Bulacan, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, armed with crowbar (bareta) and with intent to kill one Abegail Tobias y dela Torre, eleven (11) years old minor, with abuse of superior strength and treachery, did then and there willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously attack, assault and hit said Abegail Tobias y dela Torre with the said crowbar on the different parts of her body which directly caused the instantaneous death of the said Abegail Tobias y Dela Torre.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[4]

Upon arraignment, accused-appellant entered a plea of ""Not Guilty"" to the charge.[5]

Trial on the merits ensued.","Before the Court is an appeal[1] assailing the Decision[2] dated April 19, 2022, of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR HC No. 14958 that affirmed the Decision[3] dated July 20, 2020, of Branch 18, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Malolos City, Bulacan in Criminal Case No. 4160-M-2014. The RTC found Rossano Samson y Tiongco (accused-appellant) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code.","The appeal is unmeritorious.

It is settled that the factual findings of the trial court are entitled to great weight and respect, especially when they are affirmed by the appellate court.[29] Findings of the trial court that are factual in nature and that involve the credibility of witnesses are accorded respect, if not finality, by the appellate court when no glaring errors, gross misapprehension of facts, and speculative, arbitrary, and unsupported conclusions can be gleaned from such findings.[30] The trial court is in the best position to assess the credibility of the witnesses and their testimonies because of ""its unique opportunity to observe the witnesses first hand and to note their demeanor, conduct, and attitude under grueling examination.""[31]

Upon a judicious perusal of the records of the case, there is no compelling reason to depart from the ruling of the RTC and the CA that accused-appellant is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder.

The Court affirms the ruling of both the RTC and the CA that the totality of the circumstantial evidence is sufficient to hold accused-appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged. The Court likewise holds that the RTC, as affirmed by the CA, correctly admitted the extrajudicial confession of accused-appellant.

The RTC convicted accused-appellant of Murder qualified by treachery and abuse of superior strength.[32] Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code states:

ART. 248. Murder. — Any person who, not falling within the provisions of Article 246 shall kill another, shall be guilty of murder and shall be punished by reclusion perpetua, to death, if committed with any of the following attendant circumstances:

With treachery, taking advantage of superior strength, with the aid of armed men, or employing means to weaken the defense or of means or persons to insure or afford impunity[.]
The elements of Murder are the following: ""(a) that a person was killed; (b) that the accused killed him [/her]; (c) that the killing was attended by any of the qualifying circumstances mentioned in Article 248; and (d) that the killing is not parricide or infanticide.""[33]

Here, all the elements of Murder are present. Accused-appellant killed Abegail. The killing was neither parricide nor infanticide. However, it must be clarified that the killing of Abegail was qualified by treachery only; the circumstance of abuse of superior strength is deemed absorbed by treachery.","ACCORDINGLY, the appeal is DISMISSED. The Decision dated April 19, 2022, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR HC No. 14958 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. Accused-appellant Rossano Samson y Tiongco is hereby found GUILTY of Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code in Criminal Case No. 4160-M-2014 filed with Branch 18, Regional Trial Court, Malolos City, Bulacan. He is sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua and is likewise ORDERED to pay the heirs of Abegail Tobias y Dela Torre the following:

PHP 75,000.00 as civil indemnity;
PHP 75,000.00 as moral damages;
PHP 75,000.00 as exemplary damages; and
PHP 50,570.00 as actual damages.
All monetary awards shall earn legal interest rate of 6% per annum from the date of the finality of this Decision until full payment."

IGNACIA-MAYANTOC-SAN CLEMENTE-SAN JOSE, TARLAC","In a 1st Endorsement[4] dated May 26, 2015, Martin was required to comment on Judge Gandia-Asuncion's letter. Martin submitted her Comment[5] on September 16, 2015.

Martin vehemently denied the allegations against her. She claimed that she reported for work on August 11, 2014 and in the morning of May 6, 2014. She averred that in the latter instance, she realized that she forgot to write her name and merely rectified the same by writing it that same afternoon. She nevertheless admitted that she refused to comply with the order for her to go to Judge Gandia-Asuncion's chambers and explain, justifying that she was not feeling well and was the assigned stenographer for that day. Martin maintained that OIC Clerk of Court Rodelio A. Pedroche (OIC-COC Pedroche) was motivated by ill feelings towards her. She also accused her officemates who attested against her and Judge Gandia-Asuncion of not performing their duties properly. She averred that they are the ones who are always absent but reflected otherwise in their DTRs. Martin asserted that Judge Gandia-Asuncion had been ""so unfair"" to her in the past forcing her to work even though she is sick, that is why she refused to receive nor read the Memorandum issued to her by the former.[6]

The Court, in its Resolution[7] dated April 18, 2018, referred the administrative matter to Judge Rixon M. Garong (Judge Garong) of Branch 37, Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Lingayen, Pangasinan, for investigation, report, and recommendation as Acting Presiding Judge of the RTC, Branch 68, Camiling, Tarlac pursuant to Administrative Order No. 217-2017 dated December 27, 2017.

Judge Garong required Judge Gandia-Asuncion and the other complainants who joined her namely: OIC-COC Pedroche, Genelyn C. Gragasin, Maranatha Gracel A. Lardizabal, Von A. Villanueva, Dioso S. Tomas, and Maynard L. Millado, all of whom are employees of the MCTC of Sta. Ignacia-Mayantoc-San Clemente-San Jose, Tarlac, to respond to Martin's Comment dated August 20, 2015; and for Martin to file her sworn Rejoinder thereto.

Judge Gandia-Asuncion submitted her Comment with annexes on July 31, 2018, whereas the rest of the complainants filed their sworn separate comment on August 1, 2018. During the date set for conference, Martin manifested that she will no longer file a rejoinder.[8]

On October 2, 2018, Judge Garong submitted his Investigation Report,[9] recommending on the basis of his investigation:

From the foregoing, the undersigned found LORNA M. MARTIN to be liable for tampering records, specifically the logbook on 6 May 2014 entries. Similarly, she can be held liable for the same infractions committed on 16 May 2014 and 11 August 2014.

Also, based on the foregoing facts as supported by sworn statements by MCTC personnel, respondent LORNA M. MARTIN exhibited insubordination to lawful orders not only from [Judge Gandia-Asuncion] but also from her OIC-Clerk of Court.

Hence, it is recommended that the appropriate disciplinary sanctions commensurate to her infractions be imposed on [Martin].","In a letter[1] dated September 3, 2014 addressed to the Office of Court Administrator (OCA), signed by Judge Stela Marie Q. Gandia-Asuncion (Judge Gandia-Asuncion) of the Municipal Circuit Trial Court (MCTC) of Sta. Ignacia-Mayantoc-San Clemente-San Jose, Tarlac, that Ms. Lorna M. Martin (Martin), Court Stenographer I of the same court, was reported for her incorrect declarations in her Daily Time Record (DTR) for August and May 2014.
Specifically, Judge Gandia-Asuncion informed the OCA that she signed Martin's DTR for the said months ""with reservation"" as the latter entered in the Registry Book of Attendance (logbook) that on August 11, 2014, she arrived at 1:00 p.m. and left at 5:00 p.m., when she did not report for work that afternoon.[2] The incident happened again on May 6, 2014, wherein Martin logged that she arrived in the office at 8:00 a.m. and left at 12:00 p.m. when in fact, she was not present that morning. Judge Gandia-Asuncion also noted that Martin made incorrect entries in the logbook on May 16, 2014.[3]","The Court in A.M. No. 18-01-05-SC, amended the Rules of Court and included personnel of the lower courts within the coverage of Rule 140.[27] The penalty to be imposed upon Martin shall then be in accordance with such Rule. Section 14, of Rule 140 classifies gross misconduct and serious dishonesty, as well as gross insubordination as serious charges.

Under Section 17 of the same Rule, a respondent found guilty of a serious charge shall be imposed with any of the following sanctions:

Section 17. Sanctions. -

(1) If the respondent is guilty of a serious charge, any of the following sanctions shall be imposed:

(a) Dismissal from service, forfeiture of all or part of the benefits as the Supreme Court may determine, and disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office, including government-owned or -controlled corporations. Provided, however, that the forfeiture of benefits shall in no case include accrued leave credits;

(b) Suspension from office without salary and other benefits for more than six (6) months but not exceeding one year; or

(c) A fine of more than [PHP] 100,000.00 but not exceeding [PHP] 200,000.00.

Considering that Martin is guilty of multiple offenses, Section 21 of Rule 140 applies as to the imposable penalty. Section 21 reads:

SECTION 21. Penalty for Multiple Offenses. - If the respondent is found liable for more than one (1) offense arising from separate acts or omissions in a single administrative proceeding, the Court shall impose separate penalties for each offense. Should the aggregate of the imposed penalties exceed five (5) years of suspension or [PHP] 1,000,000.00 in fines, the respondent may, in the discretion of the Supreme Court, be meted with the penalty of dismissal from service, forfeiture of all or part of the benefits as may be determined, and disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office, including government-owned or controlled corporations. Provided, however, that the forfeiture of benefits shall in no case include accrued leave credits.

On the other hand, is a single act/omission constitutes more than one (1) offense, the respondent shall still be found liable for all such offenses, but shall nonetheless, only be meted with the appropriate penalty for the most serious offense.","ACCORDINGLY, the Court finds Lorna M. Martin, Court Stenographer I of the Municipal Circuit Trial Court, Sta. Ignacia-Mayantoc-San Clemente-San Jose, Tarlac, GUILTY of Serious Dishonesty and Gross Misconduct, for which she is ordered to pay a FINE of PHP 200,000.00. Martin is also found GUILTY of Gross Insubordination and is meted out the penalty of FINE of PHP 110,000.00."
"A.M. No. MTJ-23-019 [Formerly JIB FPI No. 21-043-MTJ], February 27, 2024","RICHARD CARINGAL, COMPLAINANT, VS. JUDGE CORNELIO A. SY, PRESIDING JUDGE, MUNICIPAL TRIAL COURT, SAN JOSE, OCCIDENTAL MINDORO, RESPONDENT.","Caringal essentially alleged that Claveria and Culla borrowed PHP 500,000.00 from him secured by a promissory note and a Kasunduan dated December 15, 2015. When Claveria and Culla failed to pay, he brought the matter to the office of the barangay. There, the parties signed an agreement denominated as ""PAGHAHARAP"" where Claveria and Culla agreed to pay their PHP 500,000.00 loan.[2]

Despite this agreement, Claveria and Culla continued to default in their payment. Consequently, he (Caringal) obtained from the barangay a certificate to file action against them. On July 7, 2017, he filed with the Municipal Trial Court, San Jose, Occidental Mindoro (single sala) (MTC) a petition for a writ of execution to enforce the terms of the aforesaid PAGHARARAP. On November 13, 2018, Judge Sy, as presiding judge, dismissed the complaint in view of the supposed doubtful veracity of the barangay documents attached to the petition.[3]

On appeal, the RTC reversed and held that pursuant to Section 417 of Republic Act No. 7160, otherwise known as the Local Government Code, an amicable settlement or arbitration award may be executed at the level of the Lupon within six months from the date of the settlement. Thereafter, the settlement may be enforced by filing the appropriate action before the court. The RTC thus remanded the case to the MTC, San Jose, for the issuance of a writ of execution against Claveria and Culla; and to enforce the parties' agreement or PAGHAHARAP.[4]

On May 17, 2021, Caringal went back to the MTC for the implementation of the foregoing decision. Per his Order dated May 20, 2021, Judge Sy granted his motion for issuance of writ of execution, and in his subsequent Order set the case for ""Pre-Execution Conference"" on October 18, 2021.[5]

Caringal did not attend the pre-execution conference despite notice. He claims though that during the conference, Judge Sy influenced his (Caringal's) counsel, Atty. Luminate, to accept the PHP 500,000.00 cash offered by Claveria and Culla as full satisfaction of his claim despite Atty. Luminate's alleged lack of special authority to enter into any kind of compromise agreement on his behalf. While PHP 500,000.00 was the full amount of the principal loan, interest was also due him from Claveria and Culla.[6]

Lastly, upon learning that his (Caringal) counsel, Atty. Luminate, accepted the PHP 500,000.00, he filed a protest-letter before the MTC. He denied giving Atty. Luminate authority to accept the PHP 500,000.00, sans payment of interest, on his behalf.[7]","Complainant Richard Caringal (Caringal) charged respondent Judge Cornelio A. Sy (Judge Sy) with gross misconduct, gross incompetence, and gross ignorance of the law for allegedly allowing Atty. Darwin Luminate (Atty. Luminate) to enter into a compromise agreement with Marcelo Claveria (Claveria) and Delia Culla (Culla) in Civil Case No. 1671 without a special power of attorney from Caringal himself as the winning party; and declaring Civil Case No. 1671 closed and terminated notwithstanding that the final and executory judgment issued by Branch 46, Regional Trial Court, San Jose, Occidental Mindoro (RTC) has not been fully satisfied yet.[1]","
Judge Sy is not guilty of gross ignorance of the law, gross misconduct, or gross incompetence
 

To begin with, the present administrative action is premised on the erroneous notion that there was a reduction of the judgment amount during the execution stage and that it was pursued by Judge Sy, albeit complainant's lawyer then present did not supposedly bear the client's authority to compromise the case.

To clarify, the subject agreement denominated as PAGHAHARAP states:
i. The parties would continue to respect their agreement executed before Notary Public Atty. Alfredo A. Castillo;

ii. Defendant Claveria would pay the debt in the amount of Five Hundred Thousand [PHP] 500,000.00) Pesos in favor of [the] [Caringal][30]

....
Further, the writ of execution provides:[31]","ACCORDINGLY, the Administrative Complaint against respondent Judge Cornelio A. Sy, Presiding Judge, Municipal Trial Court, San Jose, Occidental Mindoro is DISMISSED for utter lack of merit.

The complainant Richard Caringal is ORDERED to SHOW CAUSE within 10 days from notice why he should not be cited for indirect contempt of court for filing a premature complaint against Judge Cornelio A. Sy intended to harass or vex the latter.

The Clerk of Court and Sheriff of the Office of Clerk of Court, Municipal Trial Court, San Jose, Occidental Mindoro are ORDERED to SHOW cause within 10 days why no disciplinary action should be taken against them for inefficiency and neglect of duty."

AND MAKAR AGRICULTURAL CORP., RESPONDENTS.","In an undated letter, Vincente L. Olarte (Vincente), as attorney-in-fact of the Olarte Hermanos y Cia Estate (Olartes), wrote to the regional director of the DPWH, Region XII, Cotabato City to claim Road Right of Way (RROW) compensation for Lots A, G, and F, Plan Lot SC-6834, Subdivision Plan SWO-12-000103, located along the National Highway, General Santos City (subject property).[4] The subject property involved a 3.5-kilometer road with an area of approximately 186,856 square meters that was taken by the government for public use as it was traversed by the Cotabato-Kiamba-General Santos-Koronadal National Highway.[5]

The DPWH then received the June 4, 2007 Order from Branch 14, Regional Trial Court of Cotabato City (RTC), in relation to a case docketed as Spec Proc. No. 2004-074 entitled ""In Re: Matter of Insolvencia Voluntaria de [Olarte] Hermanos [y] Cia, Heirs of the late Alberto P. Olarte, etc."" The said Order enjoined the DPWH to pay the RROW claim of the Olartes. On November 13, 2007, an Order was again issued instructing DPWH to release the partial payment in the amount of PHP 44,891,140.65 within 10 days from notice. As such, the DPWH began paying the Olartes in installment.[6]

On May 7, 2008, Espina and Makar filed a Complaint (With [prayer for a] temporary restraining order)[7] docketed as Civil Case No. 7788 against the heirs of Alberto Pelayo Olarte and Jose Pelayo Olarte (heirs of Olarte), the DPWH, and the Register of Deeds of General Santos City. They alleged that Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. 12 registered in the name of Olarte Hermanos, under which the heirs of Olarte were laying claim to the RROW compensation, had been mortgaged to El Hogar Filipino (El Hogar). Due to nonpayment of the loan, the subject property was sold at public auction and OCT No. 12 was cancelled. Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 886 was issued in favor of El Hogar who then sold the subject property to the Espina sisters, namely, Salud, Soledad, Mercedes, and Asuncion. Thus, TCT No. 886 was cancelled and TCT No. (T-635)(T-19)T-2 was issued in favor of the Espina sisters. In 1949, Asuncion sold her share to Soledad and TCT No. (T0636)(T-20)T-3 was issued in the name of Salud, Mercedes, and Asuncion. In 1958, the subject property was sold to Makar and TCT No. (T-5288)(T-433)T-118 was issued in its favor. Makar then sold a 195.18-hectare portion of the subject property to Espina which, in turn, subdivided it into 600 lots, 300 of which had already been sold. Of the 300 lots sold, 67 were already in the names of the vendees.[8]

The RTC granted a 72-hour Temporary Restraining Order (TRO). Subsequently, in its June 24, 2008 Order, it issued a Writ of Preliminary Injunction (WPI) in Civil Case No. 7788.[9]

The DPWH filed a ""Manifestation and Motion (in lieu of Answer),""[10] alleging, among others, that it had already made payments to the heirs of Olarte upon the latter's representation that they owned the subject property. Considering the dispute on the ownership of the subject property, the DPWH manifested that it would support any proceeding that would settle the issue and that it would cease from paying the heirs of Olarte until it was resolved.[11]

Meanwhile, Espina and Makar filed a Manifestation to render Civil Case No. 7788 moot and academic in view of the July 22, 2009 Decision of the CA in CA-G.R. SP No. 02303-MIN[12] entitled ""Espina & Madarang, Co. & Makar Agricultural Corp., represented by Rodrigo A. Adtoon v. Hon. Cedar P. Indar Al Haj, Judge"" They insisted that in the said Decision, the CA affirmed their ownership over the subject property.[13] CA-G.R. SP No. 02303-MIN was an offshoot of Spec Pro. No. 2004-074.[14]

On October 5, 2009, the RTC issued an Order[15] in Civil Case No. 7788 ruling that the injunction case was already moot and academic in view of the Decision of the CA in CA-G.R. SP No. 02303-MIN.[16] It also upheld Espina and Makar's ownership over the subject property and ordered the DPWH to pay their RROW compensation claim.[17]","This Court resolves a Motion for Partial Reconsideration[1] filed by respondents Espina and Madarang, Co. (Espina) and Makar Agricultural Corp. (Makar) assailing this Court's Decision,[2] which partly granted the Petition of the Republic of the Philippines (Republic), through the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH). The dispositive portion of the Decision states:
WHEREFORE, premises considered[,] the petition is PARTLY GRANTED. The Decision dated January 25, 2016 and the Resolution dated July 22, 2016 of the CA in CA-G.R. SP No. 06472-MIN is AFFIRMED WITH MODIFICATION to read as follows:

The Orders dated December 16, 2013, February 24, 2014, and July 21, 2014 of the Regional Trial Court of General Santos City, Branch 36 in Civil Case No. 7788 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE in so far as they directed the Sheriff to reimplement the Writ of Execution dated June 2, 2010 and to levy, garnish, seize, and deliver to the respondents Espina & Madarang, Co. and Makar Agricultural Corp., or to the court whatever funds money, or assets of the Department of Public Works and Highways susceptible to execution found anywhere in the Philippines to satisfy the judgment in favor of the respondents.

Respondents Espina & Madarang, Co. and Makar Agricultural Corp. are hereby enjoined to file a money claim before the Commission on Audit for the satisfaction and enforcement of the money judgment validating their claim to the Road Right of Way compensation.","
This Court may exercise its discretion to entertain the Motion for Partial Reconsideration of respondents
The doctrine of immutability of judgments holds that ""a decision that has acquired finality becomes immutable and unalterable, and may no longer be modified in any respect, even if the modification is meant to correct erroneous conclusions of fact and law.""[80] Nevertheless, this doctrine is not an iron-clad rule as it is subject to several recognized exceptions such as:

(1) the correction of clerical errors; (2) the so-called nunc pro tunc entries which cause no prejudice to any party; (3) void judgments; and (4) whenever circumstances transpire after the finality of the decision rendering its execution unjust and inequitable.[81] (Citation omitted)

In the past, this Court has also recognized other exceptions to the rule on immutability of judgments and ordered the recall of the entries in the interest of substantial justice and where there are special and compelling reasons that warrant such actions.[82]

Considering that petitioner no longer filed a motion for reconsideration to challenge the March 23, 2022 Decision, this Court shall now focus on the arguments raised in the Motion for Partial Reconsideration. After taking a second hard look, this Court finds that the instruction in the March 23, 2022 Decision that the claim for just compensation be brought to the COA is worth revisiting.

Here, respondents argue that despite the finality of this Court's Decision on March 23, 2022, their Motion for Partial Reconsideration should still be entertained due to a circumstance made known after it was promulgated. Invoking the fourth exception enumerated above, they maintain that the execution of the ruling of this Court's Decision, particularly the instruction to file a money claim before the COA for the satisfaction and enforcement of the money judgment validating their claim to the RROW compensation, has become unjust and inequitable, if not impossible, due to the issuance of COA Resolution No. 2021-008.[83]

Admittedly, the issuance of COA Resolution No. 2021-008 transpired prior to the promulgation of this Court's Decision. Nonetheless, this Court is not precluded from exercising its discretion to entertain the Motion for Partial Reconsideration of respondents. In exercising discretion, this Court is guided by the tenets of justice and fair play, bearing in mind the circumstances obtaining in each case.[84] Here, this Court finds it appropriate to exercise this prerogative and resolve the compelling arguments raised in the Motion for Partial Reconsideration in light of the crucial consequence of the issuance of COA Resolution No. 2021-008 to the directive of this Court in the March 23, 2022 Decision, and in the interest of substantial justice. After all, the purpose of the rules of procedure is to facilitate the attainment of justice. When the strict and rigid application of the rules of procedure frustrates rather than promotes the efficient delivery of justice, this Court may suspend the rules in favor of substantial justice.[85]","ACCORDINGLY, the Motion for Partial Reconsideration is GRANTED. The March 23, 2022 Decision of this Court is MODIFIED. Respondents Espina & Madarang, Co. and Makar Agricultural Corp. are entitled to receive just compensation equivalent to PHP 218,839,455.00. This Court imposes interest at the rate of 12% per annum from June 30, 2007 until June 30, 2013, and 6% per annum from July 1, 2013 until full payment.

The portion of the assailed Decision enjoining respondents Espina & Madarang, Co. and Makar Agricultural Corp. to file a money claim before the Commission on Audit for the satisfaction and enforcement of the money judgment validating their claim to the Road Right of Way compensation is DELETED."

PHILIPPINE HEALTH INSURANCE CORPORATION EMPLOYEES' ASSOCIATION, THROUGH ITS LEADERS, LORNA BERNAS, SUSAN G. IDUYAN, ET AL., PETITIONERS-INTERVENORS.","This case stemmed from four separate Notices of Disallowance (NDs) issued on various dates by the Supervising Auditor of the COA assigned to PHIC amounting to a total of PHP 43,810,985.26:

a)
ND No. 10-001-717(08) dated March 12, 2010 was issued disallowing the Withholding Tax Portion of the Productivity Incentive Bonus for calendar year (CY) 2008 in the amount of PHP 12,758,649.75 received by PHIC on March 29, 2010;
 	 
b)
ND No. 10-002-725(09) dated March 29, 2010 was issued disallowing the Collective Negotiation Agreement (CNA) Incentive included in the computation of the Productivity Incentive Bonus for CY 2008 in the amount of PHP 10,460,000.00 received by PHIC on March 29, 2010;
 	 
c)
ND No. 10-003-725(09) dated April 13, 2010 was issued disallowing the Presidential Citation Gratuity for CY 2009 in the amount of PHP 18,347,758.02 received by PHIC on April 14, 2010;
 	 
d)
ND No. 10-004-725(09) dated April 21, 2010 was issued disallowing the Shuttle Service Assistance for CY 2009 in the amount of PHP 2,244,577.49 received by PHIC on April 21, 2010.
On August 24, 2010, PHIC filed its Consolidated Memorandum of Appeal before the Commission on Audit-Corporate Government Sector (COA-CGS), assailing the issuance of the NDs.","This is a Petition for Certiorari[1] (Petition) under Rule 65, in relation to Rule 64 of the Rules of Court filed by the petitioner Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PHIC), which seeks to set aside the December 28, 2016 Decision No. 2016-474[2] and the January 31, 2020 Resolution No. 2020-405[3] of the Commission on Audit (COA) for having been issued with grave abuse of discretion. The assailed Decision denied the Petition for Review filed by the PHIC for having been filed out of time and for lack of merit. The assailed Resolution denied the PHIC's Motion for Reconsideration.","The Court upholds the COA Decision.

An appeal made before the COA Proper must be filed within the six-month period
The Revised Rules of Procedures of the Commission on Audit (RRPC) prescribes the period for filing appeals before the COA Proper. The six-month period finds basis in Rule VII, Section 3 of the RRPC as follows:

SEC. 3. Period of Appeal. — The appeal shall be taken within the time remaining of the six (6) months period under Section 4, Rule V, taking into account the suspension of the running thereof under Section 5 of the same Rule in case of appeals from the Director's decision, or under Sections 9 and 10 of Rule VI in case of decision of the [Adjudication and Settlement Board].

Parenthetically, Rule V, Section 4 of the RRPC provides as follows:

SEC. 4. When Appeal Taken. — An Appeal must be filed within six (6) months after receipt of the decision appealed from.

Here, the PHIC received ND Nos. 0-001-717(08) and 10-002-725(09) on March 29, 2010 and ND No. 10-003-725(09) on April 14, 2010. However, the Petition for Review was only filed before the COA Proper on July 13, 2012. Taking into consideration the tolling of the period to appeal when PHIC filed its Memorandum of Appeal with the COA Director until PHIC's receipt of its resolution, the Petition for Review was only filed 199 days after receiving ND Nos. 0-001-717(08) and 10-002-725(09), and 183 days after receiving ND No. 10-003-725(09).[21] Hence, PHIC's appeal was perfected beyond the six-month or the 180-day reglementary period.

It is hornbook doctrine that the right to appeal is a mere statutory right and anyone who seeks to invoke such privilege must apply with the applicable rules; otherwise, the right to appeal is forfeited.[22] In this case, the right to appeal must comply with the RRPC, which was crafted to ensure the orderly disposition of cases.[23]

To give the impression that the Petition for Review before the COA Proper was timely filed, PHIC maintains that under the Civil Code, the word ""month"" is understood to mean ""thirty days,"" and that unless a specific reference is made to a month, it shall be understood to mean that the same consists of 30 days.[24] Applying this logic, PHIC proposed the following computation of the period:

March 29 – 30, 2010	=	2 days
 	 	 
April 1 – 30, 2010	=	30 days
 	 	 
May 1–30, 2010	=	30 days
 	 	 
June 1 –30, 2010	=	30 days
 	 	 
July 1 – 30, 2010	=	30 days
 	 	 
August 1 – 24, 2010	=	24 days
 	 	 
May 23 – 30, 2012	=	8 days
 	 	 
June 1 – 26, 2012	=	26 days
 	 	 
Total	=	180 days
On June 26, 2012, PHIC filed its Motion for Extension to file its Petition for Review before the COA Proper. On July 13, 2012, PHIC finally filed its Petition for Review.

A simple reading of the proposed computation of PHIC would reveal that it disregarded the fact that the months of March, May, and July all have 31 days. The proposed computation also conveniently gives the impression that PHIC was able to comply within the required period, filing its Motion for Extension on the alleged last day of the reglementary period.

The Court is not persuaded.

The Court has already settled in PHIC v. COA, et al.[25] that the six-month period provided in Rule V, Section 4 of the RRPC must be understood to mean 180 days as follows:","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DISMISSED. The Commission on Audit's Decision No. 2016-474 dated December 28, 2016 is AFFIRMED."
"A.M. No. 23-07-26-SC, February 27, 2024",RE: POST OF ATTY. ERWIN ERFE ON SOCIAL MEDIA ACCUSING THE COURT OF JUDICIAL TYRANNY,"On July 11, 2023, the Court in its Resolution in A.M. No. 25-05-05-SC, Re: Request of the Public Attorney's Office to Delete Section 22, Canon III of the Proposed Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability, denied the said request of the Public Attorney's Office (PAO). The Court likewise directed Atty. Persida V. Rueda-Acosta (Atty. Acosta), Chief of the PAO, to show cause why she should not be cited in indirect contempt and disciplined as a member of the Bar for her public statements on social media and other actions in relation to the said request of the PAO.

When the Court's ruling in its July 11, 2023 Resolution was disseminated to the public through a press release, Atty. Erfe posted on his Facebook account the following statement: ""The Supreme Court's threat to cite in contempt the PAO Chief for defending the PAO cannot be called any other name other than judicial tyranny"" (Facebook post).[3]

For this reason, the Court issued the Resolution, dated July 25, 2023. The Court stated that ""Atty. Erfe's public characterization of the Court's action as 'judicial tyranny' degrades the administration of justice, as contemplated in Section 3(d), Rule 71 of the Rules of Court,"" which tended ""to bring the authority of the Court into disrepute.""[4] Atty. Erfe was likewise ordered to show cause why he should not be disciplinary dealt with as a member of the Bar for violating the CPRA.[5]

In his Verified Compliance,[6] Atty. Erfe submitted his Most Humble Apology,[7] dated August 24, 2023,[8] expressing his ""most heartfelt and sincere apology to [the Justices of the Court], to the Supreme Court, and the entire judiciary.""

Atty. Erfe explained that the Facebook post was ""spurred by the uncontrollable and sudden emotional feeling that [he] felt"" upon learning about the denial of the PAO's request to delete Section 22, Canon III and the show cause order against Atty. Acosta. He averred that he later realized that he should not have been overcome by emotions and thus deleted the Facebook post. He added that he saw the rationale behind Section 22, Canon III and expressed his intention to fully comply with the said provision.[9]","This resolves the Verified Compliance (Re: Show Cause Order dated 25 July 2023)[1] filed by respondent Atty. Erwin P. Erfe (Atty. Erfe) in response to the Court's Resolution,[2] dated July 25, 2023, in which the Court directed him to show cause why he should not be cited in indirect contempt and why he should not be disciplined as a member of the Bar for violation of Sections 2, 14, and 19 of Canon II of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability (CPRA).","Atty. Erfe is guilty of indirect contempt

The Court holds that Atty. Erfe's Facebook post amounts to ""improper conduct tending, directly or indirectly, to impede, obstruct, or degrade the administration of justice,"" punishable as indirect contempt under Section 3(d), Rule 71 of the Rules of Court.

Time and again, the Court, when confronted with actions and statements that tend to promote distrust and undermine public confidence in the Judiciary, has not hesitated to wield its inherent power to cite persons in contempt.[10] In so doing, the Court preserves the Judiciary's honor and dignity and the trust and confidence of the public which is critical for the stability of democratic government.[11]

Here, Atty. Erfe, without providing any basis in fact or law, accused the Court of tyranny for ordering Atty. Acosta to show cause why she should not be cited in contempt. Atty. Erfe's statement, which suggested that the Court, in exercising its contempt power, acted in an oppressive manner, impaired public confidence in the Court and, consequently, degraded the administration of justice. It is an unwarranted attack on the dignity of the Court constitutive of indirect contempt.

At this juncture, the Court underscores the importance of maintaining the people's trust in the Judiciary, particularly, the Court. If the public loses their confidence in the Court, which is the last bulwark to which the Filipino people may repair to obtain relief for their grievances or protection of their rights when these are trampled upon, and believe that they cannot expect justice from the Court, they might be driven to take the law into their hands, and disorder and perhaps chaos might be the result.[12]

This is not to say that the courts are sacrosanct and thus should be shielded from any form of criticism. In People v. Godoy,[13] the Court explained that fair criticism of a court's rulings or decisions is not improper. So long as critics confine their criticisms to facts and base them on the decisions of the court, they commit no contempt no matter how severe the criticism may be; but when they pass beyond that line and charge that judicial conduct was influenced by improper, corrupt, or selfish motives, or that such conduct was affected by political prejudice or interest, the tendency is to create distrust and destroy the confidence of the people in their courts. Clearly, Atty. Erfe's derogatory remark against the Court falls outside the ambit of fair criticism.

What makes the present case more reprehensible is that the contumacious statement came from a member of the Bar, who as an officer of the court, has the sworn and moral duty to help build and not destroy unnecessarily that high esteem and regard towards the courts that is so essential to the proper administration of justice. Thus, Atty. Erfe must likewise be disciplined as a member of the Bar.

Atty. Erfe violated Sections 2, 14, and 19, Canon II of CPRA","FOR THESE REASONS, the Court finds respondent Atty. Erwin P. Erfe GUILTY of indirect contempt of court and orders him to PAY a FINE of PHP 10,000.00. The Court further finds him GUILTY of grossly undignified conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice and violation of the sub judice rule and he is REPRIMANDED with a STERN WARNING that a repetition of the same or similar offense will be dealt with more severely.

Let copies of this Resolution be furnished to the Office of the Bar Confidant, to be appended to the personal record of respondent Atty. Erwin P. Erfe, to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines, and to the Office of the Court Administrator for dissemination to all courts throughout the country for their guidance and information.

"A.M. No. P-14-3223 (Formerly OCA IPI No. 10-3344-P), February 27, 2024","LEONILA V. BELTRAN, COMPLAINANT, VS. RAINERIA S. PABICA, STENOGRAPHER I/ACTING CLERK OF COURT, MUNICIPAL TRIAL COURT, PALOMPON, LEYTE, RESPONDENT.","In her Letter-Complaint[1] dated December 23, 2009, Leonila V. Beltran (Beltran) essentially averred:

She was one of the defendants in Civil Case No. 461 entitled ""Matilde Marilao-Canson, et. al. v. Leonila V. Beltran, et. al."" for Recovery of Possession and Ownership with Damages and Attorney's Fees filed before the Municipal Trial Court of Palompon, Leyte (MTC) where respondent Raineria S. Pabica (Pabica) was then its Court Stenographer I and Acting Clerk of Court at the same time.[2]

Initially, Atty. Raymund B. Samson (Atty. Samson) of the Public Attorney's Office represented Beltran and the other co-defendants in the case. But after the hearing held on April 20, 2005, Pabica approached Beltran to convince the latter to hire another lawyer, Atty. Camilo P. Esmero (Atty. Esmero), in lieu of Atty. Samson. Beltran had reservations regarding Atty. Esmero because said counsel had previously represented the same plaintiffs in another case and had even notarized certain documents which formed part of the plaintiff's evidence-in-chief in Civil Case No. 461. Beltran nonetheless, followed Pabica's instructions relying on the latter's supposed knowledge on the qualifications of legal practitioners in Palompon, Leyte.[3]

On September 20, 2007, Pabica informed her by phone that the decision in Civil Case No. 461 was forthcoming, and that could help them in obtaining a favorable judgment in exchange for PHP 15,000.00. Beltran agreed. Thus, in the evening of that day, Pabica came to Beltran's house to collect the payment. Upon Beltran's request, Pabica signed a receipt. As it was, however, the MTC ruled against Beltran and the other defendants.[4]

Beltran contacted Pabica regarding the adverse decision. Pabrica appeased Beltran by telling the latter that the MTC decision would be appealed to the Regional Trial Court of Palompon, Leyte (RTC). In its Order dated August 28, 2008, Branch 17 of the RTC dismissed the appeal citing several basic and material flaws in the Memorandum submitted by the defendant-appellants, through their counsel, Atty. Esmero, including the failure to assign errors allegedly committed by the MTC in the assailed decision, as well as the erroneous prayer for the dismissal of the appeal for lack of basis.[5]

After informing Pabica of the aforesaid order of dismissal, the latter adviced Beltran to file a motion for reconsideration with the Regional Trial Court and, thereafter, an appeal before the Court of Appeals should the said motion be denied. Pabica then told Beltran that the filing fee for the motion for reconsideration would cost around PHP 4,000.00. Beltran turned over this amount to Pabica on September 8, 2008 around 9:00 p.m. at the Palompon Public Cemetery. The turnover was witnessed by several persons. Upon verification, Beltran learned that the motion for reconsideration was denied for being filed 42 days late. According to Beltran, Pabica deliberately caused the belated filing of the said motion.[6]","Under Rule 140, Section 14(a) and (n), in relation to Section 17 of the Rules of Court, as amended, gross insubordination and gross misconduct are classified as serious charges warranting (a) dismissal from service; (b) forfeiture of retirement and other benefits, except accrued leave credits, if any; and (c) disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office, including government-owned or controlled corporations, viz.:","The Court resolves to adopt and approve the findings of fact, conclusions of law and recommendation of the Judicial Integrity Board in its Report dated January 25, 2023.

First. Pabica violated Canon IV, Section 5 of the Code of Conduct for Court Personnel[17] (CCCP) when she meddled with Civil Case No. 461 by convincing complainant to engage the legal services of Atty. Esmero as her handling lawyer, in lieu of Atty. Samson. Thus, the acts of Pabica are even more pernicious, given that Atty. Esmero's acceptance of complainant's case appears to violate the prohibition against conflict of interest under Canon III, Sections 13, 14, 17, and 18.

Canon IV, Section 5 of the CCCP explicitly ordains that court personnel shall not recommend private attorneys to litigants.[18] Notably, Pabica did not merely recommend, but even convinced complainant and her co-defendants to change their attorney and hire Atty. Esmero to replace Atty. Samson. Worse, Pabica, as the Acting Clerk of Court of the Municipal Trial Court, could not have been unaware that Atty. Esmero had previously represented complainant's opponents in another case before the same court and even notarized documents forming part of the evidence-in-chief of the plaintiffs in Civil Case No. 461.

In Office of the Court Administrator v. Buzon,[19] the Court found that a court stenographer committed grave misconduct for assisting a party-litigant to find legal representation, viz.:

Likewise, respondent claims that she was merely assisting Tablante in finding a new defense lawyer does not legitimize her actions. Canon IV, Section 5 of the Code of Conduct for Court Personnel prohibits court personnel from recommending private attorneys to litigants, prospective litigants, or anyone dealing with the judiciary. While court employees are not totally prohibited from rendering aid to others, they should see to it that the assistance, albeit involving acts unrelated to their official functions, does not in any way compromise the public's trust in the justice system. Clearly, by assisting Tablante in finding legal representation, respondent violated ethical rules.

Respondent's action is all the more malevolent considering that Tablante has a pending case with the court where she is a stenographer. Their interaction gave the appearance that the court is partial to Tablante's cause. As an employee of the judiciary, respondent should have maintained a neutral attitude in dealing with party-litigants. If it were true that Tablante insisted on asking for her assistance, respondent should have severed any form of communication with her. However, instead of distancing herself, respondent even agreed to meet Tablante after the latter represented that she already gathered funds to pay for a lawyer. Certainly, respondent's deliberate acts are inconsistent with her claim that she was merely a victim of frame-up.

Thus, respondent should be held accountable for grave misconduct, dishonesty, and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of service.[20]

Pabica, too, is accountable for grave misconduct, dishonesty, and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service.","ACCORDINGLY, Raineria S. Pabica is found GUILTY of Gross Misconduct and Gross Insubordination in violation of Canon I, Sections 1 and 2, and Canon IV, Section 5. In view of her compulsory retirement on December 30, 2019, the Court ORDERS the FORFEITURE of her retirement benefits, except accrued leave credits, if any, with disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office, including government-owned or -controlled corporations.

Further, the Court DIRECTS the Integrated Bar of the Philippines to conduct an investigation and submit its report and recommendation on the acts of Atty. Camilo P. Esmero which may constitute a violation of the prohibition against Conflict of Interest under Canon III, Sections 13, 14, 17, and 18.

Let a copy of this Decision be served on Raineria S. Pabica at her last known address at Sitio San Martin, Brgy. San Isidro, Palompon, Leyte."
"A.M. No. 23-05-05-SC, February 27, 2024","REQUEST OF THE PUBLIC ATTORNEY'S OFFICE TO DELETE SECTION 22, CANON III OF THE PROPOSED CODE OF PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY","On April 28, 2023, the Court received a Letter,[4] dated April 20, 2023, from the PAO addressed to Chief Justice Alexander G. Gesmundo (Chief Justice Gesmundo). In the said Letter, the PAO petitioned that:

1)
SECTION 22, CANON III of the Proposed Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability, to wit:
 	 	 


""SECTION 22. Public Attorney's Office; conflict of interest. – The Public Attorney's Office is the primary legal aid service of the government.

A conflict of interest of any of the lawyers of the Public Attorney's Office incident to services rendered for the Office shall be imputed only to the said lawyer and the lawyer's direct supervisor. Such conflict of interest shall not disqualify the rest of the lawyers from the Public Attorney's Office from representing the affected client, upon full disclosure to the latter and written informed consent.""
 	 

be REMOVED, so that public attorneys will be governed by the remaining provisions on conflict of interest applicable to all members of the legal profession, without discrimination and qualification;
 	 
2)
Section 22, Canon III of the New Code of Professional Responsibility be TEMPORARILY NOT IMPLEMENTED pending a second look and review by all members of the Supreme Court En Banc on its constitutionality, and determination of whether it is detrimental to the integrity of the justice system, public service and public trust, and safety of the life and limb of public attorneys.[5] (Emphasis and underscoring in the original)
On June 7, 2023, the Court received another Letter,[6] dated June 6, 2023, from the PAO reiterating concerns regarding Section 22, Canon III of the CPRA and seeking a dialogue with Chief Justice Gesmundo.

In the Resolution,[7] dated July 11, 2023, the Court resolved to deny the PAO's request that Section 22, Canon III of the CPRA be deleted. It ruled that the CPRA was promulgated by the Court in the exercise not only of its power to regulate the practice of law, but also of its constitutional prerogative to promulgate rules concerning legal assistance to the underprivileged. Noting that the PAO's principal mandate is to provide free legal assistance to indigents, the Court rejected the PAO's contention that it should be treated like a regular law firm. The Court also found no merit in the PAO's claim that Section 22, Canon III singles out the poor and that it is ""antithetical to adequate legal assistance"" and poses a ""serious threat"" to the right to speedy disposition of cases, emphasizing that the policy behind the new rule is to promote the poor's access to legal assistance by limiting the imputation of conflict of interest to public attorneys who had actual participation in the case. The Court found the alleged inconsistencies pointed out by the PAO between the assailed rule, on the one hand, and Republic Act No. 9406[8] and the 2021 PAO Revised Operations Manual, on the other hand, to be more apparent than real.[9]

In the same Resolution, the Court noted and expressed concern over Atty. Acosta's disturbing actions in relation to her opposition to the proposed new conflict of interest rule for the PAO, which eventually became Section 22, Canon III of the CPRA. In several public posts on her page on the social media platform Facebook, Atty. Acosta appealed to the public to stand against Section 22, Canon III of the CPRA and maligned the Court for adopting the said rule. Atty. Acosta also launched a public campaign against Section 22, Canon III of the CPRA by posting on the same social media platform several videos of the PAO lawyers, employees, and clients declaring their disagreement with the rule. Moreover, Atty. Acosta publicized the contents of the PAO's letters to Chief Justice Gesmundo against Section 22, Canon III of the CPRA through different forms of media.[10]","Before the Court are the Very Respectful Verified Compliance (Re: Show-Cause Order dated 11 July 2023)[1] (First Compliance) and Very Respectful Verified Compliance (Re: Show-Cause Order dated 25 July 2023)[2] (Second Compliance) filed by Atty.

Acosta to show cause why she should not be cited in indirect contempt and be disciplined as a member of the Bar for violation of Sections 2, 14, and 42, Canon II and Section 2, Canon III of A.M. No. 22-09-01-SC, the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability (CPRA).","
Atty. Acosta is guilty of indirect contempt
Contempt is defined as a disobedience to the court by acting in opposition to its authority, justice and dignity. It signifies not only a willful disregard or disobedience of the court's orders, but such conduct which tends to bring the authority of the court and the administration of law into disrepute or in some manner to impede the due administration of justice. It is a conduct that tends to bring the authority and administration of the law into disrespect or to interfere with or prejudice parties-litigant or their witnesses during litigation.[24]

In Tallado v. Racoma,[25] the Court discussed the nature of and rationale behind the courts' authority to penalize contempt of court:

The power to punish for contempt is inherent in all courts, and need not be specifically granted by statute. It lies at the core of the administration of a judicial system. Indeed, there ought to be no question that courts have the power by virtue of their very creation to impose silence, respect, and decorum in their presence, submission to their lawful mandates, and to preserve themselves and their officers from the approach and insults of pollution. The power to punish for contempt essentially exists for the preservation of order in judicial proceedings and for the enforcement of judgments, orders, and mandates of the courts, and, consequently, for the due administration of justice. The reason behind the power to punish for contempt is that respect of the courts guarantees the stability of their institution; without such guarantee, the institution of the courts would be resting on a very shaky foundation.[26] (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)

In Fortune Life Insurance Co., Inc. v. Commission on Audit,[27] the Court underscored that for the Court and all other courts of the land to be able to administer and dispense evenhanded justice, they should be free from harassment and disrespect.

There are two (2) types of contempt of court: (i) direct contempt; and (ii) indirect contempt. As defined by jurisprudence, direct contempt is characterized by misbehavior committed in the presence of or so near a court or judge as to interrupt the proceedings before the same, as distinguished from indirect contempt, which is committed out of or not in the presence of the court, that tends to belittle, degrade, obstruct, or embarrass the court and justice.","ACCORDINGLY, the Court finds respondent Atty. Persida V. Rueda-Acosta GUILTY of indirect contempt of court and orders her to pay a FINE of PHP 30,000.00.

Moreover, Atty. Persida V. Rueda-Acosta is found GUILTY of Grossly Undignified Conduct Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice. Accordingly, she is ordered to pay a FINE in the amount of PHP 150,000.00, with A STERN WARNING that a repetition of the same or similar offenses shall be dealt with more severely.

"G.R. No. 256116, February 27, 2024","MAIN T. MOHAMMAD, PETITIONER, VS. OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY, DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, MENARDO I. GUEVARRA, IN HIS CAPACITY AS SECRETARY OF JUSTICE, RESPONDENT.","Mohammad was identified as a member of the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) responsible for the kidnapping and murder of certain individuals.[6]

In the Resolution[7] dated April 8, 2019, the charges of murder were dismissed as the prosecution was unable to produce a witness who could identify Mohammad as the same person charged in the Information.

On the basis of this acquittal, Mohammad filed a claim for compensation under Republic Act No. 7309 with the Board in Zamboanga City since he was mistakenly identified as a member of the ASG and as a result was ""unjustly arrested, accused, and detained two years for a crime he did not commit.""[8] According to Mohammad, he is entitled to compensation under Section 3(a) of Republic Act No. 7309, which provides that ""any person who was unjustly accused, convicted, and imprisoned but subsequently released by virtue of a judgment of acquittal"" may file claims for compensation before the Board.[9]

Mohammad argued that the term ""and"" as used in Section 3(a) of Republic Act No. 7309 should not be strictly construed as implying conjunction or union of the words connected by it because doing so would result in grave injustice to Mohammad and other persons similarly situated and would run counter to the very purpose of the law. As laws must be construed in a manner that avoids absurdity or unreasonableness, Mohammad argued that the conjunctive ""and"" should not be taken in its ordinary acceptation but should be construed like the disjunctive ""or"" if the literal interpretation of the law would pervert or obscure the legislative intent. Mohammad surmised that the legislative intent behind Republic Act No. 7309 appears to cover persons unjustly prosecuted even though they have been acquitted by the trial court, as the unjust prosecution ruined their honor and besmirched their reputations. In Mohammad's case, he was arrested, tagged, accused, and identified as a member of a notorious terrorist organization.[10]","This is a Petition for Certiorari[1] filed pursuant to Rule 65 of the Rules of Court (Rules) by petitioner Main T. Mohammad (Mohammad), assailing the Decision,[2] dated February 1, 2021, issued by the Secretary of Justice (the Secretary). The Secretary affirmed the Decision,[3] dated November 18, 2020, issued by the Department of Justice Board of Claims (the Board), which denied Mohammad's application for compensation under Republic Act No. 7309[4] for lack of prior conviction.","The Petition should be dismissed. The Secretary of Justice did not commit grave abuse of discretion in affirming the Decision of the Board. 
 
Mohammad failed to prove that the Secretary of Justice committed grave abuse of discretion in issuing the assailed Decision
 

Grave abuse of discretion under Rule 65 has a specific meaning. It is the arbitrary or despotic exercise of power due to passion, prejudice or personal hostility; or the whimsical, arbitrary, or capricious exercise of power that amounts to an evasion or refusal to perform a positive duty enjoined by law or to act at all in contemplation of law. For an act to be struck down as having been done with grave abuse of discretion, the abuse of the discretion must be patent and gross.[27]

The Decision of the Secretary finds basis under the clear import of Section 3(a) of Republic Act No. 7309:

Section 3(a) of Republic Act No. 7309 provides as follows:
Sec. 3. Who May File Claims. – The following may file claims for compensation before the Board: 
 
a)
any person who was unjustly accused, convicted, and imprisoned but subsequently released by virtue of a judgment of acquittal[.]
The provision is clear. For a successful claim for compensation under Section 3(a) of Republic Act No. 7309, the following elements must concur: (a) there must be a person who was unjustly accused; (b) the person must have been convicted of the offense; (c) the person was imprisoned by virtue of the conviction; and (d) the person was subsequently released by virtue of a judgment of acquittal. In this case, all elements are absent. Hence, Mohammad's claim for compensation under Republic Act No. 7309 was properly denied.

For the first element, the Court finds that the same is lacking as no other reason was given by Mohammad other than that he was detained for two years only to be acquitted by the Regional Trial Court (RTC) later.[28] The Court reiterates that the finding of probable guilt by our prosecutors, absent any bad faith, cannot be considered as an unjust accusation, even if the same ultimately leads to an acquittal of the accused. The case of Basbacio v. Drilon,[29] is clear in this regard:
Indeed, [s]ec. 3(a) does not refer solely to an unjust conviction as a result of which the accused is unjustly imprisoned, but, in addition, to an unjust accusation. The accused must have been ""unjustly accused,[""] in consequence of which he is unjustly convicted and then imprisoned. It is important to note this because if from its inception the prosecution of the accused has been wrongful, his conviction by the court is, in all probability, also wrongful. Conversely, if the prosecution is not malicious[,] any conviction even though based on less than the required quantum of proof in criminal cases may be erroneous but not necessarily unjust.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DENIED.

Relative to the first issue, it must be noted for the information of Bayron et al. that the Court's relatively recent Decision in Abella v. Commission on Audit Proper[32] finds application to the instant Petition. In that case, the Sangguniang Panlungsod of Butuan City enacted in 2004 an ordinance appropriating extraordinary and miscellaneous expenses for the utilization of certain Butuan City officials, which were actually disapproved by DBM for the 2000 fiscal year due to the prohibition under Republic Act No. 7160 (otherwise known as the Local Government Code of 1991) against appropriations similar to discretionary funds of the local chief executive but separate therefrom in the LGU's budget. The COA's Regional Office No. XIII in that case also disallowed the disbursements made under said prohibited appropriation on the ground of lack of legal basis, which was eventually sustained by the COA's Proper. In ruling that the COA's disallowance of the illegal disbursements under the Butuan City ordinance was proper, the Court said thus:
Undeniably, [extraordinary and miscellaneous expenses or EME] appropriations and discretionary funds have the same purpose, i.e., to have an available source of funds for certain expenses in relation to the discharge of official functions which are not covered by the regular budget allocation. It is noteworthy that SP Ordinance No. 2557-2004, which was the basis of the disallowed disbursements, already had an appropriation for the Office of the City Mayor's discretionary expenses. Thus, separate amounts appropriated in the local budget ordinance are patent circumventions of the limitation under Section 325(h) of the LGC. To stress, the provision expressly prohibits the appropriation of a separate amount for discretionary purposes other than the two percent (2%) allocated for the local chief executive's discretionary fund.

Furthermore, the COA Regional Director correctly observed that the SP designated its Mayor, Vice Mayor, and SP/Government Department Heads as having equal ranks to those officials entitled to EME under the General Appropriations Acts (GAA[s]) of 2004 to 2009, to wit: Department Secretary, Department Assistant Secretary, and ""Assistant Bureau/Director."" [sic] The SP designations were, however, made without authorization from the DBM, which was a patent contravention of the GAAs. The pertinent GAA provisions are clear that only those officials named in the GAA, the officers of equivalent rank as the DBM authorized, and the offices under them are entitled to claim EME in the amounts provided in the GAAs.","ACCORDINGLY, the instant Motion for Reconsideration is PARTIALLY GRANTED.

SANDIGANBAYAN AND PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENTS.","On June 5, 2014, the Office of the Ombudsman filed with the Sandiganbayan an Information,[3] dated June 5, 2014, for Plunder against Enrile, Jessica Lucila Reyes (Reyes), Janet Lim Napoles (Napoles), Ronald John Lim (Lim), and John Raymund de Asis (de Asis).[4]
The Information reads:

In 2004 to 2010 or thereabout, in the Philippines, and within this Honorable Court's jurisdiction, above-named accused JUAN PONCE ENRILE, then a Philippine Senator, JESSICA LUCILA G. REYES, then Chief of Staff of Senator Enrile's Office, both public officers, committing the offense in relation to their respective offices, conspiring with one another and with JANET LIM NAPOLES, RONALD JOHN LIM, and JOHN RAYMUND DE ASIS, did then and there willfully, unlawfully, and criminally amass, accumulate, and/or acquire ill-gotten wealth amounting to at least ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO MILLION EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED PESOS ([PHP]172,834,500.00) through a combination or series of overt criminal acts, as follows:

(a) by repeatedly receiving from NAPOLES and/or her representatives LIM, DE ASIS, and others, kickbacks or commissions under the following circumstances: before, during and/or after the project identification, NAPOLES gave, and ENRILE and/or REYES received, a percentage of the cost of a project to be funded from ENRILE'S Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF), in consideration of ENRILE'S endorsement, directly or through REYES, to the appropriate government agencies, of NAPOLES' non-government organizations which became the recipients and/or target implementors of ENRILE'S PDAF projects, which duly­funded projects turned out to be ghosts or fictitious, thus enabling NAPOLES to misappropriate the PDAF proceeds for her personal gain;

(b) by taking undue advantage, on several occasions, of their official positions, authority, relationships, connections, and influence to unjustly enrich themselves at the expense and to the damage and prejudice, of the Filipino people and the Republic of the Philippines.","This is a Petition for Prohibition (Petition),[1] dated March 1, 2022, filed by the petitioner Juan Ponce Enrile (Enrile) praying that the Court enjoin the Sandiganbayan from acting in Criminal Case No. SB-14-CRM-0238, titled People of the Philippines v. Juan Ponce Enrile, et al. (Main Case) and to dismiss the said criminal case.[2]","The Petition is procedurally defective
 
a.
The Petition was filed out of time
 

Enrile does not deny that he filed the Petition only in March 2022 despite the fact that he received the assailed July 12, 2021 Resolution (which denied his Motion for Reconsideration) on July 22, 2021. Enrile insists that because the assailed Resolutions are interlocutory orders, they are not subject to the 60-day reglementary period for the filing of a petition for prohibition.

There is no dispute that the Sandiganbayan's denial of Enrile's prayer for: (a) the inclusion of the Bill of Particulars Decision in the Pre-Trial Order; and (b) the Sandiganbayan to limit the prosecution's evidence to pertain only to matters stated in the Bill of Particulars, is interlocutory. An order is interlocutory when it resolves only an incidental matter ""which does not touch on the merits of the case or put an end to the proceedings.""[61] An interlocutory order leaves something more to be done by the trial court as to the merits of the case. Generally, interlocutory orders are not subject to a reglementary period.[62]

However, in San Juan, Jr. v. Cruz,[63] the Court ruled that where there are multiple motions for reconsideration raising the same arguments to assail an interlocutory order, the 60-day period is reckoned from the notice of the denial of the first motion for reconsideration and not that of the last motion for reconsideration. While there is no rule prohibiting the filing of a second (or even subsequent motions for reconsideration) raising the same arguments raised in a first motion for reconsideration, the latter motions can be denied on the ground that they merely reiterate the grounds and arguments already passed upon by the court. Moreover, the reckoning point for the 60-day period is the notice of the denial of the first motion for reconsideration, ""otherwise indefinite delays will ensue.""[64]

The Court applied the ruling in San Juan in Communication and Information Systems Corp. v. Mark Sensing Australia Pty. Ltd.[65] In this case, the Court ruled that the sixty (60)-day reglementary period for the filing of a Rule 65 certiorari petition is reckoned from the notice of the denial of the first motion for reconsideration and not of the third motion for reconsideration. The Court said:
Applying the rule in San Juan, MSAPL's challenge to the order dated April 13, 2009 was clearly time-barred. The 60-day reglementary period for challenging the RTC's issuance of the amended writ of attachment should be counted from April 27, 2009, 39 the date when MSAPL received a copy of the April 13, 2009 Order denying MSAPL's motion for reconsideration of the December 22, 2008 Order which granted CISC's motion to amend the writ of preliminary attachment. The CA, however, considered MSAPL's act of filing a motion to determine the sufficiency of the bond as a definitive indication that private respondents have not ""abandoned their right to impugn the evidence submitted in the application for the second writ."" This is erroneous for two reasons: first, MSAPL's motion never impugned the propriety and factual bases of the RTC's issuance of the amended writ of attachment; and second, even if it did, the motion would be considered as a second motion for reconsideration, which could not have stayed the reglementary period within which to file a petition for certiorari assailing an interlocutory order. We emphasize that the provisions on reglementary periods are strictly applied, indispensable is they are to the prevention of needless delays, and are necessary to the orderly and speedy discharge of judicial business. The timeliness of filing a petition for certiorari is mandatory and jurisdictional, and should not be trifled with.[66] (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)
Further, in Philippine National Bank v. Intestate Estate of De Guzman,[67] the Court cited San Juan to deny a petition for certiorari under Rule 65, which was filed using the denial of the last of a series of motions to dismiss raising the same arguments as the reckoning point. The Court explained:
The Court finds insufferable petitioner's repeated filing of Motions to Dismiss raising the same ground. In the three previous Motions to Dismiss and in an omnibus motion for reconsideration, petitioner argued that the present case was barred by prior judgment and that there was forum­-shopping. Correspondingly, the issues had been repetitively passed upon and resolved by the court a quo.

The motions were apparently filed for no other reason than to gain time and gamble on a possible change of opinion of the court or the judge sitting on the case. The Motions to Dismiss were filed in a span of five years, the first one having been filed on June 1, 2000 and the last — the subject motion — on February 15, 2005, three years after petitioner filed its answer. In fact, since the first Motion to Dismiss, three judges had already sat on the case and resolved the motions. By filing these motions, petitioner had disrupted the court's deliberation on the merits of the case. This strategy cannot be tolerated as it will entail inevitable delay in the disposition of the case.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Prohibition, dated March 1, 2022 is DISMISSED."
"G.R. No. 264659, February 27, 2024","PHILIPPINE HEALTH INSURANCE CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON AUDIT, AS REPRESENTED BY ITS FORMER CHAIRPERSON, MICHAEL G. AGUINALDO, RESPONDENT.","In 2012, the PhilHealth Board of Directors approved Resolution No. 1584, series of 2012. This resolution eliminated PhilHealth's welfare support assistance and concurrently introduced a scheme of benefits for public health workers, including hazard pay, subsistence pay, and laundry allowance. The Board's basis for granting these benefits rested upon Republic Act No. 7305. In consonance with this directive, PhilHealth RO-NCR and Rizal disbursed hazard pay, subsistence allowance, and laundry allowance to its staff during calendar year 2014. The aggregate sum of these allowances amounted to PHP 43,200,215.08.[9]

In 2015, COA OIC-Supervising Auditor Marissa V. Fajardo-Parinas issued Notice of Disallowance No. NCR 2015-002 COB (14), thereby proscribing the disbursement of hazard pay, subsistence allowance, and laundry allowance to the personnel of PhilHealth RO-NCR and Rizal. The Auditor identified the officials of PhilHealth who sanctioned and endorsed these allowances, as well as the beneficiaries the ·eof, and declared them solidarily liable for the disallowed amount.[10]

PhilHealth filed an appeal to the COA Cluster 6-Corporate Governance Sector, refuting the subject Notice of Disallowance, but this was given short shrift in CGS-6 Decision No. 2015-017.[11]

Consequently, PhilHealth elevated the case to the COA proper via a petition for review. In the assailed Decision, the COA affirmed the subject Notice of Disallowance, noting that PhilHealth personnel are not public health workers entitled to hazard pay, subsistence allowance, and laund1y allowance.[12] The COA declared the approving and certifying officers solidarily liable for the disallowed amount. However, the COA spared the passive recipients of liability for being in good faith.[13]

Upon reconsideration, the COA, through the assailed Resolution, partly granted PhilHealth's motion for reconsideration and lifted the disallowance on the payment of laundry allowance. Nevertheless, the COA still affirmed the disallowance of the payment of hazard pay and subsistence allowance amounting to PHP 42,531,290.08.[14]

Undeterred, Philhealth seeks succor before this Court via the instant Petition, imputing grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the COA for its failure to consider PhilHealth personnel as public health workers entitled to receive hazard pay, subsistence pay, and laundry allowance under Republic Act No. 7305, as amended by Republic Act No. 11223[15] or the Universal Health Care Act.[16]

The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) avouched that Phil Health failed to sufficiently establish its personnel's entitlement to hazard pay and subsistence allowance based on the standards set by Sections 21 and 22 of Republic Act No. 7305.[17]","Employees of the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth), despite being categorized as public health workers, are not automatically eligible for allowances under Republic Act No. 7305 or the Magna Carta of Public Health Workers[1] if they do not meet the requirements of the said law and its implementing rules and regulations.[2]

This Petition for Certiorari (with Application for Issuance of Temporary Restraining Order and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction)[3] seeks to nullify and set aside Decision No.2019-294[4] (assailed Decision) and Decision No. 2022-229[5] (assailed Resolution) of the Commission on Audit (COA). In the assailed Decision, the COA affirmed Notice of Disallowance No. NCR 2015-002 COB (14)[6] on the payment of hazard pay, subsistence pay, and laundry allowance to the officers and employees of the PhilHealth Regional Office for the National Capital Region and Rizal (RO-NCR & Rizal) for calendar year 2014 amounting to PHP 43,200,215.08. However, the COA declared that the passive recipients were in good faith; thus, they need not refund the amounts they received.[7] In the assailed Resolution, the COA partly granted PhilHealth's motion for reconsideration and lifted the disallowance on the payment of laundry allowance. However, the disallowance on the payment of hazard pay and subsistence allowance amounting to PHP 42,531,290.08 was affirmed.[8]","The Petition lacks merit.

A petition under Rule 64, in relation to Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, questioning the COA's rulings would prosper only when it is shown that the COA committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, thus:
A Rule 65 petition is a unique and special rule because it commands limited review of the question raised. As an extraordinary remedy, its purpose is simply to keep the public respondent within the bounds of its jurisdiction or to relieve the petitioner from the public respondent's arbitrary acts. In this review, the Court is confined solely to questions of jurisdiction whenever a tribunal, board or officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial function acts without jurisdiction or in excess of jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction....

The limitation of the Court's power of review over COA rulings merely complements its nature as an independent constitutional body that is tasked to safeguard the proper use of the government and, ultimately, the people's property by vesting it with power to (i) determine whether the government entities comply with the law and the rules in disbursing public funds; and (ii) disallow legal disbursements of these funds.[18] (Emphasis supplied)
The elucidation of the Court in the case of Puentevella v. Commission on Audit[19] is worth reiterating:
It is primal that factual findings of administrative bodies charged with their specific field of expertise. are afforded great weight by the courts, and in the absence of substantial showing that such findings were made from an erroneous estimation of the evidence presented, they are deemed conclusive and binding upon this Court. In the interest of stability of the governmental structure, they should not be disturbed.[20]
Viewed through this lens, the Court once more upholds its general policy of affirming a decision rendered by an administrative agency, especially one that is constitutionally created, not only on the basis of the doctrine of separation of powers but also for their presumed expertise in the laws that they are entrusted to enforce.[21]

The Court now proceeds to discuss the merits.

The COA correctly disallowed the hazard
pay and subsistence allowance. The COA's
lifting of the disallowance on the payment of
laundry allowance has become final.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Certiorari is DISMISSED. The August 8, 2019 Decision and January 24, 2022 COA Decision Nos.2019-294 and 2022-229 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATIONS, as follows:

1. The approving officers namely: Atty. Alexander A. Padilla, Recto M. Panti, Ronald M. Vergara, Cheryl W. Peña, and Dennis S. Mas, are held solidarily liable to RETURN the net disallowed amount, which excludes the amounts excused to be returned by the recipients.

On December 4, 2009, TMA Group of Companies Pty. Ltd. (TMA Australia) and TMA Group Philippines, Inc. (TMA Philippines) (TMA et al.) and PCSO entered into a Contractual Joint Venture Agreement (CJVA) for the establishment of the first thermal coating plant in the Philippines. The thermal coating plant would be for the production of PCSO lotto tickets. PCSO would have no investment in the project except for its commitment to buy its lotto tickets exclusively from the said thermal coating plant.[2]

By Resolution[3] dated August 20, 2010, the PCSO Board of Directors suspended the implementation of the CJVA pending review thereof by the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel (OGCC).

TMA et al., thereafter, demanded that the CJVA be implemented, but to no avail. As a result, on April 8, 2011, TMA et al. filed with the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Makati City a Complaint for Specific Performance and Mandatory and Prohibitory Injunction, with Prayer for a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) and/or Preliminary Injunction, docketed as Civil Case No. 11-310.

Relatedly, Section 3 of the same Canon 6 ordains judges to take reasonable steps to maintain and enhance their knowledge, skills, and personal qualities necessary for the proper performance of judicial duties.

In Department of Justice v. Mislang,[36] the Court emphasized that where the law is straightforward and the facts so evident, failure to know it or to act as if one does not know it constitutes gross ignorance of the law, viz.:

Where the law is straightforward and the facts so evident, failure to know it or to act as if one does not know it constitutes gross ignorance of the law. A judge is presumed to have acted with regularity and good faith in the performance of judicial functions. But a blatant disregard of the clear and unmistakable provisions of a statute, as well as Supreme Court circulars enjoining their strict compliance, upends this presumption and subjects the magistrate to corresponding administrative sanctions.

For liability to attach for ignorance of the law, the assailed order, decision or actuation of the judge in the performance of official duties must not only be found erroneous but, most importantly, it must also be established that he was moved by bad faith, dishonesty, hatred, or some other like motive. Judges are expected to exhibit more than just cursory acquaintance with statutes and procedural laws. They must know the laws and apply them properly in all good faith. Judicial competence requires no less. Thus, unfamiliarity with the rules is a sign of incompetence. Basic rules must be at the palm of his hand. When a judge displays utter lack of familiarity with the rules, he betrays the confidence of the public in the courts. Ignorance of the law is the mainspring of injustice. Judges owe it to the public to be knowledgeable, hence, they are expected to have more than just a modicum of acquaintance with the statutes and procedural rules; they must know them by heart. When the inefficiency springs from a failure to recognize such a basic and elemental rule, a law or a principle in the discharge of his functions, a judge is either too incompetent and undeserving of the position and the prestigious title he holds or he is too vicious that the oversight or omission was deliberately done in bad faith and in grave abuse of judicial authority. In both cases, the judge's dismissal will be in order.[37] (Emphasis supplied)","ACCORDINGLY, JUDGE JOSELITO C. VILLAROSA is found GUILTY of Gross Ignorance of the Law, Gross Misconduct, and Grave Abuse of Authority in violation of the New Code of Judicial Conduct. JUDGE JOSELITO C. VILLAROSA is FINED in the amount of PHP 200,000.00 payable directly to the Supreme Court within 30 days from receipt of notice. The Court further ORDERS the FORFEITURE of his retirement benefits, except accrued leave credits, if any, with disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office, including government-owned or controlled corporations.

"G.R. No. 249238, February 27, 2024","REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, PETITIONER, VS. RUBY CUEVAS NG A.K.A. RUBY NG SONO, RESPONDENT.","On December 8, 2004, respondent Ruby Cuevas Ng a.k.a. Ruby Ng Sono (Ng), a Filipino citizen, and Akihiro Sono (Sono), a Japanese national, contracted marriage in Quezon City.[6] Ensuingly, their union bore them a child named Rieka Ng Sono.[7]

Soon after their marriage, the spouses moved to Japan. Unfortunately, their relationship turned sour and they later decided to obtain a divorce. From then on, they secured a ""divorce decree by mutual agreement"" in Japan on August 31, 2007, as evinced in the Divorce Certificate[8] issued by the Embassy of Japan in the Philippines. Conformably, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) in Manila provided an Authentication Certificate[9] and a Certificate of Acceptance of Notification of Divorce.[10] Likewise, the City Civil Registry Office of Manila released a Certification[11] dated April 19, 2018, guaranteeing that the Divorce Certificate provided by the Embassy of Japan in the Philippines was filed and recorded in its office. So, too, the fact of divorce was duly recorded in the Civil Registry of Japan as exhibited by the original copy of the Family Registry of Japan[12] bearing the official stamp of the Mayor of Nakano-Ku, Tokyo, Japan, and supported by its corresponding English translation.[13]

On May 28, 2018, Ng filed a Petition for judicial recognition of foreign divorce and declaration of capacity to remarry before the RTC.

During the initial hearing, the court a quo admitted all the documentary evidence submitted by Ng for purposes of compliance with jurisdictional requirements. The RTC also allowed her to present her evidence-in-chief ex parte after making a declaration of general default.[14]

On January 3, 2019, the RTC granted the Petition on the thrust of Article 26, paragraph 2 of the Family Code of the Philippines, ratiocinating that there was a valid divorce obtained by Ng abroad, disposing as follows:

WHEREFORE, premises considered, the judgment is hereby rendered:

(a)
DECLARING that the petition for judicial recognition of the foreign decree of divorce filed by Ruby Cuevas Ng is hereby judicially recognized by this Court and therefore, as capacitated to remarry under Article 26, 2nd paragraph of the Family Code, in view of the divorce which has been obtained in Japan by her alien spouse, terminating their matrimonial relationship or dissolving their marriage solemnized on December 8, 2004; and


(b)
DIRECTING the Office of the Local Civil [Registrar] of Quezon City and the Philippine Statistics Authority to correct, change name or annotate the record of RUBY CUEVAS NG as regards her civil status to reflect that her marriage with AKIHIRO SONO has already been dissolved by way of foreign judgment and to declare the person of RUBY CUEVAS NG as single and free to remarry.",Repugned in the instant Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] are the Decision[2] of Branch 220 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City (RTC) in SP Proc. Case No. R-QZN-18-05526-SP granting the Petition for Judicial Recognition of Foreign Divorce and Declaration of Capacity to Remarry Under Article 26 of the Family Code[3] and the Order[4] denying the Motion for Reconsideration[5] thereof.,"The Petition is meritorious.

Incipiently, it bears accentuating that Philippine laws do not provide for absolute divorce; hence, our courts cannot grant it.[18] Nevertheless, jurisdiction is conferred on Philippine courts to extend the effect of a foreign divorce decree to a Filipino spouse without undergoing trial to determine the validity of the dissolution of the marriage. ""Article 26 of the Family Code—which addresses foreign marriages or mixed marriages involving a Filipino and a foreigner — allows a Filipino spouse to contract a subsequent marriage in case the divorce is validly obtained abroad by an alien spouse capacitating him or her to remarry.""[19] The provision states:

Article 26. All marriages solemnized outside the Philippines in accordance with the laws in force in the country where they were solemnized, and valid there as such, shall also be valid in this country, except those prohibited under Articles 35(1), (4), (5) and (6), 36, 37 and 38.

Where a marriage between a Filipino citizen and a foreigner is validly celebrated and a divorce is thereafter validly obtained abroad by the alien spouse capacitating him or her to remarry, the Filipino spouse shall likewise have capacity to remarry under Philippine law. (Emphasis supplied)

The case of Minoru Fujiki v. Marinay[20] elucidates the nature of Article 26, paragraph 2 of the Family Code, thus—

The second paragraph of Article 26 is only a corrective measure to address the anomaly that results from a marriage between a Filipino, whose laws do not allow divorce, and a foreign citizen, whose laws allow divorce. The anomaly consists in the Filipino spouse being tied to the marriage while the foreign spouse is free to marry under the laws of his or her country. The correction is made by extending in the Philippines the effect of the foreign divorce decree, which is already effective in the country where it was rendered.[21]

In the instant case, the Republic opposes the recognition of the foreign divorce decree on the ground that it was by mutual agreement and not obtained through an adversarial proceeding in court and hence, the provision under Article 26(2) of the Family Code finds no application.

The contention is bereft of merit.

In the landmark case of Manalo, the Court emphatically declared that Article 26(2) only requires that there be a divorce validly obtained abroad capacitating the foreigner spouse to remarry, without regard as to who initiated it. Manalo instructs that there must be a confluence of two elements in order for the second paragraph of the quoted provision to be validly applied, to wit: (1) there is a valid marriage that has been celebrated between a Filipino citizen and a foreigner; and (2) a valid divorce is obtained capacitating the parties to remarry regardless of the spouse who initiated the divorce proceedings.[22]

Significantly, the Court clarified that pursuant to the majority ruling in Manalo, Article 26(2) of the Family Code applies to mixed marriages where the divorce decree is: (1) obtained by the foreign spouse; (2) obtained jointly by the Filipino and foreign spouse; and (3) obtained solely by the Filipino spouse.[23]","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is hereby GRANTED. The January 3, 2019 Decision and the September 6, 2019 Order of Branch 220 of the Regional Trial Court, Quezon City in SP Proc. Case No. R-QZN-18-05526-SP are REVERSED. The case is REMANDED to the trial court for further proceedings and reception of evidence of the pertinent Japanese law on divorce."

GADON, RESPONDENT.","On June 24, 2021, news of the death of former President Benigno Simeon ""Noynoy"" Aquino III (President Aquino) broke out. Understandably, media outlets started to relay this information to the public as soon as possible. On the same day, Atty. Gadon appeared as a guest host in DWIZ's radio-television show Karambola. During his appearance, Atty. Trixie Cruz-Angeles, a host of Karambola, announced on air the death of the former President. The relevant portions of the episode are transcribed below:

The statements made by Atty. Gadon on air caused so much public outrage that the DWIZ management posted a public apology on the DWIZ Twitter page, which reads:

The Management of DWIZ would like to apologize to everyone and in particular, to the Aquino Family about the inappropriate statements made by our guest host in the show Karambola about the sudden death of our former President Benigno Simeon Aquino III.

Felix (Felix) and Gem A. Cabreros (Cabreros), pursuant to Section 1, Rule 139 of the Rules of Court, against Atty. Lorenzo G. Gadon (Atty. Gadon) for his statements made on air on June 24, 2021 and June 27, 2021.","The Court finds that Atty. Gadon has shown himself to be unfit to continue as an officer of the court and a part of the legal profession.

The Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability
At the outset, the Court notes that the Code of Professional Responsibility was revised to address the needs of the ever-changing landscape of the legal profession. On April 11, 2023, the Court unanimously approved the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability[9] (CPRA), which now serves as the standard for ethical conduct for all members of the legal profession. While the subject statements and the filing of this administrative case both preceded the CPRA, the same remains applicable due to the provision expressly providing for retroactive application:

GENERAL PROVISIONS

SECTION 1. Transitory provision. — The CPRA shall be applied to all pending and future cases, except to the extent that in the opinion of the Supreme Court, its retroactive application would not be feasible or would work injustice, in which case the procedure under which the cases were filed shall govern.

Canon II of the CPRA, otherwise known as the Canon on Propriety, finds applicability in this case. The relevant portions of the Canon provide:

SECTION 1. Proper Conduct. — A lawyer shall not engage in unlawful, dishonest, immoral, or deceitful conduct.

SECTION 2. Dignified Conduct. — A lawyer shall respect the law, the courts, tribunals, and other government agencies, their officials, employees, and processes, and act with courtesy, civility, fairness, and candor towards fellow members of the bar.

A lawyer shall not engage in conduct that adversely reflects on one's fitness to practice law, nor behave in a scandalous manner, whether in public or private life, to the discredit of the legal profession.

SECTION 3. Safe Environment; Avoid All Forms of Abuse or Harassment. — A lawyer shall not create or promote an unsafe or hostile environment, both in private and public settings, whether online, in workplaces, educational or training institutions, or in recreational areas.

To this end, a lawyer shall not commit any form of physical, sexual, psychological, or economic abuse or violence against another person. A lawyer is also prohibited from engaging in any gender-based harassment or discrimination.

SECTION 4. Use of Dignified, Gender-Fair, and Child- and Culturally-Sensitive Language. — A lawyer shall use only dignified, gender-fair, child- and culturally-sensitive language in all personal and professional dealings.

To this end, a lawyer shall not use language which is abusive, intemperate, offensive or otherwise improper, oral or written, and whether made through traditional or electronic means, including all forms or types of mass or social media.

SECTION 5. Observance of Fairness and Obedience. — A lawyer shall, in every personal and professional engagement, insist on the observance of the principles of fairness and obedience to the law. (Emphasis supplied)","ACCORDINGLY, the Court finds Atty. Lorenzo G. Gadon GUILTY of violating the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability, thereby warranting the imposition of the penalty of DISBARMENT from the practice of law. However, in view of his earlier disbarment in In Re: Atty. Lorenzo G. Gadon's Viral Video Against Raissa Robles, the penalty can no longer be imposed but must nonetheless be recorded in his personal file pursuant to Section 42, Canon VI of the CPRA and should be considered in the event that he applies for judicial clemency. Accordingly, and in view of his prior disbarment, a penalty of FINE in the amount of PHP 150,000.00 is imposed instead upon Atty. Lorenzo G. Gadon.

Let copies of this Decision be furnished the Office of the Bar Confidant, to be appended to Atty. Lorenzo G. Gadon's personal record as a member of the Bar; the Integrated Bar of the Philippines; the Office of the Court Administrator, for dissemination to all courts throughout the country for their information and guidance; and the Department of Justice.

This Decision is immediately executory."
"G.R. No. 226445, February 27, 2024","TUNA PROCESSORS, INC., PETITIONER, VS. FRESCOMAR CORPORATION & HAWAII INTERNATIONAL SEAFOODS, INC.,* (HISI), RESPONDENTS.","Kanemitsu Yamaoka owned the rights over the Yamaoka Patent,[6] a process of curing tuna meat using filtered smoke cooled to between 0°C and 5°C. Yamaoka Nippon Corporation (YNC), and later Pescarich Manufacturing Corporation (Pescarich), used the Yamaoka Patent in producing tuna products.[7]

In January 2003, Tuna Processors, Inc. (TPI), a foreign corporation organized and existing under the laws of California, United States (U.S.) of America, was granted the right to license or sub-license the Yamaoka Patent and its counterparts in other jurisdictions, such as U.S. Patent No. 5,484,619 and Indonesian Patent No. ID0003911. TPI also had the exclusive right to enforce the patents and collect royalties for past and present infringement and damages from third persons.[8]

On March 31, 2004, TPI entered into a license agreement with Frescomar, a company that processes and manufactures seafood products and tasteless filtered smoke in canisters for export abroad.[9] Under the License Agreement, TPI granted Frescomar the non-exclusive license to make, use, import, purchase, sell, or offer to sell products protected by the Yamaoka Patent. In turn, Frescomar has to submit shipment reports as the bases for computing the royalty fees for the use of the patent. If Frescomar believes that any of its products do not use the Yamaoka Patent, it should request for exemption from paying the royalty fees.[10]

Frescomar made an initial payment of USD 3,000.00 to TPI. However, Frescomar failed to make subsequent payments.[11] In a letter dated October 30, 2004, TPI demanded from Frescomar the shipment report and payment of royalty fees.[12] TPI's request remained unheeded.

In another letter dated September 1, 2005, TPI reiterated its previous demands. TPI added that it has come to their attention that Frescomar is producing and selling filtered smoke contained in a canister for William Kowalski (Kowalski) of HISI. TPI demanded that Frescomar submit all information for all transactions, which it believed to be outside the scope of the Yamaoka Patent, and stop using the patent to produce smoke for Kowalski.[13]

HISI likewise sells seafood products in the U.S. and Frescomar's tasteless smoke in a canister to seafood processing facilities outside the Philippines. HISI's products used the tasteless smoke technology protected under U.S. Patent No. 5,972,401 with a corresponding application under Philippine Patent Application No. 1-1998-02560, entitled ""Process for Manufacturing Tasteless Super-Purified Smoke for Treating Seafood to be Frozen and Thawed"" (Kowalski Patent).[14]

In response to TPI's demands, Frescomar initially claimed that the selling of smoke was not covered by the License Agreement.[15] Not long after, Frescomar agreed to pay USD 22,534.80 royalties computed based on Frescomar's shipment reports submitted to TPI.[16] Unfortunately, Frescomar failed to make any payments. TPI sent a final demand letter[17] dated January 13, 2006 asking Frescomar to pay USD 22,534.80 royalties for the past two years. Still, Frescomar failed to comply. Consequently, TPI terminated the License Agreement on January 17, 2006.[18]

On February 13, 2006, Frescomar and HISI filed a Complaint for Unfair Competition and Injunction with Prayer for a Preliminary Injunction against TPI. In turn, TPI filed a Counterclaim demanding the payment of royalties from March 25, 2004 until the termination of the agreement.[19] TPI's Counterclaim raised the issues of whether Frescomar and HISI are liable for breaching the License Agreement and infringing the Yamaoka Patent.[20] Frescomar and HISI filed a Supplemental Reply (To Defendant's Answer with Compulsory Counterclaim and Opposition to the Application for Preliminary Injunction)[21] and mainly argued that the Yamaoka Patent only covers tuna products and not tasteless smoke technology and that TPI has no right to stop Frescomar from producing the smoke and HISI from buying it.

On August 23, 2007, TPI and Frescomar entered into a Settlement Agreement.[22] In a Joint Motion to Dismiss[23] filed on September 25, 2007, Frescomar moved for the dismissal of its action against TPI, while TPI moved for the dismissal of its counterclaims against Frescomar, both with prejudice.[24] On October 4, 2007, the Regional Trial Court, Branch 23, General Santos City (RTC) granted the Joint Motion to Dismiss. The dispositive portion states:
WHEREFORE, finding the Joint Motion to Dismiss to be in order, Civil Case No. 7565 is hereby ordered DISMISSED with prejudice. In Civil Case No. 7566, the same is hereby ordered DISMISSED with prejudice with respect to plaintiff [Frescomar] and said case shall continue with respect to plaintiff HISI.","In this case, the Court stresses the importance of examining the patent claims in determining patent infringement. Like the technical description of a real property, patent claims define the extent of protection conferred by the patent and describe the boundary of the invention through words. Any information or invention outside of that boundary forms part of prior art, and the use of that information or invention without the patentee's consent does not constitute patent infringement.[1]

This resolves the consolidated Petitions for Review on Certiorari,[2] assailing the Court of Appeals' (CA) Decision[3] dated September 9, 2015 and Resolution[4] dated August 10, 2016 in CA-G.R. CV No. 02845-MIN.

The core issues are whether (1) Frescomar Corporation's (Frescomar) smoke production infringed Philippine Patent No. 31138, entitled ""Method for Curing Fish and Meat by Extra Low Temperature Smoking,"" or the Yamaoka Patent and (2) Hawaii International Seafoods, Inc. (HISI) is liable for tortious interference.[5]","At the outset, Rule 17, Section 2[55] of the Rules of Court, as amended by A.M. No. 19-10-20-SC, May 1, 2020, provides that a complaint may be dismissed at the plaintiff's instance. If the defendant filed a counterclaim before the plaintiff moved for the dismissal, the dismissal shall be limited to the complaint. In this case, HISI moved for the dismissal of the unfair competition case after TPI filed a Counterclaim. Thus, TPI's Counterclaim may still be resolved in the same action. As well, HISI did not question the RTC's order dismissing the unfair competition case and setting the case for hearing TPI's Counterclaim despite receipt of the order.

With regard to the substantive issues, the Court finds that Frescomar did not infringe the Yamaoka Patent when it produced the filtered smoke even after the termination of the License Agreement. The filtered smoke is not an indirect product of the Yamaoka Patent. Besides, TPI already released Frescomar from its liabilities, following the Settlement Agreement and the Joint Motion to Dismiss. Notwithstanding, HISI is liable for tortious interference by inducing Frescomar to violate the terms of the license agreement.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petitions are DENIED. The Court of Appeals' Decision dated September 9, 2015 and Resolution dated August 10, 2016 in CA-G.R. CV No. 02845-MIN are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION in that Hawaii International Seafood, Inc. is ORDERED to pay Tuna Processors, Inc. PHP 1,000,000.00 as temperate damages for tortious interference, PHP 500,000.00 as exemplary damages, and PHP 1,000,000.00 as attorney's fees, which shall all earn interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of finality of this Decision until full payment."
"G.R. No. 268216, February 26, 2024","ARIDAD PACHECO, PETITIONER, VS. JIMMY F. REYES, RESPONDENT.","The facts of the case as culled from the rollo provides:

Jimmy F. Reyes (respondent) is the lawful possessor of the lot located at No. 39 Visayas Street, Group 3, Area B, Payatas, Quezon City having acquired the same from Benedicto Roquid, by virtue of a Subrogation/Transfer of Rights and Improvement dated February 5, 2004.[4]

Petitioner and her late husband, Ramon Pacheco, Sr., (collectively, spouses Pacheco), as lessees, entered into a contract of lease with respondent at a monthly rental of PHP 6,000.00 to be paid every first day of the month starting on October 1, 2012. Starting April 1, 2017 and onwards, spouses Pacheco failed to pay the monthly rentals, and despite several demands to pay and vacate, no payment was made. Despite receipt of the demand letter dated August 5, 2017[5] and tender of another demand letter dated February 11, 2019, spouses Pacheco continued to remain in possession of the subject premises.[6]

Subsequently, respondent filed a complaint against spouses Pacheco before the Lupon ng Tagapamayapa of Barangay Payatas, Quezon City but they allegedly ignored said complaint and refused to amicably settle the dispute. Thus, a Certificate to File Action dated July 10, 2017 was issued by the Office of Lupong Tagapamayapa of Barangay Payatas, Quezon City.[7]

On February 13, 2019, respondent, through the University of the Philippines-Office of the Legal Aid's (UP-OLA) Law Intern Juan Paolo M. Artiaga (Artiaga), personally tendered to spouses Pacheco the Demand Letter dated February 11, 2019, demanding them to: (a) pay the respondent the amount of PHP 66,000.00, representing spouses Pacheco's overdue and unpaid rentals; (b) vacate the lot and its improvements, which spouses Pacheco are using as a junk shop. However, spouses Pacheco allegedly refused to receive and sign the aforementioned demand letter despite Artiaga's explanation to them. To prove that Artiaga personally tendered the said demand letter to spouses Pacheco, he executed an Affidavit of Service dated February 22, 2019. Despite such demand to pay and vacate, spouses Pacheco remained in possession of the subject property.[8]

On April 13, 2019, the respondent, through the assistance of UP-OLA, filed a complaint for Unlawful Detainer and Damages. Summons upon spouses Pacheco was successfully served to them on April 22, 2019 per the Return of Service of the Court Bailiff.[9]

On May 6, 2019, spouses Pacheco, through Atty. Romeo N. Bartolome (Atty. Bartolome), filed their Answer with Compulsory Counter Claim to the respondent. They denied the allegation of the respondent claiming that the respondent has no cause of action against them because they are the owners of the subject property which they acquired from Acopiado estate, the registered owner of the subject property.[10] They added that respondent is claiming a property different from the one they are occupying. They argued that the respondent has no right to collect any rentals and to claim any damages from them. Spouses Pacheco submitted a Deed of Assignment of Real Property to prove their ownership over the subject property. They further averred that they had not received the alleged demand letter from the respondent. And if ever they refused to receive the alleged letter, they asserted that they have all the reasons to do so as the alleged owners of the subject property.[11]

Spouses Pacheco then prayed that the case be dismissed on the ground of prescription since they have been in open and continuous possession of the subject property for more than 30 years and that the one-year period from the last demand to vacate on August 5, 2017 within which to file the instant action has already lapsed.[12]","This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] filed by Caridad Pacheco (petitioner) assailing the July 26, 2022 Resolution[2] and the May 8, 2023 Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA), in CA-G.R. SP No. 173904.","The Court finds no reversible error when the CA dismissed the petition outright for being the wrong remedy and because the petition suffers from several procedural infirmities.

Petitioner averred that her failure to attach a verification and a certificate against forum shopping in the petition she filed with the CA was merely due to inadvertence. She pleaded for liberal application of the rules claiming that her subsequent submissions of the verification and a certification against forum shopping, including all required documents, constituted substantial compliance with the rules.[30]

The Court is not convinced.
 
In Quitalig v. Quitalig,[31] the Court reiterated the following guidelines as well as exceptions with respect to non-compliance with the requirements on, or submission of a defective, verification and certification against forum shopping, viz.: 
1)
A distinction must be made between non-compliance with the requirement on or submission of defective verification, and non-compliance with the requirement on or submission of defective certification against forum shopping.


2)
As to verification, non-compliance therewith or a defect therein does not necessarily render the pleading fatally defective. The court may order its submission or correction or act on the pleading if the attending circumstances are such that strict compliance with the Rule may be dispensed with in order that the ends of justice may be served thereby.


3)
Verification is deemed substantially complied with when one who has ample knowledge to swear to the truth of the allegations in the complaint or petition signs the verification, and when matters alleged in the petition have been made in good faith or are true and correct.


4)
As to certification against forum shopping, non-compliance therewith or a defect therein, unlike in verification, is generally not curable by its subsequent submission or correction thereof, unless there is a need to relax the Rule on the ground of ""substantial compliance"" or presence of ""special circumstances or compelling reasons.""


5)
The certification against forum shopping must be signed by all the plaintiffs or petitioners in a case; otherwise, those who did not sign will be dropped as parties to the case. Under reasonable or justifiable circumstances, however, as when all the plaintiffs or petitioners share a common interest and invoke a common cause of action or defense, the signature of only one of them in the certification against forum shopping substantially complies with the Rule.


6)
Finally, the certification against forum shopping must be executed by the party-pleader, not by his counsel. If, however, for reasonable or justifiable reasons, the party-pleader is unable to sign, he must execute a Special Power of Attorney designating his counsel of record to sign on his behalf.[32] (Underlining and italics in the original, citation omitted)
Applying these guidelines here, the dismissal of the CA petition was warranted. A review of the alleged subsequent correction and submission by the petitioner shows that the same was still inadequate. As observed by the CA, the verification and a certificate against forum shopping lack attestation. In addition, petitioner merely submitted the first page of her Position Paper and nothing more.[33] Evidently, the averred subsequent submission made by petitioner is far from substantial.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED.

That on or about July 2, 2018, in the Municipality of Monkayo, Province of Compostela Valley, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, without any legal cause and without being authorized by law, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and knowingly cultivate One (1) marijuana plant a dangerous drug weighing 15.9758 grams when weighed by the PNP Provincial Crime Laboratory Office, Tagum City, Davao del Norte.","Before the Court is an appeal[1] under Rule 122 of the Rules of Court which assails the Decision[2] dated November 26, 2020, of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 02223. The CA affirmed the Decision[3] dated December 18, 2018, of Branch 56, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Compostela, Compostela Valley in Criminal Case No. 100-2018-MNK that found accused-appellant Jonel F. Gepitulan[4] (Jonel) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Section 16,[5] Article II of Republic Act No. (RA) 9165.[6]","In criminal cases, an appeal opens the entire case for review because it is the duty of the reviewing tribunal to correct, cite, and appreciate errors in the appealed judgment, though unassigned, or even reverse the trial court's decision based on grounds other than those that the parties raised as errors.[69] Simply put, the appeal confers upon the appellate court full jurisdiction over the case and renders it competent to examine records, revise the judgment appealed from, and even increase the penalty.[70]

Essentially, Jonel seeks his acquittal because the corpus delicti of the offense charged was supposedly not proven by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt. His argument is hinged on two grounds: First, he argues that the marijuana plant is inadmissible in evidence because it was confiscated on private land without a search warrant and not during a lawful warrantless arrest. And second, the marijuana plant presented in evidence was not properly authenticated due to the police officers' failure to comply with the chain of custody rule under Section 21, Article II of RA 9165.

Jonel’s arrest and the search conducted incidental thereto were valid because he was seen violating RA 9165 in flagrante delicto.
Section 2,[71] Article III of the 1987 Constitution provides that every person has a right to be secure in his or her persons. As a rule, therefore, law enforcers must first secure a warrant before they may lawfully arrest a person.[72] Nevertheless, there are several recognized exceptions to the rule, including the situation contemplated in Section 5(a),[73] Rule 113 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure, i.e., the in flagrante delicto exception or when, in the presence of the law enforcers, the person to be arrested executes an overt act indicating that he or she has just committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit a crime.[74]

When a person is lawfully arrested without a warrant, the apprehending officer has both the duty and the right to conduct a warrantless search not only on the person of the suspect, but also in the permissible area within the latter's reach.[75] In such a case, the arresting officer may validly confiscate evidence either on the person of the arrestee or the area of his or her immediate control within which the arrestee might gain possession of a weapon or destructible evidence.[76] Items which may be seized as an incident to a lawful arrest include any money or property found upon the suspect's person that was used in the commission of the crime or was the fruit of the crime, or which may provide the suspect with the means of committing violence or escaping, or which may be used in evidence in the trial of the case.[77] The rationale for the rule is to prevent the suspect from obtaining a weapon to commit violence or to reach for incriminatory evidence and destroy it.[78]","ACCORDINGLY, the appeal is hereby GRANTED. The Decision dated November 26, 2020, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 02223 is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Accused-appellant JONEL F. GEPITULAN is hereby ACQUITTED for failure of the prosecution to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt in Criminal Case No. 100-2018-MNK filed with Branch 56, Regional Trial Court, Compostela, Compostela Valley.

"G.R. No. 247331, February 26, 2024","HON. LOURDES R. JOSE, IN HER CAPACITY AS CITY TREASURER OF CITY OF CALOOCAN, PETITIONER, VS. TIGERWAY FACILITIES AND RESOURCES, INC., RESPONDENT.","In 2005, Tigerway applied for a renewal of its mayor's permit.[10] The Caloocan City Business Permit and Licensing Office (BPLO) then issued an Order of Payment on January 21, 2005 requiring Tigerway to pay local business tax and fees in the amount of PHP 219,429.80. Following the prompt payment of the assessed amount, a mayor's permit was issued to Tigerway.[11]

Remarkably, it was followed by a Final Demand from the BPLO calling for the payment of deficiency business taxes, fees, and charges amounting to PHP 1,220,720.00. This demand stemmed from an alleged ocular inspection conducted at Tigerway's establishment on May 27, 2005,[12] which purportedly brought to light Tigerway's misrepresentations concerning the nature of its business, the number of its employees, and the size of its business area.[13]

On July 15, 2005, the BPLO issued a Notice of Deficiency reiterating its earlier demand, which was then followed by a Last and Final Demand on December 2, 2005. A further Order of Payment was issued on December 8, 2005, seeking the same amount and citing another ocular inspection of Tigerway's establishment on June 10, 2005 as basis.[14]

A subsequent Order of Payment was issued on December 29, 2005. Notably, the amount claimed was reduced to PHP 500,000.00. Tigerway paid the reduced amount on the same day.[15]

On December 27, 2007, Tigerway filed a written claim for refund or credit to the City Treasurer, asserting that the additional assessments lacked factual and legal basis. Tigerway maintained that its actual liability for business taxes, fees, and charges for the year 2005 should only have been PHP 234,234.79, which is PHP 14,804.99 more than the BPLO's initial assessment.[16] Given its earlier payments of PHP 219,429.80 on May 27, 2005 and PHP 500,000.00 on December 29, 2005, totaling PHP 719,429.80, Tigerway claimed a refund of PHP 485,195.01 (PHP 719,429.80 – PHP 234,234.79).[17]

On the next day, Tigerway filed a Complaint for Refund or Credit of Local Tax and Fees before the RTC under Section 196 of the LGC, seeking a refund of the amount of PHP 485,195.01 which it claimed was erroneously paid to the City Treasurer.[18]

In response, the City Treasurer argued that the Complaint was baseless since Tigerway had lost its right to contest the assessment for having failed to protest it within 60 days from the receipt of the Order of Payment dated December 29, 2009, as prescribed under Section 195 of the LGC. Consequently, with the assessment becoming final and executory, the City Treasurer insisted that Tigerway was precluded from alleging any mistake or error in its payment.[19]

The RTC rendered a Decision in Tigerway's favor, disposing as follows:

WHEREFORE, IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the instant complaint is GRANTED. The defendant Treasurer of the City of Caloocan (petitioner herein) is hereby ORDERED to:

A.
Refund or credit to plaintiff (respondent herein) the amount Four Hundred Eighty Five Thousand One Hundred Ninety Five Pesos and 1/100 (Php 485,195.01), plus interest at the legal rate at 6% per annum from the time of payment to defendant on 29 December 2005 until actual refund or credit has been made;


B.
Defendant's counterclaim is DENIED for lack of merit.","Sections 195 and 196 of the Local Government Code (LGC) provide avenues for obtaining refunds of local taxes. Section 195 implicitly allows for refunds as a consequence of a successful protest against a tax assessment, while Section 196 explicitly serves as the dedicated remedy for claims of tax refund or credit.[1] In seeking a refund through Section 195, it is essential that the assessment notice from the local treasurer contains the factual and legal basis of the assessment.[2] Without this, there would be no tax assessment to contest. As a result, the provisions of Section 196 would apply.
This Court resolves the Petition for Review[3] under Rule 45 filed by Lourdes R. Jose, in her capacity as the City Treasurer of Caloocan City (City Treasurer), challenging the Decision[4] and the Resolution[5] of the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) En Banc, which affirmed the Decision[6] and the Resolution[7] of the CTA Third Division. These dispositions upheld the Decision[8] and Resolution[9] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), which ordered the refund of the amount of PHP 485,195.01 in favor of Tigerway Facilities and Resources, Inc. (Tigerway).","For the sake of clarity, Sections 195 and 196 of the LGC expressly state:

Section 195. Protest of Assessment. — When the local treasurer or his duly authorized representative finds that correct taxes, fees or charges have not been paid, he shall issue a notice of assessment stating the nature of the tax, fee, or charge, the amount of deficiency, the surcharges, interests and penalties. Within sixty (60) days from the receipt of the notice of assessment, the taxpayer may file a written protest with the local treasurer contesting the assessment; otherwise, the assessment shall become final and executory. The local treasurer shall decide the protest within sixty (60) days from the time of its filing. If the local treasurer finds the protest to be wholly or partly meritorious, he shall issue a notice cancelling wholly or partially the assessment. However, if the local treasurer finds the assessment to be wholly or partly correct, he shall deny the protest wholly or partly with notice to the taxpayer. The taxpayer shall have thirty (30) days from the receipt of the denial of the protest or from the lapse of the sixty (60)-day period prescribed herein within which to appeal with the court of competent jurisdiction otherwise the assessment becomes conclusive and unappealable.

Section 196. Claim for Refund of Tax Credit. — No case or proceeding shall be maintained in any court for the recovery of any tax, fee, or charge erroneously or illegally collected until a written claim for refund or credit has been filed with the local treasurer. No case or proceeding shall be entertained in any court after the expiration of two (2) years from the date of the payment of such tax, tee, or charge, or from the date the taxpayer is entitled to a refund or credit.

In this case, petitioner reiterated its argument that respondent could not invoke the remedy under Section 196 of the LGC, alleging that the contentions in the Complaint before the RTC lie with the empirical basis of the assessment, and not with the local government units' (LGUs) power of taxation. Petitioner averred that Section 196 is relevant only when the protest revolves around the taxing authority of the LGU. Thus, the CTA En Banc should have applied Section 195 in this case. It also emphasized that Section 196 is not a substitute for a lost remedy of protest.[43]

Further, petitioner asserted that Section 195 does not require the inclusion of the factual and legal basis of the assessment in the notice of assessment. According to petitioner, the provision merely requires the notice of deficiency to state the details on the nature of taxes, fees, or charges and the amount of deficiency, all of which were sufficiently complied with in the Notice of Deficiency dated July 15, 2005.[44]

Petitioner likewise maintained that respondent's failure to timely protest within 60 days from receipt of the notice rendered the assessment final and immutable and, thus can no longer be modified by any tribunal or court.[45]

The instant Petition is devoid of merit.","FOR THESE REASONS, the Petition is DENIED. The July 25, 2018 Decision and the May 10, 2019 Resolution of the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc in CTA EB No. 1605 (CTA AC No. 127) are AFFIRMED WITH MODIFICATION. Accordingly, petitioner City Treasurer of the City of Caloocan is ORDERED to refund or credit to respondent Tigerway Facilities and Resources, Inc. the amount of PHP 485,195.01.

For Atty. Gener C. Sansaet's repeated failure to comply with this Court's Resolutions, he is ORDERED to PAY a fine in the amount of PHP 1,000.00 and is STERNLY WARNED that a repetition of similar acts will be dealt with more severely.

PALMA, IN HIS CAPACITY AS SECRETARY TO THE MAYOR OF QUEZON CITY; AND MARLOWE Y. JACUTIN, IN HIS CAPACITY AS OFFICER-IN-CHARGE OF TASK FORCE COPRISS OF QUEZON CITY, RESPONDENTS.","The occupants, Cesar A. Altarejos et al. (Altarejos et al.), now petitioners before this Court, had been the actual possessors of the property for around 20 to 30 years.[7]

On October 1, 2013, spouses Edilberto and Dolores Palispis (Spouses Palispis) wrote a letter addressed to Tadeo M. Palma (Palma), the Quezon City mayor's secretary, coursed through Marlowe Y. Jacutin (Jacutin), head of the City Government's Task Force for the Control, Prevention, and Removal of Illegal Structures and Squatting (Task Force), requesting ""the immediate removal of illegal structures and the[] squatters""[8] within the property registered in their names.

Altarejos et al. opposed the request. They stated that Spouses Palispis had previously filed an ejectment case over the property but was eventually dismissed with finality, making any attempt to oust them of their possession without court intervention illegal.[9] In any case, the occupants claimed that the Task Force had no authority to order the demolition of any structure because this authority lies with the building official under the National Building Code of the Philippines.[10]

Meanwhile, the Task Force inspected the site and found several structures ""for residential and others for commercial use""[11] within the property. It held a series of dialogues on three separate dates—October 4, 21, and 29, 2013—with the occupants and the registered owners for an amicable settlement, to no avail.[12]

On November 5, 2013, Jacutin wrote Palma, requesting that the structures be removed in line with Section 3(m) and Section 27 of Republic Act No. 7279.[13] Jacutin emphasized that Spouses Palispis had presented proof of ownership over the property, while the occupants, who had been leasing the space to others, were professional squatters.[14]

In the interim, the Office of the Secretary to the Mayor held more meetings with the occupants, together with the Presidential Commission for the Urban Poor and the Commission on Human Rights. Spouses Palispis committed to extend financial assistance of PHP 30,000.00 to each structure owner. For failure to settle, the occupants continued to stay in the property.[15]

On March 17, 2014, Palma issued a Memorandum[16] ordering Jacutin to demolish the structures. It reads:
This refers to the request of Sps. Edilberto and Dolores Palispis dated October 1, 2013, for the demolition or various structures within the lots registered under their names, located at North Diversion Road, Barangay Unang Sigaw, [sic] Quezon City.
 
In the actual site inspection conducted by the Task Force COPRISS, it revealed that indeed there are various structures within the lots of Sps. Palispis being used for commercial and residential purposes.

. . . .

The record will show that the illegal structure-owners did not submit a [sic] conclusive proof or ownership over the lots they presently occupy specifically the duly recognized Certificate of Title under the existing Torrens System or Registration.

. . . .

In the course or the meetings, proofs or ownership and supporting documents or registered-owner [Sps.] Palispis were furnished the occupants through counsel, such [sic] the copy of the Torrens Titles. Tax Declarations, Tax Map, Lot Plan, the Verification Survey Plan submitted by the Department of Building Official, and the masterlist of occupants and structural survey map submitted by the Housing, Community Development and Resettlement Department (HCDRD). They were likewise furnished copies of the Inspection Report of the Quezon City Fire District dated January 17, 2013, finding the structures therein constitutive of a fire hazards [sic], and the Transmittal of the Department or Building Official dated November 25, 2013, declaring all the structures illegal.","Republic Act No. 7279 empowers local chief executives to issue demolition and eviction orders without court intervention, as well as summary eviction, but only on limited grounds. They do not possess unbridled discretion to exercise these powers when the facts of the case fall outside the scope of the law.

This Court resolves a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] assailing the Decision[2] and Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the Decision[4] and Order[5] of the Regional Trial Court holding that the Quezon City mayor has the legal authority to summarily evict the occupants of a property located at 39-C North Diversion Road, Camachile, Balintawak, Quezon City and have their erring structures demolished.[6]","Under Rule 65, Section 2 of the Rules of Court, a writ of prohibition is issued to command a person to desist from further proceeding in an action or matter.[53] For it to be issued, the following requisites must concur: (a) it must be directed against a tribunal, corporation, board, or person exercising functions, judicial or ministerial; (b) the tribunal, corporation, board, or person has acted without or in excess of jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion; and (c) there is no appeal or any other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.[54]

In City Engineer of Baguio v. Baniqued,[55] this Court clarified that although mayors mainly discharge executive roles, they nevertheless perform quasi-judicial functions, particularly when issuing demolition notices or orders.[56] In Aquino v. Municipality of Malay, Aklan,[57] this Court said:
[I]t is the nature of the act to be performed, rather than of the office, board, or body which performs it, that determines whether or not a particular act is a discharge of judicial or quasi-judicial functions....

It is not essential that the challenged proceedings should be strictly and technically judicial, in the sense in which that word is used when applied to courts of justice, but it is sufficient if they are quasi-judicial. To contrast, a party is said to be exercising a judicial function where he has the power to determine what the law is and what legal rights of the parties are, and then undertakes to determine these questions and adjudicate upon the rights of the parties, whereas quasi-judicial function is ""a term which applies to the actions, discretion, etc., of public administrative officers or bodies ... required to investigate facts or ascertain the existence of facts, hold hearings, and draw conclusions from them as a basis for their official action and to exercise discretion of a judicial nature.[58] (Citations omitted)
Assessing the legality of a structure and deciding whether it warrants demolition entails specific factual inquiries, which require conducting hearings to reach a verdict.[59] In pursuit of these functions, city mayors are bound to exercise quasi-judicial powers.[60] It follows that a petition for prohibition is a proper remedy to command city mayors to desist from implementing their demolition or eviction orders and from further proceeding on the matter when these are issued with grave abuse of discretion.

In this case, the Regional Trial Court, in denying the Petition for Prohibition, simply went to conclude:
At first glance, it must be noted that based on the allegations in the Petition, the petitioners failed to comply with one of the requisites for the issuance of a writ of prohibition – there is no appeal or any other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. Nowhere in the Petition was it alleged that petitioners sought administrative relief before the office of the public respondents. Clearly, petitioners did not seek administrative recourse before filing this action.[61]
We find this hasty conclusion without any basis.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is GRANTED. The September 7, 2018 Decision and April 25, 2019 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA­-G.R. SP No. 154278 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The March 17, 2014 Memorandum ordering the demolition of petitioners' structures is declared VOID for being issued with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction."
"G.R. No. 264439, February 26, 2024","RAMON O. SAMPANA, PETITIONER, VS. THE MARITIME TRAINING CENTER OF THE PHILIPPINES, CAPTAIN ALEJANDRO C. AQUINO, JR., AND NORMANDY E. GUALBERTO, RESPONDENTS.","On April 11, 2017, Sampana filed a Complaint[4] for illegal dismissal, regularization, and payment of retirement benefits, 14th month pay, training fees, separation pay, damages, and attorney's fees against respondents The Maritime Training Center of the Philippines (TMTCP), Captain Alejandro C. Aquino, Jr. (Capt. Aquino), TMTCP's chief executive officer (CEO), and Normandy E. Gualberto (Gualberto), TMTCP's administrative and finance manager.[5]

Sampana essentially averred that he was hired by TMTCP as Instructor initially under a consultancy agreement for a period of three months from March 21, 2011 to June 21, 2011 with a monthly salary of PHP 25,000.00. The consultancy agreement was continuously and repeatedly renewed every three months for three years, or from March 21, 2011 to March 20, 2014.[6] Eventually, his contract was changed by TMTCP to one captioned as ""Employment with a Fixed Term"" for a period of three months from March 21, 2014 to June 21, 2014[7] with a monthly gross compensation of PHP 27,000.00. The fixed-term contract was likewise repeatedly renewed[8] every three months until December 21, 2016.[9]

Meantime, on November 8, 2016, per advice of TMTCP's management, he sent a letter[10] to Gualberto inquiring about his retirement benefits. He stated therein that he already turned 60 and has been serving TMTCP for five years and seven months as of October 21, 2016. On November 24, 2016, he sent another letter[11] to Gualberto and Capt. Aquino notifying them that he preferred to retire after his five years and eight months of employment with TMTCP, and reiterating his query about his retirement benefits.[12]

On December 21, 2016, he was allegedly dismissed by TMTCP without just cause. On the following day, he was required to sign an Employee Clearance Form with Release, Waiver and Quitclaim.[13]

TMTCP, on the other hand, countered that it is an educational institution that provides training to Filipino seafarers.[14] Sampana was engaged as its consultant from March 21, 2011 to March 20, 2014 under a consultancy agreement. Sampana requested that his contract be changed from consultancy to contractual basis so it entered into another contract with him. In the new contract, it was stipulated that Sampana's employment was for a fixed period from March 21, 2014 to June 21, 2014. This fixed-term contract was renewed several times. Sampana was fully aware that his employment as instructor was only for the duration of the training course, which is three months, and may be renewed by agreement of the parties.[15]

During the latter part of Sampana's employment, it received several complaints from its trainees regarding Sampana's manner of conducting his classes. Consequently, due to Sampana's unsatisfactory service, it decided not to renew Sampana's last contract after it expired on December 21, 2016. Hence, Sampana was not illegally dismissed.[16]

Too, he was not entitled to retirement pay. While he reached the required age for voluntary retirement, he failed to meet the required five years of service. The period for which he was hired as consultant should be excluded from the computation of the five-year service requirement since no employer-employee relationship existed between them. More, he is not entitled to 14th month pay considering that its grant is a prerogative of management. The grant of cash gift is an act of liberality, not an obligation, which Sampana cannot demand as a matter of right.[17]","This Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] assails the following dispositions of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 158622 entitled Ramon O. Sampana v. National Labor Relations Commission (Fourth Division), The Maritime Training Center of the Philippines, Captain Alejandro C. Aquino, Jr., and Normandy E. Gualberto:

Decision[2] dated March 18, 2021 affirming the ruling of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) that petitioner Ramon O. Sampana (Sampana) did not meet the five-year requirement for optional retirement benefits under the Labor Code; and

Resolution[3] dated October 20, 2022 denying Sampana's Motion for Reconsideration.","
Sampana is a regular employee of TMTCP
The existence of an employer-employee relationship is a pure factual issue which the Court does not generally entertain. The Court is not a trier of facts, and this rule applies with greater force in labor cases. Hence, the factual findings of the NLRC are generally accorded not only respect but even finality if supported by substantial evidence and especially when affirmed by the Court of Appeals. But a disharmony between the factual findings of the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC, as in this case, opens the door for review by the Court.[39] Here, there is a need to review the records to determine whether the Court of Appeals, in the exercise of its certiorari jurisdiction, erred in affirming that Sampana is not a regular employee of TMTCP, thus:

….

However, with respect to the period from March 21, 2011 up to March 20, 2014, We opine that the same should not be included in the computation since no employer-employee relationship existed between the parties while petitioner was a consultant.

To ascertain the existence of an employer-employee relationship, jurisprudence has invariably adhered to the four-fold test, to wit: (1) the selection and engagement of the employee, (2) the payment of wages, (3) the power of dismissal, and (4) the power to control the employee's conduct, or the so-called ""control test."" Verily, the power of the employer to control the work of the employee is considered the most significant determinant of the existence of an employer-employee relationship. This is the so-called ""control test,"" and is premised on whether the person for whom the services are performed reserves the right to control both the end achieved and the manner and means used to achieve that end.

Based on the Consultancy Agreements entered into between the parties, petitioner was engaged to ""provide consultancy services and coordinate to the Training Director and/or Course Director, for further instructions on his duties and responsibilities and other pertinent related functions."" It is also stated therein that petitioner's consultancy services would be paid in the amount of [PHP] 25,000.00 subject to the deduction of ten percent (10%) creditable withholding tax. Consequently, no income tax was withheld from petitioner. No deductions were likewise made with respect to petitioner's contributions for coverage under PhilHealth, Social Security System (SSS), Pag-Ibig, and other contributions mandated by law to be collected by an employer from the employees.

The consultancy hours agreed upon was from 8:00 o'clock in the morning to 5:00 o'clock in the afternoon from Monday to Friday, and 8:00 o'clock in the morning to 12:00 o'clock noon every Saturday. However, there was no stipulation in the agreement that petitioner was required to physically report at the TMTCP premises from Monday to Saturday. Petitioner likewise failed to present proof that he was actually present at the TMTCP premises for the entirety of the agreed consultancy period.

Petitioner asseverates that he was mandated to familiarize himself with a certain manual, serving as proof that TMTCP exercised control over how petitioner performed his duties. Under the consultancy agreement, said manual refers to nothing more than the TMTCP Company Policies and Regulations. Such document pertains to general matters affecting all stakeholders of TMTCP, i.e., with regard to office decorum and attire. The same does not prescribe the manner or method by which petitioner should conduct the assigned training course. And looking at the complaints, comments, and suggestions of the trainees regarding petitioner and the training course, it is apparent that the manner and method by which petitioner performed his duties are not regulated by TMTCP. Petitioner is given freedom of discretion on how to carry out the training course during the consultancy, petitioner is not even precluded from devoting an hour's worth of lecture time to sharing anecdotes from the Bible.

Under the circumstances, We agree with the findings of the NLRC that the aforecited tests for the existence of employer-employee relationship were not met in this case.[40] (Citations omitted)

We reverse.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated March 18, 2021 and Resolution dated October 20, 2022 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 158622 are REVERSED.

In the respondents' Consolidated Position Paper,[5] dated December 12, 2013, they claimed that: (1) they were regular employees of PPI by operation of law considering the years of service they have rendered with PPI; (2) their jobs were considered necessary and desirable in the usual business or trade of PPI; (3) they were under the direct control and supervision of PPI's managers; (4) the tools and machines they used were all owned by PPI; and (5) they were directly hired by PPI but were later transferred to CBMI to avoid their regularization under the former.[6]

The respondents further averred that during the pendency of the regularization case they filed against PPI, they were dismissed by the latter without just and valid reasons and without proper observance of due process of law. Hence, they filed a case for illegal dismissal and damages against PPI and CBMI.[7]

For its part, PPI denied having an employer-employee relationship with the respondents. Instead, PPI alleged that the respondents are delivery riders employed by CBMI.[8] PPI further alleged that: (1) CBMI was incorporated and duly registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission;[9] (2) through the years, CBMI has established its name and goodwill of rendering janitorial, messengerial, sanitation, medical, bussing on tables, kitchen, delivery services, warehousing services, etc.;[10] (3) for more than two (2) decades now, CBMI had been rendering janitorial, bussing, kitchen, cashiering, warehousing and delivery services to PPI, as per the Contract of Services entered into by and between PPI and CBMI, wherein the latter undertook to perform the contracted services according to its own manner and method, free from the control and direction of PPI in all matters connected with the performance of the work except as to the results thereof;[11] (4) the Contract of Services specifically provides for the absence of fiduciary and employer-employee relationship between PPI and CBMI's employees;[12] (5) CBMI hired the respondents who were assigned to PPI as delivery riders.[13] Therefore, PPI argued that it is not the real party-in-interest against whom the respondents may avail of reliefs.

On the other hand, CBMI claimed that: (1) it is registered as a legitimate job contractor with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) ;[14] (2) PPI engaged the services of CBMI and contracted out motorized delivery services;[15] (3) throughout their deployment in their respective branch assignments, the respondents regularly received their wages and other benefits from CBMI;[16] (4) it was CBMI that deducted respondents' Social Security System, Philhealth and Pag-IBIG contributions and remitted the same; and (5) during the respondents' deployment, it was also CBMI that approved the former's applications for leave, as well as imposed the disciplinary sanctions for respondents' violation of company rules and regulations; (6) given the foregoing, it cannot be denied that the respondents were employees of CBMI and not PPI.[17]

CBMI argued that it is not liable for illegal dismissal because the respondents were not dismissed but were placed on floating status as a result of the change in circumstance of PPI, which had a reduction in manpower.[18]","This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court filed by petitioner Philippine Pizza, Inc. (PPI) assailing the Decision,[2] dated May 23, 2018, and the Resolution,[3] dated November 27, 2018, of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 140927. The CA ruled that the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) committed grave abuse of discretion, in reversing the Decision of the Labor Arbiter finding that an employer-employee relationship exists between respondents Romeo G. Oladive, Jr., Arnel D. Labog, John Laurence R. Verdida, Paul William S. Soliman, Rommel N. Caccam, Ramil D. Delos Santos, Gabriel S. Montana, Teofilo N. Bergantin, and Arthur A. De Guzman (collectively, respondents) and PPI; that Consolidated Building Maintenance, Inc. (CBMI) is engaged in labor-only contracting; and that the respondents were illegally dismissed from their employment.","The Petition has no merit.

At the outset, it must be emphasized that the issue of whether CBMI is an independent contractor, and the matter of respondents' status are questions of fact that are not the proper subjects of a petition for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. However, an exception may be made when the factual findings of the Labor Arbiter and the CA on the one hand, and the NLRC on the other, are contradictory.[38]

In the present case, the Court finds that the CA did not err in finding that the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion in reversing the Labor Arbiter's ruling that CBMI is a labor-only contractor and thus PPI is the true employer of the respondents.

PPI and CBMI were engaged in labor-
only contracting

As a rule, contracting arrangements for the performance of specific jobs or services under the law and its implementing rules are allowed. However, contracting must be made to a legitimate and independent job contractor since labor rules expressly prohibit labor-only contracting.[39]

Permissible contracting or subcontracting, and labor-only contracting is provided for under Article 106 of the Labor Code:
ARTICLE 106. Contractor or Subcontractor. — Whenever an employer enters into a contract with another person for the performance of the former's work, the employees of the contractor and of the latter's subcontractor, if any, shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of this Code.

In the event that the contractor or subcontractor fails to pay the wages of his employees in accordance with this Code, the employer shall be jointly and severally liable with his contractor or subcontractor to such employees to the extent of the work performed under the contract, in the same manner and extent that he is liable to employees directly employed by him.

The Secretary of Labor and Employment may, by appropriate regulations, restrict or prohibit the contracting-out of labor to protect the rights of workers established under this Code. In so prohibiting or restricting, he may make appropriate distinctions between labor-only contracting and job contracting as well as differentiations within these types of contracting and determine who among the parties involved shall be considered the employer for purposes of this Code, to prevent any violation or circumvention of any provision of this Code.

There is ""labor-only"" contracting where the person supplying workers to an employer does not have substantial capital or investment in the form of tools, equipment, machineries, work premises, among others, and the workers recruited and placed by such person are performing activities which are directly related to the principal business of such employer. In such cases, the person or intermediary shall be considered merely as an agent of the employer who shall be responsible to the workers in the same manner and extent as if the latter were directly employed by him. (Emphasis supplied)
Labor-only contracting is prohibited and is not condoned by law as it is seen as a circumvention of labor laws; thus, the labor-only contractor is treated as a mere agent of its principal.[40]","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED. The Decision, dated May 23, 2018, and the Resolution, dated November 27, 2018, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 140927 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. Consolidated Building Maintenance, Inc. is declared as a labor-only contractor and is adjudged solidarily liable with Philippine Pizza, Inc., the employer of respondents Romeo G.

"G.R. No. 255100, February 26, 2024","DOMINGO V. DE GUZMAN III, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","These consolidated cases arose from the shooting of Ferdinand ""Enzo"" Salas Pastor (Enzo) which led to his death.·

The Prosecution's Version

Paolo Salazar (Salazar) testified that he was employed by Enzo as a helper and mechanic. Enzo was an award-winning racecar driver.[4] On June 12, 2014, around 1:00 p.m., he and Enzo left the latter's house in Magallanes and drove to Batangas to retrieve the NASCAR cars Enzo would be using for a race. Enzo drove a yellow truck on which the racing car was loaded, while Salazar sat beside him. They were able to return to Enzo's home around 7:00 p.m. where they were greeted by Dalia, Enzo's wife.[5]

By 9:45 p.m., he and Enzo left the house again and headed to Clark, Pampanga to drop off the car. Again, he took the passenger's seat as Enzo drove with both windows of the truck rolled down. Dalia called Enzo around five times as they made their way to Clark.[6]

The truck came to a stop at the intersection of Visayas Avenue and Congressional Avenue. A man wearing black clothes with a motorcycle mask and helmet suddenly approached the driver's side of the truck and fired at them. Enzo instructed him (Salazar) to lay on the floor.[7] In the midst of the chaos, he was able to see the gunman's nose, eyes, and forehead, and observed that one of his eyes was ""kirat.""[8]

As a result of this encounter, Enzo was shot on his left side. He (Salazar) saw blood oozing out of Enzo's mouth and body. He screamed for help. Minutes later, a UNTV crew arrived but they were brought to separate hospitals.[9] He survived but Enzo did not.

Meantime, on August 23, 2014, around 1:00 p.m., members of the Philippine National Police (PNP) assigned at the District Anti-Illegal Drugs Special Operations Task Group (DAID-SOTG) of the Quezon City Police District conducted a buy-bust. operation along Boni Serrano Road, Brgy. Libis, Quezon City. During this operation, the team arrested Police Officer II Edgar Angel y Ybañez (PO2 Angel.).

Bothered by his conscience, PO2 Angel owned up to the killing of Enzo by executing an extrajudicial confession. He said that he came clean because he feared he would be killed next. In his admission, PO2 Angel named Domingo de Guzman Iii alias Sandy (De -Guzman) as the mastermind in the killing of Enzo. Enzo's wife, Dalia conspired with De Guzman and was present when they plotted the killing. PO2 Angel knew De Guzman through the latter's first wife, who was his friend. Around the second week of November 2013, De Guzman called and asked to meet him at Pier One. There, De Guzman engaged him to kill Enzo for PHP 100,000.00. De Guzman told him he pitied Enzo's wife who claimed she was regularly beaten up by Enzo. During that meeting, he and De Guzman did not agree on anything. Thereafter, they met several times, during which, De Guzman tried to convince him to carry out the plan to kill Enzo. During one of those meetings sometime in January 2014, he inquired if De Guzman was having an affair with Enzo's wife, which De Guzman denied.[10]

In the last week of February 2014, he asked for proof that Enzo was hurting his wife. De Guzman showed him a photo of a woman, who was later identified as Dalia, whose face and arm were bruised. De Guzman then handed him PHP 50,000.00 cash as down payment. He next heard from De Guzman sometime in the third week of April when the former sent him a text message, saying ""GAME NA"" and that the motorcycle and gun to be used had been prepared. He (PO2 Angel) responded ""basta text ka na lang."" From then on, De Guzman kept following up with him to carry out the plan.[11]","These Petitions for Review on Certiorari[1] assail the following dispositions of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

Consolidated Resolution[3] dated January 11, 2021 denying the Partial Motion for Reconsideration of the People of the Philippines, Motion for Partial Reconsideration of Tomas Pastor (Tomas), and Motion for Reconsideration of De Guzman.","No exception exists to warrant
a review of the uniform
factual findings of the trial
court and the appellate court
on the sufficiency of the
evidence against De Guzman
vis-a-vis he issuance of a
warrant of arrest on him and
the denial of his application
for bail

Section 1 of Rule 45 of the Rules of Court ordains that a petition for review on certiorari ""shall raise only questions of law which must be distinctly set forth."" The determination of probable cause necessarily entails a review of the facts of the case.[128] It is generally not the function of the Court to analyze or weigh the evidence which have been considered in the proceedings of the lower courts.[129]

Here, there is no denying that the issues of whether probable cause exists to support the issuance of a warrant of arrest on De Guzman and whether strong evidence exists to warrant the denial of his application for bail are both questions of fact which the Court, not being a trier of facts, will not take cognizance of under a Rule 45 petition.[130] More, the factual findings of the trial court on these incidents are valid and binding on the Court especially when the same carry the full concurrence of the appellate court as in this case.[131]

We are nonetheless aware of the exceptions where we may review the factual findings of the courts below:
When the finding are grounded entirety on speculations, surmises or conjectures; (ii) when the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible; (iii) when there is grave abuse of discretion; (iv) when the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts; (v) when the findings of fact are conflicting; (vi) when in making its findings[,] the Court or Appeals went beyond the issues of the case, or its findings are contrary to the admissions of both the appellant and the appellee; (vii) when the findings are contrary to that of the trial court; (viii) when the findings are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based; (ix) when the facts set forth in the petition[,] as well as in the petitioner's main and reply briefs[,]. are not  disputed by the respondent; (x) when he findings of fact are premised on the supposed absence of evidence. and contradicted by the evidence on record; [or] (xi) when the Court of Appeals manifestly overlooked certain relevant facts not disputed by the parties, which, if proper y considered, would justify a different conclusion.[132]
To be sure, however, none of these exceptions exist in the present case as shall be further discussed below. But even if We do a review of the factual findings of both courts below, We ordain that the evidence on record sufficiently support these factual findings.

The evidence against De
Guzman is sufficient to 1)
establish probable cause and
2) deny his application for
bail.

1) On the existence of
probable cause warranting
De Guzman's arrest

Upon the filing of a criminal complaint or Information, the trial court may exercise any of three options under Rule 112, Section 5(a) of the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure (a) dismiss the case if the evidence on record clearly failed to establish probable cause; (b) issue a warrant of arrest if it finds probable cause; or (c) order the prosecutor to present additional evidence within five days from notice in case of doubt on the existence of probable cause. No less than the Constitution mandates that issuing a warrant of arrest, should be based on probable cause ""to be determined personally by the Judge after examination under oath or affirmation of the complainant and the witnesses he may produce.""[133] On this score, the Court has decreed:
Probable cause for the purpose of issuing a warrant of arrest pertains to facts and circumstances which would lead a reasonably discreet and prudent person to believe that an offense has been committed by the person sought to be arrested. In determining probable cause, the average person weighs facts and circumstances without resorting of the calibration of our technical rules of evidence of which his or her knowledge may be nil. Rather, the person relies on the calculus of common sense of which all reasonable persons have an abundance. Thus, the standard used for issuance of a warrant of arrest is less stringent than that used for establishing the guilt of the accused. So long as the evidence presented shows a prima facie case against the accused, the trial court judge has sufficient round to issue a warrant of arrest against him or her.

If the trial court decides to issue a warrant of arrest, such warrant must have been issued after compliance with the requirement that probable cause be personally determined by the judge. At this stage, the judge is tasked to merely determine the probability, not the certainty, of guilt of the accused. In doing so, the judge need not  conduct a de novo hearing: he or she only needs to personally review the prosecutor's initial determination and see if it is supported by substantial evidence.[134]
In personally determining whether De Guzman, is probably guilty of killing Enzo as a co-principal, the trial court evaluated and gave credence to the following pieces of evidence:","ACCORDINGLY, in G.R. No. 255100, the Petition for Review on Certiorari of Domingo V. De Guzman III is DENIED for lack of merit.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[4]

On August 15, 2011, petitioner posted bail for his temporary liberty.[5] When arraigned, petitioner pleaded ""not guilty"" to the charges.[6] Thereafter, trial ensued.","This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] (Petition) under Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court, assailing the Decision[2] (CA Decision) dated August 31, 2016, and the Resolution[3] (CA Resolution) dated January 5, 2017, of the Court of Appeals – Manila, Special Sixth Division (CA) in CA-G.R.CR No. 37787. The CA affirmed with modification the conviction of petitioner Juanito Galiano y Obrar (petitioner) for illegal possession and use of false treasury or bank notes and other instruments of credit, as punished by Article 168 in relation to Article 166 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended.","The Petition has merit.

In this Petition, the Court is called upon to stress the concepts of mala in se and mens rea, particularly in relation to the crime of illegal possession and use of false treasury or bank notes and other instruments of credit, as punished by Article 168 in relation to Article 166 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended.

Mala in se felonies are crimes which are inherently immoral and such crimes are generally defined and penalized in the Revised Penal Code. However, even if a crime is punished by a special law, when the acts complained of are inherently immoral, they are deemed mala in se.[34]

Actus non facit reum, nisi mens sit rea is a legal maxim which establishes a fundamental aspect of mala in se crimes, namely that ""ordinarily, evil intent must unite with an unlawful act for there to be a crime.""[35] Thus, the existence of a mala in se crime hinges on the concurrence of both actus reus and mens rea.[36] Actus reus pertains to the external or overt acts or omissions included in a crime's definition, while mens rea refers to the accused's guilty state of mind or criminal intent accompanying the actus reus.[37] Hence, the classification of a crime as mala in se hinges not solely on the inherently wrong or depraved nature of the prohibited acts; it also requires that the penalizing law's language explicitly delineates the requisite mental element.[38] Thus, in crimes mala in se, good faith and lack of criminal intent are available defenses.[39]

On the other hand, in mala prohibita crimes, the criminal acts are not inherently immoral but become punishable only because the law says so. With these crimes, the sole issue is whether the law has been violated; criminal intent is not necessary, for the acts are prohibited for reasons of public policy.[40] In mala prohibita crimes, there is no need to prove criminal intent, for the same is conclusively presumed to exist from the commission/omission of an act prohibited by law.[41] To hold the offender guilty or accountable for the offense, it is sufficient that there is a conscious intent to perpetrate the act prohibited by the special law. The essence of mala prohibita is voluntariness in the commission of the act constitutive of the crime.[42]

Article 168 of the Revised Penal Code provides for the crime of illegal possession and use of false treasury or bank notes and other instruments of credit, while Article 166 of the same code as amended by Republic Act No. 10951,[43] relates to the applicable penalty to be imposed. The provisions read:

Article 166. Forging treasury or bank notes or other documents payable to bearer; Importing, and uttering such false or forged notes and documents. — The forging or falsification of treasury or bank notes or certificates or other obligations and securities payable to bearer and the importation and uttering in connivance with forgers or importers of such false or forged obligations or notes, shall be punished as follows:

1. By reclusion temporal in its minimum period and a fine not to exceed Two million pesos (PHP 2,000,000.00), if the document which has been falsified, counterfeited, or altered is an obligation or security of the Philippines.

The words obligation or security of the Philippines shall mean all bonds, certificates of indebtedness, national bank notes, coupons, Philippine notes, treasury notes, fractional notes, certificates of deposit, bills, checks, or drafts for money, drawn by or upon authorized officers of the Philippines, and other representatives of value, of whatever denomination, which have been or may be issued under any act of Congress.

2. By prision mayor in its maximum period and a fine not to exceed One million pesos (PHP 1,000,000.00), if the falsified or altered document is a circulating note issued by any banking association duly authorized by law to issue the same.

3. By prision mayor in its medium period and a fine not to exceed One million pesos (PHP 1,000,000.00), if the falsified or counterfeited document was issued by a foreign government.

4. By prision mayor in its minimum period and a fine not to exceed Four hundred thousand pesos (PHP 400,000.00), when the forged or altered document is a circulating note or bill issued by a foreign bank duly authorized therefor.

. . . .

Article 168. Illegal possession and use of false treasury or bank notes and other instruments of credit. — Unless the act be one of those coming under the provisions of any of the preceding articles, any person who shall knowingly use or have in his possession, with intent to use any of the false or falsified instruments referred to in this section, shall suffer the penalty next lower in degree than that prescribed in said articles.

A close reading of the provisions shows that there are two ways by which a violation of Article 168 is committed: first, when a person knowingly uses any of the false or falsified instruments; and second, when a person has in his or her possession, with intent to use, a false or falsified instrument. Then, depending on the instrument falsified, the person shall suffer the penalty next lower in degree than what is prescribed in Article 166.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is GRANTED.

SO ORDERED.[4] (Emphasis in the original)
In his recent Manifestation and Compliance[5] dated February 5, 2024, Judge Alzate stated:
THE UNDERSIGNED most respectfully comes before the Honorable Supreme Court and states that:
In compliance with the Resolution of the Honorable Court directing the undersigned to pay the fine in the amount of TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PESOS [PHP] 200,000.00 in relation to this case, the undersigned has paid the said amount through the Office of the Clerk of Court, RTC Bangued, Abra;

As proof of payment, the undersigned respectfully submits the certified true copy of Official Receipt No. 5803638 under the SAJ Fund; [and]

The undersigned likewise manifests that he has assumed office as Presiding Judge of Branch 1, RTC Bangued, Abra on February 1, 2024.
WHEREFORE, premises considered, it is most respectfully prayed that the Honorable Supreme Court deems this as sufficient compliance of its Resolution dated April 18, 2023.[6]
The thing speaks for itself. Judge Alzate has flagrantly disrespected and defied Our Resolution[7] dated April 18, 2023, pertaining to his five-year suspension, which he is deemed to have only partially served via his previous one-year preventive suspension. He should have commenced serving the rest of his five-year suspension only upon his receipt of the aforesaid Resolution on January 31, 2024.[8]

But what he peremptorily did was to simply pay the imposed fine, and thereupon, take it upon himself to report back to Branch 1, Regional Trial Court, Bangued, Abra right on the following day February 1, 2024, sans any prior notice or clearance from the Court.

It is, thus, readily suspicious that in his Manifestation and Compliance dated February 5, 2024, he did not even mention the five-year suspension imposed on him. This is a clear signal that Judge Alzate has intentionally omitted the mention of the five-year suspension for no other purpose than to mislead the Court itself and consequently negate its efficacy.

"G.R. No. 262941, February 20, 2024","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. YYY, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","On July 13, 2016, the United States of America (USA) Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) tracked the electronic mails (emails) of YYY[2] and obtained nude photos of minor girls being sold to online male customers. The FBI traced the coordinates of the emails that led to the northern part of Angeles City, Pampanga, Philippines. A male FBI undercover agent had an online chat with YYY who gave him the payment details and access to sexual webcam shows and indecent photos of minor girls. YYY proposed to the undercover agent a sexual meet up and bragged that she offers child pornography to foreigners. On July 27, 2016, the Legal Attache of the US Embassy sent an Unclassified/Law Enforcement Sensitive Letter to the Philippine National Police (PNP) Headquarters in Camp Crame, Quezon City concerning YYY's illegal activities.[3]

Immediately, the acting chief of the PNP Anti-Trafficking in Persons Division Colonel Villamar Tuliao (Col. Tuliao) directed Police Senior Inspector Mary Gallano (PSI Gallano) to verify the report. PSI Galiano looked for the social media accounts of YYY and learned that she is selling her house in Mabalacat City, Pampanga. On August 6, 2016, PSI Gallano together with Police Senior Inspector Jigs Madato (PSI Madato) conducted a surveillance, proceeded to YYY's house, and posed as buyers. YYY introduced herself as owner of the property and invited PSI Gallano and PSI Madato for a house tour where they saw minor girls, a computer set with webcam, a vibrator, and children's panties. PSI Gallano and PSI Madato took pictures of the premises and confirmed that the room, curtain, and fixtures matched the photos from the FBI.[4]

On August 11, 2016, Col. Tuliao applied for a search warrant before the Regional Trial Court (RTC). Executive Judge Ramon Pamular (Judge Pamular) interviewed Col. Tuliao and PSI Gallano and examined the supporting documents.[5] On even date, Judge Pamular issued a warrant authorizing the law enforcers to searc.h the house of YYY in Mabalacat City, Pampanga for items related to child pornography: (a) computer sets, including a silver monitor encased in a pink casing connected to a black CPU; (b) laptops; (c) modems/routers connected either by cable or connected remotely; (d) computer speakers; (e) other communication/electronic devices connected or remote; (f) telephone sets, cellular/mobile phones, including an iPhone 6 plus; (g) Central Processing Units (CPUs); (h) digital storage devices such as SD cards, thumb drives, and external drives or webcams; (i) memory cards; (j) transaction receipts from money transfer providers such as Western Union, Cebuana Lhuiller, Moneygram, Xoom, and others; (k) sex toys; (1) pornographic pictures and images; (m) birth control pills; (n) lingerie or underwear; (o) condoms and lubricants; (p) cabinets; and (q) black Toyota Vios with a plate number ZLE 632.[6]

On August 16, 2016, at around 6:00 a.m., the police officers and barangay officials proceeded to YYY's house and implemented the search warrant.[7] The operatives composed of Col. Tuliao, PSI Gallano, PSI Madato and evidence custodian Senior Police Officer 1 Edgard Siazon (SPO1 Siazon) retrieved and marked the following items: (a) one computer set (CPU, HP monitor, keyboard, AVR, lampshade, cord, wire, and speaker) marked as ECS ""H"" ECS ""B "" ECS ""G"" ECS ""K"" ECS ""I"" ECS ""L"" ECS ""J"" and ECS ""H,"" respectively; (b) on' e set of wifi modem' marked 'as ECS ""A' ;"" (c) two wallets without money and assorted receipts marked as ECS ""C;"" (d) one set of vibrator marked as ECS ""O;"" (e) assorted receipts marked as ECS ""E;"" (f) Hello Kitty poster marked as ECS ""M;"" (g) one unit of Samsung cellphone, official receipt of a vehicle, two compact discs, empty pills, and checks all marked as ECS ""D;"" and (h) one clear book marked as ECS ""F."" SPO1 Siazon inventoried the confiscated items in the presence of YYY, her live-in partner, and the barangay officials who attested that the search was made in a lawful, peaceful, and orderly manner. The authorities also rescued three minor children, namely, AAA, BBB, and CCC and handed them to the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD).[8]

On August 22, 2016, the police officers returned the search warrant and presented the seized items to the RTC which, in turn, ordered the PNP Anti­ Cybercrime Division to conduct a digital forensic examination. On September 15, 2016, the operatives interviewed the rescued minors. AAA narrated that she was left under the custody of her aunt YYY after her parents separated. YYY ordered AAA to enter a room, remove her clothes, and stand naked in front of a computer monitor with a webcam where her private parts were exposed to an unidentified old man. YYY likewise took pictures and videos of AAA in two separate occasions where she was made to touch her genitalia in front of a computer screen. YYY gave AAA money and brought her to the mall after each incident. On September 20, 2016, digital forensic examiner Senior Police Officer 2 Jocar Samenian (SPO2 Samenian) extracted from the seized computer set and cellphone the nude photos and videos of AAA who was touching her genitalia and waving at the camera. SPO2 Samenian also obtained a conversation between YYY and a foreign customer about the sale of AAA's nude pictures and videos.[9]","The repeal of a criminal act by its reenactment, even without a saving clause, would not destroy criminal liability.[1] The doctrine obtains chief consideration in this appeal assailing the conviction of the accused-appellant for child pornography with the use of a computer system.","The repeal with reenactment in
Republic Act No. 11930 of similar
prohibited acts in Republic Act No.
9775 does not extinguish the criminal
liability of the accused

As a rule, the explicit, categorical, definite, and absolute repeal of a penal law deprives the courts of their authority to punish an accused charged with a violation of the old law prior to its repeal. The unqualified repeal of a penal law renders legal what had been previously declared as illegal. Differently stated, the offense no longer exists as if the person who committed it never did so.[24] However, the rule is subject to exceptions. One is the inclusion of a saving clause in the repealing law which provides that the repeal shall have no effect on pending actions. Another exception is where the repealing law reenacts the former statute and punishes the act previously penalized under the old law. In such instance, the act committed before the reenactment continues to be an offense in the statute books and pending cases are not affected, regardless of whether the new penalty to be imposed is more favorable to the accused,[25] thus:
Where a clause or provision or a statute for that matter is simultaneously repealed and reenacted, there is no effect, upon the rights and liabilities which have accrued under the original statute, since the reenactment, in effect ""neutralizes"" the repeal and continues the law in force without interruption. The rule applies to penal laws and statutes with penal provisions. Thus, the repeal of a penal law or provision, under which a person is charged with violation thereof and its simultaneous reenactment penalizing the same act done by him under the old law, will neither preclude the accused's prosecution nor deprive the court of its jurisdiction to bear and try his case. As pointed out earlier, the act penalized before the reenactment continues to remain an offense and pending cases are unaffected.[26] (Emphasis supplied)
In this case, YYY allegedly committed the crime charged in August 2016 when the prevailing law is Republic Act No. 9775 or the Anti-Child Pornography Act of 2009. On July 30, 2022, the Congress enacted Republic Act No. 11930 or the Anti-Online Sexual Abuse or Exploitation of Children (OSAEC) and Anti-Child Sexual Abuse or Exploitation Materials (CSAEM) Act. Notably, Republic Act No. 11930 expressly repealed the entire Republic Act No. 9775[27] but at the same reenacted the unlawful acts defined as child pornography. Republic Act No. 11930 even expanded the scope of prohibited acts and made it a declared policy of the State to protect every child from all forms of abuse or exploitation, whether committed with or without the use of information and communications technology (ICT), such as when the abuse or exploitation involves: (1) performances and materials through online or offline means or a combination of both; and (2) the inducement or coercion of a child to engage or be involved in child sexual abuse or exploitation materials through whatever means. A comparison of the unlawful acts defined in Republic Act No. 9775 and Republic Act No. 11930 does not hint on any intent to decriminalize child pornography:

Provincial Prosecutor[6]

The said Information is based on the Resolution[7] also dated September 4, 2006 of the Office of the Provincial Prosecutor of Bohol (OPP-Bohol), which is quoted below in full for easy reference:","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] filed to assail both the Decision[2] dated February 22, 2019 and the Resolution[3] dated August 28, 2020 of the Court of Appeals (CA) 20th Division in CA-G.R. CEB-CR No. 02697. Said final orders of the CA effectively denied the appeal of Floro Galorio y Gapas (petitioner) from the Decision[4] dated July 28, 2015 of Branch 51, Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Carmen, Bohol in Criminal Case No. 0954, and affirmed the same with modifications. The trial court's Decision had convicted petitioner for the crime of Homicide as punished under Article 249 of Act No. 3815, otherwise known as the Revised Penal Code (RPC).","The instant Petition is very much impressed with merit, and accordingly, petitioner’s acquittal is in order.

Anent the first issue, the Court notes of the various exceptions to the general rule that its disposition of petitions for review on certiorari are limited to errors of law, and concurrently, that the findings of fact below relative to such petitions are deemed conclusive. In Fuentes v. Court of Appeals,[91] the Court enumerated such exceptions to be as follows:

(1) [W]hen the factual findings of the Court of Appeals and the trial court are contradictory;

(2) [W]hen the findings are grounded entirely on speculation, surmises, or conjectures;

(3) [W]hen the inference made by the Court of Appeals from its findings of fact is manifestly mistaken, absurd, or impossible;

(4) [W]hen there is grave abuse of discretion in the appreciation of facts;

(5) [W]hen the appellate court, in making its findings, goes beyond the issues of the case, and such findings are contradictory to the admissions of both appellant and appellee;

(6) [W]hen the judgment of the Court of Appeals is premised on a misapprehension of facts;

(7) [W]hen the Court of Appeals fails to notice certain relevant facts which, if properly considered, will justify a different conclusion;

(8) [W]hen the findings of fact are themselves conflicting;

(9) [W]hen the findings of fact are conclusions without citation of the specific evidence on which they are based; and

(10) [W]hen the findings of fact of the Court of Appeals are premised on the absence of evidence but such findings are contradicted by the evidence on record.[92] (Emphases supplied)

Meanwhile, People v. Esteban[93] also cited the following principle when it comes to the findings of fact by lower courts in criminal cases, viz.:

It is well-settled that, in criminal cases, factual findings of the trial court are generally accorded great weight and respect on appeal, especially when such findings are supported by substantial [sic] evidence on record. It is only in exceptional circumstances, such as when the trial court overlooked material and relevant matters, that this Court will re-calibrate and evaluate the findings of the trial court below.[94]

Such recalibration and reevaluation are in order here, for the Court cannot turn a blind eye to the egregious errors of the trial court that seem to have been overlooked by the appellate court here in a disturbingly nonchalant manner. But such shall be discussed later with regard to the third issue, as the Court must first make a short pronouncement on the second issue of whether or not petitioner's right to speedy trial was violated by the trial court below.

The Court in Corpuz v. Sandiganbayan[95] explained the rationale and purpose of the constitutional right to speedy trial, viz.:

The right of the accused to a speedy trial and to a speedy disposition of the case against him was designed to prevent the oppression of the citizen by holding criminal prosecution suspended over him for an indefinite time, and to prevent delays in the administration of justice by mandating the courts to proceed with reasonable dispatch in the trial of criminal cases. Such right to a speedy trial and a speedy disposition of a case is violated only when the proceeding is attended by vexatious, capricious and oppressive delays. The inquiry as to whether or not an accused has been denied such right is not susceptible by [sic] precise qualification. The concept of speedy disposition is a relative term and must necessarily be a flexible concept.","ACCORDINGLY, the instant Petition for Review on Certiorari is GRANTED. The Decision dated July 28, 2015 of Branch 51, Regional Trial Court of Carmen, Bohol in Criminal Case No. 0954, as well as the Decision dated February 22, 2019 and the Resolution dated August 28, 2020 of the Court of Appeals 20th Division in CA-G.R. CEB-CR No. 02697, are all REVERSED and SET ASIDE, and petitioner Floro Galorio y Gapas is thus ACQUITTED on the ground of DEFENSE OF A RELATIVE in accordance with Article 11, paragraph 2 of Act No. 3815, otherwise known as the Revised Penal Code, as amended. Petitioner Floro Galorio y Gapas is also ADJUDGED and DECLARED to be NOT CIVILLY LIABLE to the heirs of the late Andres G. Muring, Sr.

Petitioner Floro Galorio y Gapas is also ORDERED to be IMMEDIATELY RELEASED from confinement if he is still detained, unless he is being held for other lawful case.

Let entry of judgment be issued immediately."
"G.R. Nos. 244695, 244752 & 245294, February 14, 2024 ","MANGGAGAWA SA KOMUNIKASYON NG PILIPINAS, PETITIONER, VS. PLDT, INC., RESPONDENT.","Petitioner PLDT is a corporation engaged in the telecommunications business. For its operation, it engaged the services of several contractors and sub-contractors to provide services in various areas or phases of its operations. Petitioner MKP, on the other hand, was the exclusive bargaining agent of PLDT's rank-and file employees.[4]

To settle the dispute that arose from the negotiation of the collective bargaining agreement between PLDT and MKP, the intervention of the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) was sought, and the parties agreed to have a ""Special Assesment and Visit of Establishment"" (SAVE) conducted in PLDT.[5] Thus, the DOLE issued Administrative Order No. 648 (AO 648),[6] constituting a DOLE Assessment Team that will:
[C]onduct [SAVE] to assess, validate and verify PLDT's, including its contractors/subcontractors, compliance to Department Order 18-A, Series of 2011, on-the-job training and other training-in-employment practices, hiring practices, working arrangements and compliance with general labor standards and occupational safety and health standards.[7]
During the inspection, the DOLE Assessment Team interviewed a total of 1,104 PLDT employees and contracted workers, as well as 37 contractors' representatives from several offices of PLDT in the National Capital Region. The focus of the interview was PLDT's contracting activities and practices.[8]

During a conference held on December 5, 2016, the DOLE Assessment Team presented its Report on the Special Assessment and Visit of the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (SAVE Report).[9] In the SAVE Report, the DOLE Assessment Team enumerated their preliminary findings of PLDT's and its contractor's violation of DOLE Department Order No. 18-A, Series of 2011 (DO 18-A).[10] Among other things, the DOLE Assessment Team reported matters that tend to establish that PLDT and its contractors are engaged in labor-only contracting. In particular, the interviews of the workers intimated that PLDT exercised control and supervision over them,[11] which is demonstrated by the following:
a.	
PLDT informed the contractors of its personnel needs, setting the basic requirements for hiring job applicants. PLDT also conducted initial evaluatjon of contractors' job applicants, and those who passed were referred to the contractor for the completion of the hiring process. Contractors' employees also underwent trainings provided by PLDT, either alone or with the contractor.[12]
 	
b.	
Work schedules for contractors' employees and work deadlines were set by PLDT. Rendition of overtime work and availment of leave benefits were subject to PLDT's approval. PLDT also reviewed the work and reports of contractors' workers on a weekly basis.[13]
 	
c.	
Problems encountered by contractors' workers were referred to PLDT's personnel for appropriate action. Most workers interviewed also said that organic PLDT employees supervised them. Special Point of Contact (SPOC) persons assigned by contractors to PLDT only communicated problems encountered by workers but had no authority to address the concerns themselves. PLDT managers or supervisors were always assigned to address work problems.[14]
 	
d.	
Some workers of contractors performed tasks also performed by PLDT employees.[15]
 	
e.	
PLDT possessed the authority to recommend replacement or termination of employment of contractors' workers.[16]
It was also reported that 47 of PLDT's contractors violated general labor standards provisions on overtime pay, holiday pay, service incentive leave, maternity leave, paternity leave and 13th month pay. Nineteen contractors were also found to have made unauthorized deductions for uniform, safety shoes, cable handset, monitoring tablet and other tools.[17]

Based on this finding of control, it was recommended that PLDT should regularize contractual employees performing jobs that are directly related to their business. PLDT was also declared solidarily liable with the contractors to pay the unpaid monetary benefits of the contractors' workers.[18]","Before the Court are consolidated Petitions[1] for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court filed by petitioners Manggagawa sa Komunikasyon ng Pilipinas (MKP), PLDT, Inc.

Bello), all assailing the Decision[2] and Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA). In the challenged issuances, the CA affirmed, albeit with substantial modifications, the resolutions issued by Sec. Bello in ""In Re: Special Assessment or Visit of the Establishment (SAVE) in Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT), ""and docketed as OS-LS-0120-0804-2017.","We sustain the assailed Decision of the CA and, thus, dismiss the consolidated Petitions.

The extent of the Court's judicial
review of labor cases vis-á-vis the
scope of the CA 's certiorari review of
the decisions of the Secretary of
Labor and the labor tribunals

To begin with, it must be emphasized that the consolidated petitions before Us are riddled with factual issues that would require the Court to take a second look at the records of the case just to have a complete disposition of this long-drawn controversy. Normally, these factual issues are outside the ambit of a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, which is a mode of appeal that is almost restricted to pure questions of law,[79] save for some exceptions where factual review is allowed, such as when the finding of the lower tribunals are contradictory.[80]

We had recently confirmed this doctrine in Coca-Cola FEMSA Philippines, Inc. v. Coca-Cola FEMSA Phils., MOP Manufacturing Unit Coordinators and Supervisors Union-All Workers Alliance Trade Unions (CCFP-MMUCSU-AWATU),[81] where We explained:
As early as 1993, the Court has already ruled that ""judicial review by [the Supreme] Court in labor cases does not go so far as to evaluate the sufficiency of the evidence upon which the labor officer or office based his or its determination but are limited to issues of jurisdiction and grave abuse of discretion."" This limitation on the scope of review in labor cases is based on the summary nature of labor adjudication proceedings and the nature of the mode of review allowed by law therefrom, Thus, ""[i]n labor cases, petitions for review on certiorari under Rule 45 [are] limited to determining whether the Court of Appeals was correct in finding the presence or absence of grave abuse of discretion and jurisdictional errors on the part of the lower tribunal.""[82]
Meanwhile, and as already intimated in the above-quoted ruling, the purview of the CA's certiorari powers over labor disputes are focused on finding whether grave abuse of discretion attended the assailed ruling of the labor tribunal or officer.[83]

No doctrine is more settled than that the sole office of a writ of certiorari is the correction of errors of jurisdiction including the commission of grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction.[84] A court or tribunal is said to have acted with grave abuse of discretion when it capriciously acts or whimsically exercises judgment to be ""equivalent to lack of jurisdiction.""[85] Furthermore, the abuse of discretion must be so flagrant to amount to a refusal to perform a duty or to act as provided by law.[86] In labor disputes, grave abuse of discretion may be ascribed to labor officers and tribunals when, inter alia, their findings and conclusions are not supported by substantial evidence or that amount of relevant evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion.[87] In Barroga v. Quezon Colleges of the North,[88] We held:
In labor cases, grave abuse of discretion may be ascribed when its findings and conclusions are not supported by substantial evidence, which refers to that amount of relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion. Thus, if the NLRC's ruling has basis in the evidence and the applicable law and jurisprudence, then no grave abuse of discretion exists and the CA should so declare and, accordingly, dismiss the petition.[89]
Based on the foregoing, the scope of the Court's review of the CA's decision involving labor disputes remains confined to questions of law; a unique question of law, at that: did the CA correctly determine whether grave abuse of discretion attended the determination and resolution of the NLRC, or for this matter, the Secretary of Labor?[90] This is best explained in Montoya v. Transmed Manila Corp.,[91] to wit:
We review in this Rule 45 petition the decision of the CA on a Rule 65 petition filed by Montoya with that court. In a Rule 45 review, we consider the correctness of the assailed CA decision, in contrast with the review for jurisdictional error that we undertake under Rule 65. Furthermore, Rule 45 limits us to the review of questions of law raised against the assailed CA decision. In ruling for legal correctness, we have to view the CA decision in the same context that the petition for certiorari it ruled upon was presented to it; we have to examine the CA decision from the prism of whether it correctly determined the presence or absence of grave abuse of discretion in the NLRC decision before it, not on the basis of whether the NLRC decision on the merits of the case was correct. In other words, we have to be keenly aware that the CA undertook a Rule 65 review, not a review on appeal, of the NLRC decision challenged before it. This is the approach that should be basic in a Rule 45 review of a CA ruling in a labor case.[92] (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)
Bearing these foregoing principles in mind, We rule that the CA did not err in finding grave abuse of discretion on the part of Sec. Bello in issuing his assailed Resolutions. As will be discussed, the CA correctly ruled that the Resolutions of Sec. Bello were not supported by substantial evidence.","FOR THESE REASONS, the Petitions in G.R. No. 244695, G.R. No. 244751, and G.R. No. 245294 filed by petitioners Manggagawa sa Komunikasyon ng Pilipinas, PLDT, Inc., and Silvestre H. Bello III (Sec. Bello), respectively, are DISMISSED. The Decision dated July 31, 2018 and Resolution dated February 14, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 155563 are AFFIRMED.

The Resolution of Silvestre H. Bello III in OS-LS-0120-0804-2017, issued in his capacity as then Secretary of Labor, is MODIFIED. Sec. Bello's order to regularize the workers of PLDT's service contractors is SET ASIDE, except those performing installation, repair, and maintenance services, who are hereby declared regular employees of PLDT subject to the terms of the REMAND as set out below.

" G.R. No. 237422, February 14, 2024","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. BEN G. BATION, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","The Information[4] dated March 3, 2010 charging Bation with illegal planting and cultivation of marijuana, reads:

That on or about 5:50 . . . in the morning of March 1, 2010 in Kinamandagan, Lazi, Siquijor and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused without any legal authority, did then and there wilfully and unlawfully plant, cultivate[,] and culture marijuana as he indeed was caught in the act by the police authorities watering and tending the said plants considered dangerous drug [sic] under the law.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[5]

Bation pleaded not guilty.[6]","On appeal is the July 20, 2017 Decision[1] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 01985 affirming the December 9, 2014 Judgment[2] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 46 of Larena, Siquijor in Criminal Case No. 1510, which found accused-appellant Ben G. Bation guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Section 16, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165,[3] otherwise known as the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002.","The appeal has merit. The Court acquits Bation of the crime charged.

At the outset, the Court holds that Bation was validly arrested as he was caught in the act of committing a crime.

Under Section 5, Rule 113 of the Rules of Court, a warrantless arrest may be made under the following circumstances:

Section 5. Arrest without warrant; when lawful. — A peace officer or a private person may, without a warrant, arrest a person:

(a) When, in his [or her] presence, the person to be arrested has committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit an offense;

(b) When an offense has just been committed, and he [or she] has probable cause to believe based on personal knowledge of facts or circumstances that the person to be arrested has committed it; and

(c) When the person to be arrested is a prisoner who has escaped from a penal establishment or place where he [or she] is serving final judgment or is temporarily confined while his [or her] case is pending, or has escaped while being transferred from one confinement to another . . .

For an arrest effected under Section 5 (a), Rule 113 to be valid, it is required that: (a) the person to be arrested must execute an overt act indicating that he or she has just committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit a crime; and, (b) such overt act is done in the presence or within the view of the arresting officer.[90]

Bation was caught in flagrante delicto of cultivating plant sources of dangerous drugs when he fertilized and watered the marijuana plants. It is undisputed that the plants he cultivated came out positive for marijuana, a dangerous drug, after laboratory examination.[91]

The warrantless search of the property prior to his arrest was valid. There was no invalid intrusion as the plants were located in an open area visible to passersby. The decision of the police officers to wait out and arrest the person who cultivates the plants, instead of obtaining a search warrant, is a valid course of action. This course of action resulted to Bation being caught in flagrante delicto, leading to his arrest.

Assuming the warrantless search was invalid, Bation cannot argue against the unreasonable search. He is neither the owner nor the occupant of the property where the marijuana plants were discovered, which is around 300 meters away from his house. He admitted that he was not the owner of the property and that a certain ""Bayuyong"" is the owner.[92]

The right to contest the legality of a seizure belongs only to the party whose rights have been impaired.[93] The right is personal, and only a party whose rights were violated can assail the act and move to exclude the evidence gathered pursuant to the act.[94] A person who is not the owner or legal occupant of the place cannot validly give consent to the search therein.

Thus, Bation cannot raise the defense that there was an invalid search of the marijuana plants leading to his arrest.

In any event, the acquittal of Bation is proper due to non-compliance by the police officers with the rule on chain of custody for failure to observe the three-witness requirement.

Bation was charged with Cultivation or Culture of Plants Classified as Dangerous Drugs or are Sources Thereof under Section 16 of Republic Act No. 9165. To successfully prosecute this offense, the prosecution must show that the rule on chain of custody in Section 21 of the same law has been observed. The relevant portions of Section 21, before its amendment,[95] read:","ACCORDINGLY, the appeal is GRANTED. The July 20, 2017 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

"G.R. No. 256540, February 14, 2024","BISON MANAGEMENT CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. AAA• AND DALE P. PERNITO,•• RESPONDENTS.","The present petition stems from an amended Complaint[9] dated March 1, 2019 for illegal dismissal and discrimination, non-payment of salary/wages, overtime pay, vacation leave pay, payment of the unexpired portion of the employment contract, attorney's fees, damages, and legal interest filed by respondents AAA and Dale P. Pernito (Pernito) (collectively, respondents) against Bison, Belen M. Al-Humayed[10] (Al-Humayed), and Saraya Al Jazerah Contracting Est.[11] (Saraya).

Bison is the recruitment agency that placed and deployed respondents to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (Saudi Arabia) as overseas Filipino workers (OFW);[12] Al-Humayed is the President of Bison;[13] while Saraya is the foreign recruitment agency of Bison.[14]

The antecedent facts are summarized by the CA as follows:

[AAA] . . . applied with [Bison] sometime in 2017 and, after undergoing the usual screening and interview, was hired as a Cleaning Laborer under a two (2)-year contract with a monthly salary of One Thousand Five Hundred Saudi Riyal (SR 1,500.00). He was deployed to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on 18 October 2017 and commenced work thereafter. In January of 2019 – after working for fifteen (15) months – [AAA] underwent routine medical examination and was found positive for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). On this basis, his foreign employer terminated the employment of [AAA] because under the laws of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, an HIV+ individual is considered unfit to work. He was repatriated to the Philippines on 08 February 2019.

As to [Pernito], he applied with [Bison] sometime in 2018 and was hired as a Restaurant Worker under a similar two (2)-year contract with a monthly salary of One Thousand Five Hundred Saudi Riyal (SR 1,500.00). He was deployed to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on 29 March 2018 and commenced work soon thereafter. Unfortunately, after working for around nine (9) months, he was terminated from employment supposedly because he had expressed interest to resign and transfer to another employer. However, [Pernito] vehemently denied this imputation, and claimed that he was actually terminated because his employer saw him and his co-workers conversing with each other during their break time. He was repatriated to the Philippines on 23 January 2019.[15]","Before the Court is the petition for review[1] (Petition) under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court filed by petitioner Bison Management Corporation (Bison) assailing the Decision[2] dated November 18, 2020 and Resolution[3] dated May 25, 2021 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 164083.

The CA affirmed the Decision[4] dated September 30, 2019 and Resolution[5] dated November 18, 2019 of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) in NLRC LAC (OFW-M)-(L)-08-000564-19. The NLRC had earlier reversed and set aside the Decision[6] dated July 22, 2019 of the Labor Arbiter in NLRC NCR Case No. (L) 03-04320-19.","Article XIII, Section 3 of the Constitution provides:

SECTION 3. The State shall afford full protection to labor, local and overseas, organized and unorganized, and promote full employment and equality of employment opportunities for all.

It shall guarantee the rights of all workers to self-organization, collective bargaining and negotiations, and peaceful concerted activities, including the right to strike in accordance with law. They shall be entitled to security of tenure, humane conditions of work, and a living wage. They shall also participate in policy and decision-making processes affecting their rights and benefits as may be provided by law.

As the Court has succinctly worded in Princess Talent Center Production, Inc. v. Masagca[38] (Princess Talent Center Production), ""[t]he Constitutional guarantee of security of tenure extends to Filipino overseas contract workers. . . . Employees are not stripped of their security of tenure when they move to work in a different jurisdiction.""[39]

"G.R. No. 260118, February 12, 2024","PAOLO MARTIN M. ORTIGAS, DENISE MARIE O. TING AND CARISSA KATRINA O. KO, HEIRS OF JOCELYN M. ORTIGAS, PETITIONERS, VS. COURT OF APPEALS AND HESILITO N. CARREDO, RESPONDENTS.","In their Petition for Annulment of Judgment docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 167025, the Ortigas Heirs, namely Paolo Martin M. Ortigas (Paolo), Denise Marie O. Ting, and Carissa Katrina O. Ko sought to set aside and nullify the Decision dated June 17, 2020 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 91, Quezon City in Civil Case No. R-QZN-18-10658-CV (petition for cancellation of a memorandum of encumbrance annotated on TCT No. 004-2017014143 covering a parcel of land acquired by private respondent Carredo through a public auction sale conducted by the City Treasurer of Quezon City for real property tax delinquency of spouses Cicero and Maria Luz Lumauig, the previous owners of the property).[5] They alleged that on October 29, 1999, Spouses Lumauig, for a consideration of PHP 5,000,000.00, mortgaged to their predecessor in interest Jocelyn M. Ortigas (Jocelyn) their property in Quezon City covered by TCT No. N-198628. The parties agreed that in case of default, the mortgagor shall pay 5% compounded interest per month plus 1% penalty per month. On September 1, 2000, the corresponding deed of real estate mortgage was annotated on the title of the property.[6]

Upon the death of Jocelyn, they succeeded to her estate, including all her rights to the subject property. In the course, they came across the deed of real estate mortgage in question and discovered that Spouses Lumauig defaulted in the payment of their mortgage debt. Consequently, they demanded from Spouses Lumauig the total amount of PHP 20,000,000.00 comprising the principal amount plus interest, payable within 10days from notice. Demand letters, the last of which was dated September 19, 2017, were sent by personal service to the address of Spouses Lumauig as indicated in the mortgage agreement. These demand letters, however, were returned unserved because Spouses Lumauig were no longer residing in their given address.[7]

They later on discovered that the mortgaged property was already foreclosed and sold at public auction on July 4, 2013 due to non-payment of real estate taxes.[8] It was sold to Carredo in whose name TCT No. 004-2017014143 was issued.[9]

Thereafter, they filed a petition for extrajudicial foreclosure of mortgage with the Quezon City Office of the Clerk of Court acting as Ex-Officio Sheriff.

On June 15, 2020, Carredo received a notice of extrajudicial sale of the property covered by TCT No. 004-2017014143. Carredo's counsel claimed to have requested the Quezon City Office of the Clerk of Court for documents pertaining to the said notice. He also allegedly informed the said office of a pending action for cancellation of encumbrance before the Regional Trial Court, Branch 91, Quezon City. It turned out that Carredo was referring to the petition entitled Hesilito N. Carredo v. Jocelyn Ortigas and the Register of Deeds for Quezon City, docketed as Civil Case No. R-QZN-18-10658-CV and filed on September 5, 2018 specifically for cancellation of the real estate mortgage annotated on TCT No. 004-2017014143.[10]

By Decision[11] dated June 17, 2020, Regional Trial Court, Branch 91, Quezon City granted Carredo's petition for cancellation of encumbrance, thus:

WHEREFORE, the petition for cancellation of the encumbrance or Entry No. PE-5670 annotated on the memorandum of encumbrance of TCT No. 004-2017014143 which is registered under the name of petitioner Hesilito N. Carredo, is hereby GRANTED.

The Register of Deeds of Quezon City is directed to cancel, after proper annotation, the subject encumbrance pursuant to Sec. 108 of P.D. 1529 upon finality or this decision and payment of the necessary fees.","This Petition for Certiorari[1] under Rule 65 assails the following dispositions of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 167025 entitled Paolo Martin M. Ortigas, Denise Marie O. Ting, and Carissa Katrina O. Ko, Heirs of Jocelyn M. Ortigas, v. Hesilito N. Carredo and Hon. Wilfredo L. Maynigo in his capacity as Acting Presiding, Judge of Branch 91, Regional Trial Court, Quezon City:

1)
Resolution[2] dated January 25, 2021, dismissing outright the Petition for Annulment of Judgment filed by the Heirs of Jocelyn M. Ortigas (Ortigas Heirs) against the dispositions of the trial court in Civil Case No. R-QZN-18-10658-CV for cancellation of encumbrance on Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 004-2017014143;
 	 
2)
Resolution[3] dated October 7, 2021, denying their motion for reconsideration; and
 	 
3)
Resolution[4] dated February 10, 2022, noting without action their Motion for Clarification.","On the procedural aspect, while Rule 45 of the Rules of Court prescribes petitions for review on certiorari as the remedy for errors of law committed by the appellate court, it does not preclude the availment of Rule 65 in cases of grave abuse of discretion amounting to excess or lack of jurisdiction or denial of due process where Rule 45 does not appear to be a plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, as in the present case.

In Tanenglian v. Lorenzo,[29] we held that while a petition for certiorari is dismissible for being the wrong remedy, there are exceptions to this rule: (a) when public welfare and the advancement of public policy dictates; (b) when the broader interest of justice so requires; (c) when the writs issued are null and void; or (d) when the questioned order amounts to an oppressive exercise of judicial authority. Here, to afford protection to rights of petitioners at the earliest possible time, the petition for certiorari should be allowed to promptly prevent a miscarriage of justice.

The term grave abuse of discretion is well defined in jurisprudence. Grave abuse of discretion means a capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment that is patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law.[30] It is a form of limited review that is only confined to errors of jurisdiction.[31] Sarol v. Spouses Diao[32] instructs that a decision rendered in violation of due process, such as one issued despite improper service of summons, suffers a jurisdictional defect.

The Court, therefore, takes cognizance of, and accepts the present petition for certiorari as the proper remedy to nullify the affirmance of the trial court's dispositions which were rendered without jurisdiction and in violation of the constitutional right to due process of the Ortigas Heirs as well as of their predecessor in interest.

We now resolve the case on the merits.

A petition for annulment of judgment is a remedy in equity which courts view with an attitude of reluctance and one that should not be granted indiscriminately by the Court. It is allowed only in exceptional cases as it is an exception to the time honored doctrine of immutability of final judgments. Since it disregards the time-honored rule of immutability of final judgments, the Rules of Court imposes stringent requirements before a litigant may avail of it.[33] On this score, Section 1 of Rule 47 of the Rules of Civil Procedure provides:

Section 1. Coverage. This Rule shall govern the annulment by the Court of Appeals of judgments or final orders and resolutions in civil actions of Regional Trial Courts for which the ordinary remedies of new trial, appeal petition for relief or other appropriate remedies are no longer available through no fault of the petitioner.

As worded, since an action for annulment of judgment is only a remedy of last resort, it may not be invoked: (1) where the party has availed himself or herself of the remedy of new trial, appeal, petition for relief or other appropriate remedy and lost; or (2) where he or she has failed to avail of those remedies through his or her own fault or negligence.[34]

Further, Section 2 of Rule 47 of the Rules of Court provides the specific grounds for annulment of judgment, which are: 1) extrinsic fraud; and 2) lack of jurisdiction, viz.:

Section 2. Grounds for Annulment. The annulment may be based only on the grounds of extrinsic fraud and lack of jurisdiction.

Extrinsic fraud shall not be a valid ground if it was availed of, or could have been availed of, in a motion for new trial or petition for relief.","ACCORDINGLY, the petition is GRANTED. The Resolutions dated January 25, 2021, October 7, 2021, and February 10, 2022 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 167025 are NULLIFIED and SET ASIDE. The Decision dated June 17, 2020 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 91, Quezon City in Civil Case No. R-QZN-18-10658-CV is declared VOID.

The Register of Deeds of Quezon City is ordered to immediately cause the re-annotation of the deed of real estate mortgage between Jocelyn Ortigas and Spouses Cicero Lumauig and Maria Luz Lumauig on TCT No. 004-2017014143 or any and all of its derivative titles."
"G.R. No. 255308, February 12, 2024","MA. ANACLETA RACHELLE PAGUIRIGAN Y CUETO, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","In 2008, Ma. Anacleta Paguirigan (Anacleta) introduced herself to Elizabeth Delos Triños (Elizabeth) as general manager of AJ Construction and Development Company. Anacleta and Elizabeth then executed a contract to sell over a lot situated in Spud St., East Fairview, Quezon City.[4] The agreement expressly stated that Anacleta was representing the vendor and property owner Alfredo A. Rosanna (Alfredo).[5] Thereafter, Elizabeth tendered PHP 100,000.00 as initial payment to Anacleta. However, the transaction did not materialize because Alfredo changed his mind and sold the property to another person. In 2009, Anacleta and Elizabeth executed another contract to sell covering a different lot located at Winston St., East Fairview, Quezon City. Elizabeth paid PHP 780,000.00 to Anacleta. The sale did not push through again when the bank denied Elizabeth's housing loan application. Later, Elizabeth demanded a refund of the sum of PHP 880,000.00 from Anacleta.[6] Anacleta agreed to return the funds and gave checks to Elizabeth.[7] But the checks that Anacleta issued bounced.[8]

On February 26, 2016, Elizabeth charged Anacleta with two counts of estafa through false pretenses or fraudulent acts under Article 315, paragraph 2(a), of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) before the Regional Trial Court (RTC), to wit:
Criminal Case No. 16-03867

That on or about the 14th day of May, 2008, in Quezon City, Philippines, the said Accused, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously defraud ELIZABETH DELOS TRI[Ñ]OS, represented by Carmelina O. Longakit, in the manner as follows: the said accused, by means of false manifestation and fraudulent representations made to herein complainant to the effect that she is a licensed developer and engaged in real estate business and owner/general manager of AJ Const. & Dev't Co., induced and succeeded in inducing said Complaint to buy a house and lot she is offering for sale with an area of 94 square meter located at Spud St. East Fairview, this City, accused knowing fully well that said manifestations and representations were false and fraudulent, and that said representations were made only for her to obtain the amount of P100,000.00, Philippine Currency, and once in possession thereof accused misappropriated, misapplied and converted the same to her own personal use and benefit, to the damage and prejudice of the said Offended party in the amount aforementioned.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[9] (Emphasis supplied)

Criminal Case No. 16-03868

That on or about the 30th day of April, 2014, in Quezon City, Philippines, the said accused, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously defraud ELIZABETH DELOS TRI[N]OS, represented by Carmelina O. Longakit, in the manner as follows: the said accused, by means of false manifestation and fraudulent representations made to herein complainant to the effect that she is a licensed developer and engaged in real estate business and owner/general manager of AJ Const. & Dev't Co., induced and succeeded in inducing said Complainant to buy a house and lot she is offering for sale, accused knowing fully well that said manifestations and representations were false and fraudulent, and that said representations were made only for her to obtain the amount of P780,000.00 Philippine Currency, and once in possession thereof accused misappropriated, misapplied and converted the same to her own personal use and benefit, to the damage and prejudice of the said Offended party in the amount aforementioned.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[10] (Emphasis supplied)
Anacleta pleaded not guilty.[11] She claimed that she is the owner of AJ Construction and Development. Anacleta recounted that in 2008, Elizabeth approached her and asked if she could sell to Elizabeth a ""lot with house construction."" Anacleta averred that Elizabeth was fully aware that she was representing property owners in the contracts to sell. Anacleta and Elizabeth had two transactions under this business practice. Anacleta admitted that the first transaction did not materialize because the property owner urgently needed money and sold the lot to another buyer for a higher price. She also claimed that the second transaction likewise failed since Elizabeth was not able to secure a housing loan. Elizabeth allegedly only asked for a refund when her family decided to migrate abroad. Anacleta insisted that she issued checks with the instruction to make a deposit only after notice of sufficiency of funds, yet, Elizabeth deposited the checks without her go signal.[12]

On July 20, 2018,[13] the RTC convicted Anacleta in Criminal Case No. 16-03867, holding that the prosecution proved that she falsely pretended to be the owner of the properly under the first contract to sell, resulting in a PHP 100,000.00 pecuniary damage to Elizabeth. Meanwhile, the RTC acquitted Anacleta in Criminal Case No. 16-03868 absent evidence that she falsely claimed ownership of the property subject of the second contract to sell. In both cases, the RTC held Anacleta civilly liable to return the total amount of PHP 780,000.00; thus:
Criminal Case No. 16-03867

In this case, the accused falsely pretended that she [owned] the property she [was] selling located at Spud St., East Fairview, Quezon City... When in truth and in fact, she [did] not own the same. This false representation constituted fraud. It is clear from the testimony of De Los (sic) Tri[ñ]os that she parted with her money because she believed that the accused (sic) [owned] the property she [was] selling. Furthermore, there is no question that the element of damage was established. The prosecution was able to prove and duly admitted by accused, that private complainant gave her as initial payment, P100,000.00

. . . .

Criminal Case No. 16-03868

Nonetheless, unlike the first Contract to Sell which did not push through because accused does not own the property, and the owner demanded a higher price, this Court finds that the prosecution failed to prove all the elements of Estafa in this case for the second Contract to Sell because in this contract, accused did not claim ownership of the property. Accused therefore is entitled to an acquittal. She is however not entirely free from any liability towards private complainant. It has been held that an acquittal based on reasonable doubt that the accused committed the crime charged does not necessarily exempt her from civil liability where a mere preponderance of evidence is required. There is no question that the evidence adduced by the prosecution is preponderant enough to sustain accused'[s] civil liability.

WHEREFORE, in Criminal Case No. 16-03867 accused Ma. Anacleta Paguirigan Rachelle [y] Cueto is found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Estafa under Art. 315 par. 2(a), of the Revised Penal Code and is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of four months and one day of arresto mayor maximum to two years of prision correccional minimum.

As to the civil indemnity, accused is ordered to return the amount of one hundred Thousand Pesos (P100,000.00) to private complainant Elizabeth De Los (sic) Tri[ñ]os. Complainant is entitled to an interest at the legal rate of 6% per annum from the date of finality of this judgment until fully paid.

As for Criminal Case No. 16-03868, for failure of the prosecution to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt, accused Ma. Anacleta Rachelle Paguirigan [y] Cueto is hereby acquitted of the crime charged. She is however found civilly liable and is ordered to return the amount of six hundred eighty Thousand Pesos (P680,000.00) to private complainant Elizabeth De Los (sic) Tri[ñ]os. Complainant is entitled to an interest at the legal rate of 6% per annum from the date or finality of this judgment until fully paid.

SO ORDERED.[14] (Emphasis supplied)
Anacleta elevated the case to the Court of Appeals (CA). Anacleta argued that the trial court reversibly erred in convicting her based on facts not stated in the Information.[15] She pointed out that the Information alleged that she misrepresented herself as a legitimate real estate developer, yet, she was convicted of falsely pretending to be the owner of the property under the first contract to sell. In any event, Anacleta maintained that she was not guilty of any deceit since the first contract to sell disclosed the true owner of the property.[16]

On January 24, 2020, the CA affirmed[17] Anacleta's conviction and ruled that Anacleta falsely represented to Elizabeth that she had the power to transfer ownership of the lot.[18] The CA explained that there was no violation of the accused's right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against her because the offense proved was included in the offense charged, to wit:
The foregoing elements of estafa by deceit are present in this case. Ma. Anacleta falsely represented to Elizabeth that she had the power and intent to effect the transfer of the subject lot to private complainant and build a house thereon. Accused-appellant even presented documents to Elizabeth such as floor plans and computations of expenses to convince private complainant to proceed with the house construction. She asked Elizabeth to submit the needed documents for the processing of the housing loan and building permit. As a result of these false misrepresentations, Elizabeth gave P100,000.00 simultaneously with the execution of the first Contract to Sell. She also paid the 30% agreed ""equity"" amounting to P780,000.00.

. . . .

Further highlighting Ma. Anacleta's deceit was her continuous receipt of payments from Elizabeth despite knowledge that she could no longer sell the subject property to private complainant...

. . . .

The fact that the Contract to Sell stated that Ma. Anacleta was representing the vendor, Alfredo A. Rosanna (Alfredo), would not negate a finding of guilt against accused-appellant. Notably, Ma. Anacleta failed to adduce the Special Power of Attorney from Alfredo which could have proved that she has the authority to sell the subject property on behalf of the real owner. As earlier discussed at length, Ma. Anacleta concealed to Elizabeth the uncertainties regarding her authority to sell the subject property.",The integral components of a crime must be sufficiently alleged in the information and established during trial with proof beyond reasonable doubt. The required rule on allegation and proof cannot be restricted to the essential elements of an offense but should extend to the material facts constitutive of the crime.[1] Any doubt in the allegations on the information shall be construed against the State and in favor of the accused who is presumed to have no independent knowledge of the facts that constitute the offense.[2] The strict construction is not to enable a guilty person to escape punishment through technicalities but stems rather from the solemn duty of the courts to protect and give life to the constitutional rights of the accused.[3],"The accused's constitutional right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against them mandates the prosecution to set out in the information every element of the crime.[26] The principal objective of the rule is to avoid surprise on the part of the accused and to afford them the opportunity to suitably prepare their defense.[27] No matter how conclusive and convincing the evidence of guilt may be, the accused cannot be convicted of any crime unless it is clearly charged in the information for which they are tried.[28] The main purpose of an information is to ensure that the accused are formally abreast of the facts and the acts constituting the offense charged.[29] The Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure is explicit that an information is sufficient if it states ""the acts or omissions complained of as constituting the offense""[30] in terms sufficient to enable persons of common understanding to know the charge against them and for the court to pronounce judgment.[31] The test is ""whether the crime is described in intelligible terms with such particularity as to apprise the accused, with reasonable certainty, of the offense charged.""[32] The actual recital of facts in the information determines the real nature and character of the criminal charge.[33] The alleged acts constitutive of the offense charged are substantial matters and the right of the accused to question their conviction based on facts not alleged in the information cannot be waived.[34]

In this case, the actual recital of facts in the Information conflicts with the prosecution evidence. It is undisputed that the prosecution charged Anacleta with estafa through false pretenses or fraudulent acts under Article 315, paragraph 2(a), of the RPC. What the prosecution alleged as facts constituting the crime charged are that Anacleta pretended to be a ""licensed developer... engaged in real estate business"" and that she ""induced and succeeded in inducing [Elizabeth] to buy a house and lot she is offering for sale.""[35] Yet, the CA and the RTC convicted Anacleta based on the factual findings that she ""falsely pretended that she owns the property she is selling"" and that she misrepresented her ""power and intent to effect the transfer of the subject property.""[36] These factual matters are not in the Information. To convict Anacleta of acts not alleged in the Information while she is concentrating her defense against the narrated facts would be plainly unfair and underhanded. The rule is that a variance between the allegation in the information and proof adduced during trial shall be fatal to the criminal case if it is material and prejudicial to the accused so much so that it affects their substantial rights.[37] Clearly, Anacleta was denied of her constitutional right to be fully apprised of the charge against her, which would have allowed her to suitably prepare a defense. The factual matters not found in the Information, which the prosecution tried to prove, confused Anacleta as to the nature and cause of the accusation against her.

Contrary to the CA's[38] ratiocination, the ""variance doctrine"" is inapplicable. Rule 120, Sections 4 and 5 of the Rules of Court provide the rule in case of conflict between allegation and proof, to wit:
Section 4. Judgment in case of variance between allegation and proof. — When there is variance between the offense charged in the complaint or information and that proved, and the offense as charged is included in or necessarily includes the offense proved, the accused shall be convicted of the offense proved which is included in the offense charged, or of the offense charged which is included in the offense proved.

Section 5. When an offense includes or is included in another. — An offense charged necessarily includes the offense proved when some of the essential elements or ingredients of the former, as alleged in the complaint or information, constitute the latter. And an offense charged is necessarily included in the offense proved, when the essential ingredients of the former constitute or form part of those constituting the latter.
Notably, the variance doctrine allows the conviction of the accused for an offense ""which is different from but necessarily included in the crime charged.""[39] For instance, in Sevilla v. People,[40] the Court upheld the conviction of the accused for falsification of public document through reckless imprudence notwithstanding that the charge against him in the information was for the intentional felony of falsification of public document. In Osorio v. People,[41] the Court held that the crime of other deceits is necessarily included in estafa by means of deceit. In People v. Adajar,[42] the Court convicted the accused of the lesser crime of acts of lasciviousness because it is included in the offense of sexual assault. In People v. Ursua,[43] the accused was convicted of sexual abuse, which was held to be necessarily included in rape by sexual intercourse. In People v. Hong Yen E,[44] the Court ruled that illegal possession is an element of and is necessarily included in illegal sale of dangerous drugs. In Guillergan v. People,[45] the Court declared that falsification of documents committed by public officers who take advantage of their official position necessarily includes the falsification of commercial documents by private persons. The offenses proved in these cases are considered subsumed in the crimes charged. The accused are effectively being held liable for the offenses as precisely charged in the information. Hence, it could not be claimed that there was a violation of the constitutional right of the accused to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against them.

The present case is far different. As intimated earlier, the prosecution accused Anacleta with estafa through false pretenses or fraudulent acts under Article 315, paragraph 2(a), of the RPC.[46] Yet, the CA and the RTC did not discuss another offense which is distinct from, but necessarily included in, the crime charged. There is no variance between the offense charged and the crime proved. Instead, the difference pertains to the alleged acts in regard to the proven facts constitutive of the elements of estafa through false pretenses or fraudulent acts. To reiterate, the CA and the RTC held Anacleta liable for the crime charged because of her alleged false pretensions as to the ownership and power to sell the property[47]even if the Information averred the different constitutive act of misrepresenting her engagement in legitimate real estate and construction business.[48] Obviously, there is a tragic gap between the prosecution's theory and evidence, which prompted it to prove facts not alleged in the Information. In this circumstance, the variance doctrine cannot be conveniently invoked to fill the lacuna or cure the weakness and inadequacy of the prosecution evidence. The courts should not allow a rule of procedure to triumph over the constitutional rights of the accused to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation and to be presumed innocent. Without these guarantees, the right to liberty can prove meaningless and due process will only be an empty slogan.[49]

At any rate, the prosecution failed to meet the required moral certainty to sustain the conviction of the accused for the crime charged. The requisites of estafa through false pretenses or fraudulent acts under Article 315, paragraph 2(a), of the RPC are the following:
(1) The accused used fictitious name or false pretense that he possesses (a) power, (b) influence, (c) qualifications, (d) property, (e) credit, (f) agency, (g) business or (h) imaginary transaction, or other similar deceits;

(2) The accused used such deceitful means prior to or simultaneous with the execution of the fraud;

(3) The offended party relied on such deceitful means to part with his money or property; and

(4) The offended party suffered damage.[50]","ACCORDINGLY, the petition is GRANTED. The Decision elated January 24, 2020 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 42175 is REVERSED. Petitioner Ma.

In Criminal Case No. 44965-03, Rubirosa M. Ciocon (Rubirosa) and her alleged paramour, Valencia, were charged with adultery, viz.:[4]
That on or about 9:00 o'clock in the evening of December 2001 and sometime before and thereafter [in] General Santos City, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, said Rubirosa Ciocon, being then united in wedlock with the Private Complainant Ramon Chito A. Ciocon, did then and there wil[l]fully, unlawfully and feloniously have sexual intercourse with Michael [A.] Valencia[,] who is not her husband and her co-accused Michael [A.] Valencia, did then and there wil[l]fully, unlawfully and feloniously had carnal knowledge of her, knowing her to be married.[5]
On arraignment, Valencia pleaded not guilty to the charge against him.[6] Rubirosa remained at large.[7]

Prosecution's Version

Ramon Chito T. Ciocon (Ramon) testified that he married Rubirosa on August 19, 1991,[8] and that he is the father of Emmanuel Job Ciocon, Angelica Ciocon, Dane Ciocon, and Monaby Faith R. Ciocon (Monaby).[9] He was frequently out of the country, working as a 3rd engineer-seaman on a Japanese ship.[10] His wife, Rubirosa, operated a karinderya on Leon Llido Street, Lagao, General Santos City. She introduced Valencia to him as a customer of the karinderya. He later found out that his wife and Valencia were in a relationship.[11]

Every time he called home from abroad, it was his mother who answered the phone. The latter told him that ""there is something wrong with his family"" and that ""he has to go home"".[12] In August 2002, he went home to investigate and see for himself what was happening with his family.[13] It was only when he arrived that he discovered that his family left their house on Leon Llido Street, Countryside Subdivision, General Santos City to reside at Summerlight Subdivision, Polomolok, South Cotabato.[14] Subsequently, his daughter, Monaby, informed him that Rubirosa was living in the same house with Valencia.

He noticed that Rubirosa was uneasy whenever they were together. When he asked her what was going on, she cried and admitted that she was living with Valencia as they were in a relationship. Rubirosa admitted to loving Valencia and eventually left Ramon and his family.[15] Ever since, he no longer knew the whereabouts of Rubirosa.[16]

According to Ramon, the unfaithfulness of Rubirosa ""was very painful"" and ""insulted his manhood.""[17] He filed the case against Rubirosa and Valencia so that they could ""pay for their sins and be imprisoned.""[18]

Monaby identified Valencia in open court and testified that she is the daughter of Rubirosa and Ramon.[19] She observed that Valencia and Rubirosa were always together and that they were ""lovey dovey and sweet,""[20] always hugging and kissing one another.[21]

When she was 8 years old, her family lived in a house at Countryside Subdivision. She and her siblings slept in the living room and noticed that Valencia was on the second floor and did not come down.[22] Out of curiosity, she went up to check on her mother. She opened the unlocked door, and in the illuminated room, she saw Rubirosa and Valencia together in bed, hugging and kissing each other.[23] When Rubirosa saw her, she got angry and shooed her away. After the incident, she chose to keep quiet because she was afraid of her mother.[24]

Monaby testified that Rubirosa and Valencia usually slept together in their house, although she could not tell if they were wearing undergarments, since they were always covered by a blanket. Every time she would see Valencia and her mother, the latter would get angry and tell her to get out of the room.[25]
 
When they moved to the house at Summerlight Subdivision, Monaby said that Rubirosa and Valencia continued to hug and kiss each other.[26] More, she saw Rubirosa and Valencia naked in the bedroom.[27] When she went to get the clothes of her brother, she saw Rubirosa on top of Valencia. As soon as she was able to retrieve her brother's clothes she left out of shock and fear.[28]

She recalled that her father Ramon went to Polomolok, South Cotabato ""to patch things up"" but Rubirosa refused to live with him.[29] Rubirosa then left, and they no longer had any information on her whereabouts.[30]","This Petition[1] assails the following dispositions of the Court of Appeals in CA G.R. CR No. 01715 titled People of the Philippines v. Michael Valencia:
Resolution[2] dated October 10, 2018, affirming the conviction of petitioner Michael G. Valencia (Valencia) for adultery under Article 333 of the Revised Penal Code; and

Resolution[3] dated January 15, 2019 denying his Motion for Reconsideration.","Preliminarily, we find that the Court of Appeals did not err in dismissing Valencia's appeal solely on procedural grounds. Rule 42, Section 3 of the Rules of Court clearly states the consequence of noncompliance with the prescribed procedure:
SECTION 3. Effect of failure to comply with requirements. — The failure of the petitioner to comply with any of the foregoing requirements regarding the payment of the docket and other lawful fees, the deposit for costs, proof of service of the petition, and the contents of and the documents which should accompany the petition shall be sufficient ground for the dismissal thereof.
Although Valencia has shown that the Court of Appeals should have deemed the docket fees paid based on the Certification[67] dated February 8, 2019 issued by the Development Bank of the Philippines, the four other procedural infirmities observed by the Court of Appeals remain unexplained and unrectified. As such, Valencia's perfunctory invocation of ""the interest of justice""[68] cannot prevail against his repeated noncompliance with procedural rules. D.M. Wenceslao and Associates, Inc. v. City of Paranaque[69] is in point:
[P]rocedural rules are not to be belittled or dismissed simply because their non-observance may have prejudiced a party's substantive rights. Like all rules, they are required to be followed except only for the most persuasive of reasons when they may be relaxed.[70]
Further, a petition for review on certiorari is narrowly confined to any of these two grounds: i.e., (a) when the court a quo has decided a question of substance, not theretofore determined by the Supreme Court, or has decided it in a way probably not in accord with law or with the applicable decisions of the Supreme Court; or (b) when the court a quo has so far departed from the accepted and usual course of judicial proceedings, or so far sanctioned such departure by a lower court, as to call for an exercise of the power of supervision.[71]

Absent any of these grounds cited or shown in the petition, there is no special reason to warrant the exercise of the Court's discretionary appellate jurisdiction here. To stress, the present Petition is a mere reiteration of the arguments already raised and passed upon in full by the MTCC and the RTC, and which were not considered by the Court of Appeals due to Valencia's own procedural lapses. Verily, the Petition should be denied outright.

In any event, whether Valencia committed the adulterous act of engaging in sexual intercourse with a married woman not his wife, as narrated no less by Monaby, Rubirosa's own minor daughter and whether the offended husband has pardoned his unfaithful wife, are both pure questions of fact beyond the cognizance of the Court via Rule 45.[72]

Relatedly, when the issue is one of credibility of witnesses, the Court will generally not disturb the trial courts' factual findings.[73] Indeed, trial courts are in a better position to decide the question as it heard the witnesses themselves and observed their deportment and manner of testifying during the trial. Here, both the MTCC and RTC found minor Monaby's testimony credible.[74] Valencia has not adduced any convincing reason for the Court to depart from said findings.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DISMISSED and the assailed Resolutions of the Court of Appeals dated October 10, 2018 and January 15, 2019 in CA G.R. CR No. 01715 are AFFIRMED.

In Criminal Case No. 44965-03, petitioner Michael G. Valencia is CONVICTED of adultery under Article 333 of the Revised Penal Code. He is sentenced to prision correccional in its medium period or imprisonment for two years, four months, and one day to four years, and two months."
" G.R. No. 250296, February 12, 2024","REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, REPRESENTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS AND HIGHWAYS (DPWH), PETITIONER, VS. A.D. GONZALES, JR. CONSTRUCTION AND TRADING COMPANY, INC., RESPONDENT.","The case stemmed from a Complaint for collection of sum of money with damages filed by A.D. Gonzales, Jr. Construction and Trading Company, Inc. (Gonzales Construction) against the DPWH. Gonzales Construction claimed that it entered into two contracts with DPWH for the following: (1) Rehabilitation of Gumain-Porac Division Channel, Sta. 5+800 to Sta. 6+100 in the amount of PHP 2,695,980.00 (Gumain Project); and (2) Abacan River Control Cut-Off Channel along Manggahan Sto. Rosario, Mexico, Pampanga, Sta. 17+500 to Sta. 18+033 in the amount of PHP 8,174,294.32 (Abacan Project).[6]

The Gumain Project was signed by Aurelio Gonzales, Jr. (Gonzales) for the Gonzales Construction and by the District Engineer, Angelita M. Twaño of the Office of the Regional Director of DPWH, and was submitted to the regional director for his signature. On the other hand, the Abacan Project was signed by Gonzales and was submitted to the Regional Director of DPWH for signature.[7]

Gonzales Construction alleged that it performed its undertakings and submitted to the DPWH the corresponding documents to prove the projects' completion. Moreover, the projects were duly inspected and verified as to the work accomplished and were found to be in accordance with the plans and specifications and special provisions of the contracts. Despite completion of the two projects, only PHP 1,178,252.42 was paid representing partial payment for the Abacan Project, leaving an unpaid amount of PHP 9,692,021.92 for the two projects. The last demand for payment was made on March 26, 1999.[8]

Hence, Gonzales Construction filed its Complaint for sum of money before the RTC and to support it, presented the following witnesses: (a) Remedios P. Soto, State Auditor IV of Commission on Audit; (b) Aurelio Gonzales, Jr. (Gonzales), President of Gonzales Construction; (c) Engineer Jesus O. Obordo (Engr. Obordo), then the assistant chief of the Construction Division, Region III, DPWH.[9] It also offered several documentary evidence.[10]

For their defense, DPWH raised special and affirmative defenses: (1) DPWH, being an unincorporated agency of the State, cannot be sued without its consent which the State has not given; (2) the subject contracts were void because no certification was issued that funds had been duly appropriated for the said projects as required by Presidential Decree No. 1445,[11] otherwise known as the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines; (3) the subject contracts were not signed by the Regional Director nor by the DPWH secretary; and (4) the Complaint was premature because Gonzales Construction failed to exhaust administrative remedies.[12] Notably, DPWH did not present any evidence.[13]","Assailed in this Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court are the Decision[2] dated January 31, 2019 and the Resolution[3] dated November 5, 2019 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 105103, which denied the appeal filed by petitioner Republic of the Philippines, represented by the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH). The CA, in turn, affirmed with modification the Decision[4] dated July 17, 2014, and the Order dated April 1, 2014[5] of Branch 46, Regional Trial Court of San Fernando City, Pampanga (RTC) by deleting the award of attorney's fees and costs of suit; maintaining the award of PHP 5,364,086.35; and adding an interest rate of 6% percent per annum from the finality of the decision until full payment.","The petition is denied.

Under Commonwealth Act No. 327,[41] as amended by Section 26 of Presidential Decree No. 1445,[42] it is the COA which has primary jurisdiction over money claims against government agencies and instrumentalities, to wit:
Section 26. General jurisdiction. — The authority and powers of the Commission shall extend to and comprehend all matters relating to auditing procedures, systems and controls, the keeping of the general accounts of the Government, the preservation of vouchers pertaining thereto for a period of ten years, the examination and inspection of the books, records, and papers relating to those accounts; and the audit and settlement of the accounts of all persons respecting funds or property received or held by them in an accountable capacity, as well as the examination, audit, and settlement of all debts and claims of any sort due from or owing to the Government or any of its subdivisions, agencies and instrumentalities. The said jurisdiction extends to all government-owned or controlled corporations, including their subsidiaries, and other self-governing boards, commissions, or agencies of the Government, and as herein prescribed, including non­-governmental entities subsidized by the government, those funded by donations through the government, those required to pay levies or government share, and those for which the government has put up a counterpart fund or those partly funded by the government. (Emphasis supplied)
It was explained in Metropolitan Manila Development Authority v. D.M Consunji, Inc.[43] that the COA has jurisdiction over money claims against a government agency based on quantum meruit.

The foregoing notwithstanding, the Court, in the interest of judicial economy, deems it prudent to nevertheless rule on the merits of this case. In addition, it will not serve the ends of justice if the Court will allow this case to go unresolved for an inordinate amount of time.[44] To be sure, this course of action is justified, as may be gleaned from RG Cabrera Corporation, Inc. v. DPWH.[45]

Similar to this case, RG Cabrera Corporation also involved the rehabilitation projects of the government dealing with the aftermath of Mt. Pinatubo's eruption. In that case, the DPWH entered into several contracts of lease of equipment with therein petitioner for the maintenance and restoration of portions of the Porac-Gumain Diversion Channel System. At the end of the lease contract, therein petitioner sought to collect the agreed rentals, but the DPWH did not pay; hence, the former filed several complaints for collection of sum of money before a trial court which was granted, but was reversed by the CA. The Court affirmed the CA ruling considering that it was the COA which has jurisdiction over money claims against the government. Thereafter, RG Cabrera filed the said money claims before the COA but was denied for lack of a prior certification as to the availability of the necessary funds based on Sections 86 and 87 of Presidential Decree No. 1445. The Court reversed the COA and granted the money claims. It held that while the existence of appropriation and the attachment to the contract of the certification showing availability of funds are conditions sine qua non for the execution of government contracts, the absence thereof, however, does not necessarily mean that the contractor is precluded from receiving payment for the services rendered. Citing Quiwa,[46] which the Court found to be on all fours in therein case, the Court held that the lack of certification of availability of funds does not bar a contractor from recovering the fees stipulated in the contract.[47]

Further, the Court explained that the subject lease contracts are not intrinsically illegal, but rather, were merely declared to be so under Presidential Decree No. 1445 for lack of the necessary certification. Nevertheless, it would be an injustice to deny therein petitioner the payment for the use of its heavy equipment, which benefited the public, solely on the ground of the procedural flaws in the contracts.[48]

Applying RG Cabrera Corporation and Quiwa here, Gonzales Construction should be paid what is due to them; otherwise, this would amount to unjust enrichment to the State at the expense of Gonzales Construction, which this Court cannot countenance.

The DPWH, however, argues that Gonzales Construction failed to present convincing evidence that it had accomplished 90.61 % of the Abacan Project to be entitled for payment.

It must be stressed that a review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court is limited to reviewing questions of law, subject to this Court's discretion and other exceptions recognized in case law.[49] The Court finds that these reasons are not present in this case to review the uniform findings of fact of the RTC and the CA. As a general rule, the factual findings of the trial court, when affirmed by the appellate court, attain conclusiveness and are given utmost respect by this Court.[50] Here, the RTC found that 90.61% of the Abacan Project was accomplished and the value of the completed works evaluated in the amount of PHP 7,332,292.45. The CA affirmed that 90.61% of the Abacan Project was accomplished after evaluating on its own the pieces of evidence submitted by Gonzales Construction, while DPWH did not present evidence to the contrary. Hence, this Court will not disturb the factual findings of the RTC and the CA.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DENIED. The Decision dated January 31, 2019 and the Resolution dated November 5, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 105103 are hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. The award of PHP 5,364,086.35 shall earn interest at the rate of 6% per annum from July 17, 2014 until full payment."
"G.R. No. 228490, February 12, 2024 ","HEIRS OF ELIAS SOLANO & GLECERIA FALABI SOLANO, PETITIONERS, VS. PASCUAL T. DY, RESPONDENT.","Elias Solano (Elias) owned two parcels of land—Lot 1-A-32 with an area of 7,351 square meters (sqm), and Lot 1-A-25 consisting of 2,284 sqm, covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) Nos. 230[8] and 232,[9] respectively. The properties are situated at Barrio Triangulo, Naga City, Camarines Sur and were acquired by Elias as a farmer beneficiary, under Emancipation Patent Nos. A-109074 and A-109076.

Sometime in December 1999, spouses Solano obtained a PHP 100,000.00 loan, payable within three months, from spouses Samson. As a condition for the release of the proceeds, Elias executed a Special Power of Attorney[10] (SPA) dated December 3, 1999 in favor of Merle Samson (Merle) over Lot 1-A-32. Elias's wife Gleceria Solano (Gleceria) gave her marital consent and signed the SPA. In addition, spouses Solano executed a Deed of Sale with Right to Repurchase dated December 1999. When spouses Solano failed to pay the loan within the stipulated period, they got another PHP 150,000.00 loan and surrendered the owner's duplicate copy of TCT No. 230 to Merle.

A few months later, spouses Solano sold Lot 1-A-25 to spouses Samson for PHP 100,000.00 as shown in the Deed of Absolute Sale[11] dated April 6, 2000.

On April 15, 2000, by virtue of the SPA dated December 3, 1999 granted to her by Elias, Merle sold Lot 1-A-32 to Pascual Dy (Dy) in the amount of PHP 500,000.00 through a Deed of Absolute Sale with Right to Repurchase.[12]

Subsequently, on December 20, 2001, Merle also sold Lot 1-A-25 to Dy for the amount of PHP 500,000.00 via a Deed of Absolute Sale.[13] Merle gave the owner's duplicate copy of TCT No. 232 to Dy without effecting the registration of the previous sale of Lot 1-A-25 between her and spouses Solano.[14]

Several years later, on January 3, 2008, Dy filed Civil Case No. RTC 2008-0001, which is a Complaint[15] for specific performance against spouses Samson and spouses Solano with the RTC of Naga City, Branch 22 (RTC-Branch 22). Dy claimed that he failed to have the deeds of conveyance for the two properties notarized and registered because he misplaced the following documents: (1) the owner's duplicate copy of TCT No. 230 for Lot 1-A-32; (2) the Deed of Sale with Right to Repurchase dated April 15, 2000 for Lot 1-A-32; and (3) the Special Power of Attorney dated December 3, 1999 for Lot 1-A-32.[16] The delay in the registration was compounded by the failure of spouses Samson and spouses Solano to raise the funds to repurchase Lot 1-A-32. When he found the missing documents, Dy decided to transfer the titles of the lots in his name. However, both spouses refused to sign new notarized deeds of sale in his favor. Dy thus prayed that defendants-spouses be ordered to execute deeds of conveyance to allow him to register Lot 1-A-32 and Lot 1-A-25 in his name.[17]

In their Answer with Counterclaim,[18] spouses Solano countered that they did not intend to sell their properties to spouses Samson. They obtained loans from spouses Samson but clarified that the documents were solely prepared by Merle. Spouses Solano did not understand the contents of the documents which were written in English given that Gleceria only reached Grade 3 and Elias was a Grade 6 dropout. They were in dire need of money and Merle Samson tricked them into signing the following: (1) SPA dated December 3, 1999 for Lot 1-A-32; (2) Deed of Sale with Right to Repurchase dated December 1999 for Lot 1-A-32; and (3) Deed of Absolute Sale dated April 6, 2000 for Lot 1-A-25. Spouses Solano stressed that they are still in actual possession of the lots in the concept of owners, and spouses Samson never attempted to register the same under their names. Spouses Solano tried to settle their loan obligation in the amount of PHP 300,000.00, but Merle refused to accept the payment. Consequently, spouses Solano instituted Civil Case No. 2003-0150, which is an action for ""Revocation and Cancellation of the Deeds of Sale and SPA""[19] with damages against spouses Samson before the RTC of Naga City, Branch 21 (RTC-Branch 21). During the trial, Merle did not disclose that she already sold the properties to Dy. It was only in the execution stage that Merle admitted that the TCTs could not be returned to spouses Solano because she gave the titles to Dy on account of the subsequent sale.[20]

As special affirmative defense, spouses Solano stated that Dy has no cause of action against them. They were not privy to the transactions between Dy and spouses Samson involving the two properties. They maintained that the subsequent sales were not registered nor annotated in the certificates of title. In addition, spouses Solano maintained that the deeds of sale they supposedly executed in favor of Merle are actually equitable mortgages. For this reason, Merle could not validly use the documents they signed to sell the properties to Dy. As counterclaim, spouses Solano prayed for the award of PHP 100,000.00 for moral damages, PHP 50,000.00 for exemplary damages, PHP 50,000.00 for attorney's fees, PHP 1,500.00 for each court appearance, and PHP 20,000.00 for litigation expenses.[21]

In his Reply,[22] Dy argued that spouses Solano could not deny the authority they gave to spouses Samson to sell and mortgage the lots. Dy pointed out that even in Civil Case No. 2003-0150, the trial court rejected spouses Solano's prayer for revocation or nullification of the SPA for Lot 1-A-32 in view of their admission that they voluntarily signed the documents when they obtained the loan.[23]","No person shall be affected by a proceeding in which he is a stranger.[1] We observe this jurisprudential dictum in resolving the present appeals.
The Case

Before the Court are consolidated Petitions for Review on Certiorari: G.R. No. 228490[2] filed by the heirs of spouses Elias and Gleceria Solano and G.R. No. 228645[3] filed by the heirs of Pascual T. Dy, both questioning the Decision[4] dated April 8, 2016 and Resolution[5] dated November 28, 2016 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 103451, which modified the Decision[6] dated June 17, 2014 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Naga City, Branch 22 in Civil Case No. RTC 2008-0001, involving a Complaint[7] for specific performance filed by Pascual T. Dy (Dy) against spouses Renato and Merle Samson (spouses Samson) and spouses Elias and Gleceria Solano (spouses Solano).","The Court partially grants G.R. No. 228490 and G.R. No. 228645.

To serve as a goalpost, we state at the outset that the Decision dated February 2, 2007 of the RTC-Branch 21 in Civil Case No. 2003-0150 is final and executory. Inevitably, the RTC's declaration that the transactions between the Solanos and the Samsons are equitable mortgages may no longer be altered following the doctrine of immutability of final judgment.

Relying on RTC-Branch 21's final Decision, the Solanos now invoke the principle of res judicata in arguing that the heirs of Dy can no longer assert any claim over the properties that are the subject of the equitable mortgages.

There are two concepts of res judicata. The first kind is res judicata through bar by prior judgment[53] wherein there is identity of parties, subject matter, and causes of action. In the second one which is res judicata by conclusiveness of judgment,[54] there is only identity of parties and subject matter or issues. Considering that there is no identity of causes of action in res judicata by conclusiveness of judgment, the final ruling is conclusive only as to those matters directly controverted and determined in the first case.[55]

Consequently, there is res judicata by conclusiveness of judgment when the following elements are present: (1) the judgment sought to bar the new action must be final; (2) the decision must have been rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties; (3) the disposition of the case must be a judgment on the merits; and (4) there must be identity of parties and issues as between the first and second action, but not identity of causes of action.[56]

There is no question that the first, second, and third elements are present in this case. First, the RTC-Branch 21 decision is final and executory there being no appeal taken within the reglementary period. Second, the RTC had jurisdiction over the case, the subject matter, and the parties. Third, the RTC's judgment was rendered based on the merits.

Our task then is to determine the existence of the fourth element, which is the identity of parties and issues.

With regard to the similarity of parties, the Court explained in PD No. 1271 Committee v. De Guzman[57] that the parties in the two cases need not be identical provided that they substantially share the same interest. It is enough that there is privity between the party in the first case and in the second case, like when a successor-in-interest or an heir participates in the second case.[58]

There is identity of parties in the present controversy. In the first case decided by RTC-Branch 21, spouses Solano were the plaintiffs while spouses Samson were the defendants. In the second case decided by RTC-Branch 22, Dy was the plaintiff while spouses Solano and spouses Samson were impleaded as co-defendants. Although the parties are not strictly identical, there is substantial identity. Substantial identity of parties exists when there is a community of interest between a party in the first case and a party in the second case.[59] As stressed in Development Bank of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals[60] and Republic v. Court of Appeals,[61] absolute identity is not required:

For purposes of res judicata, only substantial identity is required and not absolute identity. Parties in both cases need not be physically identical provided that there is privity between the parties or their successors-in-interest subsequent to the commencement of the previous cause of action, litigating for the same thing, title[,] or capacity.[62] (Emphasis supplied)","ACCORDINGLY, the petition in G.R. No. 228490 filed by the heirs of spouses Elias and Gleceria Falabi Solano and the petition in G.R. No. 228645 filed by the heirs of Pascual T. Dy are PARTLY GRANTED. The Decision dated April 8, 2016 and Resolution dated November 28, 2016 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 103451, which modified the Decision dated June 17, 2014 of Branch 22, Regional Trial Court of Naga City in Civil Case No. RTC 2008-0001, are REVERSED.

As discussed above, the final judgment of Branch 21, Regional Trial Court of Naga City in Civil Case No. 2003-0150, which declared the Deed of Sale with Right to Repurchase dated December 1999 and the Deed of Absolute Sale dated April 6, 2000 between spouses Elias and Gleceria Falabi Solano and spouses Renato and Merle Samson, as equitable mortgages STANDS. The Court further decrees that:

(1) Spouses Elias and Gleceria Falabi Solano/heirs are entitled to repurchase the mortgaged properties described as Lot 1-A-32 covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 230, and Lot No. 1-A-25 covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 232. For this purpose, they are ORDERED to pay the principal mortgaged debt to Pascual Dy/heirs, in the total amount of PHP 300,000.00, with interest at the legal rate of 12% per annum, from January 15, 2009 until June 30, 2013, and 6% per annum from July 1, 2013 until full payment. The payment shall be made by spouses Solano/heirs within 30 days from finality of this Decision. Otherwise, Pascual Dy/heirs may initiate the proper judicial foreclosure proceedings.

(2) Meanwhile, to comply with the final judgment in Civil Case No. 2003-0150, Pascual Dy/heirs are ORDERED to deposit/surrender Transfer Certificate of Title Nos. 230 and 232 covering Lots 1-A-32 and 1-A-25 to the Clerk of Court of Branch 21, Regional Trial Court of Naga City.

(3) In case of a timely repurchase by spouses Solano/heirs, to prevent unjust enrichment, spouses Renato and Merle Samson/heirs are ORDERED to return to Pascual Dy/heirs the total amount of PHP 700,000.00, plus interest at the rate of 12% per annum from January 3, 2008 until June 30, 2013, and 6% per annum from July 1, 2013 until full payment."

The said Information is based on the Resolution[7] of even date of the Office of the City Prosecutor (OCP) of Pasay City, which is as follows:","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] that assails both the Decision[2] dated November 10, 2020 and the Resolution[3] dated October 8, 2021 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR No. 43208. Said rulings of the CA affirmed the Decision[4] dated March 13, 2019 of Branch 108, Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Pasay City in Criminal Case No. R-PSY-18-15642-CR, which convicted Mark Anthony Pagtakhan y Flores (petitioner) of the crime of robbery as penalized under Article 293, in relation to Article 294, Paragraph 5 of Act No. 3815, otherwise known as the Revised Penal Code.","The instant Petition is impressed with merit, and accordingly, petitioner is entitled to an acquittal.

Preliminarily, the Court is mindful of various exceptions to the general rule that petitions for review on certiorari are properly limited to the Court's review of errors of law, and indeed, the findings of fact of trial and appellate courts below relative to the antecedents of such petitions are deemed conclusive. The Court enumerated the said exceptions in Fuentes v. Court of Appeals,[29] viz.:

(1) [W]hen the factual findings of the Court of Appeals and the trial court are contradictory;

(2) [W]hen the findings are grounded entirely on speculation, surmises, or conjectures;

(3) [W]hen the inference made by the Court of Appeals from its findings of fact is manifestly mistaken, absurd, or impossible;

(4) [W]hen there is grave abuse of discretion in the appreciation of facts;

(5) [W]hen the appellate court, in making its findings, goes beyond the issues of the case, and such findings are contradictory to the admissions of both appellant and appellee;

(6) [W]hen the judgment of the Court of Appeals is premised on a misapprehension of facts;

(7) [W]hen the Court of Appeals fails to notice certain relevant facts which, if properly considered, will justify a different conclusion;

(8) [W]hen the findings of fact are themselves conflicting;

(9) [W]hen the findings of fact are conclusions without citation of the specific evidence on which they are based; and

(10) [W]hen the findings of fact of the Court of Appeals are premised on the absence of evidence but such findings are contradicted by the evidence on record.[30] (Emphases supplied)

Moreover, the Court reiterated in Macayan, Jr. v. People[31] the aforementioned enumeration, which also cited the admonition in People v. Esteban[32] when it comes to reviewing findings of fact in criminal cases, to wit:

It is well-settled that, in criminal cases, factual findings of the trial court are generally accorded great weight and respect on appeal, especially when such findings are supported by substantial [sic] evidence on record. It is only in exceptional circumstances, such as when the trial court overlooked material and relevant matters, that this Court will re-calibrate and evaluate the findings of the trial court below.[33]

Verily then, the issue of herein private complainant's out-of-court identification of petitioner as the perpetrator of the robbery—which is the fulcrum upon which the ultimate determination of his guilt rests due to the absence of any other evidence presented at trial below—is a question of fact that is cognizable by the Court as an exception, especially if the same was not appreciated or not properly considered by either the trial or the appellate court.","ACCORDINGLY, the instant Petition for Review on Certiorari is hereby GRANTED. The Decision dated November 10, 2020 and the Resolution dated October 8, 2021 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 43208, as well as the Decision dated March 13, 2019 of Branch 108, Regional Trial Court of Pasay City vis-à-vis Criminal Case No. R-PSY-18-15642-CR, are all hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. For failure on the part of the prosecution to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt, petitioner Mark Anthony Pagtakhan y Flores is hereby ACQUITTED of the crime charged, and is also hereby ORDERED to be IMMEDIATELY RELEASED from confinement if he is still so detained, unless he is being held for other lawful cause. Any amount paid by way of bail bond is thus also ORDERED to be IMMEDIATELY RETURNED to petitioner Mark Anthony Pagtakhan y Flores.

Let entry of judgment be issued immediately."
"A.C. No. 12353, February 06, 2024","MELODY H. SANTOS, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. EMILIO S. PAÑA, JR., RESPONDENT.","Melody alleged that in 2013, she needed assistance for the declaration of the nullity of her marriage.[3] Hence, she was introduced by a friend of her cousin's wife to one Alberto Santos (Santos).[4] Santos was a court interpreter in Branch 39 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Polomolok, South Cotabato, who allegedly knew a lawyer who could help her obtain a quick nullity of marriage.[5] This lawyer turned out to be Atty. Paña.[6]

Purportedly, Santos, and Atty. Paña claimed that they could obtain a decree of nullity of marriage for Melody within a period of six months, together with the relevant documents from the National Statistics Office (NSO).[7] For their services, Melody paid PHP 280,000.00.[8]

Melody claimed that Atty. Paña eventually provided her with copies of a Judgment dated March 18, 2010 appearing to be issued by Judge Cader P. Indar, al Haj (Judge Indar) of Branch 15 of RTC Cotabato City.[9] She was also given a Certificate of Finality, dated April 14, 2010 stating that the said judgment has become final and executory.[10]

Thereafter, in 2014, Melody applied for her K-1 visa at the United States (US) Embassy in Manila.[11] During her interview, she was informed that the annulment papers she presented were fraudulent.[12] As a result, her application was denied.[13] It was later confirmed that the annulment papers were indeed inauthentic, and not actually issued by Branch 15 of RTC Cotabato City.[14] Notably, Judge Indar has been disbarred by the Court for violating the CPR.[15]

Due to the foregoing, Melody stated that she was forced to hire another lawyer to file another petition for the nullity of her marriage.[16] Further, she had to refile a K-1 visa application with the US Embassy.[17] When she demanded for a refund, Atty. Paña merely returned PHP 260,000.00.[18]

Thus, Melody prayed that Arty. Paña should be disbarred from the practice of law for violating the Lawyer's Oath and Rule 1.01 of Canon 1 and Rule 7.03 of Canon 7 of the CPR.[19]

For his part, Atty. Paña denied the allegations against him.[20] He confirmed that Melody was indeed referred to him for the declaration of the nullity of her marriage.[21] Shortly thereafter, Melody allegedly called him stating that her fiance from the US was in a hurry to bring her there.[22] The said fiance was willing to spend for a quick annulment of Melody's previous marriage.[23] Atty. Paña claimed that he informed Melody that a quick annulment was not possible in South Cotabato.[24]

Verily, Atty. Paña stated that at that time, he encountered one Samuel Guillermo (Guillermo), a court employee who claimed to know a lot of court staff, lawyers, and businessmen, who successfully secured the annulment of their marriages in Cotabato.[25] When Melody reached out again to Atty. Paña, she allegedly asked that she be referred to someone who could provide her immediate assistance.[26] She also stated that she will no longer be engaging Atty. Paña's legal services.[27] Due to her earnest request, Atty. Paña referred her to Guillermo.[28]

More than a year later, Melody purportedly requested for a meeting with Atty. Paña.[29] It was only then that he was informed that the annulment papers were not honored by the NSO.[30] He then advised Melody to ask for a refund from Guillermo, but she pressed that Atty. Paña should assist her in demanding for the refund.[31] Purportedly Guillermo gradually paid Melody by depositing the money to her Metrobank account.[32]

Atty. Paña insisted that if ever he committed lapses, it was referring Melody to Guillermo.[33] He stated that in his journey as a lawyer, this was perhaps the indiscretion of a lifetime.[34] He apologized for not being prudent enough in making the said referral, as Guillermo assisted Melody in taking a shortcut of the regular procedure for the annulment of her marriage.[35]

Verily, on July 1, 2019, the present complaint was referred by the Court to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) for investigation, report, and recommendation.[36]","A lawyer's participation in the falsification of court documents is a reprehensible act which merits administrative sanction. It is directly contradictory to the oath one takes upon becoming a member of the Bar and shows unworthiness to continue in the practice of law.

The Case

This involves an administrative Complaint[1] filed with the Court by Melody H. Santos (Melody) against respondent Atty. Emilio S. Paña, Jr. (Atty. Paña) for committing gross immoral conduct, in violation of the Lawyer's Oath and the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR).[2]","The Court adopts the recommendation of the IBP BOG.

Time and again, it has been emphasized that the lawyers are expected to remain highly ethical and strictly observe the rules of the profession.[47] Failure to adhere to this standard would result in the Court's exercise of its power to discipline members of the bar.[48] Using such power, the Court calls lawyers to account for their mistakes as officers of the Court, for the purpose of preserving the purity of the profession and the proper administration of justice.[49]

On this note, the falsification of court documents has been treated as an act which reflects a high degree of moral turpitude on a lawyer.[50] It is deemed as an offense amounting to unlawful, dishonest, immoral, and deceitful conduct, and has the effect of lessening the confidence of the public in the legal system.[51] Due to the damage and prejudice caused by this offense, the Court has pronounced that it exhibits one's inability to discharge his or her duties as a member of the bar.[52]

In this regard, Rule 1.01, Canon 1 of the CPR provides that lawyers should not engage in unlawful, dishonest, immoral, or deceitful conduct. Rule 7.03, Canon 7 thereof also states that they should not engage in conduct that adversely reflects on their fitness to practice law. Similarly, both the Lawyer's Oath and Rule 10.01, Canon 10 of the CPR mandate lawyers to not do any falsehood, nor consent to the doing of any in court.

Verily, A.M. No. 22-09-01-SC, or the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability (CPRA), was recently issued by the Court, which repealed the CPR and took effect on May 29, 2023.[53] Notably, the CPRA includes a transitory provision which states that it shall be applied to all pending and future cases, unless not feasible or would work injustice.[54] As the exceptions are not present in the instant case, the Court deems the application of the CPRA to be proper.[55]

The pertinent provisions in the CPRA which enjoin lawyers from performing improper acts, particularly the participation in the falsification of court decisions, orders, or documents, are the following:[56]","ACCORDINGLY, the Court finds respondent Atty. Emilio S. Paña, Jr. GUILTY of violating the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability and the Lawyer's Oath. He is DISBARRED from the practice of law and his name is ordered STRICKEN OFF from the Roll of Attorneys, effective immediately.

Let a copy of this Decision be furnished to the Office of the Bar Confidant, to be appended to Atty. Emilio S. Paña, Jr.'s personal records as attorney. Likewise, let copies of this Decision be furnished to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines and the Office of the Court Administrator for dissemination to all courts in the country."
"A.C. No. 13753, February 06, 2024 ","JULIETA L. CO, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. JORGE P. MONROY, RESPONDENT.","Sometime in July 2000, Atty. Monroy offered to sell a Toyota Land Cruiser for PHP 1.4 million to Julieta. The vehicle was among the vehicles confiscated by the Bureau of Customs (BOC) where Atty. Monroy worked as Director III of Financial Services. Atty. Monroy assured Julieta that the transaction is legal and that official receipts will be issued in their favor. On July 12, 2000, Julieta, her sister Maria Victoria L. Que and her husband Romeo Que (Spouses Que) went to the office of Atty. Monroy at the South Pier, Manila. Atty. Monroy introduced them to Remus Erlan S. Palmos (Palmos), who is his nephew and personal staff and a certain Ben Valic (Valic), a licensed broker, as the persons who will facilitate the release of the vehicle. Palmos and Valic brought them to the vehicle depot of the BOC to inspect the vehicle. Having known Atty. Monroy since her high school days as a trusted family friend, Julieta was convinced to proceed with the purchase of the Land Cruiser.[2]

Upon Atty. Monroy's instructions, Julieta and Spouses Que prepared a check for PHP 150,000.00 payable to cash. They gave the check personally to Atty. Monroy on July 18, 2000 and were told to return on July 21, 2000 to pay the balance. On July 21, 2000, Atty. Monroy called Julieta to inform her that the vehicle is ready for delivery. She prepared a manager's check for the balance of PHP 1,250,000.00 but Atty. Monroy insisted on cash payment, which he personally received in his office. They waited the whole day for the release of the vehicle and were later told that one signatory from the Department of Finance (DOF) had yet to sign the documents for the release of the vehicle.[3]

When they returned on July 24, 2000, Atty. Monroy again told them that one signature was lacking from an officer of the DOF. On the same day, Palmos accompanied them to the DOF. Palmos spoke to two unidentified persons at the lobby of the DOF. He then told Julieta that the documents are still in the office of Undersecretary Cornelio Giron. They went back to the office of Atty. Monroy wherein the latter admitted that the vehicle cannot be released because someone ran off with the money and can no longer be located. To appease their worries, Atty. Monroy and Palmos issued a receipt to guarantee the return of the money. Julieta made repeated demands for Atty. Monroy to return her money to no avail as he kept on avoiding her and her relatives.[4]

Consequently, on January 24, 2003, Julieta caused the filing of two Informations docketed as Criminal Case Nos. 27767-27768 against Atty. Monroy: one for violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019, or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, and another one for estafa under the Revised Penal Code.[5] After trial, the Sandiganbayan issued a Decision[6] finding Atty. Monroy guilty of both charges.[7] In view of the absence of Atty. Monroy and his counsel during the scheduled promulgation on September 30, 2010, the Decision of conviction was promulgated in absentia. Atty. Monroy remained at-large despite the warrant of arrest issued by the Sandiganbayan.[8]

Apart from his criminal liability, Julieta filed the present administrative complaint for disbarment on the ground that Atty. Monroy acted in utter bad faith by using his position in the government to defraud her to part with PHP 1.4 million. He abused Julieta's trust as a friend to get money for the supposed payment for the negotiated sale of a vehicle from the BOC. Atty. Monroy failed to maintain the highest degree of morality required of those admitted to the Bar. He committed a dishonest, immoral, and unlawful act in gross violation of the provisions of the CPR. Finally, Julieta maintains that Atty. Monroy's conviction for the crimes involving moral turpitude are valid grounds for his disbarment.[9]",This resolves the Complaint-Affidavit[1] for disbarment filed by complainant Julieta L. Co (Julieta) before the Integrated Bar of the Philippines-Commission on Bar Discipline (IBP-CBD) against respondent Atty. Jorge P. Monroy (Atty. Monroy) for violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR).,"To begin, the Court observed that all the notices sent by the IBP to Atty. Monroy's last known addresses, i.e., Order[19] dated October 1, 2013, Notice of Mandatory Conference,[20] and the subsequent notices,[21] were returned unserved. Thus, in a Resolution[22] dated July 25, 2023, the Court ordered the IBP-CBD to: (1) verify and inform the Court whether Atty. Monroy was duly notified of the disbarment proceedings; and (2) to submit the last known addresses of Atty. Monroy.[23]

In a letter[24] dated November 16, 2023, Atty. Avelino V. Sales (Atty. Sales) manifested that the IBP-CBD can no longer verify whether the previous notices were received by Atty. Monroy as the entire records of the case were forwarded to the Office of the Bar Confidant. In any case, Atty. Sales informed the Court that the last Notice of Resolution dated October 1, 2022 sent by the IBP-CBD to Atty. Monroy was similarly returned to the Commission.[25] Without doubt, the difficulty in serving notices to Atty. Monroy was due to his own failure to comply with his duty as a lawyer to report any change of his addresses with IBP.[26] Therefore, the Court considers Atty. Monroy to have waived his right to refute the allegations against him. We will proceed to resolve the present administrative charge based on the evidence at hand.

The Court adopts the findings of the IBP-CBD, as affirmed by the IBP Board of Governors, and sustains the IBP Board of Governor's Resolution No. CBD-XXV-2022-10-07 recommending the disbarment of Atty. Monroy.

Membership in the Bar is a privilege burdened with continuing requirements. To maintain one's standing in the legal profession, a lawyer is required to conduct dealings with honesty, fidelity, and integrity at all times. Being a mere privilege, the practice of law may be suspended, or even withdrawn by the Court once it is shown that a lawyer was not able to sustain the high degree of good moral character expected by the community from the members of the legal profession.[27] Thus, in disbarment proceedings, the only issue to be resolved is whether a lawyer is worthy to continue his or her mandate as an officer of the court.[28]

Here, it is undisputed that Atty. Monroy was adjudged guilty of estafa and violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019 in the Sandiganbayan's Decision[29] in Criminal Case Nos. 27767-27768. Indeed, a lawyer may be disbarred for his or her conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude as provided under Rule 138, Section 27[30] of the Rules of Court. However, in Buenafe v. Commission on Elections,[31] the Court clarified that not every criminal act involves moral turpitude, as this does not include offenses that are not of themselves immoral, but only prohibited by law.[32] In Teves v. Commission on Elections,[33] moral turpitude was defined as those acts done contrary to justice, modesty, or good morals, depicting vileness or depravity in the private and social duties of a person.[34]

With regard to the charge of estafa, there is no question that this crime involves moral turpitude. The Court has invariably ruled that a lawyer who was convicted of estafa is totally unfit to be a member of the legal profession and aid in the administration of justice.[35] However, to serve as sufficient ground for disbarment, it must be shown that the conviction has already attained finality.[36]

In this case, Julieta alleged that due to the non-appearance of Atty. Monroy during the scheduled promulgation on September 30, 2010 the Sandiganbayan promulgated the Decision in absentia. Atty. Monroy's motion for reconsideration was denied by the Sandiganbayan. There being no appeal filed by Atty. Monroy, the Decision became final and executory.[37] The Court notes that aside from the copy of the Decision, there was no other evidence presented to show that the Decision has become final. Julieta did not submit a copy of the Order given in open court during the promulgation of Decision wherein Atty. Monroy failed to appear, or the Resolution denying his motion for reconsideration, or certificate of finality or entry of Decision in Criminal Case Nos. 27767-27768. Unfortunately, the Court cannot assume that the Decision of conviction against Atty. Monroy is already final.

Despite this, the Court still finds Atty. Monroy's disbarment justified for his violation of Canon 1, Rule 1.01 and Canon 6, Rule 6.02 of the CPR, which state:","WHEREFORE, premises considered, Judgment is hereby rendered in these cases as follows:

1. In Criminal Case No. 27767: Finding accused Jorge Paguntalan Monroy GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of Violation of Sec. 3(e), [Republic Act] No. 3019, as amended, and sentencing him to suffer the indeterminate penalty of imprisonment from six (6) years and one (1) month as minimum, to twelve (12) years as maximum, with perpetual disqualification from holding public office;

2. In Criminal Case No. 27768: Finding accused Jorge Paguntalan Monroy GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Estafa as defined and penalized under Art. 315, par. 2(a) of the Revised Penal Code, and sentencing him to suffer the indeterminate penalty of imprisonment from four (4) years and two (2) months of prision correccional as minimum to fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day of reclusion temporal as maximum; and return to private offended party Julieta Lim-Co the amount of One Million Four Hundred Thousand Pesos ([PHP] 1,400,000.00)."
"G.R. No. 262193, February 06, 2024","DEVELOPMENT BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON AUDIT, RESPONDENT.","To recall, on March 7, 2005, DBP issued Circular No. 10 which authorized the computation of the MVLC of its official and employees based on their ""gross monthly cash compensation"" composed of basic salary, officer's allowance, Representation and Transportation Allowances, Personnel Economic Relief Allowances, Additional Compensation, meal, children's, and family allowances, including longevity pay.[4] On February 28, 2007, the COA issued various NDs[5] covering the period from March to December 2005, in the total amount of P26,182,467.36. It held that the MVLC should be based on basic pay.[6] DBP sought reconsideration which the Supervising Auditor (SA) denied since the ""present salary or compensation of DBP officers and employees are without the requisite authority or approval of the Office of the President and the Department of Budget and Management (DBM).""[7] DBP appealed to the Cluster Director of the COA. It filed a Memorandum of Appeal on August 24, 2009.[8] Thereafter, it filed a Manifestation and Motion,[9] notifying the COA that then President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (PGMA) approved DBP's Compensation Plan, which allegedly includes DBP Circular No. 10. It argued that PGMA's approval rendered the ground on which the NDs were based moot and academic.[10]

On January 30, 2018, the COA Commission Proper (CP) issued Decision No. 2018-197,[11] partially granting the appeal of DBP. It affirmed the NDs on the payment of the MVLC but held that employees who were passive recipients were not required to refund the amount they received in good faith. The liability shall fall on DBP's Board of Directors (BOD) and officials who approved the payment as they were performing discretionary functions. The COA CP rejected DBP's invocation of PGMA's post facto approval of the bank's Compensation Plan as it was made 18 days before the May 10, 2010 Presidential and Vice-Presidential Elections. Under Article XII of the Omnibus Election Code (OEC), a government official cannot give any increase in salary or remuneration or privilege to any government official or employee 45 days before a regular election.[12]

DBP moved for reconsideration which the COA CP denied in its Decision No. 2022-072[13] dated January 24, 2022. The COA CP affirmed its earlier Decision with modification in that even the passive recipients of the MVLC are required to refund the illegally disbursed amount regardless of their good faith. Thus, DBP filed a petition for certiorari before Us.

In our assailed Decision, We held that: (1) DBP was not denied due process because it was able to present its side and defend its position throughout the proceedings from the SA to the COA CP;[14] (2) COA violated the right to speedy disposition of cases of DBP's officials and employees as it failed to justify the 11 years delay in the resolution of DBP's appeal and motion for reconsideration;[15] (3) there is no res judicata between the present case and the 2021 case of DBP v. COA;[16] (4) DBP Circular No. 10 is inconsistent with the Omnibus Rules on Leave,[17] as amended by Civil Service Commission (CSC) Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 14-99 and CSC MC No. 8-03, and DBM Budget Circular (BC) No. 2002-1 as it uses gross monthly cash compensation instead of basic pay;[18] (5) DBP BOD's power to fix personnel compensation is not absolute and must be in accord with the law and prevailing rules and regulations issued by the President and/or the DBM;[19] (6) DBP Circular No. 10 is not included in the Compensation Plan approved by PGMA;[20] (7) PGMA's approval of the Compensation Plan is invalid as We earlier ruled in the 2022 case of DBP v. COA[21] (2022 DBP case) since it was made during the prohibited period under the OEC;[22] (8) DBP BOD and officers who approved and certified the disallowed MVLC are excused from returning the same due to their good faith reliance on Section 13[23] of DBP's Revised Charter; and (9) Recipients of the MVLC are likewise absolved from returning the disallowed amounts under Rule 2d of Madera v. Commission on Audit[24] on the ground of undue prejudice caused by the COA's violation of their right to speedy disposition of cases.[25]

In this Motion for Partial Reconsideration, DBP alleges that Our finding that COA violated DBP's right to speedy disposition of cases warrants the dismissal and nullification of the NDs. It claims that We should not have merely affirmed with modification COA Decision No. 2018-197 dated January 30, 2018 and Decision No. 2022-072 dated January 24, 2022.[26] It further argues that the COA has no power to determine if PGMA's approval of its Compensation Plan violated the OEC because only the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) could make such a determination.[27]","Before Us is a Motion for Partial Reconsideration[1] of Our Decision[2] dated July 11, 2023 (assailed Decision), which affirmed with modification the Decision No. 2018-197 dated January 30, 2018 and Decision No. 2022-072 dated January 24, 2022 of the Commission on Audit (COA). The COA disallowed the payment of the money value of the leave credits (MVLC) of the officials and employees of the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) computed based on their gross monthly cash compensation. In Our assailed Decision, We absolved the persons identified as liable under Notices of Disallowance (NDs) Nos. HRM-MVLC-2006-04 (01-01) to HRM-MVLC-2006-04 (01-03), all dated February 28, 2007 and ND No. HRM-MVLC-2006-04 (03) dated July 4, 2007 from refunding the disallowed amounts therein.[3]","We grant the Motion for Partial Reconsideration.

In Navarro v. Commission on Audit[28] (Navarro) and Rosario v. Commission on Audit[29] (Rosario), We held that the COA was guilty of violating therein petitioner's right to speedy disposition of cases due to inordinate delay in resolving the appeal and motion for reconsideration before it. Navarro and Rosario involved 7 and 11 years of delay, respectively. In both cases, We reversed and set aside the Decisions of the COA and relieved petitioners of any liability for the disallowed amounts.

Conformably with Navarro and Rosario, We also now set aside the challenged Decisions of the COA in the present case and excuse DBP and its officials and employees on account of the COA's violation of their right to speedy disposition of cases.

Here, COA failed to discharge its burden of proving that the 11-year delay in the resolution of DBP's case is justified and reasonable. On pages 11-12 of Our assailed Decision, We ruled that:
On the matter of DBP's right to speedy disposition of cases, We find that the COA is guilty of violating the same. Section 16, Article III of the Constitution provides that all persons shall have the right to speedy disposition of their cases before all judicial, quasi-judicial, and administrative bodies. Any party to a case may demand expeditious action from all officials who are tasked with the administration of justice. In determining whether the right to speedy disposition of cases is violated, several factors are considered such as: (a) the length of delay; (b) the reasons for such delay; (c) the assertion or failure to assert such right; and (c) the prejudice caused by the delay.

We measure the length of delay in conjunction with the period for which the COA should have decided the case before it. Under Section 7, Article IX(A), of the Constitution, the COA shall decide any case or matter brought before it within 60 days from its submission for decision or resolution. A case or matter is deemed submitted for decision or resolution upon filing the last pleading, brief, or memorandum required by the rules of the Commission or by the Commission itself. In this case, DBP filed its Memorandum of Appeal before the COA Cluster Director on August 24, 2009, while the COA Auditor filed a Consolidated Reply Memorandum on August 25, 2009. The COA CP rendered the assailed Decision No. 2018-197 on January 30, 2018 or more than eight years from the submission of the Reply Memorandum. Likewise, the COA took its time in resolving DBP's motion for reconsideration of the Decision No. 2018-197. DBP filed the motion on October 17, 2018 but it was only on January 24, 2022 or more than three years after the COA issued Decision No. 2022-072.

Since the delay in the disposition of the case extended to years, way beyond the mandate of the Constitution and the COA's own rules of procedure, it is incumbent upon the Commission to prove that the delay was reasonable, or that the delay was not attributable to it. To justify the delay in this case, the COA argued that it was in the process of amending its Rules of Procedure in 2009 and this might have resulted in unintended delays. We are not persuaded.

The COA itself stated that its new rules was approved on September 15, 2009, while the delay in this case spanned from August 2009 to January 2018 and November 2018 to January 2022 for the appeal and the motion for reconsideration, respectively. Clearly, the COA had already finished the amendments of its rules during the long hiatus of the case. It did not substantiate the so-called ""organizational adjustments"" brought about by the amendments that caused the delay in the disposition of the case. Hence, such cannot excuse the COA's inaction for a total of 11 years.","WHEREFORE, the Partial Motion for Reconsideration is hereby GRANTED. The Decision No. 2018-197 dated January 30, 2018 and Decision No. 2022-072 dated January 24, 2022 of the Commission on Audit are ANNULLED and SET ASIDE on account of the violation of the constitutional right to speedy disposition of cases of petitioner Development Bank of the Philippines and its officials and employees."

In Criminal Case No. 12-292735, Hernandez and Anonuevo were charged in an Amended Information[6] with qualified trafficking in persons under Section 4(a) in relation to Section 3(a) and 6(a) of Republic Act No. 9208, committed as follows:

That sometime on June 23, 2012 or there about, in the City of xxxxxxxxxxx, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused Dennis Hernandez and Maria Cristina Anonuevo, for the purpose of sexual exploitation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully, and knowingly, conspired and confederated with each other in recruiting, transporting, transferring, harboring, providing, and/or receiving AAA, a.k.a. ""XXXXX,"" 17 years old, from the City of XXXXX to the province of XXXXX under the pretext of domestic employment as a house helper, with the intent of forcing her to have sex with Maria Cristina Anonuevo's live-in partner, Dennis Hernandez, and latter, with threat and intimidation, sexually abused and exploited said AAA, to the latter's damage and prejudice. That subsequently thereafter, the above-named accused, conspiring and confederating with each other, forced and threatened AAA, a.k.a. ""XXXXX"" to find her replacement and bring her to Dennis Hernandez on July 02, 2012, or there about, for the purpose of sexual exploitation.

This case is attendant with the qualifying circumstance of Minority being that AAA, a.k.a. ""XXXXX,"" was seventeen (17) years old when the crime was committed against her.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[7] (Emphasis in the original)

In the original case, docketed as Criminal Case No. 6858, Hernandez and Anonuevo were indicted in an Information[8] for violation of Section 5(b) of Republic Act No. 7610, committed as follows:

That on June 23, 2012 or there about, in the Province of xxxxx, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, through threat and intimidation, conspiring and confederating with one another, did then and there willfully, unlawfully, and knowingly, induce AAA, seventeen (17) years old, to indulge in sexual intercourse and lascivious conduct for money, profit, and any other consideration, against her will and consent, to the damage and prejudice of the said minor child.","This Court resolves the appeal[1] filed by accused-appellants Dennis Hernandez y Caringal (Hernandez) and Maria Cristina Anonuevo y Coriana (Anonuevo) assailing the Decision[2] of the Court of Appeals (CA), which affirmed with modification the Judgment[3] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) finding Hernandez and Anonuevo guilty beyond reasonable doubt of:
1) qualified trafficking in persons under Section 4(a), in relation to Sections 3(a), 6(a), and 10(a) of Republic Act No. 9208,[4] otherwise known as the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003; and

2) violation of Section 5(b) of Republic Act No. 7610,[5] otherwise known as the Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act.","The appeal is bereft of merit.

Factual findings of trial courts are entitled to great weight and will not be disturbed on appeal, especially when affirmed by the CA. This great respect lies in the trial court's firsthand access to the evidence presented during the trial, and in its direct observation of the witnesses and their demeanor while they testify on the occurrences and events attested to.[53] However, this rule does not apply where material facts have been overlooked, misapprehended, or misapplied by the lower courts.[54]

After a careful scrutiny of the records, we find no cogent reason to deviate from the uniform findings of the CA and RTC that the prosecution established by the required quantum of evidence, the elements of the crimes charged for reasons which shall be discussed ad seriatim.

In Criminal Case No. 12-292735, accused-appellants were charged with and convicted of qualified trafficking in persons under Section 4(a) in relation to Section 6(a) of Republic Act No. 9208.

At this juncture, it is worth noting that Republic Act No. 9208 was amended by Republic Act No. 10364[55] on February 6, 2013, and further amended by Republic Act No. 11862[56] on June 23, 2022. However, since the alleged act of trafficking was committed by accused-appellants on June 23, 2012, or prior to the enactment of both amendatory laws, the original law remains applicable in the resolution of the instant case.

Section 3 of Republic Act No. 9208 defines ""trafficking in persons,"" ""prostitution,"" and ""sexual exploitation"" as follows:

SECTION 3. Definition of Terms. – As used in this Act:

(a) Trafficking in Persons – refers to the recruitment, transportation, transfer or harboring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders by means of threat or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the person, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person for the purpose of exploitation which includes at a minimum, the exploitation or the prostitution of other or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs.

The recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of a child for the purpose of exploitation shall also be considered as ""trafficking in persons"" even if it does not involve any of the means set forth in the preceding paragraph.

(c) Prostitution – refers to any act, transaction, scheme or design involving the use of a person by another, for sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct in exchange for money, profit or any other consideration.

. . . .

(f) Sexual Exploitation – refers to participation by a person in prostitution or the production or pornographic materials as a result of being subjected to a threat, deception, coercion, abduction, force, abuse of authority, debt bondage, fraud or through abuse of a victim's vulnerability.

A conviction for qualified trafficking in persons rests upon: (a) the commission of any of the specific acts constituting trafficking in persons enumerated under Section 4 (Acts of Trafficking in Person) or Section 5 (Acts that Promote Trafficking in Persons); and (b) the existence of any of the qualifying circumstance listed under Section 6 (Qualified Trafficking in Persons). The provisions relevant to the case at hand are quoted below:

SECTION 4. Acts of Trafficking in Persons. – It shall be unlawful for any person, natural or juridical, to commit any of the following acts:

(a) To recruit, transport, transfer; harbor, provide, or receive a person by any means, including those done under the pretext of domestic or overseas employment or training or apprenticeship, for the purpose of prostitution, pornography, sexual exploitation, forced labor, slavery, involuntary servitude or debt bondage;

"G.R. No. 235894, February 05, 2024","KAREN BALDOVINO CHUA, PETITIONER, VS. JOSE NOEL B. DE CASTRO, RESPONDENT.","In a Complaint[5] lodged before the RTC against Jose Noel B. De Castro (respondent) for rescission, breach of contract, and damages, petitioner averred that she and her husband engaged his services for the construction of a two-storey residential building. Owing to respondent's years of experience and the fact of him being the first cousin of petitioner's mother, no written contract was executed between the parties.[6] Respondent prepared and proposed the building plans, designs, and material specifications, which petitioner and her husband acceded to.[7] They likewise provided all the funding respondent requested from them, which amounted to PHP 2,241,600.00 as of the institution of the complaint.[8] However, a month after petitioner and her family moved to the newly-constructed house, they noticed several structural and architectural defects such as leaking ceilings, flooding on the ground floor, cracks on the doors, and plumbing issues. The services of another foreman had to be engaged when respondent failed to resolve such defects.[9] The repairs done by the foreman to address the defects as well as the subsequent inspections conducted by a new engineer all revealed that respondent compromised on the work done and the materials he used.[10] It was also discovered that he deviated from the structural plan agreed upon.[11] The dispute was then referred to the Lupong Tagapamayapa of Barangay Quezon, Solano, Nueva Vizcaya.[12]

During the first hearing before the Lupong Tagapamayapa, respondent acknowledged the existence of the construction agreement and the receipt of the amount detailed by petitioner and her husband.[13] Despite several hearings, the parties failed to resolve their differences, impelling the Punong Barangay to issue a Certificate to File Action.[14] Afterwards, petitioner instituted her complaint.

On account of respondent's failure to submit any responsive pleading notwithstanding the summons served on him,[15] petitioner filed a Motion to Declare Defendant in Default.[16] She beseeched the RTC to proceed and render judgment based on the complaint.

In the first inveighed Order,[17] the RTC held that pursuant to Circular No. 103-2015 of the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA), the complaint had to be dismissed and referred to the Construction Industry Arbitration Committee (CIAC), the same being the tribunal with exclusive jurisdiction over construction disputes. The trial court held that the allegations in the complaint placed the controversy within the jurisdiction of the CIAC and as such, it was exercising its discretion to dismiss the case motu proprio.[18]

Petitioner moved for a reconsideration of the order, which the RTC denied in the second oppugned Order.[19]

Through the present direct recourse before this Court on a pure question of law, petitioner argues that the RTC erred in dismissing her complaint for want of jurisdiction. She insists that under Executive Order (E.O.) No. 1008,[20] parties must agree to submit the dispute to the CIAC for voluntary arbitration before the tribunal can exercise its jurisdiction. In this instance, there was neither a construction contract with an arbitration clause nor a subsequent agreement from the parties to submit their case for arbitration.[21]

In the Court's Resolution[22] dated March 12, 2018, respondent was directed to file his comment on the Petition. After the lapse of the original period provided him, another Resolution[23] was issued reiterating the directive that he file his comment. Still and all, he deigned to comply with the said directive. Inevitably, on June 10, 2020, he was made to show cause why he should not be held in contempt for ignoring the Court's directives.[24] On June 16, 2021 after the Court had confirmed that its latest Resolution was indeed received by respondent's daughter on September 21, 2020,[25] but that no compliance was received from him, he was held in contempt and fined the sum of PHP 1000.00. Likewise, another reiteration was made for him to file his comment on the Petition.[26]

To date, respondent has neither paid the fine imposed upon him[27] nor filed his comment.

The sole issue for the Court to resolve is whether the RTC erred in dismissing petitioner's complaint for lack of jurisdiction.","This Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] impugns the Orders dated August 11, 2017[2] and November 17, 2017[3] of Branch 27 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya, which dismissed the civil case filed by Karen Baldovino Chua (petitioner) before it, and denied her Motion for Reconsideration[4] thereof, respectively, in Civil Case No. 7389.","At the outset, the Court resolves to DISPENSE WITH respondent's comment due to his repeated failure to file the same.

From a procedural standpoint, the Court affirms the remedy availed by petitioner via an appeal by certiorari under a Rule 45 petition directly filed with the Court. Under Rule 41, Section 2(c), the appeal from a judgment of the RTC must be lodged with the Supreme Court by a Rule 45 petition ""[i]n all cases where only questions of law are raised or involved[.]"" Unquestionably, the issue of determining jurisdiction over a subject matter is a question of law,[28] which snugly falls within this Court's appellate jurisdiction.

On the merits, the Court resolves to GRANT the Petition.

It is well-settled that jurisdiction over the subject matters is conferred by law and not ""by the consent or acquiescence of any or all of the parties or by erroneous belief of the court that it exists.""[29]

The jurisdiction of the CIAC is laid down in Section 4 of E.O. No. 1008:
SECTION 4. Jurisdiction. — The CIAC shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction over disputes arising from, or connected with, contracts entered into by parties involved in construction in the Philippines, whether the dispute arises before or after the completion of the contract, or after the abandonment or breach thereof. These disputes may involve government or private contracts. For the Board to acquire jurisdiction, the parties to a dispute must agree to submit the same to voluntary arbitration.... (Emphasis supplied)
Unarguably, the foregoing section provides that when the dispute involves a construction agreement, the law vests jurisdiction with the CIAC so long as the ""the parties agree to submit to voluntary arbitration[.]""[30] In fact, the mere incorporation of an arbitration clause in a construction contract is sufficient to vest the CIAC with jurisdiction.[31] The clause operates as the parties' consent as required by the law, and may not be subjected to any condition or qualification.[32]

This Court has recognized the pivotal role that the CIAC plays in the swift settlement of construction controversies and has adopted policies to ensure that the adjudicative body is ""empowered and enabled to fulfill its function as the professionally authoritative venue for settlement of construction disputes[.]""[33]","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is hereby GRANTED. The challenged Orders dated August 11, 2017 and November 17, 2017 of Branch 27 of the Regional Trial Court, Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya in Civil Case No. 7389 are SET ASIDE. The case is remanded to the said court a quo, which is DIRECTED to resolve the case with dispatch.

The Clerk of Court is likewise DIRECTED to execute the fine amounting to PHP 1000 against respondent Jose Noel B. De Castro in accordance with Section 9, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court."
"G.R. No. 264846, February 05, 2024","CCC, PETITIONER, VS. DDD, EEE, FFF, GGG & HHH, RESPONDENTS.*","CCC married the late III in 2006. They begot two children, namely: AAA, who was born in 2006, and BBB, who was born in 2011. After seven years of marriage, their relationship turned sour due to personal differences. As a result, III left the marital home together with their children and sought refuge at her parents' house in xxxxxxxxxxx, North Cotabato. In 2014, the marriage was legally dissolved through a divorce obtained from a Shari'a Court. Three years thereafter, III passed away; AAA and BBB were left under the care and custody of her relatives, the respondents in this case.[6]

Meanwhile, respondent EEE, III's brother, became the judicially appointed guardian of the children.[7]

In 2018, CCC discovered that his children were no longer residing in xxxxxxxxxxx, North Cotabato. He found them living in an apartment in xxxxxxxxxxx with III's siblings. Left without recourse, he filed a petition before the CA seeking the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus to regain custody over the minors.[8]

Prior to the final adjudication of the petition, the CA referred the case to Branch xxxxxxxxxxx of the RTC of xxxxxxxxxxx, Cotabato, and ordered III's siblings to appear before the trial court together with the children and to show cause why they should not be returned to the custody of CCC.[9]

In his testimony, AAA vividly described how CCC physically abused him, his sister, and their late mother. AAA highlighted a specific incident when CCC traveled to xxxxxxxxxxx, Cotabato with the sole purpose of threatening III's life. AAA also overheard him explicitly stating that he refuses to acknowledge her as his wife and their children as his own. When given the choice, AAA expressed his preference to live with his mother's siblings instead of CCC. Furthermore, AAA conveyed a deep-seated sense of hatred toward his father.[10]

BBB's testimony aligned with her brother's account. She expressed her desire to remain in the care of her aunts and uncles, as they had treated her kindly. She intimated her reluctance to live with CCC because he already has another wife and children.[11]

As III's relatives, respondents explicated that they had been entrusted with the care of the children following her death. However, it was EEE who officially filed and obtained the petition for guardianship over the minors. Despite EEE's work as a seaman abroad, he consistently provided monthly support of PHP 40,000.00 for the children. Respondents expressed their strong desire to maintain custody of the children, citing concerns about CCC's inability to provide them proper care. They also provided detailed accounts of the hardships that their sister endured during the years she lived with him.[12]

In response, CCC vehemently denied abandoning III and their children for another woman. He claimed entering into a new relationship only after separating from III. He accused respondents of influencing his children's perspective, leading them to reject the idea of living with him. He expressed his strong desire to personally raise and provide guidance to his children while acknowledging and striving to address his past shortcomings. Despite having a new family, he avouched that his new wife willingly agreed to take the children into their household.[13]

In due course, the RTC denied the habeas corpus and custody petition and refused to grant CCC custody over the minors. The fallo of the Judgment reads:
WHEREFORE, the Court finds no cogent reason to grant the herein petition for habeas corpus and custody of minors AAA and BBB to herein petitioner, thus, hereby DENIES the same and judgment is hereby rendered:
That the custody over the person of minors AAA and BBB shall remain with EEE, the guardian designated and appointed by the Court in Spl. Proc. No. 17-010, rendered by the RTC, Branch xxxxxxxxxxx, xxxxxxxxxxx, Cotabato;

That petitioner is ordered to give monthly financial support to AAA and BBB necessary for their support, maintenance and education, in the sum of [PHP] 40,000.00, for the two of them, which amount was the financial support that EEE has been providing the minors, and may be increased depending upon the needs of the children;

Direct the Social Welfare Officer of the LSWDO of xxxxxxxxxxx, Cotabato, to conduct a thorough and continuous counselling to the minors, AAA and BBB, including the guardian, to prepare the minors emotionally and psychologically in allowing the petitioner to visit them, and if the children are already prepared for the visitation, to schedule the time of visitation which is the most convenient to the minor children, and submit a case study and report on the continuous counselling being undertaken to the Court. Counselling must be done immediately, and upon coordination with guardian appointed by the Court;

Direct the petitioner to undergo psychological and psychiatric counselling, to prepare him of his responsibilities toward his children, and to consult with the local Social Welfare Officer of xxxxxxxxxxx, Cotabato, for the conduct of said counselling; [and]

Grant unto the petitioner visitation rights, upon the recommendation of the Social Welfare Officer, when the minor­children AAA and BBB are already ready and willing to allow the petitioner to visit them, and the visitation period must be scheduled in accordance with what is most convenient to the minor children[.]","This Verified Appeal by Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court rails against the Decision[2] and the Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA), which affirmed the Judgment[4] rendered by Branch xxxxxxxxxxx of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of xxxxxxxxxxx, Cotabato, denying the petition for habeas corpus and custody of minors filed by CCC, and which gave short shrift to the Motion for Reconsideration (Of the Decision dated June 21, 2022),[5] respectively, in CA-G.R. SP No. 10277-MIN.","After a percipient study of the case at bench, the Court rules and so holds to deny the Petition.

The CA committed no reversible error in affirming the trial court's denial of CCC's petition for the issuance of the writ of habeas corpus and in refusing to grant him custody of his minor children.

A writ of habeas corpus shall extend to all cases where the rightful custody of any person is withheld from the persons entitled thereto. In cases involving minors, the purpose of a petition for habeas corpus is not limited to the production of the child before the court. The main purpose of the petition for habeas corpus is to determine who has the rightful custody over the child.[19] In deciding custody issues, the child's welfare is the most important consideration.[20]

Along this grain, the trial court must carefully consider the totality of the circumstances. Ultimately, such issue is factual in nature, which the Court is not tasked to undertake under a Rule 45 petition as it is not a trier of facts.[21] Thus, as a matter of sound practice and procedure, the Court defers and accords finality to the factual findings of trial courts.[22]

In the case at bench, the RTC, as affirmed by the CA, found that AAA and BBB are better off living with respondents, who are III's relatives.

The Court could not agree more.","ACCORDINGLY, the Verified Appeal by Certiorari is hereby DENIED. The June 21, 2022 Decision and the November 14, 2022 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 10277-MIN are AFFIRMED."
"G.R. No. 264913, February 05, 2024 ","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. RONALD PARADERO APORADO, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","Ronald was charged with murder for stabbing Amado B. Halasan (Amado) in an Information that reads:
That sometime on January 28, 2017, in the Municipality of Bansalan, Province of Davao del Sur, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, and with intent to kill, armed with a bolo, with treachery, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and stab Amado B. Halasan in a sudden and unexpected manner without giving the victim the chance to defend himself a mode of attack which the accused consciously and deliberately adopted inflicting upon him stab wounds on the different parts of his body, which caused his instantaneous death, to the damage and prejudice of his heirs.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[4]
When arraigned, Ronald pleaded not guilty to the charge.[5] At the trial, the prosecution proved that on January 28, 2017, Ronald, alias Tunay, Jay Amoy (Jay), Amado, and Fritz Montalba (Fritz) were having a drinking spree outside the house of Jomar Amoy (Jomar) in Sitio San Roque, Barangay Mabuhay, Bansalan, Davao del Sur.[6] The group teased Ronald that he looked like a killer and told him that he was ugly.[7] Amado even challenged Ronald if he knew how to kill a person.[8] Unknown to the group, Ronald was enraged by their mockery. He took it to mean that the group degraded his person. After while, Ronald's sister called and asked him to go home since he was already drunk.[9] Ronald went home as instructed. When he returned, Jay offered him a drink. Suddenly, Ronald tried to punch Amado, but Jay held his, hand.[10] Jay then noticed that Ronald had a knife, so he let go of Ronald's hand and ran towards Jomar's house. Fritz followed.[11] Inside, Jay saw Ronald stab Amado several times in the breast area.[12] At that time, Amado was asleep and seated with his head bowed.[13]

After that, Ronald went to the house of Rey Amoy, came back with a backpack, and again stabbed Amado while shouting, ""do you think that I do not know how to kill a person. I have killed many times.""[14] Ronald left with a warning that he will kill them all.[15] Amado was brought to Centeno Hospital where he was proclaimed dead on arrival.[16]

Ronald was apprehended by barangay tanod Janilo Espinosa (Janilo) along the road going to New Visayas. Janilo bodily frisked him and saw a knife in his backpack.[17] He then brought Ronald to the barangay hall. When asked why he stabbed Amado, Ronald answered that he just liked to kill (""natripingan lang niya"").[18]","We review in this appeal[1] the conviction of Ronald Paradero Aporado (Ronald) for the crime of murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) in the Decision[2] dated November 18, 2020 and the Resolution[3] dated April 20, 2022 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 02268-MIN.","It is hornbook doctrine that where the accused admits full responsibility for the killing of the victim, it is incumbent upon them to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the killing was justified and that they incurred no liability therefor. The burden of evidence is shifted to the accused, and they must rely on the strength of their own evidence and not on the weakness of that of the prosecution, for even if the latter were weak, it would not be disbelieved after their open admission of responsibility for the killing.[38]

Here, Ronald admitted that he killed Amado. He testified in open court how he was enraged by the mockery of Jay, Fritz, and Amado that he decided to go home, get a knife, and stab Amado to death:","ACCORDINGLY, the appeal is DENIED.

"G.R. No. 214074, February 05, 2024","PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK, PETITIONER, VS. MEDIAN CONTAINER CORPORATION AND ELDON INDUSTRIAL CORPORATION, RESPONDENTS.","On November 2, 2010, respondents Median Container Corporation (Median) and Eldon Industrial Corporation (collectively, respondents) filed a complaint[6] for Reformation of Instrument before the RTC. The complaint alleged that to finance the purchase of various goods needed for their businesses, they availed of a credit line with PNB in the amount of PHP 50 Million, with fixed amortization and interest. Instead of the usual promissory notes and other loan documents, PNB purportedly lured them into signing trust receipts, which did not reflect their real agreement, to coerce them as well as their officers to pay whatever billing sent to them under the pain of criminal prosecution.[7]

In its Answer with Counterclaim,[8] PNB argued that the complaint should be dismissed because the trust receipts reflected their real agreement. It claimed that there was no enticement involved in the execution thereof because the provisions were freely agreed upon and voluntarily executed by both parties. It claimed that the complaint was a mere ploy on respondents' part to evade their obligations and escape possible criminal prosecution for estafa as they failed to turn over the proceeds of the sale of the goods or return the goods covered by the trust receipts in violation of the Trust Receipts Law. Thus, PNB sought to implead Spouses Ley, as President and Vice-President/Treasurer of Median, to hold them severally liable with respondents and collect from them the sum of PHP 31,059,616.29.[9]","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court filed by petitioner Philippine National Bank (PNB) assailing the Decision[2] dated March 19, 2014 and the Resolution[3] dated August 18, 2014 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 121782. The assailed CA rulings affirmed the Resolutions dated February 14, 2011[4] and July 29, 2011[5] issued by Branch 91, Regional Trial Court, Quezon City (RTC) which dismissed, without prejudice, PNB's counterclaim and denied its motion to implead Spouses Carlos and Fely Ley (Spouses Ley).","The Petition is without merit.

At the outset, the Court notes that PNB's arguments are mere rehash of those it raised before the CA, which have already been sufficiently addressed and resolved in its rulings. More significantly, the issues that PNB raises in the instant petition, i.e., whether its counterclaim is compulsory and whether Spouses Ley should have been impleaded, require a review of the pleadings and arguments raised, as well as the findings of the CA, including those of the RTC, which are not proper in a Rule 45 petition where only questions of law are allowed.[30]

At any rate, the Court finds no reversible error on the part of the CA in upholding the RTC ruling that dismissed PNB's counterclaim, including the motion to implead Spouses Ley, for lack of merit.

It bears stressing that under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, the Court's review of the CA Decision is discretionary and will be granted only when there are special and important reasons for it such as when the court a quo has: (a) decided a question of substance, not theretofore determined by the Supreme Court, or has decided it in a way probably not in accord with law or with the applicable decisions of the Supreme Court; or (b) so far departed from the accepted and usual course of judicial proceedings, or so far sanctioned such departure by a lower court, as to call for an exercise of the power of supervision.[31]

None of these reasons were shown to exist in this case.

A counterclaim is defined as any claim for money or other relief which a defending party may have against an opposing party.[32] A counterclaim is considered compulsory if: (a) it arises out of, or is necessarily connected with, the transaction or occurrence which is the subject matter of the opposing party's claim; (b) it does not require for its adjudication the presence of third parties of whom the court cannot acquire jurisdiction; and (c) the court has jurisdiction to entertain the claim.[33] In other words, a compulsory counterclaim cannot be made the subject of a separate action but should be asserted in the same suit involving the same transaction or occurrence giving rise to it.[34]

To determine whether a counterclaim is compulsory, the following tests apply: (1) Are the issues of fact and law raised by the claim and counterclaim largely the same?; (2) Would res judicata bar a subsequent suit on defendant's claim absent the compulsory counterclaim rule?; (3) Will substantially the same evidence support or refute plaintiffs claim as well as defendant's counterclaim?; and (4) Is there any logical relation between the claim and the counterclaim?[35] A positive answer to all four questions would indicate that the counterclaim is compulsory. Otherwise, it is permissive.[36]

Another test established by case law is the ""compelling test of compulsoriness"" which requires ""a logical relationship between the claim and counterclaim, that is, where conducting separate trials of the respective claims of the parties would entail a substantial duplication of effort and time by the parties and the court.""[37]

Applying the foregoing standards, the Court agrees that PNB's counterclaim for collection of sum of money is merely permissive.

First, the issue in the main case, i.e., whether the parties' real agreement is a loan or some other contract and not a trust receipt agreement, is entirely different from the issues in the counterclaim, i.e., whether respondents secured an obligation from PNB, the total amount due, and that they refused to pay despite demand.

Case law characterizes reformation of an instrument as a remedy in equity where a written instrument already executed is allowed by law to be reformed or construed to express or conform to the real intention of the parties. The rationale of the doctrine is that it would be unjust and inequitable to allow the enforcement of a written instrument that does not express or reflect the real intention of the parties.[38] To support an action for reformation, the petitioner/complainant must present evidence establishing the alleged real agreement between the parties, in addition to the instrument sought to be reformed.","FOR THESE REASONS, the Court resolves to DENY the Petition for Review on Certiorari.

REAL ESTATE CORP.,** AND MELISSA ILAGAN YU, RESPONDENTS.","A Complaint[6] for illegal dismissal with money claims dated August 14, 2014 was filed by petitioner against M.I.Y. and Yu. Petitioner alleged (1) that she was a regular employee of M.I.Y.;[7] (2) that she was hired on April 10, 2013 as Facilities Maintenance and Services (FM&S) personnel at the Goldrich Mansion, where M.I.Y. conducted its business and Yu maintained a separate residence;[8] (3) as FM&S personnel, her duty was to monitor and maintain the orderliness and cleanliness of every floor of the building, including its establishments such as a spa, massage parlor, salon, bar, transient rooms, and agency (yaya.com);[9] (3) that she cleaned, mopped the floor, washed the glass windows of every floor, changed the bedsheets, pillows, and curtains of the transient rooms, and cleaned all the transient rooms;[10] (4) that she also maintained the things used in the spa and massage parlor, like changing the towels used, checking the provisions for face towels, uniforms, and accessories, and monitored the staff;[11] and (5) that she was also assigned to handle, monitor, and clean the penthouse where Yu's office was located.[12] In other words, petitioner performed her tasks as FM&S staff for M.I.Y. and Yu.

Petitioner further alleged that respondents crafted a policy to force her to end the contract with them every six months.[13] Petitioner was allegedly instructed to make a copy of a resignation letter given to her, then affix her name and signature.[14] Furthermore, she was instructed to take a two-week vacation, then return to work thereafter.[15] Petitioner also complained and reported to respondents that, by the negligence of another employee, her eyes were hit by a hot blower sprayed by the steamer in the spa, and that she did not receive any medication or medical help.[16]","This Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] (Petition) challenges the Decision[2] and the Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R.

The CA held that the labor tribunal did not commit grave abuse of discretion when it declared that: (1) petitioner Flordivina M. Gaspar was not an employee of M.I.Y. Real Estate Corporation (M.I.Y.); and (2) petitioner was engaged as a domestic worker of Melissa Ilagan Yu (Yu) (collectively respondents).[5]","We rule in the negative and deny the Petition for lack of merit.

Petitioner did not establish with substantial evidence her employment with M.I.Y. Thus, the CA did not commit grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or in excess of jurisdiction when it declared petitioner as a domestic worker of Yu and consequently affirmed the labor tribunals.

Judicial review of a labor case

Petitioner alleges that the CA committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or in excess of jurisdiction when it affirmed the finding that she was a domestic worker of Yu, and not an employee of M.I.Y.[64]

We disagree.

The decision of the NLRC may be reviewed by the CA through a Rule 65 petition when there is grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or in excess of jurisdiction.[65]

Grave abuse of discretion is defined in jurisprudence as such capricious and arbitrary exercise of judgment as equivalent, in the eyes of the law, to lack of jurisdiction.[66] There is grave abuse of discretion where the power is exercised in an arbitrary or despotic manner by reason of passion, prejudice, or personal hostility amounting to an evasion of a positive duty, or a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined, or to act at all in contemplation of law.[67] Through time, the meaning of grave abuse of discretion has been expanded to include any action done contrary to the Constitution, the law, or jurisprudence.[68]","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED.

Direct resort to the Court is allowed following the guidelines set forth in In Re: Elbanbuena[54]
 

As a general rule, litigants must observe the hierarchy of courts.[55] Direct resort to this Court is justified only when there are special and important reasons specifically set out in the petition.[56]

In Hernan v. Sandiganbayan,[57] We ruled that the passage of Republic Act No. 10951 is an exceptional circumstance which warrants not only the re­opening of an already terminated case, but also the recall of an Entry of Judgment for purposes of modifying the penalty to be served. Hernan sought only the modification of sentence pursuant to Republic Act No. 10951.

In contrast and applying Hernan, the case of In Re: Elbanbuena[58] involved the modification of sentence pursuant to Republic Act No. 10951, as well as the immediate release from confinement on account of full service of the re­computed sentence.

The Court in In Re: Elbanbuena then issued guidelines to govern the procedures for actions seeking the following reliefs: (1) the modification, based on the amendments introduced by Republic Act No. 10951, of penalties imposed by final judgments; and (2) the immediate release of the petitioner­convict on account of full service of the penalty/penalties, as modified.[59] Among others, We laid down the rule on direct resort to this Court:
VII. Judgment of the court.

To avoid any prolonged imprisonment, the court shall promulgate judgment no later than ten (10) calendar days after the lapse of the period to file comment. The judgment shall set forth the following:
The penalty/penalties imposable in accordance with RA No. 10951;
Where proper, the length of time the petitioner-convict has been in confinement (and whether time allowance for good conduct should be allowed); and
Whether the petitioner-convict is entitled to immediate release due to complete service of his sentence/s, as modified in accordance with RA No. 10951.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Certiorari is GRANTED.

"G.R. No. 254186, April 17, 2024","SOLITO C. AMORES, JR., PETITIONER, VS. GOLDROUTE MARITIME INC., RESPONDENT.","On March 28, 2015, petitioner entered into a Contract of Employment[5] with Goldroute Maritime Inc. on behalf of its principal, Kyowa Kisen Co. Ltd., to work as an oiler on board the vessel ""Kanoura"" for a period of nine months. Petitioner was declared fit for sea duty upon undergoing the mandatory pre-­employment medical examination (PEME).[6]

During the effectivity of his contract, or sometime in October 2015, petitioner experienced chest pains and shortness of breath. Before he can even report his medical condition to the ship Captain, the latter informed him that he would be sent home. When petitioner inquired as to the reason for his repatriation prior to the expiration of his contract, the Captain merely told him that it was respondent company's order to send him home. On October 18, 2015, petitioner, along with two other seafarers, was repatriated to the Philippines.[7]

On October 19, 2015, petitioner immediately reported to respondent's office where he was informed that he will be transferred to another vessel and to wait for advice regarding his next deployment. Petitioner requested for a post-­employment medical examination as he was still experiencing intermittent chest pains but he was told to see his own private doctor.[8] Thus, on October 20, 2015, petitioner consulted with Dr. Rogelio M. Ramirez (Dr. Ramirez) who prescribed some medications for his chest pains and advised him to undergo further medical examinations such as electrocardiogram and treadmill stress test.[9]

On December 5, 2015, respondent informed petitioner of his line up for deployment and advised him to undergo PEME. On December 15, 2015, petitioner was examined by respondent's company-designated physician, Dr. Ramon M. Guzman (Dr. Guzman). After laboratory tests and physical examination, petitioner was found to be suffering from Hypertension, Controlled, T/C Ischemic Heart for Work-Up and Possible Angiography. Consequently, petitioner was declared unfit for sea duty.[10]

On December 28, 2016, petitioner underwent cardiovascular evaluation at the PMP Diagnostic Center, Inc. Dr. Ana Ma. Luisa Javier (Dr. Javier), the company-designated Cardiologist who examined petitioner made the following findings:
ASSESSMENT: Hypertensive cardiovascular disease to rule out Atherosclerotic Heart Disease","This Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] seeks to reverse and set aside the Decision[2] and the Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 146946. The CA reversed and set aside the Decision[4] of the Panel of Voluntary Arbitrators which granted the claim of petitioner Solito C. Amores, Jr. for total and permanent disability benefits.","We rule in the negative.

Petitioner chiefly argues that respondent's failure to provide him with the mandatory post-employment examination resulted in his entitlement to total and permanent disability benefits by operation of law. On the other hand, respondent belies petitioner's claim that he reported his medical condition to respondent immediately upon his repatriation and that he asked to be referred to the company-designated physician for post-employment examination.

The question under consideration is evidently factual because it requires an examination of the evidence on record and a determination of whether or not petitioner indeed asked for a post-employment medical examination from respondent after his repatriation. Well-settled is the rule that the Court is not a trier of facts. The function of the Court in petitions for review on certiorari is limited to reviewing errors of law that may have been committed by the lower courts.[38]

However, this rule is not absolute and admits of exceptions like in labor cases where the Court may look into factual issues when the factual findings of the lower tribunals are conflicting.[39] In this case, the findings of the PVA are contrary to those of the CA. They had a different appreciation of the evidence in determining the propriety of petitioner's claim for disability benefits. To finally resolve the factual dispute, the Court deems it proper to tackle the factual question presented.[40]

Petitioner, insists that respondent refused to subject him to a post-­employment medical examination which resulted to a lack of proper medical assessment thereby rendering him totally and permanently disabled by operation of law.","ACCORDINGLY, the petition is DENIED.

"G.R. No. 254433, April 17, 2024","ARLO ALUMINUM CO., INC., PETITIONER, VS. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","Arlo Aluminum Co., Inc. (Arlo), a domestic corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the Philippines,[4] filed an Application[5] dated June 21, 2012 for the registration of title over Lot Nos. 7948 and 7947 located in Barangay Caniogan, Pasig City. Arlo claimed to have acquired Lot No. 7948, a parcel of land measuring about 62.50 square meters, sometime in 1996 from Melvin Atienza (Atienza). Atienza bought the said lot from Esmeraldo Tambongco (Tambongco), who had been in continuous, uninterrupted, open, public, and adverse possession, and in the concept of an owner since June 12, 1945, or possibly earlier. Arlo further alleged that it acquired the adjacent land, Lot No. 7947, measuring approximately 146.94 square meters, from Dalisay Crisostomo (Crisostomo). Crisostomo likewise acquired the same from Tambongco, who had been in continuous, uninterrupted, open, public, and adverse possession, and in the concept of an owner since June 12, 1945, or possibly earlier. Arlo claimed that Lot Nos. 7948 and 7947 have been declared for taxation purposes, and the realty taxes thereon have been paid.[6]

The Office of Solicitor General (OSG) filed a Notice of Appearance[7] dated January 23, 2013 and a letter[8] deputizing the Office of the City Prosecutor of Pasig City to appear in the case before the trial court.

During the course of the proceedings, Arlo submitted the following documents: (1) Notice of Initial Hearing;[9] (2) Affidavit of Publication;[10] (3) Official Gazette;[11] (4) Technical Description of Lot No. 7948;[12] (5) Tax Declaration No,. 007-07150 for Lot No. 7948;[13] (6) Real Property Tax Clearance No. A-3 1269 for Lot No. 7948;[14] (7) Tax Declaration No. 007-05478 for Lot No. 7947;[15] (8) Real Property Tax Clearance No. A-3 1268 for Lot No. 7947;[16] (9) Technical Description of Lot No. 7947;[17] (10) Survey Plan for Lot No. 7948;[18] and (11) Survey Plan for Lot No. 7947.[19]

Arlo also submitted two Certifications dated September 27, 2013 issued by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources-National Capital Region (DENR-NCR), which were signed by Regional Executive Director Neria A. Andin, Ceso III (Andin), indicating that Lot Nos. 7948 and 7947, containing an area of 47 square meters and 165 square meters, respectively, as surveyed by Geodetic Engineer Florante S. Abad, were verified to be within the alienable or disposable land under Project No. 21 of Pasig per Land Classification (LC) Map No. 639, approved on March 11, 1927.[20]
","Before this Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, seeking to set aside the Decision[2] and the Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 112019.","In view of new legal and jurisprudential developments during the pendency of this case, the Court resolves to remand the matter to the appellate court for the reception of new evidence.

Generally, the Supreme Court does not review the factual findings of the CA since this Court is not a trier of facts. It will not rule on questions of fact, as the factual findings of the appellate courts are deemed final, binding, and conclusive on the parties and upon the Court, provided they are supported by substantial evidence.[46] However, there are exceptional circumstances when the Court is called to deal with questions of fact in resolving a petition for review on certiorari, such as:
(1) when the conclusion is a finding grounded entirely on speculation, surmises or conjectures; (2) when the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible; (3) when there is grave abuse of discretion; (4) when the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts; (5) when the findings of fact are co1iflicting; (6) when the [CA], in making its findings, went beyond the issues of the case and the same is contrary to the admissions of both [parties]; (7) when the finding of the [CA] are contrary to those of the trial court; (8) when the findings of fact are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based; (9) when the facts set forth in the petition as well as in the petitioner's main and reply briefs are not disputed by the respondents; and (10) when the finding of fact of the [CA] is premised on the absence of evidence and are contradicted by the evidence on record.

These exceptions similarly apply in petitions for review filed before this court involving civil, labor, tax, or criminal cases.

A question of fact requires this court to review the truthfulness or falsity of the allegations of the parties. This review includes assessment of the ""probative value of the evidence presented."" There is also a question of fact when the issue presented before this court is the correctness of the lower courts' appreciation of the evidence presented by the parties.[47] (Emphasis supplied)
In this case, the determination of whether Arlo sufficiently established that the subject lots are alienable and disposable lands of the public domain, as well as its possession and occupation of the said lots under a bona fide claim of ownership, is a factual question that requires a review of the evidence on record. Since the findings of the CA are contrary to those of the trial court, the instant case falls under the well-recognized exceptions. ","ACCORDINGLY, the present petition is DENIED in part. The Decision dated February 7, 2020 and the Resolution dated November 20, 2020 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 112019 are hereby SET ASIDE. The case is REMANDED to the Court of Appeals, for reception of evidence on the following matters based on the parameters set forth in Sections 6 and 7 of Republic Act No. 11573:
The area covered by Lot Nos. 7948 and 7947;
The nature, period and circumstances of the possession and occupation of Arlo Aluminum Co., Inc. and its predecessors-in-interest over Lot Nos. 7948 and 7947; and
The land classification status of Lot Nos. 7948 and 7947.

COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, RESPONDENT.","Petitioner Manila Peninsula, registered with the Large Taxpayers Division of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), is a duly registered domestic corporation with address at Ayala Avenue corner Makati Avenue, Makati City. It was incorporated on April 4, 1974, with the following primary purpose:
""To lease real estate, and to erect thereon hotels and other buildings and improvements; to own, lease, operate, manage and administer hotels, apartment hotels, and all other facilities, accommodations, adjunct and accessories appurtenant to a general hostelry business; to furnish entertainment and otherwise perform any and all things for the pleasure, comfort and convenience of hotel guests, tenants and other customers; to promote travel and tourism; and otherwise, to handle and engage in other allied businesses; provided that the Corporation will cater only to its hotel customers and their guests.[6] (Citation omitted)
Respondent, on the other hand, is the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR), with the authority to act on claims for refund or tax credit of erroneously or excessively paid taxes. It holds office at the BIR National Office Building, BIR Road, Diliman, Quezon City.

During taxable year (TY) 2010, Manila Peninsula provided hotel room accommodations and food and beverage services to Delta Air, a foreign corporation with a License to Transact Business in the Philippines (License) dated December 29, 2009, issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Under such License, Delta Air is allowed to establish a branch office in the Philippines to engage in international air transport services.[7]

Delta Air provides room accommodations and food and beverage services to its pilots and cabin crew during flight layovers in the Philippines. For this purpose, an agreement was executed between Delta Air and Manila Peninsula wherein the latter would provide room accommodations and food and beverage services to the former's pilots and cabin crew during flight layovers in the Philippines. The cost of hotel services would be directly charged to Delta Air and would not constitute compensable income for its crew but a business expense of the airline.[8]","This Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] (Petition) under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court filed by petitioner Manila Peninsula Hotel, Inc.

The CTA EB denied Manila Peninsula's petition for review and affirmed the Decision[4] dated August 14, 2015 and Resolution[5] dated December 10, 2015 of the CTA Third Division (CTA Division), which held that Manila Peninsula's sale of services to Delta Air Lines, Inc. (Delta Air) is not subject to Value-Added Tax (VAT) zero­ rating for failure to satisfy the requisites to be entitled to it.","The Petition is meritorious.
 
Exhaustion of administrative remedies and requirements to assail BIR issuance.
 

Manila Peninsula claims that Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 46-2008 and Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 31-2011 are not controlling BIR issuances because they are contrary to Section 108(B)(4) of the NIRC, as amended. The CIR, on the other hand, argues that Manila Peninsula's challenge against the foregoing BIR issuances is a collateral attack on the duly issued administrative issuances which the law frowns upon.[49]

In Banco De Oro, et al. v. Republic of the Phils., et al.,[50] the Court, sitting En Banc, declared that the CTA has undisputed jurisdiction to pass upon the constitutionality or validity of a tax law or regulation when raised by the taxpayer in disputing or contesting an assessment or claiming a refund. The CTA may likewise take cognizance of cases directly challenging the constitutionality or validity of a tax law or regulation or administrative issuance (revenue orders, revenue memorandum circulars, rulings). The Court En Banc further declared that:
[W]ith respect to administrative issuances (revenue orders, revenue memorandum circulars, or rulings), these are issued by the Commissioner under its power to make rulings or opinions in connection with the implementation of the provisions of internal revenue laws. Tax rulings, on the other hand, are official positions of the Bureau on inquiries of taxpayers who request clarification on certain provisions of the National Internal Revenue Code, other tax laws, or their implementing regulations. Hence, the determination of the validity of these issuances clearly falls within the exclusive appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Tax Appeals under Section 7(1) of Republic Act No. 1125, as amended, subject to prior review by the Secretary of Finance, as required under Republic Act No. 8424.[51] (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)
There is no dispute that what is involved in the present case is the CIR's exercise of the power to interpret tax laws under the first paragraph of Section 4 of the NIRC, as amended, which is subject to review by the Secretary of Finance:[52]
Section 4. Power of the Commissioner to Interpret Tax Laws and to Decide Tax Cases. — The power to interpret the provisions of this Code and other tax laws shall be under the exclusive and original jurisdiction of the Commissioner, subject to review by the Secretary of Finance.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is PARTLY GRANTED.

Dela Cruz-Lanuza (Leonora) filed a Petition for Declaration of Nullity of Marriage based on the lack of a valid marriage license and/or psychological incapacity with the Regional Trial Court of Caloocan City, Branch 124.[4]

Leonora was married to Alfredo M. Lanuza, Jr. (Alfredo) in June 1984. They have four children together.[5]

In her petition, Leonora said that although their marriage contract states that a marriage license was secured from the Local Civil Registry of Imus, Cavite, she did not secure any such license, nor did she appear before the same.[6]

She claimed that, although their married life started smoothly, Alfredo later showed signs of psychological incapacity which led to the marriage's breakdown.

During the hearing before the Regional Trial Court, Leonora testified that she and Alfredo met at work. They eventually married on June 9, 1984. However, they did not apply for a marriage license prior to their marriage, nor did they appear before the Local Civil Registry of Imus, Cavite.[7]

Later on, Alfredo's behavior changed. He would come home late or early morning after a night out with friends. He neglected his duty and did not provide food for the family.[8] He treated Leonora as an ordinary occupant of the house; not as his wife.[9] Alfredo also engaged in illicit affair.[10]

In 1994, Alfredo and Leonora separated.[11] It was also in 1994 when Alfredo married a certain Mary Ann Makalintal in Quezon City.[12] Thereafter, Leonora filed a complaint for bigamy against Alfredo. However, the complaint for bigamy was archived because Alfredo could not be found.[13]

Alfredo was a police officer, but was dismissed from service after he went on AWOL because of the bigamy case. The mail sent by Leonora's counsel to Alfredo was returned with a notation ""deceased,"" but there is no record regarding his death.[14]

In 2000, Alfredo married Jane Alejo, as shown by pictures posted on Facebook. He later remarried Jane in a church wedding.[15]

To support her allegation that Alfredo married two other women, Leonora attached a Certification issued by the Philippine Statistics Authority that as per the record of marriages, the name ""Alfredo Jr. Mares Lanuza"" comes out in three records:

Date of marriage: October 16, 2000
Place of marriage: Santo Domingo, Nueva Ecija
Name of Bride/Groom: JAINE P. ALEJO/ALFREDO M. LANUZA
*****
 
Date of marriage: June 09, 1984
Place of marriage: Ermita, Manila
Name of Bride/Groom: LEONORA DELA CRUZ/ALFREDO JR LANUZA
*****
 
Date of marriage: February 22, 1994
Place of marriage: Quezon City, Metro Manila (2nd District)
Name of Bride/Groom: MARY ANN DUNGCA MAKALINTAL/ALFRED JR MARES LANUZA[16]
Leonora further testified that Alfredo abandoned his family and did not provide any financial support. The only instance when Alfredo visited his children was in 1999, during the recognition day in school. However, he only stayed for less than an hour.[17]

Advised by a lawyer, Leonora underwent a psychological evaluation and the psychologist concluded that Alfredo was psychologically incapacitated to comply with his marital obligations.[18]","Unjustified absence from the marital home for decades may be considered as part of the totality of evidence that a person is psychologically incapacitated to comply with the essential obligations of marriage.

Thus, the proper mode of appeal would have been an ordinary appeal under Rule 41(a),[70] or a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 if the matters raised are purely questions of law.[71]

BALO,* FORMER PRESIDING JUDGE, BRANCH 44, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, SURALLAH, SOUTH COTABATO, RESPONDENT.","Judge Balo was appointed as Presiding Judge of Branch 44, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Surallah, South Cotabato (RTC Surallah). In addition to his official station, he was also designated as Acting Presiding Judge of Branch 19, RTC, Isulan, Sultan Kudarat (RTC Isulan).[1]

On February 14, 2020, Judge Balo was designated as full-time Acting Presiding Judge of Branch 19, RTC Isulan. Meanwhile, Judge Allan Edwin P. Boncavil (Judge Boncavil), Presiding Judge, Branch 62, RTC, Polomok, South Cotabato, was designated as Acting Presiding Judge of Branch 44, RTC Surallah on January 23, 2020.[2] Importantly, Judge Balo optionally retired on October 3, 2020.[3]

On August 13, 2020, the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) directed Judge Balo and his Branch Clerk of Court to submit a verified report on cases pending before Branch 44, RTC Surallah, which must provide information on the following: (1) cases where the defense already rested its cases, and cases submitted for decision/resolution; (2) cases with pending motions/incidents; and (3) cases that have not progressed for more than three months. The report was required in lieu of the judicial audit that is usually conducted in preparation for a judge's impending retirement.[4]

On September 7, 2020, Judge Balo and his Branch Clerk submitted a report, but it was rejected by the OCA because it did not comply with the required form. Twice, Judge Balo and his Branch Clerk requested for extensions of time to submit their report, which were both granted by the OCA. Thus, it was only on October 29, 2020 that the OCA received the Verified Report, which was almost a month after Judge Balo's optional retirement took effect on October 3, 2020.[5]

In the meantime, the OCA sent to Judge Balo the OCA Memorandum[6] dated September 30, 2020, directing him to explain, within 10 days from notice, his failure to decide/resolve the cases enumerated in the OCA Memorandum, and/or incidents pending before his official station as Presiding Judge of Branch 44, RTC Surallah. An extension of time to respond to the OCA Memorandum was requested by Judge Balo, which was granted by the OCA.[7]

Judge Balo received the OCA Memorandum on October 2, 2020, a day before his retirement on October 3, 2020. Thus, the deadline for Judge Balo's submission of his reply to the OCA Memorandum was extended from the original date of October 12, 2020, to October 27, 2020.[8]

In his Letter[9] dated October 27, 2020 (Letter), Judge Balo admitted that he incurred delay in the disposition of two criminal cases[10] pending before Branch 44, RTC Surallah, particularly by failing to immediately promulgate judgment after the accused pleaded guilty to a lesser offense. He also admitted that he incurred delay in the resolution of pending incidents in several criminal and civil cases before the same sala. He mainly pointed to heavy workload and the COVID-19 pandemic as the main reasons for the delay.[11]

However, the OCA found no merit in Judge Balo's explanations. It emphasized that Judge Balo should have requested for an extension of time to resolve the cases pending before Branch 44, RTC Surallah instead of unilaterally prolonging the disposition of the cases or resolution of the incidents pending therein. It also found that several of the delays were incurred even before the COVID-19 pandemic set in. The OCA further highlighted that Judge Balo acted without authority and with Gross Ignorance of the Law when he continued to issue orders and resolve pending incidents in Branch 44, RTC Surallah even after he was already appointed as full-time Acting Presiding Judge of Branch 19, RTC Isulan.[12]

Thus, on May 25, 2021, the OCA filed with the Judicial Integrity Board (JIB) its Memorandum,[13] recommending the conduct of inquiry on Judge Balo and that he be found guilty of Gross Ignorance of the Law and Undue Delay in Rendering Decisions or Orders. It particularly identified 7 criminal cases that were not decided within the reglementary period, 14 criminal cases with pending incidents, and 5 civil cases with pending incidents.[14]
","The Court resolves the administrative disciplinary proceedings against respondent Judge Lorenzo F. Balo (Judge Balo), charging him with Gross Ignorance of the Law and Undue Delay in Rendering Decisions or Orders.","The Court finds Judge Balo guilty of three counts of Gross Neglect of Duty and imposes upon him the penalty of fines, to be deducted from his retirement benefits.

The Court retains administrative jurisdiction over Judge Balo despite his optional retirement on October 3, 2020
 

Preliminarily, the Court finds it proper to clarify when the present administrative disciplinary proceedings were instituted against Judge Balo.","WHEREFORE, the Court finds former Judge Lorenzo F. Balo GUILTY of three counts of Gross Neglect of Duty in the Performance or Non-Performance of Official Functions and imposes upon him the penalty of fines in the amount of PHP 200,000.00 for each count of Gross Neglect of Duty, for a total aggregate of fines in the amount of PHP 600,000.00. Former Judge Lorenzo F. Balo is DIRECTED to PAY the fines imposed within a period not exceeding three months from the time of promulgation of this Decision. If unpaid within the required period, the fines imposed may be deducted from the retirement benefits, including accrued leave credits, due Judge Lorenzo F. Balo."
"G.R. No. 242133, April 16, 2024","ROSELYN AGACID Y DEJANIO* PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES AND MARIA ALEXANDRIA BISQUERRA Y NUEVA,** RESPONDENTS.
","On August 31, 2014, Maria Alexandria Bisquerra (Bisquerra) went to the Cubao Police Station to complain about her ex-partner Agacid. In her Complaint-Affidavit,[4] she narrated that she and Agacid were in a four-year relationship until they broke up in March 2014. They met again on August 31, 2014 in Starbucks, Ali Mall, Cubao, Quezon City at around 4:00 p.m. so Bisquerra could return the items that Agacid gave her during their relationship.[5]

According to Bisquerra, Agacid thought that they would talk and fix their relationship, but Bisquerra insisted on the break-up as she no longer liked Agacid. At that moment, Agacid got angry. She slapped Bisquerra and stabbed her on her right forearm with a sharp object which wounded her.[6]

Bisquerra ran away and asked for help from the guards at Ali Mall, but Agacid had already escaped. Bisquerra went to Quezon Memorial Medical Center to have her wound treated, after which she went to the Cubao Police Station to file her Complaint.[7]

Agacid was eventually charged with violation of Section 5(a) of Republic Act No. 9262 before the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City.[8] The Information reads:

That on or about the 31st day of August 2014, in Quezon City, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of the Honorable Court, the above-named accused, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously commit physical abuse upon one MARIA ALEXANDRIA BISQUERA y NUEVA, her former lover and live-in partner, by then and there slapping her and stabbing her on the forearm with a cutter causing laceration on the proximal 3rd or the right forearm, to the damage and prejudice of the said offended party.","Republic Act No. 9262 or the Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act of 2004 also applies even if the perpetrator is a woman, so long as the victim is a woman.
This Court resolves the Petition for Review[1] assailing the Court of Appeals Decision[2] which found no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Regional Trial of Court when it issued Orders[3] denying the Motion to Quash with Motion to Defer Arraignment and Pre-trial filed by Roselyn Agacid (Agacid).","While petitioner is correct that Garcia did not involve a lesbian relationship, this pronouncement has nevertheless been reiterated and affirmed in a succeeding case.

Jacinto v. Fouts[44] discussed the application of Garcia in a lesbian relationship. Jacinto involved a woman accused of violating Republic Act No. 9262 against her live-in partner who is also a woman. During trial, she also moved to quash the Information, arguing that the facts charged do not constitute an offense as the law does not apply to lesbian relationships.[45]

When the Regional Trial Court denied her motion, she went to the Supreme Court through a Rule 45 petition for review, raising the same argument.[46] Procedurally, the Court in Jacinto also reiterated the rule that:

""[t]he remedy against the denial of a motion to quash is for the movant accused to enter a plea, go to trial, and should the decision be adverse, reiterate on appeal from the final judgment and assign as error the denial of the motion to quash. The denial, being an interlocutory order, is not appealable, and may not be the subject of a petition for certiorari because of the availability of other remedies in the ordinary course of law.""[47] (Citation omitted)

In denying the petition, this Court squarely ruled that Republic Act No. 9262 applies to lesbian relationships:

Contrary to petitioner's submission that the foregoing disquisition in Garcia was a mere obiter dictum, the Court notes that one of the issues raised in Garcia is the supposed discriminatory and unjust provisions of [Republic Act No.] 9262 which are likewise violative of the equal protection clause. The foregoing discussion of the Court as to the applicability of the law to lesbian relationships is clearly a resolution of the particular issue raised in Garcia and not a mere obiter dictum or an opinion of the Court. The statement of the Court that ""[t]here is likewise no merit to the contention that [Republic Act No.] 9262 singles out the husband or father as the culprit"" further amplifies that the issue of whether [Republic Act No.] 9262 only applies to male perpetrators was indeed raised in the said case.[48] (Citation omitted)","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review is DENIED. The August 24, 2018 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 151014 is AFFIRMED. The Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 229 is ordered to proceed with the trial of Criminal Case No. R-QZN-16-10244-CR with utmost dispatch."
"G.R. No. 270564, April 16, 2024","SMARTMATIC TIM CORPORATION AND SMARTMATIC PHILIPPINES, INC., PETITIONERS, VS. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS EN BANC, ELISEO MIJARES RIO, JR., AUGUSTO CADELIÑA LAGMAN, FRANKLIN FAYLOGA YSAAC, AND LEONARDO OLIVERA ODOÑO,* RESPONDENTS.","On October 27, 2023, the COMELEC published the Invitation to Bid for the Lease of Full Automation System with Transparency Audit/Count (FASTrAC) for the 2025 NLE.[8] On October 30, 2023, Smartmatic purchased the bidding documents.[9] On November 13, 2023, SMMT-TIM 2016, Inc. (an entity related to, but separate from, Smartmatic) attended the Pre-Bid Conference.[10]

In the meantime, private respondents Eliseo Mijares Rio, Jr., Augusto Cadelina Lagman, Franklin Fayloga Ysaac, and Leonardo Olivera Odoño (Rio, Jr. et al.) filed a petition,[11] supplemental petition,[12] and second supplemental petition[13] before the COMELEC En Banc. In their petitions, Rio, Jr. et al. alleged that: (a) the transmission of the results of certain precincts preceded the printing of election results; (b) a scheme to clone vote counting machine (VCM) transmissions was shown by the fact that the logs reflect the same internet protocol (IP) address for certain machines instead of separate IP addresses; and (c) Smartmatic's affiliates and/or representatives reportedly met with the representatives of a presidential candidate while Smartmatic's Secure Electronic Transmission Services (SETS) Contract for the 2022 NLE results was still in force, in violation of Clause 5.13 of the SETS Contract.[14] Among other reliefs, Rio, Jr. et al. prayed that ""[t]he qualifications of Smartmatic be reviewed by the [Bids and Awards Committee (BAC)] in view of the serious and material irregularities in the transmission and reception of election results in the system which Smartmatic developed and provided for the [May 9, 2022] Elections,""[15] and that the COMELEC En Banc order the BAC to ""disqualify or declare ineligible Smartmatic from participating in the procurement for the 2025 Automated Election System"" if the ""serious and grave irregularities"" are not satisfactorily explained.[16]

On August 10, 2023, the COMELEC En Banc directed its Law Department to review and submit a recommendation on the petitions filed by Rio, Jr. et al.[17] On August 31, 2023, the COMELEC Law Department submitted its Compliance, opining that there is no legal basis to prohibit Smartmatic from participating in the bidding process.[18]

On October 5, 2023, the COMELEC En Banc set the case for hearing on October 17, 2023.[19] It also required Smartmatic to comment on the petitions filed by Rio, Jr. et al.[20]

During the October 17, 2023 hearing, the COMELEC En Banc required the parties to file their respective memoranda and formal offer of evidence within five days, and their respective reply memoranda within three days from receipt of the other party's memorandum.[21]

On November 29, 2023, the COMELEC En Banc ruled in favor of Rio, Jr. et al. The dispositive portion of its Resolution reads:","In exercising its constitutional mandate to enforce and administer all laws and regulations relative to the conduct of elections, plebiscites, initiatives, referenda, and recall, the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) must comply with existing laws and regulations, including Republic Act No. 9184,[1] or the Government Procurement Reform Act (GPRA), and its 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations[2] (2016 Revised IRR).
Before the Court is a Petition for Certiorari (With Extremely Urgent Application for the Issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction) With Urgent Motion for Special Raffle[3] under Rule 65, Rules of Court filed by petitioners Smartmatic TIM Corporation (Smartmatic TIM) and Smartmatic Philippines, Inc. (Smartmatic PH) (collectively referred to as Smartmatic), assailing the November 29, 2023 Resolution[4] of the COMELEC En Banc, which disqualified Smartmatic from participating in any bidding process for elections.","In so ruling, the Court does not weigh the merits of the US DOJ's allegations against Bautista. The Court merely notes that under the GPRA and its 2016 Revised IRR, the COMELEC would not have been compelled to accept the bid of a bidder which it has reasonable grounds to believe committed misrepresentation in its bidding documents and engaged in corrupt activities to secure a previous government contract.

Having declared that the COMELEC acted with grave abuse of discretion in disqualifying Smartmatic, We now determine the effects of this declaration.

To recall, the SBAC has completed the bidding process for the lease of FASTrAC for the 2025 NLE and the COMELEC has awarded the 2025 FASTrAC Contract to Miru Systems.[162] Thus, an order requiring the COMELEC to instruct the SBAC to accept Smartmatic's bid would be an exercise in futility, as there is no ongoing public bidding for FASTrAC in which Smartmatic may participate.

For reasons of equity, justice, and practicality, neither can the Court nullify the procurement activities carried out by the SBAC and order the COMELEC to conduct public bidding anew. The COMELEC's assailed Resolution has produced consequences that the Court simply cannot ignore, and the prospective application of the Court's Decision is the more prudent recourse under the circumstances.

Relying on the assailed Resolution, the SBAC prevented Smartmatic and its related entities from submitting a bid for the lease of FASTrAC and proceeded with the procurement process, eventually determining that Miru Systems was the bidder with the Single Calculated Responsive Bid and recommending that the COMELEC award Miru Systems the 2025 FASTrAC Contract.[163] As a result, the COMELEC issued the Notice of Award to Miru Systems, and executed the 2025 FASTrAC Contract with Miru Systems.[164]","ACCORDINGLY, the instant Petition is GRANTED. The Resolution of the Commission on Elections En Banc dated November 29, 2023 is REVERSED.

This ruling shall be PROSPECTIVE in application from the date of finality of this Decision.

The prayer of petitioners Smartmatic TIM Corporation and Smartmatic Philippines, Inc. for a temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction and status quo ante order is DENIED.

"G.R. No. 228357, April 16, 2024","C.P. REYES HOSPITAL AND ANGELINE M. REYES, PETITIONERS, VS. GERALDINE M. BARBOSA, RESPONDENT.
","On January 22, 2014, Barbosa filed a Complaint[7] for illegal dismissal against C.P. Reyes Hospital et al., praying for reinstatement with full backwages and the award of moral and exemplary damages, as well as attorney's fees.

In her Position Paper,[8] Barbosa alleged that she applied for the position of Training Supervisor with C.P. Reyes Hospital. In September 2013, she was instructed to sign a probationary employment contract[9] for a period of six months, from September 4, 2013 to March 4, 2014. Under the contract, Barbosa would train as a Staff Nurse for the first two months; as Ward Head Nurse and Supervisor for the next two months; and finally, as Training Supervisor for the last two months. The contract required Barbosa to ""get or maintain an average of a passing score equivalent to 80% (Satisfactory).""[10] The contract also provided that ""[f]ailure to meet the reasonable standard set by this Hospital may warrant the penalty of termination of [Barbosa's] employment.""[11]

On October 25, 2013, Barbosa alleged that Human Resource Manager Reyes and Nursing Director Joel M. Lirio (Lirio) told her that she would not be made Training Supervisor because the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Head Nurse had also applied for the position and was supposedly more qualified than her.[12]

On November 27, 2013, Barbosa received a Notice to Explain[13] from Lirio directing her to explain why no disciplinary action should be taken against her for being absent without official leave (AWOL) on November 4, 7, and 8, 2013. On the same day, Reyes told Barbosa that she will not be made a regular employee.[14]

In a Letter[15] dated November 28, 2013, Barbosa explained that she was able to notify the supervisor on duty regarding her November 4 absence, and that for the absences on November 7 and 8, she submitted a medical certificate, as well as the requisite leave forms.[16]

On November 29, 2013, Barbosa received a Letter[17] from Reyes formally terminating her probationary employment. The Letter stated:
MS. GERALDINE M. BARBOSA
Staff Nurse – Probationary

As stated on your Probationary Contract, continuous employment shall ripen only upon showing of satisfactory performance during your training period. Unfortunately, the negative performance feedback received by this office due to attitude including the attendance records reflects [sic] that you have failed to meet the reasonable standards set by the Hospital. In this regard, please be informed that your probationary contract shall end on the stated date, without renewal or regularization.

Contract Period: September 4, 2013 – March 3, 2014[18]

End Contract: December 30, 2013

       Hospital Administrator[19]
C.P. Reyes Hospital confirmed that it hired Barbosa on a probationary basis as Training Supervisor. During her employment, Barbosa's evaluators noted that while she gained passing marks,[20] she ""lacked initiative, demonstrated poor time management, needed improvement with documentation[,] and more familiarization with common nursing procedure.""[21] C.P. Reyes Hospital also alleged that Barbosa was very unreceptive of her performance evaluations and that she even accused her evaluators of deliberately giving her low marks, apparently influenced by a certain ""[Ma'am] Flor.""[22] Further, they claim that due process was complied with in Barbosa's termination because her employment was probationary, and that the two-notice rule does not apply to probationary employees.[23] Finally, C.P. Reyes Hospital alleged that Barbosa had 13[24] absences in the course of her employment, some of which were unauthorized. Thus, C.P. Reyes Hospital deemed it proper to terminate the employment of Barbosa.[25]","This resolves the Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] filed by petitioners C.P. Reyes Hospital (C.P. Reyes Hospital) and Angeline M. Reyes[2] (Reyes; collectively, C.P. Reyes Hospital et al.) assailing the Decision[3] dated April 18, 2016 and the Resolution[4] dated November 17, 2016 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 139468, which reversed and set aside the Decision[5] of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) dated September 30, 2014 in NLRC LAC No. 08-002077-14, and accordingly, declared respondent Geraldine M. Barbosa (Barbosa) to have been illegally dismissed by C.P. Reyes Hospital. In turn, the NLRC reversed the Decision[6] of the Labor Arbiter (LA) dated June 24, 2014 in NLRC NCR Case No. RAB IV-01-00097-14-B, which found Barbosa to have been illegally dismissed.","The Petition is denied.

""[T]o justify the grant of the extraordinary remedy of certiorari, petitioners must satisfactorily show that the court or quasi-judicial authority gravely abused the discretion conferred upon it. Grave abuse of discretion connotes judgment exercised in a capricious and whimsical manner that is tantamount to lack of jurisdiction. To be considered 'grave,' discretion must be exercised in a despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility, and must be so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined by or to act at all in contemplation of law.""[40]

Thus, case law instructs that ""[i]n labor cases, grave abuse of discretion may be ascribed to the NLRC when its findings and conclusions are not supported by substantial evidence, which refers to that amount of relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion. Thus, if the NLRC's ruling has basis in the evidence and the applicable law and jurisprudence, then no grave abuse of discretion exists and the CA should so declare and, accordingly, dismiss the petition.""[41]

Guided by the foregoing considerations, the Court finds that the CA correctly ruled that the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion when it held that C.P. Reyes Hospital validly terminated Barbosa's employment. Hence, its reversal of the NLRC's ruling is proper.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DENIED. The Decision dated April 18, 2016 and the Resolution dated November 17, 2016 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

Marital infidelity is one such form of domestic violence that not only transgresses the matrimonial vows of faithfulness and commitment, but also inflicts inconceivable psychological and emotional harm upon the aggrieved spouse and their children. As a form of psychological abuse, marital infidelity destroys the stability and unity of the family at its core, shatters the self-worth and trust of the betrayed spouse, and fosters deep-seated trauma borne of emotional turmoil and related mental health issues. To stem the perpetuation of the cycle of abuse, and to prevent the normalization of extramarital promiscuity in our society, the Court declares marital infidelity to be a form of psychological violence punishable under Republic Act No. 9262, otherwise known as the Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act of 2004.

Before delving into the main issue, the Court finds that a brief discussion on the historical and social contexts that underscore the necessity of Republic Act No. 9262 would be a useful aid in fully elucidating upon the merits of this case.

Violence against women is internationally recognized as a form of discrimination and violation of human rights.[40] Examining violence against women in the human rights framework reveals that the specific causes of such violence are inextricably linked to the broader context of systemic gender-based discrimination and subordination that women are forced to endure.[41] Such violence is a manifestation of the unequal power relationship between men and women, as well as widespread and deeply entrenched gender biases and prejudices against women that have historically placed women beneath men, who are thus in a position to exercise power and control over women.[42]

The discrimination and violence faced by women is an issue of global magnitude with one in three women worldwide having been subjected to either physical and/or sexual violence in their lifetime.[43] The international community has sought to address violence against women through the following conventions and international agreements.
","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DENIED. The November 8, 2019 Decision and the June 22, 2022 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 40938 are AFFIRMED.

"G.R. No. 250763, April 16, 2024","MATTHEW WESTFALL, PETITIONER, VS. MARIA CARMELA D. LOCSIN, AMY LEUNG, NORIKO OGAWA, GIL-HONG KIM, DIWESH SHARAN, RAMESH SUBRAMANIAM, KEN L. CHEE, BIBIANA VICTORIA G. FRANCISCO, TAKEHIKO NAKAO, TOSHIO OYA, MAKOTO KUBOTA, CHRISTOPHER STEPHENS, RAMIT K. NAGPAL, AND DEBORAH STOKES, RESPONDENTS.
","The Petition stemmed from a Complaint[5] for damages filed by Westfall against Locsin et al. for abuse of right and statements allegedly defamatory and damaging to Westfall's professional reputation. Westfall specifically referred to statements in the VP Panel Notes[6] and Interview Report[7] describing his knowledge, experience, and capabilities. These documents were prepared by the Screening Committee (SC) for the position of Technical Advisor (Urban and Water) in the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Respondents Locsin et al. were members of the SC. Westfall, a former staff of the ADB, applied for the position but was not selected.

Aggrieved, Westfall resorted to ADB's internal grievance process on the ground that the selection process violated ADB's administrative procedures. He pointed to two documents from ADB that contained allegedly defamatory statements:
The first document was a redacted copy of the VP Panel Notes[8] dated February 16, 2015 prepared by the SC. The document stated that ""Mr. Westfall has been away from the urban sector work for quite some time and he has not kept his knowledge current.""[9] Westfall considered this as ""highly disparaging, grossly inaccurate and factually incorrect.""[10] According to Westfall, the Notes included ""highly defamatory language that maliciously maligned [Westfall's] reputation, imputed upon him alleged defects in his credentials and discredited his person and professional background.""[11]

The second document was the Interview Report,[12] likewise prepared by the SC, containing notes on Westfall's interview. He claimed that the Interview Report contained unfounded, deeply malicious, and false statements, as the statements failed to accurately reflect his strong performance evaluations and years of professional contributions to ADB.[13]
Petitioner also filed a criminal complaint for libel against the SC.

In their defense, Locsin et al. averred that, as ADB officers and employees, they are immune from all legal processes of any kind with respect to acts performed in their official capacities.[14] They further claimed that the complaint failed to state a cause of action with respect to respondents Takehiko Nakao, Toshio Oya, Makoto Kubota, Christopher Stephens, Ramit K. Nagpal, and Deborah Stokes (Nakao et al.).

Westfall countered that diplomatic immunity does not extend to respondents' allegedly abusive and criminal acts.[15] Also, both the complaint and annexes must be considered in resolving a motion to dismiss based on failure to state a cause of action.[16]

Sustaining Locsin et al.'s defenses of functional immunity and failure to state a cause of action, Branch 138, Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Makati City dismissed the complaint.[17] The RTC held that Locsin et al. have immunities with respect to acts performed in their official capacities. It then concluded that they ""acted in the performance of their official duties for the nature of their work necessitated a discussion and recording of the candidate's merits and demerits.""[18] The RTC further ruled that the complaint failed to state a cause of action with respect to respondents Nakao, et al.[19]

Westfall moved for reconsideration, but the RTC denied his motion.[20] On certiorari with the Court of Appeals (CA), the CA denied the petition for lack of merit.[21] It ruled that whether Locsin et al. acted in their official capacity is a question of fact, and, therefore, outside the purview of a Rule 65 petition.[22] However, even if the CA were to review the question of fact, it is convinced that there is sufficient evidence that Locsin et al., as members of the SC, were acting in their official capacity and within the scope of their authority.[23] The CA also affirmed the RTC's finding that the complaint failed to state a cause of action against Nakao et al.[24]","Functional immunity does not extend to all acts and utterances made by officials and personnel of the Asian Development Bank. The protection is limited, applying only to acts performed in an official capacity. Where the act is ultra vires, such as a crime or an act contrary to law, immunity does not apply. Courts have the power and duty to inquire into the factual basis of the invoked protection.

As a preliminary matter, We emphasize that the Court En Banc is not an appellate court to which decisions or resolutions of the divisions may be appealed.[43] Nonetheless, under exceptional circumstances, a case may be elevated to the En Banc, such as when a case raises novel questions of law or is of sufficient importance.[44]

We find these considerations present here. There s a dearth of jurisprudence on the nature and scope of immunities enjoyed by international organizations and their personnel. Moreover, the distinction among state, diplomatic, organizational, and functional immunities has not been clearly articulated in previous cases, thus lending confusion on the permissible actions that courts may take when immunity is invoked.

Nonetheless, the motion to set the case for oral arguments is denied for lack of merit. As will be shown, the records are sufficient to finally resolve the issue presented in the case at bar. Thus, We find no need to conduct oral arguments.","After a thorough review and consideration of the arguments raised in the Motions, coupled with a second look at the documents and admissions on record, the Court resolves to partly grant the Motions insofar as they pray for the referral of the case to the Court En Banc and the reversal of the assailed April 27, 2022 Resolution.

","These consolidated cases draw their collective origin from the anomalies which avowedly attended the utilization and disbursement of the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) allocations of Clarete for the years 2007 to 2009.

In its SAO Report No. 2012-03, the Special Audits Office (SAO) of the Commission on Audit (COA) found that during the Calendar Years 2007 to 2009, the PDAF was not properly released by the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) and several implementing agencies (IA) did not appropriately, efficiently, and effectively utilize the PDAF. As it happened, the DBM released the funds for projects identified by the legislators notwithstanding that such projects were to be implemented outside the legislative districts of the sponsoring legislators. It further discovered that the funds released to the IAs for the implementation of projects did not pertain to the IAs' mandated functions. Moreso, the IAs failed to comply with existing laws and rules and regulations in the disbursement of funds.[13]

On the strength of the SAO Report No. 2012-03, and upon the independent field validations that the OMB itself conducted, the OMB­ Mindanao Field Investigation Unit filed a Complaint,[14] docketed as OMB-C­ C-14-0248, against Clarete and several other government officials and employees, private individuals, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).[15] The accused were alleged to have acted in conspiracy to misuse Clarete's PDAF allocations covered by the following Special Allotment Release Orders (SAROs) and Notices of Cash Allocation (NCAs):

SARO No. ROCS-07-07894 dated October 10, 2007 under NCA No. 349022-2 dated December 20, 2007;
SARO No. ROCS-08-04170 dated May 8, 2008 under NCA No. 363223-0 dated June 12, 2008;
SARO No. ROCS-08-00596 dated January 10, 2008 under NCA No. 362406-2 dated March 6, 2008;
SARO No. ROCS-09-04240 dated June 25, 2009;
SARO No. ROCS-08-08961 dated November 4, 2008 under NCA No. 377716-3 dated December 9, 2008;
SARO No. ROCS-09-03611 dated May 26, 2009 under NCA No. 381431-1 dated July 1, 2009; and
SARO No. D-08-01438 dated February 8, 2008 under NCA No. 252804-6 dated February 15, 2008.[16]
During the subject period, the DBM released Clarete's PDAF totaling to PHP 65 million to the IAs she identified and after the DBM issued the corresponding SAROs and NCAs to the IAs, Clarete endorsed the following NGOs as ""project partners"" for the implementation of the Integrated Livelihood Development Projects in her congressional district:

Kabuhayan at Kalusugang Alay sa Masa Foundation, Inc. (KKAMFI)
Kasangga sa Magandang Bukas Foundation, Inc. (KMBFI)
Aaron Foundation Philippines, Inc. (AFPI)[17]
Thereupon, the funds representing the cost of the projects/activities covered by the PHP 65-million PDAF of Clarete, i.e., livelihood technology kits (LTKs), farm input packages, and livelihood training course packages (LTCPs), were transferred from the IAs to the foregoing NGOs pursuant to the Memorandum of Agreements (MOAs) between Clarete, the IAs, as well as the NGOs. Theoretically, after the execution of such MOAs, the projects/activities were ripe for distribution by the NGOs to the identified beneficiaries in the municipalities of the First District of Misamis Oriental. However, no distribution was ever made by the NGOs.[18]","At the pith of the instant controversy are three separate Petitions for Certiorari anchored on a common factual backdrop and hinged upon interrelated issues involving the same parties.
A diegeses of the Petitions follow.

1.
The Petition for Certiorari[1] in G.R. No. 232968 was filed by petitioner Marina P. Clarete (Clarete), former Representative of the First District of Misamis Occidental, 14th Congress. It seeks to nullify and set aside the Resolution[2] and the Order[3] of the Office of the Ombudsman (OMB) in OMB-C-C-14-0248. In the challenged Resolution, the OMB found probable cause to charge Clarete and her co-accused with 18 counts of violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019,[4] seven counts of malversation of public funds, and 11 counts of malversation of public funds through falsification. On the other hand, the Order of the OMB denied Clarete's Motion for Reconsideration;[5]
 	 
2.
In his Petition for Certiorari[6] in G.R. No. 232974, petitioner Arthur Cua Yap (Yap), former Secretary of the Department of Agriculture (DA), inveighs against the same OMB issuances[7] assailed in G.R. No. 232968; and
 	 
3.
Finally, via another Petition for Certiorari[8] docketed as G.R. Nos. 238584–87, Yap impugns the two Resolutions issued by the Sandiganbayan (SBN) in SB-17-CRM-1510-1545, where he stood accused of two counts of violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019, one count of malversation of public funds, and one count of malversation through falsification. The first SBN Resolution[9] struck down Yap's Motion for Partial Reconsideration with Motion to Quash Informations,[10] while the subsequent Resolution[11] denied his Motion for Reconsideration thereof.[12]","The Petitions for Certiorari docketed as G.R. No. 232968 and G.R. No. 232974 ought to be dismissed on the ground of mootness.

In Relampagos v. Sandiganbayan,[44] citing People v. Castillo,[45] this Court distinguished the two kinds of determination of probable cause and shed light on the corresponding effect of an ensuing judicial determination of probable cause, viz.:

The executive determination of probable cause is one made during preliminary investigation. It is a function that properly pertains to the public prosecutor who is given a broad discretion to determine whether probable cause exists and to charge those whom he believes to have committed the crime as defined by law and thus should be held for trial. Otherwise stated, such official has the quasi-judicial authority to determine whether or not a criminal case must be filed in court. Whether or not that function has been correctly discharged by the public prosecutor, i.e., whether or not he has made a correct ascertainment of the existence of probable cause in a case, is a matter that the trial court itself does not and may not be compelled to pass upon.

The judicial determination of probable cause, on the other hand, is one made by the judge to ascertain whether a warrant of arrest should be issued against the accused. The judge must satisfy himself that based on the evidence submitted, there is necessity for placing the accused under custody in order not to frustrate the ends of justice. If the judge finds no probable cause, the judge cannot be forced to issue the arrest warrant.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petitions for Certiorari, docketed as G.R. No. 232968 and G.R. No. 232974, are DISMISSED on the ground of mootness.

On the other hand, the Petition for Certiorari filed by Arthur Cua Yap in G.R. Nos. 238584-87 is GRANTED. Accordingly, the Resolutions dated November 28, 2017 and March 1, 2018 of the Sandiganbayan (SBN) in SB-17-CRM-1510-1545 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Yap's Motion for Partial Reconsideration (Re: Resolution dated 15 August 2017) with Motion to Quash Informations is GRANTED and the cases against him before the Sandiganbayan, docketed as SB-17-CRM-1526, SB-17-CRM-1527, SB-17-CRM-1531, and SB-17-CRM-1544, are hereby DISMISSED."
" G.R. No. 257871, April 15, 2024 ","HJA FERWINA JIKIRI AMILHAMJA, ANANG AGANG HAWANG, NENITA PINO AGUIL, AUDIE SINCO JANEA, AND ABDURASA SARIOL ARASID,* PETITIONERS, VS. OMBUDSMAN-MINDANAO, FIELD INVESTIGATION UNIT, REPRESENTED BY: LIWAYWAY SUMAGAYSAY-RONDINA, RESPONDENT.","Arasid, in his capacity as President of Sulu State College (SSC), issued a Memorandum[6] dated May 10, 2011, requesting the SSC Board of Trustees (SSC-BOT) to formulate a resolution to purchase physics, computer engineering, and agricultural equipment (subject items) with funds sourced from SSC's local income. Pursuant to his request, the SSC­-BOT issued Resolution No. 19[7] on May 12, 2011, setting aside the amount of PHP 20,000,000.00 to be paid in quarterly installments for two years. The following day, SSC's Bids and Awards Committee (BAC), composed of Amilhamja, as Chairperson, and Hawang, Aguil, Janea, and Joseph Pescadera (Pescadera), as members, issued Resolution No. 3, Series of 2011,[8] approving the publication of the Invitation to Bid for the subject items.[9]

The BAC caused the publication of an Invitation to Apply for Eligibility and to Bid (IAEB) in the Zamboanga Star.[10] On May 25, 2011, the BAC issued Resolution No. 4, Series of 2011,[11] stating that only one prospective bidder, State Alliance Enterprises, Inc.[12] (SAEI), applied for eligibility check; and that it is the exclusive distributor of the subject items willing to deliver them and to be paid on installment basis. The BAC recommended that SSC should negotiate with SAEI as the lone bidder, after finding the latter's bid to be advantageous to SSC.[13]
 
On May 30, 2011, SSC and SAEI entered into a Contract of Agreement for the purchase of tractor, shovel, water hose, grass cutter, knapsack sprayer, wheelbarrow, bolos, magnetism, and electrostatics EST. The total purchase price was PHP 22,000,000.00, to be paid in installments from 2011 to 2014.[14]

On November 28, 2011, some parents and students of SSC wrote the Regional Director of the Commission on Audit (COA) requesting an investigation on the alleged illegal procurement of school computers and agricultural equipment for PHP 22,000,000.00.[15]

On December 13, 2011, the SSC-BOT issued Resolution No. 56, Series of 2011,[16] confirming the authority of Arasid, as President of SSC, to enter into a contract with SAEI through a loan extended by the latter for the purchase of the subject items.[17]

Meanwhile, the COA made the following findings after investigating the purchase made by SSC: first, the public bidding was insufficient and did not comply with Republic Act No. (RA) 9184, or the ""Government Procurement Reform Act"";[18] second, the Zamboanga Star was not a publication of national circulation; and third, the BAC should have declared a failure of the bidding process as there was only one bidder. Instead, the contract was immediately awarded to the lone bidder.[19]

On June 15, 2015, the COA issued a Notice of Disallowance[20] of the transaction due to the following violations: first, only PHP 3,950,000.00 was appropriated for equipment outlay under SSC's corporate operating budget (COB) for calendar year 2011; second, no appropriation was made for capital outlay in the ""General Appropriations Act for 2011;"" third, there was no certification of availability of funds, as required under Sections 46 and 47 of Executive Order No. (EO) 292,[21] or the ""Administrative Code of 1987;"" fourth, Section 48 of Presidential Decree No. (PD) 1445,[22] or the ""Government Auditing Code of the Philippines,"" sanctions officials who enter into a void contract; and finally, the change of the installment term from two years to three years and the increase of the amount to PHP 22,000,000.00 required a BOT resolution.[23]

Subsequently, the Field Investigation Unit of the OMB-Mindanao, respondent herein, filed administrative charges of Grave Misconduct against petitioners and Pescadera.[24]","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] filed by Hja[2] Ferwina Jikiri Amilhamja (Amilhamja), Anang Agang Hawang (Hawang), Nenita Pino Aguil (Aguil), Audie Sinco Janea (Janea), and Abdurasa Sariol Arasid (Arasid) (collectively, petitioners) assailing the Decision[3] and Resolution[4] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 157038. The CA affirmed with modification the Decision[5] of the Office of the Ombudsman (OMB) in OMB-M-A-17-0268.","The Court modifies the ruling of the CA.

Misconduct is the ""transgression of some established and definite rule of action, more particularly, unlawful behavior or gross neglect of duty by a public officer.""[43] It is grave if the elements of corruption, willful intent to violate the law, or flagrant disregard of established rules are present.[44] Corruption consists in the act of an official who unlawfully or wrongfully uses his or her station or character to procure some benefit for himself or herself, contrary to the rights of others.[45] Flagrant disregard of established rules, as analogous to willful intent to violate the law, is when the public official or employee concerned, through culpable acts or omission, clearly manifests a pernicious tendency to ignore the law or rules.[46] Flagrant disregard of established rules may also be characterized by the employees' propensity to ignore the rules as clearly manifested by their actions.[47]

The Court agrees with the CA that Amilhamja, Hawang, Aguil, and Janea did not comply with several requirements under RA 9184. First, they neither mentioned nor submitted evidence that they prepared the bidding documents required under Article VI, Section 17[48] of RA 9184. Second, they similarly failed to state or prove that they conducted a pre­-procurement conference required under Article VII, Section 20[49] of RA 9184. Third, they also did not prove that there was a representative from the COA and two observers during all stages of the procurement process, as mandated by Article V, Section 13[50] of RA 9184. Fourth, the IAEB was published in the Zamboanga Star, which is not a newspaper of general nationwide circulation.[50] Finally, petitioners recommended that SSC should negotiate with SAEI even though the purchase of the subject items does not qualify for negotiated procurement under Article XVI, Section 53[51] of RA 9184. Notably, Article X, Section 36 of RA 9184 allows a single calculated/rated and responsive bid submission ""[i]f after advertisement, only one prospective bidder submits a Letter of Intent and/or applies for eligibility check, and meets the eligibility requirements or criteria, after which it submits a bid, which is found to be responsive to the bidding requirements."" As such, petitioners need not have recommended negotiation with SAEI if it complied with the eligibility requirements and submitted a responsive bid.","WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED. The Decision dated September 2, 2020 and Resolution dated October 26, 2021 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 157038 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION in that:

"G.R. No. 267795, April 15, 2024","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. JOSE P. RAGUDO, JR., ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","Nancy A. Cacayorin (Cacayorin) was an employee at the Go Group of Companies, while Ragudo was a gate keeper in the compound where the company office is located.[4]

Ragudo was charged with murder, qualified theft, and alarms and scandals in the respective Informations for Criminal Case Nos. 5036-18, 5037-18, and 5038-18, thus:","This Court resolves an appeal[1] filed by Jose P. Ragudo, Jr. (Ragudo), assailing the Decision[2] of the Court of Appeals (CA) which affirmed the Judgment[3] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) that found him guilty of murder and theft.","We modify the conviction in Criminal Case No. 5036-18 from murder to homicide and modify the penalty for the conviction in Criminal Case No. 5037-18 for theft.

To begin, this Court finds that Ragudo's defense of insanity must fail.

Article 12 of the Revised Penal Code provides that one of the circumstances that is exempt from criminal liability is when a person is insane, unless they have acted during a lucid interval.

Insanity in the context of this exempting circumstance is defined in People v. Formigones[117] as being ""deprived completely of reason or discernment and freedom of the will at the time of committing the crime.""[118]

In determining whether a defense of insanity may prosper, this Court laid down the following three-way test in People v. Paña,[119] thus, clarifying the guidelines in Formigones:

Considering the foregoing, we clarify the guidelines laid down in Formigones. Under this test, the insanity defense may prosper if: (1) the accused was unable to appreciate the nature and quality or the wrongfulness of his or her acts; (2) the inability occurred at the time of the commission of the crime; and (3) it must be as a result of a mental illness or disorder.

We now use a three-way test: first, insanity must be present at the time of the commission of the crime; second, insanity, which is the primary cause of the criminal act, must be medically proven; and third, the effect of the insanity is the inability to appreciate the nature and quality or wrongfulness of the act.[120] (Emphasis supplied)

As to the kind of evidence to prove insanity, both ordinary and expert witnesses may testify, although the nature of the mental illness of a person may be best identified by experts with specialized knowledge, thus:

Insanity, as an exempting circumstance, must be shown medically, unless there are extraordinary circumstances and there is no other evidence available. Our procedural rules allow ordinary witnesses to testify on the ""mental sanity of a person with whom [they are] sufficiently acquainted,"" but reports and evaluation from medical experts have greater evidentiary value in determining an accused's mental state. The nature and degree of an accused's mental illness can be best identified by medical experts equipped with specialized knowledge to diagnose a person's mental health.[121] (Citations omitted)","ACCORDINGLY, the appeal is hereby DENIED. The September 29, 2022 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 13991 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION.

That on or about the 2nd day of December 2015, in the City of Taguig, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, armed with a gun, with intent to kill and with the qualifying circumstance of treachery, did, then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously shot (sic) one JEROME SUMULONG y GAPASIN, hitting him on his left forearm, thereby commencing the commission of the crime of Murder directly by overt acts but failed to perform all the acts of execution which would have produced the crime of murder by reason of cause/s other than his own spontaneous desistance, that is, the injuries suffered by the victim was not fatal.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[8]

Upon arraignment, accused-appellant, who was assisted by counsel, entered a plea of ""Not Guilty"" to both charges.[9]

Trial followed.[10]","This resolves the appeal[1] under Rule 122 of the Rules of Court of accused-appellant Nelson Sia, Jr. y Aculña (accused-appellant) seeking a reversal of the Decision[2] dated March 10, 2021, of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R.

The CA affirmed with modification the Joint Decision[3] dated May 8, 2019, of Branch 153, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Taguig City in Criminal Case Nos. 158545-TG and 158546-TG that convicted accused-appellant of the crime of Murder, as defined and penalized under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code;[4] and Attempted Murder, as defined and penalized under the Revised Penal Code, Article 248 in relation to Article 51.[5]","The appeal is denied for lack of merit. However, the award of damages by the CA in Criminal Case No. 158546-TG must be modified to make it conform to law and jurisprudence.

I.
The courts a quo correctly relied upon the testimony of the prosecution witnesses in finding that accused-appellant is the perpetrator of the crimes.
There is no merit to accused-appellant's allegation that the prosecution witnesses could not have identified him as the assailant because it was dark when the incident occurred early morning of December 2, 2015. To the contrary, the prosecution witnesses were able to positively identify accused-appellant as the perpetrator of the crimes charged because the scene of the crime was fairly lit by a street light, as pointed out by the courts a quo.

The Court agrees with the RTC and the CA that the street light was sufficient to produce favorable conditions for visibility and the identification of accused-appellant as the perpetrator of the crimes. Indeed, illumination from a street light, lamp post, kerosene or wick lamp, moonlight, starlight, flashlight, torch, and lighting from a nearby establishment, have all been deemed sufficient for visibility and identification of the accused as the perpetrator of the crime charged against him or her.[76]

Pertinently, the Court has held that when the conditions of visibility are favorable and the witness does not appear to foster any ill motive against the accused, his or her testimony as to the manner of the commission of the crime and the identity of the perpetrator must be accepted.[77]","ACCORDINGLY, the appeal is DENIED for lack of merit.

Subsequently, Manalo, Victor Eraño Manalo Hemedez (Hemedez), Jonathan S. Ledesma (Ledesma), and several other individuals were placed in detention. Several Informations were then filed at the Office of the City Prosecutor of Quezon City (OCP-QC), including a charge for illegal possession of firearms and ammunition under Section 28(b) of Republic Act No. 10591 docketed as Criminal Case No. R-QZN-17-03231-CR.[5] The accusatory portion of the Information[6] against Manalo states:

To recall, petitioner's Motion to Quash Amended Information was anchored on the ground of double jeopardy that is found in Rule 117, Section 3(i) of the Rules of Court.[55] The requisites of double jeopardy are enumerated in Rule 117, Section 7 of the Rules of Court, which states:
SECTION 7. Former conviction or acquittal; double jeopardy. — When an accused has been convicted or acquitted, or the case against him dismissed or otherwise terminated without his express consent by a court of competent jurisdiction, upon a valid complaint or information or other formal charge sufficient in form and substance to sustain a conviction and after the accused had pleaded to the charge, the conviction or acquittal of the accused or the dismissal of the case shall be a bar to another prosecution for the offense charged, or for any attempt to commit the same or frustration thereof, or for any offense[,] which necessarily includes or is necessarily included in the offense charged in the former complaint or information. (Emphasis in the original)
Based on the foregoing, double jeopardy exists when the following requisites concur: (1) a first jeopardy attached prior to the second; (2) the first jeopardy has been validly terminated; and (3) a second jeopardy is for the same offense as in the first.[56]

The first jeopardy attaches: (1) after a valid indictment; (2) before a competent court; (3) after arraignment; (4) when a valid plea has been entered; and (5) when the accused was acquitted or convicted, or the case was dismissed or otherwise terminated without their express consent.[57]

In the present case, the insistence of petitioner that double jeopardy exists is misplaced. As correctly determined by the CA, the elements for the first jeopardy to attach were not established. The fourth and fifth elements are not present as it was not shown that petitioner had entered a valid plea on the prior charge and that he had been either convicted or acquitted, or that the case against him was dismissed or terminated without his express consent.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DENIED. The assailed July 13, 2022 Decision and December 19, 2022 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 166960 are AFFIRMED..

The Amended Information in Criminal Case No. R-QZN-17-03231-CR is ADMITTED. The Regional Trial Court, Branch 216, Quezon City is ORDERED to proceed with the arraignment and pre-trial of Felix Nathaniel ""Angel"" Villanueva Manalo II with dispatch."
"G.R. No. 258269, April 15, 2024","JOSE ANTONIO PAULO I. REYES, PETITIONER, VS. SAMSUNG ELECTRONIC PHILS. CORP., KEVIN LEE, MINSU CHU, AND SILVER FUNGO, RESPONDENTS.","Reyes was the country manager of Ruckus Wireless, a company specializing in wireless networking solutions. On December 29, 2016, Reyes was asked by Samsung Electronic Philippines Corporation (Samsung) to consider joining its Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) Division. He was personally invited by Samsung President and/or Managing Director Kevin Lee (Lee).[7] Through a letter,[8] Samsung formally offered Reyes the position of WLAN Head/National Sales Manager albeit subject to a probationary period.

Reyes eventually decided to join Samsung and was to receive a monthly compensation that matched his previous salary at Ruckus Wireless, amounting to PHP 470,000.00.[9] Reyes then signed the Probationary Contract of Employment[10] and Contract of Employment: Side Agreement Benefits.[11]

After a few months, Samsung informed Reyes in a letter[12] through its IT and Mobile Team (IMT) Acting Head, Rhinn Piczon (Piczon), that he failed to meet the standards for regularization and that his probationary employment would be terminated effective September 27, 2017. Attached to the letter was Reyes' Performance Evaluation Form,[13] which revealed that his overall assessment yielded a score of 4.08—with 5 being the lowest—or a ""needs improvement"" rating.[14]

Reyes subsequently filed a Complaint before the LA against Samsung for illegal dismissal, nonpayment of 13th month pay, regularization, moral and exemplary damages, and attorney's fees. He also impleaded Lee, Senior Business Director Minsu Chu (Chu), and Director for Human Relations Silver Fungo (Fungo), as officers of Samsung (Samsung et al.).[15]

Reyes mainly asserted that he was not informed of the performance standards to qualify as a regular employee at the time of his engagement. After signing the employment contract, he allegedly sought clarification from Chu regarding the employment standards, but the latter purportedly gave him vague responses such as ""do what you think is right"" and that Reyes must perform the job based on his own assessment. He was also supposedly assured by Fungo that the probationary period was just a formality.[16]

On the other hand, Samsung et al. asserted that Reyes was apprised of the standards and qualifications at the time of his employment. They also claimed to have regularly reinforced these standards in their weekly leadership team, supply chain management, and consensus meetings.[17]

Samsung et al. further contended that since Reyes held the position of National Sales Manager, it was implied that he should adhere to certain expectations for someone in that role. Stated differently, Reyes had certain responsibilities and expectations that were implied and should have been understood by someone in that role. These expectations included avoiding conflicts with team members, familiarizing oneself with the company's internal procedures and work to be done, and maintaining a professional demeanor in the workplace. Reyes failed to observe all of these.[18]

Samsung et al. claimed that they expected Reyes, as National Sales Manager, to be more aware of his role as a leader among the sales personnel and to act accordingly, but Reyes did not meet these expectations. Consequently, Samsung et al. held performance feedback discussions with Reyes on June 26 and 27, 2017 to give him the opportunity to address his deficiencies, but these attempts were also unsuccessful.[19]

Essentially, Samsung et al. argued that Reyes failed to meet the reasonable standards set for him to qualify as a regular employee, and that even if he became one, he was still validly dismissed due to Samsung's loss of trust and confidence in him.[20]","This Court resolves the Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] filed by Jose Antonio Paolo I. Reyes (Reyes) assailing the Decision[2] and the Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA). These dispositions upheld the Decision[4] and the Resolution[5] of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC), which affirmed the Labor Arbiter (LA)'s Decision[6] declaring Reyes to have been validly dismissed from his probationary employment.","The Petition is bereft of merit.

Prefatorily, in labor cases, a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 is limited to reviewing whether the CA correctly determined the presence or absence of grave abuse of discretion as well as other jurisdictional errors committed by the NLRC.[43] ""As such, when a decision of the CA under a Rule 65 petition is brought to this Court by way of a petition for review under Rule 45, only questions of law may be entertained. [After all,] [t]his Court is not a trier of facts.""[44] Our ruling in Montoya v. Transmed[45] is instructive in explaining this limitation, thus:
In a Rule 45 review, we consider the correctness of the assailed CA decision, in contrast with the review for jurisdictional error that we undertake under Rule 65. Furthermore, Rule 45 limits us to the review of questions of law raised against the assailed CA decision. In ruling for legal correctness, we have to view the CA decision in the same context that the petition for certiorari it ruled upon was presented to it; we have to examine the CA decision from the prism of whether it correctly determined the presence or absence of grave abuse of discretion in the NLRC decision before it, not on the basis of whether the NLRC decision on the merits of the case was correct. In other words, we have to be keenly aware that the CA undertook a Rule 65 review, not a review on appeal, of the NLRC decision challenged before it. This is the approach that should be basic in a Rule 45 review of a CA ruling in a labor case. In question form, the question to ask is: Did the CA correctly determine whether the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion in ruling on the case?[46] (Citations omitted, emphasis supplied)
While there exist exceptions to this rule,[47] none of these are applicable to the case at hand.

Here, the crux of the controversy lies in the question of whether petitioner was made aware of the reasonable standards for regularization at the time of his engagement—which is clearly a question of fact.

This Court notes that the findings of the LA, the NLRC, and the CA are one in that petitioner was adequately informed of the regularization standards. Settled is the principle that ""findings of fact of administrative agencies and quasi-judicial bodies, which have acquired expertise because their jurisdiction is confined to specific matters, are generally accorded not only respect, but finality when affirmed by the CA.""[48] These findings merit full respect and should not be altered, modified, or reversed without justifiable grounds.[49] Here, We find no cogent reason to depart from the court a quo's findings.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DENIED. The August 26, 2020 Decision and the July 28, 2021 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA G.R. SP No. 159808 are AFFIRMED WITH MODIFICATION. The Complaint for Illegal Dismissal against respondents Samsung Electronic Phils., Corp., Kevin Lee, Minsu Chu, and Silver Fungo is DISMISSED. Nonetheless, respondent Samsung Electronic Phils., Corp., is ORDERED TO PAY petitioner Jose Antonio Paulo Ignacio Reyes his proportionate 13th month pay of PHP 235,000.00, plus legal interest at the rate of 6% per annum to be computed from the date of finality of this Decision until full payment."

A.M. No. MTJ-23-014 [Formerly JIB FPI No. 21-024-MTJ]
Hon. Sharon M. Alamada[1] (Judge Alamada), Vice-Executive Judge and Presiding Judge of Branch 3, Municipal Trial Court in Cities (MTCC), Calamba City, Laguna, filed the Complaint,[2] dated June 1, 2021, against Hon. Leah Angeli B. Vasquez-Abad (Judge Abad), Executive Judge and Presiding Judge of Branch 1, MTCC, Calamba City, Laguna, charging the latter of Gross Ignorance of the Law and Rules of Procedure.

Judge Alamada alleged that on April 20, 2021, the Office of the City Prosecutor filed four Informations, docketed as Criminal Case Nos. 65207-21 to 65210-21, all against Jeffrey Ostil Tamayo (Tamayo). On April 22, 2021, Tamayo applied for bail by posting a bond. Thereafter, Judge Abad made an assessment of probable cause and issued an Order, dismissing motu proprio three out of the four cases prior to their raffle, as follows: Criminal Case No. 65207-21—Resistance and Disobedience; Criminal Case No. 65209-21—Violation of Section 56(e) of Republic Act No. 4136;[3] and Criminal Case No. 65210-21—Simple Disobedience, which are all governed by the Rule on Summary Procedure.[4]

On April 26, 2021, Criminal Case No. 65208-21, which was for violation of a city ordinance, was subsequently raffled to Judge Alamada. Tamayo pleaded guilty during the hearing on the following day.[5]

According to Judge Alamada, Judge Abad's action in determining probable cause when Tamayo applied for bail is an exercise of adjudicatory power which cannot be exercised by an Executive Judge, pursuant to the Rules. It is also contrary to the following: (1) Administrative Matter No. 05-08-26-SC, where the power to conduct preliminary investigation from judges of First Level Courts was removed; (2) A.M. No. 03-8-02-SC, particularly the definition of the prerogatives and duties of Executive Judges; (3) Section 12 paragraph (b) of the Revised Rule on Summary Procedure; and (4) the Court's ruling in the case of Crespo v. Mogul,[6] where it was held that once a complaint or Information is filed in court, any disposition of the case as to its dismissal or conviction or acquittal of the accused rests in the sound discretion of the court.[7]

During the raffle on April 26, 2021, Judge Abad did not initially join the raffle through video conferencing, and Judge Alamada presided. However, as there was an issue with regard to the raffle, Judge Abad eventually joined. During the raffle, it was mentioned that the issue involving the Executive Judge's power will be elevated to the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) for guidance over the matter.[8]

In the afternoon of the same day, Judge Alamada sent an e-mail to then Deputy Court Administrator, now Court Administrator, Raul B. Villanueva (Court Administrator Villanueva), requesting for clarification on the matter. In his response, Court Administrator Villanueva stated that:

To be clear, the role of [Judge Abad] regarding newly-filed cases are to have them raffled. If bail is being applied before raffle, the Guidelines on the Decongestion of Holding Jails require her to raffle the case immediately and she cannot act thereon if the case was not raffled to her, much less determine the existence or absence of probable cause. The [Executive Judge] only acts on applications for bail for raffled cases to courts where all the Judges are not around or when the [Executive Judge] is the pairing court wherein the Judge is absent.[9]

Judge Alamada alleged that this is not the first time that Judge Abad was grossly ignorant of the rules and the law. On January 19, 2018, when an accused who was caught in flagrante was applying for bail, Judge Abad made a determination of probable cause. She did not require the accused to post bail and immediately ordered his release without bail. Since the said case was raffled to Judge Alamada, she was able to rectify it. However, as claimed by Judge Alamada, the three cases which were motu proprio dismissed were not initially included in the raffle; thus, there will be no opportunity for her to rectify the mistake.[10]

Lastly, Judge Alamada argued that the imposition of preventive suspension against Judge Abad is imperative as there is a strong likelihood of the latter's guilt of the serious charge of Gross Ignorance of the Law and Rules of Procedure.[11]

In her Comment,[12] dated September 10, 2021, Judge Abad asserted that she exercised good faith in dismissing Criminal Case Nos. 65207-21, 65209-21, and 65210-21. According to Judge Abad, Criminal Case No. 65207-21, for Resistance and Disobedience to Authority, was dismissed as the second element of the crime—that the offender resists or seriously disobeys such person in authority or his agent—was not present in this case, and that there is no allegation in the Information that the Barangay Police Security Officers gave any direct order to Tamayo which the latter seriously disobeyed.[13]

Criminal Case No. 65209-21, for Violation of Section 56(a) of Republic Act No. 4136, otherwise known as the Land Transportation and Traffic Code, was dismissed for being premature as the case should have been initially reported to the Traffic Adjudication Service of the Land Transportation Office (LTO).[14] Judge Abad also found that the apprehending officer failed to show that he had the express authority from the Commissioner of the LTO or his Deputies to file the case in court.

Criminal Case No. 65210-21, for Simple Disobedience, was dismissed as the second element of the crime—that the offender disobeys such agent of a person in authority, was not present in this case as there is no allegation in the Information that the police officers gave a direct order to Tamayo which the latter disobeyed.[15]

Judge Abad claimed that her action in issuing the Orders, dated April 22, 2021, was borne out of ""ingrained practice of studying immediately the records of the cases whenever an Information is filed."" More so, this practice of studying and evaluating the records is further observed when an application for bail is filed, even before the Branches 2 and 3 [of the MTCC] were organized.""[16]

Judge Abad maintained that her Orders dismissing the three criminal cases were issued in good faith and with due regard to Supreme Court Administrative Circular No. 33-2020,[17] dated March 31, 2020. She also cited OCA Circular No. 89-2020, dated April 3, 2020, which suspended the raffle of newly-filed cases and required the Judge-on-Duty to resolve all urgent matters brought before him or her, in accordance with A.C. No. 33-2020, which included the determination of probable cause.[18]",Before the Court are four consolidated administrative cases involving closely-related sets of facts and identical parties.,"In administrative proceedings, the quantum of proof necessary for a finding of guilt is substantial evidence, i.e., that amount of relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.[124]

In A.M. No. MTJ-23-014 [Formerly JIB FPI No. 21-024-MTJ], the Court resolves to modify the findings and recommendation of the JIB. As the JIB correctly held, Judge Abad's acts were a result of an error in the interpretation of Supreme Court directives and circulars in relation to her power as an Executive Judge, which she remedied by recalling her issued dismissal orders. Also, taking into consideration that this is the first administrative case against Judge Abad, and in the exercise of its sound discretion based on the facts of the case, the Court deems it proper to merely admonish Judge Abad.

In JIB FPI No. 21-033-MTJ, the Court agrees with the JIB's finding and recommendation to dismiss the administrative complaint. As correctly observed by the JIB, Judge Abad and Judge Sakkam failed to substantiate their allegations of improper conduct against Judge Alamada. Notably, they had no personal knowledge of the only specific instance of improper conduct imputed to Judge Alamada—her phone call with the Clerk of Court during which she allegedly insulted and berated the latter.

In JIB FPI No. 21-042-MTJ, the Court adopts the findings and recommendation of the JIB. Circular No. 1-90[125] grants the MTC and MCTC judges the authority to act as notaries public ex officio in notarizing documents connected with the performance of their official functions and duties. Concomitantly, Canon 2, Section 3 of the NCJC provides that ""[j]udges should take or initiate appropriate disciplinary measures against lawyers or court personnel for unprofessional conduct of which the judge may have become aware."" Thus, when Judge Sakkam notarized the Letter-Complaint of Judge Abad and the Sinumpaang Salaysay of Eraga, he was acting well within his authority as a judge.

Meanwhile, as an Executive Judge, Judge Abad has the power and duty to exercise supervision over the judges and personnel within his or her administrative area.[126] She also has the power and duty to investigate administrative complaints against Municipal and City Judges, and other court personnel within his or her administrative area, and to submit his or her findings and recommendations to the Supreme Court.[127]

Thus, the administrative complaints against Judge Sakkam and Judge Abad are dismissed for lack of merit.","ACCORDINGLY, the Court RESOLVES:

"A.M. No. P-17-3768 [Formerly OCA IPI No. 17-4734-P], April 11, 2024","OFFICE OF THE COURT ADMINISTRATOR, COMPLAINANT, VS. RUEL V. DELICANA, RESPONDENT.","On March 8, 2017, Hon. Marie Ellengrid S.L. Baliguat, (Judge Baliguat) then Executive Judge of Branch 3, MTCC, General Santos City, South Cotabato, wrote to the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) informing the latter that Delicana had been charged with two counts of rape before the Office of the City Prosecutor (OCP); thus, she is recommending for his suspension from office pending the filing of the cases in court.[1]

In another Letter[2] dated April 25, 2017, Judge Baliguat informed the OCA that two criminal Informations[3] for rape docketed as Criminal Case Nos. 17-28750 and 17-28751 were eventually filed against Delicana and were raffled to the Branch 22, Regional Trial Court (RTC), General Santos City; Delicana was able to post a surety bond in the amount of PHP 200,000.00 in each case on March 27, 2017, and that he was already scheduled for arraignment.[4]

In the Resolution[5] dated February 17, 2017 issued by the OCP, the facts leading to the filing of the two Informations[6] are summarized as follows:
Complainant works for [Delicana)'s family as their ""stay-in working student[.""] [Delicana], on the other hand, is a court employee. On January 28, 2017 at around 11:00 [A.M.], while complainant was doing her laundry at the backyard of [Delicana]'s house, the latter suddenly called her. As she went inside the kitchen, [Delicana] suddenly closed the door, grabbed her hand; embraced her, and then pushed her against the concrete wall. Complainant tried to stop [Delicana] from what he was doing but he was too strong for her. [Delicana] thereafter pulled down his short pants and her pajamas and inserted his finger into her sex organ. Complainant cried out of pain but she could not do anything. [Delicana] only stopped when a visitor came looking for him. Complainant immediately went to her room and texted her father to fetch her. After a few minutes, she went out of her room to finish her laundry but [Delicana] was outside her room waiting for her. Again, [Delicana] grabbed her, brought her to the kitchen, pushed her towards the concrete wall, pulled down her pajamas, and inserted his finger into her sex organ. As she felt helpless, she just cried until [Delicana] was able to satisfy his lust. Right after the said incident, she called up her father and insisted that he bring her home.[7]

[Complainant's grandparent] narrated that complainant was still crying when they arrived at [Delicana]'s house. She tried to ask complainant why she was crying, but [Delicana] interrupted and offered her and complainant's father some snacks. Complainant was able to confess to them the incident only after they followed her to her room. Allegedly, complainant was still trembling as she recounted to them the incident. [Complainant's grandparent] then confronted [Delicana] but the latter only answered her with, and to quote: ""Pasensyahan niyo nalang ako nay. (Please just bear with me)."" [Delicana] also told complainant to tell him should she need anything in her school.[8]
According to the OCP, Delicana denied the allegations and claimed that the complaint was private complainant's retaliatory act to his wife who reprimanded her in the morning of the alleged date of the incident.[9] According to him, and as supported by the affidavit of his wife, the latter scolded private complainant for coming home late in the evening despite still being a minor.[10]

Delicana also added that it was impossible for him to commit the alleged acts since he was suffering from ""muscle pain, body fatigue, and physical exhaustion on the alleged date brought about by his long travel from Tagum City back to his home.""[11] His visitor did not observe anything peculiar except for the fact that he looked exhausted.[12] Thus, he was surprised with the arrival of private complainant's sister, parent, and grandparent at his house and when they informed him that they are bringing private complainant back home.[13]

While Delicana admitted to have told private complainant's grandparent to just bear with him, he clarified that he was referring to the castigation made by his wife against private complainant.[14] He, in fact, gave private complainant's grandparent PHP 150.00 for their fare.[15] He maintained that private complainant's grandparent and parent never got the chance to enter his house as they were just talking in the terrace of his house.[16]

To bolster his defense, Delicana attached the affidavits of Sally Obida Baliguat and Radjena A. Koh to his counter-affidavit before the OCP. In gist, the former attested that private complainant frequently arrives at Delicana's house late at night, while the latter affirmed that she indeed went to Delicana's house and had a chat with him on the date of the alleged incident and yet she did not notice anything unusual at that time.[17]

Delicana also argued before the OCP that private complainant and her family are no longer interested in pursuing the complaint against him as they have already submitted a Motion to Withdraw Complaint,[18] Affidavit of Recantation,[19] Affidavit of Desistance & Quitclaim,[20] and Affidavit of Retraction.[21]","This resolves the administrative case against Ruel V. Delicana (Delicana), Legal Researcher, Branch 3, Municipal Trial Court in Cities (MTCC), General Santos City, South Cotabato, for Gross Misconduct and Prejudicial Conduct that Gravely Besmirches or Taints the Reputation of the Service.","The Court agrees with the findings of the JIB; verily, We adopt their recommendation.

It cannot be denied that based on the facts, the acts of Delicana fell short of the standards of high moral conduct which court employees are bound to maintain. While indeed, the criminal cases against him were dismissed and his guilt was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt, his administrative liability was proven by substantial evidence.

As correctly pointed out by the JIB, to sustain a finding of administrative culpability, only substantial evidence is required; the present case is an administrative case, not a criminal case, against Delicana. Therefore, the quantum of proof required is only substantial evidence, or that amount of relevant evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.[83]

Evidence to support a conviction in a criminal case is not necessary, and the dismissal of the criminal case against the Delicana in an administrative case is not a ground for the dismissal of the administrative case.[84] We emphasize the well-settled rule that a criminal case is different from an administrative case and each must be disposed of according to the facts and the law applicable to each case.[85]

Here, there is substantial evidence to show that Delicana violated private complainant; this was supported by the latter's Sinumpaang Salaysay[86] with attached Medico-Legal Certificate.[87] The submission later on by private complainant of affidavits purportedly showing her recantation, desistance, and quitclaim is of no moment.","ACCORDINGLY, We ADOPT the findings of the Judicial Integrity Board. Considering, however, that Ruel V. Delicana had already been previously imposed the penalty of dismissal from the service, with prejudice to re-employment or appointment in any government agency, including government-owned or -controlled corporations, and with forfeiture of benefits, including allowances, bonuses, and retirement benefits, except accrued leave credits, and perpetual disqualification from holding public office and reemployment in the government service, including government-owned and controlled corporations, We deem it proper to impose upon Ruel V. Delicana a FINE in the amount of PHP 400,000.00, the same to be paid within three months from the time this Resolution is promulgated. If unpaid, such amount is to be deducted from respondent Rule V.

"G.R. No. 251824, April 11, 2024","PETER B. FAVILA, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON AUDIT, RESPONDENT.","The facts as summarized in Our assailed Decision are as follows:
During the period from 2008 to 2010, petitioner Peter B. Favila (Favila), who was then the Secretary of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), served as an ex-officio member of the Board of Directors (Board/BOD) of the Trade and Investment Development Corporation of the Philippines (TIDCORP), a government corporate entity created under Presidential Decree No. (PD) 1080, as amended by Republic Act No. (RA) 8494.

On various occasions from 2005 to 2007, TIDCORP's BOD approved eight Board Resolutions [granting] productivity enhancement pay, developmental contribution bonuses, corporate guaranty, grocery subsidy, and anniversary bonuses to its board members and their alternates.

On July 13, 2012, without a prior notice of suspension, COA Audit Team Leader Gloria O. Lacson (ATL Lacson) and Supervising Auditor Teodora M. Lacerna (SA Lacerna) issued Notice of Disallowance (ND) No. 2012-001, disallowing various disbursement vouchers and the corresponding checks in the total amount of PHP 4,539,835.02, pertaining to monetary benefits of TIDCORP's Board members for the period of January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2010, on the ground that the same were not in accordance with [Article IX-B, Section 8 of the Constitution], which pertinently reads:
8. No elective or appointive public officer or employee shall receive additional, double, or indirect compensation, unless specifically authorized by law, [...]
It was opined that the disallowed amount constitutes double compensation since the Board members received the same in an ex-officio capacity. One of the members held liable under the ND was herein petitioner Favila who allegedly received a total of PHP 454,598.28 in benefits from October 2008 to May 2010.

TIDCORP, on behalf of its implicated officers, appealed the disallowance to the Office of the Cluster Director arguing that Section 7 of the Republic Act No. 8494 expressly grants to the Board the exclusive power to fix the remuneration, emoluments, and fringe benefits of TIDCORP officers and employees. By virtue of this, the Board passed the resolutions granting the questioned monetary benefits to its members in good faith. TIDCORP further averred that COA denied the Board members of their right to due process when it proceeded with the disallowance without first issuing a Notice of Suspension.

In their Answer Memorandum, ATL Lacson and SA Lacerna argued that [Republic Act No. 8494, Sec. 7] pertains to the authority of the Board to grant benefits/bonuses to the officers and employees of TlDCORP, and not to those given to the Board of Directors, much more to its ex-officio members. Republic Act No. 8494, Sec. 13 limits the benefits that may be accorded to the members of the Board to per diem allowances only.[5]
Undaunted, Favila filed a Petition for Review[6] before the COA Proper.","The present Motion for Reconsideration[1] seeks to reverse Our November 29, 2022 Decision[2] which affirmed the Decision in Decision No. 2019-001[3] and the Resolution in Decision No. 2020-177[4] of the Commission on Audit (COA) which found petitioner Peter B. Favila liable as the approving officer and recipient of the disallowed amount of PHP 4,539,835.02.
","After a careful deliberation, We find the motion for reconsideration impressed with merit and grant the same in part. Favila is liable to return only the amount he has unduly received.

In Madera v. Commission on Audit,[20] the Court laid down a new set of rules regarding the refund of amounts disallowed by the COA, to wit:
1.
If a Notice of Disallowance is set aside by the Court, no return shall be required from any of the persons held liable therein.



2.
If a Notice of Disallowance is upheld, the rules on return are as follows:




a.
Approving and certifying officers who acted in good faith, in regular performance of official functions, and with the diligence of a good father of the family are not civilly liable to return consistent with Section 38 of the Administrative Code of 1987.




b.
Approving and certifying officers who are clearly shown to have acted in bad faith, malice, or gross negligence are, pursuant to Section 43 of the Administrative Code of 1987, solidarity liable to return only the net disallowed amount which, as discussed herein, excludes amounts excused under the following Sections 2c and 2d.




c.
Recipients - whether approving or certifying officers or mere passive recipients - are liable to return the disallowed amounts respectively received by them, unless they are able to show that the amounts they received were genuinely given in consideration of services rendered.




d.
The Court may likewise excuse the return of recipients based on undue prejudice, social justice considerations, and other bona fide exceptions as it may determine on a case to case basis.[21] (Emphasis supplied)
In the instant case, it was established that Favila was neither an approving nor a certifying officer of the subject board resolutions which granted the disallowed benefits. Records show that the subject resolutions were approved by the Board on various occasions from 2005 to 2007.[22] Meanwhile, Favila joined the TIDCORP's Board only in 2008.[23] This means that he had no participation in the approval or certification thereof. As such, a determination of whether or not he acted in good faith, with malice or gross negligence, as the approving or certifying officer under category 2 (a) and (b) of the above-cited rules on return becomes immaterial. Given his lack of participation in the grant of the disallowed benefits, petitioner cannot be held jointly and severally liable to return the entire disallowed amount of PHP 4,539,835.02.","ACCORDINGLY, the Motion for Reconsideration is PARTLY GRANTED. The assailed November 29, 2022 Decision is MODIFIED in that petitioner Peter B. Favila is directed to settle only the amount of PHP 454,598.28 which he actually received as an ex-officio member of the Board of Trade and Investment Development Corporation of the Philippines."

The above-named accused committed the crime with the qualifying circumstances of syndicated action, the three (3) accused working in conspiracy with each [other] participating in the offense and sharing a single criminal intent.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[8]
On arraignment, accused-appellants pleaded not guilty. The prosecution presented the testimonies of Supervising Agent Arcelito C. Albao (SA Albao), Special Investigator III Aries Soliman Manaloto (SI Manaloto), AAA, and AAA's uncle, BBB. The parties also stipulated on the testimony of Christine Anne Gatmaitan-Plasigue, the social worker who handled the victim's case and prepared a report thereon.[9] On the other hand, the defense waived its right to present evidence.[10]","This Appeal[1] seeks to reverse the Decision[2] dated November 12, 2021 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

Section 3 of Republic Act No. 9208,[29] as amended by Republic Act No. 10364[30] defines Trafficking in Persons, to wit:
Section 3. Definition of Terms. – As used in this Act:

 	
(a)
Trafficking in Persons – refers to the recruitment, obtaining, hiring, providing, offering, transportation, transfer, maintaining, harboring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders by means of threat, or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the person, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person for the purpose of exploitation which includes at a minimum, the exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs.

The recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, adoption or receipt of a child for the purpose of exploitation or when the adoption is induced by any form of consideration for exploitative purposes shall also be considered as 'trafficking in persons' even if it does not involve any of the means set forth in the preceding paragraph. (Emphasis supplied.)
Trafficking in Persons requires the following elements: (1) The act of ""recruitment, transportation, transfer or harboring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders""; (2) The means used which includes ""threat or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the person, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another""; and (3) The purpose of trafficking is exploitation which includes ""exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs.""[31]

The crime is further qualified under Section 6[32] of Republic Act No. 9208, as amended, when the trafficked person is a child or when the crime is committed by a syndicate or in large scale. Trafficking is deemed committed by a syndicate if carried out by a group of three or more persons conspiring or confederating with one another. It is deemed committed in large scale if committed against three or more persons, individually or as a group.

Here, all the elements of qualified trafficking in persons have been established to a moral certainty by the clear, straightforward, and convincing testimony of the prosecution witnesses. Consider:

First, AAA's testimony proved that accused-appellants recruited her for the purpose of prostitution. The offense is qualified trafficking in persons because at the time accused-appellants committed the crime on August 3, 2018, AAA was only 16 years old as alleged in the Information and evidenced by her birth certificate.

AAA clearly narrated how she was recruited or hired for sexual purposes, first by De Leon, and later on, by Becaylas and Lumanlan. After meeting her, De Leon asked if she wanted money. Upon confirming that she needed money, De Leon contacted ""guests"" to meet with her. Not knowing she would be offered to them for sexual purposes in exchange for money, she accepted De Leon's offer. De Leon later introduced her to Becaylas and Lumanlan who also exploited her under the same scheme. Accused-appellants offered her for sex for a fee on 30 separate occasions, with her share ranging from PHP 2,000.00 to PHP 3,000.00 per guest.","ACCORDINGLY, the Appeal is DISMISSED. The Decision dated November 12, 2021 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 12848 is AFFIRMED. Accused-appellants Jeffrey Becaylas y Remon @ ""Bella,"" Kier Rome De Leon y Alfonso @ ""Mishe,"" and Justine Lumanlan y Sangalang @ ""Chiee"" are found guilty of qualified trafficking in persons under Section 4(a), in relation to Section 6(a) of Republic Act No. 9208, as amended by Republic Act No. 10364 and sentenced to life imprisonment and to PAY a fine of PHP 2,000,000.00. They are further ordered to jointly and severally PAY AAA PHP 500,000.00 as moral damages and PHP 100,000.00 as exemplary damages.

These monetary awards shall earn 6% interest per annum from finality of this Decision until fully paid."

In Criminal Case No. 01-0029-2019, Almero was charged with violation of Section 4(k)(2) in relation to Section 6(a) of Republic Act No. 9208, as amended by Republic Act No. 10364, viz.:
Criminal Case No. 01-0029-2019

On September 30, 2018 at xxxxxxxxxxx, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, by taking advantage of the minor-complainant's vulnerability, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously recruit, procure or offer for a fee AAA* (DOB: xxxxxxxxxxx), a [14-year-old] minor, to a certain ""Carlo,"" by any means for the purpose of sexual exploitation.

Contrary to law. [3]
On arraignment, Almero pleaded not guilty to the charge.[4] The parties thereafter stipulated, among others, that: (a) AAA[5] was a 14-year-old minor at the time of the incident;[6] (b) BBB[7] is the biological mother of AAA; (c) BBB was the first person to whom AAA narrated what Almero did to her; (d) BBB assisted AAA in filing the criminal case against Almero; and (e) BBB can identify AAA's Sinumpaang Salaysay[8] dated October 11, 2018 (Sinumpaang Salaysay), as well as AAA's and her signature thereon.[9]

The parties also stipulated that Dr. Jazelle R. Quebrado (Dr. Quebrado): (a) did a medical examination of AAA at xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx; (b) prepared the Medico-Legal Certificate[10] dated October 9, 2018; and (c) would affirm her findings that the hymen of AAA was no longer intact.[11]","This Appeal[1] assails the Decision[2] dated October 28, 2022 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

Trafficking in persons is defined under Republic Act No. 9208, as amended, viz.:
SEC. 3. Definition of Terms. — As used in this Act:

(a) Trafficking in Persons — refers to the recruitment, obtaining, hiring, providing, offering, transportation, transfer, maintaining, harboring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders by means of threat, or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the person, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person for the purpose of exploitation which includes at a minimum, the exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs.

The recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, adoption or receipt of a child for the purpose of exploitation or when the adoption is induced by any form of consideration for exploitative purposes shall also be considered as ""trafficking in persons"" even if it does not involve any of the means set forth in the preceding paragraph.
Here, the charge falls under Section 4(k)(2) in relation to Section 6(a) of Republic Act No. 9208, as amended, viz.:
SEC. 4. Acts of Trafficking in Persons. - It shall be unlawful for any person, natural or juridical, to commit any of the following acts:

(k) To recruit, transport, harbor, obtain, transfer, maintain, hire, offer, provide, adopt or receive a child for purposes of exploitation or trading them, including but not limited to, the act of baring and/or selling a child for any consideration or for barter for purposes of exploitation. Trafficking for purpose of exploitation of children shall include:
. . . .

(2) The use, procuring or offering of a child for prostitution, for the production of pornography, or for pornographic performances;

. . . .
SEC 6. Qualified Trafficking in Persons. - The following are considered as qualified trafficking:

(a) When the trafficked person is a child[.] (Emphasis supplied)
People v. Casio[66] laid down the elements of trafficking in persons under the expanded definition in Republic Act No. 10364, thus:
(1) The act of ""recruitment, obtaining, hiring, providing, offering, transportation, transfer, maintaining, harboring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders"";

(2) The means used include ""by means of threat, or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the person, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person""; and

(3) The purpose of trafficking includes ""the exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs."" (Emphasis supplied)
On this score, both the trial court and the appellate court are one in finding that the elements of the offense, as well as the qualifying circumstance ""that the trafficked person is a child,"" are present here.[67]

"G.R. No. 258888, April 08, 2024","ROLANDO B. ZOLETA, PETITIONER, VS. INVESTIGATING STAFF, INTERNAL AFFAIRS BOARD, OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSMAN, REPRESENTED BY: GIPO III ALFRED YANN G. OGUIS AND AGIO OMAR R. LEANO,** RESPONDENTS.","On July 21, 2017, Leonardo R. Nicolas, Jr. (Nicolas, Jr.), Associate Graft Investigation Officer III of the Intelligence Bureau-Field Investigation Office (IB-FIO) of the OMB, was arrested in an entrapment operation for extorting PHP 3,000,000.00 from Congressman Amado Espino in exchange for the closure of cases pending against Mayor Jumel Espino of Bugallon, Pangasinan. While detained in the National Bureau of Investigation Custodial Detention Center, Nicolas, Jr. executed an Affidavit dated August 2, 2017, stating that he has been transacting with petitioner Rolando B. Zoleta (Zoleta), previously the Assistant Ombudsman for Luzon then assigned at the Appeals Bureau of the Office of the Special Prosecutor, in fixing cases pending for preliminary investigation in exchange for a ""tag price"" ranging from PHP 200,000.00 to PHP 300,000.00.[6]

On August 4, 2017, Alfred Yann G. Oguis (Oguis), a member of the Internal Affairs Board-Investigating Staff (IAB-IS), filed a Complaint against Zoleta and Elias B. Caputolan Jr. (Caputolan, Jr.), an employee of the OMB, with the IAB for Serious Dishonesty, Grave Misconduct, and Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service under Rule 10(A) Nos. 1 and 3 and (B) No. 8 of the Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (RRACCS),[7] and violation of Republic Act (RA) No. 6713,[8] otherwise known as the ""Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees.""[9] It was alleged therein that Zoleta offered help to facilitate the dismissal of cases pending preliminary investigation and administrative adjudication before the OMB-Luzon and the OMB for the Military and Other Law Enforcement Offices (OMB-MOLEO).[10] Attached to the Complaint was an Affidavit allegedly executed on August 2, 2017 by Nicolas, Jr. stating that starting January 2017, he began transacting with high ranking officials. Zoleta allegedly fixed the cases of Provincial Assessor Nestor Quiambao, Mayor Percival Mallare, National Labor Relations Commission Labor Arbiter Irenarco Rimando, and Police Inspector Jaojoco Cagaoan (Cagaoan).[11] Also attached to the Complaint is the Letter addressed to the OMB and signed by Nicolas, Jr., printed screenshot of the Joint Resolution in the cases involving Cagaoan, several screenshots of the messages via Short Message Service (SMS) between Nicolas, Jr. and a certain ""AO Roy Zoleta,"" and a printed screenshot of the mobile phone number of AO Roy Zoleta.[12]

In an Order dated August 7, 2017, the IAB preventively suspended Zoleta for a period of six months. In another Order of even date, Zoleta was required to submit his counter-affidavit to the Complaint. However, instead of filing a counter-affidavit, Zoleta opted to file a Manifestation indicating the length of his government service and the history of his performance ratings, including his hospitalization for ruptured aneurysm.[13] He stated that he exercised this option because the Complaint executed on August 4, 2017 by Oguis was a mere scrap of paper because it was not based on the latter's personal knowledge and it was not supported by any affidavit or sworn statement of a witness naming Zoleta as the person being alluded to.[14] On the other hand, Oguis submitted a Motion to Admit Reply/Comment[15] dated September 14, 2017 with the attached Reply/Comment and the Judicial Affidavit[16] of Nicolas, Jr. executed on August 15, 2017. Zoleta filed his Opposition to the motion, praying for the denial of the motion, the lifting of the preventive suspension and the dismissal of the administrative complaint filed against him.[17] In an Order[18] dated October 10, 2017, parties were required to submit their respective verified position papers within a non-extendible period of 10 days from receipt of the Order.

Zoleta, in his Position Paper[19] dated October 23, 2017 attached the Joint Affidavit[20] dated September 7, 2017 and the Supplemental Joint Affidavit[21] dated October 9, 2017 of Joaquin F. Salazar and Dennis L. Garcia of the OMB­-Luzon and the OMB-MOLEO, respectively. In turn, Oguis filed a Motion to Admit Position Paper[22] dated October 27, 2017 with his Position Paper.[23]","Before this Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari,[1] assailing the Decision[2] dated January 7, 2021 and the Resolution[3] dated October 6, 2021 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 156298, which affirmed the Decision[4] dated January 17, 2018 and the Omnibus Order[5] dated May 21, 2018 of the Internal Affairs Board (IAB) of the Office of the Ombudsman (OMB) in OMB-C-A-17-0265.","As a general rule, factual findings of the OMB are conclusive when supported by substantial evidence and are accorded due respect and weight, especially when affirmed by the CA.[48] Section 27[49] of R.A. No. 6770[50] mandates that the findings of fact by the OMB are conclusive when supported by substantial evidence.

In administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings, only substantial evidence is necessary to establish the case for or against a party. Substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla of evidence. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.[51] In administrative proceedings, the complainant has the duty to prove by substantial evidence the allegations in their administrative complaint.[52]

In reviewing administrative decisions, it is beyond the province of this Court to weigh the conflicting evidence, determine the credibility of witnesses, or otherwise substitute its judgment for that of the administrative agency with respect to the sufficiency of evidence. However, while it is not the function of the Court to analyze and weigh the parties' evidence all over again, an exception thereto lies as when there is serious ground to believe that a possible miscarriage of justice would thereby result.[53] This exception is not present in this case.

Zoleta was charged with Grave Misconduct, Serious Dishonesty, and Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service – grave offenses for which the penalty of dismissal is meted even for first-time offenders.[54] The OMB found Zoleta guilty of Grave Misconduct, Serious Dishonesty, and Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service, and imposed upon him the penalty of dismissal from government service with all its accessory penalties. The CA, on appeal, affirmed the ruling of the OMB.

After a careful review of the records of the case, this Court resolves to deny the Petition for Review on Certiorari. ","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is hereby DENIED."
"G.R. No. 262362*, April 08, 2024","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. JERRIE R. ARRAZ, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.
","The prosecution avowed that it was in March 2010 when CCC[15] first met Arraz in xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx. At that time, she was only 12 years old and worked as a nanny and storekeeper for Arraz's cousin. Arraz told her that foreigners would like her and because of this, she felt elated. She intimated to him that she wanted to study in xxxxxxx and experience a good life. She eventually prevailed upon her parents to allow her to go with the assistance of Arraz himself. He bought her a dress and a pair of shoes and then brought her along to xxxxxxxxxxxxxx on board a ship at his own expense. She stayed in his residence at xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.[16]

At the start of CCC's stay in the house of Arraz, she was not permitted to leave the premises. He told her that she was ugly and that he needed to groom her. Thus, he had her skin bleached and hair fixed. He told her that he wanted her to be beautiful when they go out so she would not get bullied.[17] During this time, she was made to watch pornographic videos to learn what to do with men.[18] Later, she was enrolled in the school near Arraz's house. He bought her school uniform and supplies as well as sexy dresses and shorts.[19]

In the early morning of July 2010, Arraz woke up CCC, telling her that there was a customer who wanted her to say ""hi"" to him. They proceeded to his room and the door was closed. Inside, a foreigner was online in a Skype call and after exchanging greetings, Arraz told her that the customer also wanted her to perform a show and that she should do what the customer wanted. The customer asked Arraz to instruct her to remove her clothes, to which she acceded. She removed all her garments and stood in front of the web camera. She was asked to pose nude and to smile while the foreigner got naked and started playing with his own organ. She testified that she wanted to cry at that time, but she convinced herself not to do so. She never imagined that she would be subjected to such kind of treatment.[20]

On another occasion in July 2010, CCC was again awoken by Arraz and informed her that a foreigner would be sending money. She and Arraz proceeded to the latter's room where another foreigner was watching them online. Arraz placed a towel on the floor and made her lie down. After they were both undressed, Arraz ordered her to get up to suck his penis. After that, she was made to lie down again and then he inserted his penis into her vagina, which caused her pain. When he was about to ejaculate, Arraz inserted his penis into her mouth and released his sperm. Throughout the ordeal, the foreigner was masturbating while watching them.[21]

Similar incidents transpired thereafter. Foreigners would send money to Arraz and he would often inform CCC about this whenever he bought her needs for school and gave her an allowance.[22]","This ordinary appeal[1] before the Court seeks to overturn the Decision (Modified Version)[2] of the Court of Appeals (CA) finding accused-appellant Jerrie R. Arraz (Arraz) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of: (1) five counts of qualified trafficking in persons, as defined and penalized under Section 4(a) and (e), in relation to Section 3(a), (b), (c), (h), and (j), as well as Sections 6(a) and 10(e), of Republic Act No. 9208,[3] as amended by Republic Act No. 10364;[4] and (2) three counts of rape, as defined and penalized under Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), as amended by Republic Act No. 8353.[5]
Arraz was inculpated for the crimes of qualified trafficking in persons and rape across eight separate Informations, all raffled to Branch xx of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Quezon City and docketed as Criminal Case Nos. R-QZN-15-00611-CR to R-QZN-15-00618-CR.[6] The Informations read:","The appeal is denied for lack of merit.

Preliminarily, the Court refuses to pander to Arraz's postulation that his right to due process was violated owing to the lack of specificity as to the date of the commission of the offenses charged in the Informations docketed as Criminal Case Nos. R-QZN-15-00611-CR to R-QZN-15-00618-CR. It is well-settled that in crimes where the date of commission is not a material element, as in this case, it is not necessary to allege such date with absolute specificity or certainty in the information.[73] The Rules of Court merely requires that the date of commission be approximated,[74] as in the case at bench. Certainly, the CA committed no reversible error in ratiocinating that the countless abuses suffered by private complainants undoubtedly impaired their capability to provide an exact recollection of when the incidents occurred, especially when the abuses spanned several months and years.[75] The Court finds and so holds that the approximate dates indicated on the Informations were sufficient to apprise Arraz of the particular offenses charged. In any case, any defects on the lack of specificity of the dates of commission of the offenses were deemed waived on account of Arraz's failure to raise the same before he entered his non-guilty plea.[76] As borne by the records, Arraz moved to quash only the Informations pertaining to Criminal Case Nos. R-QZN-15-00615-CR, R-QZN-15-00616-CR, and R-QZN-15-00618-CR on the sole ground that the acts complained of in these cases were purportedly committed prior to the enactment of Republic Act No. 10364.[77] However, there was no move to quash any of the Informations on the ground of lack of specificity of the dates of the commission of the offenses charged therein.

On the substantive issues, the Court gives its imprimatur to the finding of the CA that Arraz's guilt for the crimes charged were proven beyond reasonable doubt. It bears stressing that ""the factual findings of the trial court, its calibration of the testimonies of the witnesses, and its conclusions based on its findings are generally binding and conclusive upon the Court, especially so when affirmed by the appellate court.""[78] Indeed, the foregoing principle is only strengthened by the Court's own independent and perspicacious review of the records of this case.

Arraz is guilty of qualified trafficking in persons in Criminal Case Nos. R-QZN- 15-00611-CR, R-QZN-15-00612-CR, R-QZN-15-00615-CR, R-QZN-15- 00616-CR, and R-QZN-15-00618-CR.

"A.C. No. 10627 (from A.C. No. 6622), April 03, 2024","RENO R. GONZALES, JR. AND ROBIN BRYAN F. CONCEPCION, COMPLAINANTS, VS. ATTYS. SOCRATES RIVERA AND CRES DAN BANGOY, RESPONDENTS.","In the July 10, 2012 Decision[3] in Villatuya v. Atty. Tabalingcos, the Court disbarred Atty. Bede S. Tabalingcos (Tabalingcos) for engaging in Bigamy. Thereafter, the Court denied with finality Tabalingcos's Motion for Reconsideration in a Resolution dated August 28, 2012. Records revealed that Tabalingcos received a copy of the said Resolution on October 2, 2012.[4] Despite his disbarment, however, it appears that Tabalingcos continued to perform acts that constituted the practice of law, specifically by filing, among others, motions for extension dated September 18, 2012 and October 18, 2012 in an administrative case before the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), docketed as OSI-AC No. 2012-027 (BSP case). Thus, complainants filed the letter-request informing the Court of Tabalingcos's actions.[5] They likewise requested the Court to investigate respondents, Tabalingcos's partners and associates, for possible violation of Canon 9[6] of the CPR for allegedly assisting Tabalingcos, directly or indirectly, in his unauthorized practice of law.[7]

With respect to respondents, complainants particularly alleged that Bangoy, together with Tabalingcos, signed as counsel under the Tabalingcos and Associates Law Office the Motion for Extension of Time to File Memorandum[8] dated October 18, 2012 filed in the BSP case, despite the latter's disbarment. Rivera, on the other hand, signed the Notice of Change of Address[9] dated December 2, 2013 as co-counsel of Tabalingcos and Associates Law Office in the same BSP case.[10] Moreover, complainants asserted that by respondents' act of signing the pleadings on behalf of the Tabalingcos and Associates Law Office, they misrepresented to the public that Tabalingcos was still authorized to practice law.[11]

In the said Resolution[12] dated August 19, 2014 issued by the Court in A.C. No. 6622, the Court found Tabalingcos guilty of unauthorized practice of law. The Court also treated complainants' letter-request as a complaint against respondents which was subsequently docketed as A.C. No. 10627. Thereafter, in Resolution[13] dated December 3, 2014, the Court required respondents to file their respective comments.

In compliance, Bangoy filed his Comment[14] dated November 4, 2014 claiming that he was no longer an associate of Tabalingcos and Associates Law Office upon the finality of Tabalingcos's disbarment in October 2012. He explained that he left the law firm in August 2012 to establish his own law office ""because of the Decision of the [Court] x x x in July 2012 Decision""[15] that disbarred Tabalingcos. Moreover, he denied any knowledge or participation in: (a) Tabalingcos's unauthorized practice of law; (b) the cases Tabalingcos allegedly appeared as a counsel; and (c) the pleadings Tabalingcos purportedly signed. He thus, prayed that the case against him be dismissed for lack of merit.[16] For his part, Rivera failed to file his comment.

In their Reply,[17] complainants argued that Bangoy's defense is self-serving considering his failure to present any evidence with respect to his separation from the Tabalingcos and Associates Law Office, as well as his alleged independent practice. Further, they pointed out that the Motion for Extension of Time to File Memorandum signed by Bangoy in the BSP case was in fact filed two months after the latter learned of Tabalingcos's disbarment. For respondents, Bangoy's signature in said motion was a confirmation that: (i) he was still a practicing member of the law firm; (ii) he knew about the BSP case; (iii) he knew of Tabalingcos's continued unlawful practice of law; and (iv) he knew of the continuous use of his name by Tabalingcos's law firm.[18] Finally, they averred that Rivera's failure to comment was an implied admission of his knowledge and consent to Tabalingcos's unauthorized practice of law.[19]

Thereafter, in view of Rivera's failure to file his comment, the Court issued a Resolution[20] dated July 30, 2018 requiring him to show cause why he should not be disciplinarily dealt with or held in contempt. This notwithstanding, Rivera still failed to file his comment and/or comply with the show cause Resolution. Thus, the Court issued a Resolution[21] dated November 9, 2020: (1) imposing upon Rivera a fine of PHP 1,000.00 payable to the Court within 10 days from notice, or imprisonment of five days if the fine is not paid within said period; and (2) requiring him to comply with the Court's directive to file his comment. To this date, Rivera has yet to comply with these directives; thus, the fine imposed in the November 9, 2020 Resolution stands.

Thereafter, the Court referred to the Office of the Bar Confidant (OBC) for appropriate action the failure of Rivera to pay the fine and file his comment as ordered by the Court.[22]","The instant administrative case stemmed from the Resolution[1] dated August 19, 2014 issued by the Court in A.C. No. 6622, entitled ""Manuel G. Villatuya v. Atty. Bede S. Tabalingcos (Villatuya v. Atty. Tabalingcos)"", which, among others, treated the Letter-Request[2] dated May 8, 2014 filed by complainants Reno R. Gonzales, Jr. and Bryan F. Concepcion (complainants) of Tan Venturaza and Valdez Law Office as a Complaint against respondents Attys. Socrates Rivera (Rivera) and Cres Dan Bangoy (Bangoy; collectively, respondents) for violation of Canon 9 of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR).","The Court resolves to: (a) adopt the findings and recommendation of the OBC with respect to Rivera's failure to pay the fine and file his comment, with modification; and (b) hold Bangoy administratively liable for assisting in unauthorized practice of law, as will be further discussed hereunder.

I.

At the outset, it is important to note that on April 11, 2023, the Court En Banc unanimously approved A.M. No. 22-09-01-SC or the ""Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability"" (CPRA), repealing the CPR, Sections 20 to 37 of Rule 138, and Rule 139-B of the Rules of Court. Section 3 of the General Provisions of the CPRA states that it ""shall take effect 15 calendar days after its publication in the Official Gazette or any newspaper of general circulation."" The CPRA was published in the Philippine Star and Manila Bulletin on May 14, 2023 and hence, already effective on May 30, 2023.[27]","ACCORDINGLY, the Court finds respondents Socrates Rivera and Atty. Cres Dan Bangoy GUILTY of violating the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability. They are hereby meted the following penalty:

(a)
As for Rivera, he is hereby FINED in the amount of PHP 50,000.00.
 	 

Further, the ORDER issued by the Court in the Resolution dated November 9, 2020 directing Rivera to PAY the fine in the amount of PHP 1,000.00 stands.
 	 
(b)
As for Atty. Bangoy, he is hereby SUSPENDED from the practice of law for six months effective immediately upon receipt of this Decision. Further, he is STERNLY WARNED that a repetition of the same offense or similar acts in the future shall be dealt with more severely.

"G.R. No. 234849, April 03, 2024","SAN MIGUEL FOODS, INC., PETITIONER, VS. SPOUSES RAMON AND MA. NELIA FABIE, AND FRESH LINK, INC., RESPONDENTS.","Based on the lone testimony of respondent Nelia Fabie, on October 27, 1992, Fresh Link entered into a Complementary Distributorship Agreement with SMFI under which Fresh Link was appointed as the exclusive distributor of SMFI products to specific territories or accounts for a period of six months. Under the contract, Fresh Link was required to guarantee payment for its purchases of SMFI products subject to sale and distribution. Initially, respondent spouses offered their house and lot as collateral to guarantee payment for their purchases under the contract. This was later replaced by postdated checks and a credit line under a Credit Line Agreement for PHP 800,000.00 worth of purchases extended by SMFI to Fresh Link, which was secured by a standby letter of credit issued by a bank in favor of SMFI. Since October 1992, the contract has been renewed or extended yearly under the same terms and conditions, including the rights and obligations of the parties.[8]

On May 15, 1998, the contract was once again renewed for a period of one year from May 1, 1998, pursuant to a Memorandum of Agreement on Complementary Distributorship. The renewed contract substantially provided the same obligations for SMFI as the previous agreement, particularly: (a) maintaining the exclusivity of the distributorship agreement by not selling or offering for sale any of the specified products to any person or persons within the geographic territory assigned to Fresh Link other than the latter; and (b) using its best endeavors to safeguard the sale and exclusive rights granted to Fresh Link. Under the renewed contract, the geographic territory or account assigned to Fresh Link was Makati (except for talipapas or stalls located in Kalayaan, Sacramento, Pio del Pilar, Tejeros, and Bangkal) and the Guadalupe Wet Market.[9]

In April 1999, the parties once again renewed the Complementary Distributorship Agreement (Agreement) for another period, which will expire on March 31, 2000. Meanwhile, the Credit Line Agreement in favor of Fresh Link remained in effect and subsisting until March 31, 2000. Although the respondents signed the Agreement with SMFI, and the latter executed a Credit Line Agreement in favor of Fresh Link, respondents alleged that they were not given a copy of the Agreement. Respondents requested from SMFI a copy of the said contract since it was needed for the release of the Irrevocable Domestic Standby Letter of Credit to be issued by the Bank of the Philippines Islands (BPI) in favor of SMFI as a guarantee for the Credit Line Agreement. However, respondents' request was supposedly not acted upon by SMFI or any of its officers.[10]

On June 2, 1999, and June 3, 1999, respondents complained to SMFI regarding the supposed withholding of discounts or rebates due to them, the proliferation of Magnolia chicken in the wet market within their assigned geographic territory at prices lower than the invoice price given to them, and SMFI's refusal to furnish them with a copy of the renewed Agreement. Thereafter, on June 4, 1999, SMFI ceased delivery of its products on credit to Fresh Link.[11] This action constrained respondents to file the instant Complaint against SMFI.

For its part, SMFI presented four of its officers as witnesses: Alvin Tabbu, Account Receivables Head; Oscar Caronongan, IT Head; Eugene de la Paz, Business Development Officer; and Alandro del Rosario, Area Sales Manager.[12]

In addition to refuting the allegations made by respondent Nelia Fabie, SMFI claimed that Fresh Link made numerous purchases from SMFI between March 23, 1999, and subsequent dates. It is noteworthy that, according to the Agreement, Fresh Link had a 30-day period from the date of purchase to settle its accounts with SMFI, totaling PHP 1,899,645.97, which, according to SMFI, had already become due and payable. Despite repeated demands from SMFI, Fresh Link supposedly failed to fulfill its obligations. Furthermore, contrary to the assertions of respondent Nelia Fabie, SMFI pointed out that the collateral provided by Fresh Link in the form of a letter of credit had expired on May 31, 1999.[13] Hence, on June 4, 1999, SMFI argued that it was compelled to deliver products to Fresh Link only upon receipt of cash payment.[14]","Before this Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] filed by petitioner San Miguel Foods, Inc. (SMFI) seeking to reverse and set aside the Decision[2] and the Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 104501, which affirmed with modifications the Decision[4] and the Resolution[5] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 59, Makati City in Civil Case No. 99-1147. The Resolution of the CA denied SMFI's Motion for Reconsideration.[6]
The Antecedents

The instant petition arose from a Complaint for Breach of Contract and Damages with Prayer for [a] Temporary Restraining Order and/or Preliminary Injunction[7] filed by respondent Fresh Link, Inc. (Fresh Link), a corporation owned by respondent spouses Ramon and Nelia Fabie, against SMFI, and Alandro del Rosario and Eugene De la Paz, Area Sales Manager and Business Development Officer, respectively, of SMFI.","After a judicious deliberation, We find the Petition meritorious.

The Court can conduct its own factual findings if there is insufficient evidence or if the parties failed to substantiate their claims
In civil cases, the party having the burden of proof must establish its cause of action by a preponderance of evidence,[31] or that ""evidence which is of greater weight or is more convincing than that which is in opposition to it.""[32] Preponderance of evidence ""does not mean absolute truth; rather, it means that the testimony of one side is more believable than that of the other side, and that the probability of truth is on one side than on the other.""[33]

A determination of where the preponderance of evidence lies constitutes a factual matter, which, as a rule, cannot be considered in a Rule 45 petition.[34] This is because the Court is not a trier of facts; the function of the Court in petitions for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court is limited to reviewing errors of law that may have been committed by the lower courts. However, there are exceptions to this rule, including instances where: (1) the conclusion is a finding grounded entirely on speculation, surmise, and conjectures; (2) the inference made is manifestly mistaken; (3) there is grave abuse of discretion; (4) the judgment is based on misapprehension of facts; and (5) the findings of fact are premised on the absence of evidence and are contradicted by evidence on record.[35]

Here, the lower courts' decisions rest heavily on the testimony of one witness, namely Nelia Fabie. Thus, this Court will embark on its own factual analysis and will, if necessary, reverse the rulings of the lower courts if the facts of the case suggest a lack or absence of evidence consistent with the fifth exception cited above, or if it finds that respondents in this case have failed to substantiate their claims by preponderance of evidence and, thus, are not entitled to the award of damages.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is GRANTED. The May 18, 2017 Decision and the October 18, 2017 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 104501 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The Complaint for Breach of Contract and Damages filed by respondents Spouses Ramon and Ma. Nelia Fabie and Fresh Link, Inc. against petitioner San Miguel Foods, Inc. is DISMISSED for lack of merit."
"G.R. No. 225920, April 03, 2024","FELIMON C. TORRES, PETITIONER, VS. BOARD OF TRUSTEES, GOVERNMENT SERVICE INSURANCE SYSTEM; HOUSING FINANCE ADMINISTRATION DEPARTMENT AND COMMITTEE ON CLAIMS, GOVERNMENT SERVICE INSURANCE SYSTEM, RESPONDENTS.","The facts of this case as culled from the records are undisputed.

Second Lieutenant Dominador dela Cena Torres, Jr. (Dominador) was an active combat pilot who flew the rotary aircraft for the Philippine Air Force (PAF).[5] In 1979, while he was still in active service, he entered into a Deed of Conditional Sale (DCS) with ARB Construction Co., Inc. (ARB) over a piece of real property, a low-cost housing unit, located at Block 56, Lot 4, Soldiers' Hills Village, Muntinlupa City (subject property) for the price of PHP76,830.00, to be financed by a secured housing loan from the GSIS which, in turn, was payable through salary deductions.[6]

Tragedy struck when less than a year after Dominador took out the housing loan, while he was performing a ferry mission in Mindanao on September 2, 1980, the helicopter he was piloting crashed in Lanao del Sur, killing him, two of his gunners, and four rebel returnees, with said crash being ruled by the LOA Status Board of the PAF as ""purely accidental.""[7] Dominador died intestate, single and without issue.[8] He was survived by his parents, Dominador Briones Torres, Sr. and Independencia dela Cena Torres. When Dominador's father and mother subsequently died on June 6, 1986 and April 30, 1997, respectively, they, in turn, were survived by Dominador's sibling, herein petitioner.

Yet uninformed of Dominador's death, the GSIS sent Dominador's last address several letters regarding his amortizations on his housing loan and as they remained unanswered, GSIS sent him a Notice of Foreclosure/Cancellation, which informed that it would undertake foreclosure proceedings on all low-cost housing loan accounts which were considered delinquent.[9]

Exchanges between the GSIS and petitioner later ensued. Specifically, on December 12, 1988 the GSIS Quezon City Branch Office 1 – Military sent a Notice of Foreclosure of Dominador's DCS for failure to pay installments thereon.[10] Petitioner, through letters dated February 23 and April 17, 1989,[11] and November 14, 1990[12] countered that the ownership over the subject property should be consolidated in his name for the reason that by virtue of the Sales Redemption Insurance (SRI) policy of the GSIS, the monthly amortizations for the subject property are deemed waived, since premiums therefor had already been deducted from Dominador's salary and paid for.[13]

Despite petitioner's claims, the GSIS sent on February 28, 2003 a letter anew to Dominador, reminding the latter of the need to settle the outstanding obligations, to which petitioner also reiterated his earlier claim. On July 14, 2003,[14] the GSIS also countered that Dominador's DCS was not covered by the SRI policy since Dominador, during his lifetime, did not submit himself to the requisite physical and medical examinations for the securing of the same and, consequently, it became incumbent upon Dominador's heirs to satisfy the outstanding monthly amortizations for the subject property.[15]

Still, 25 years after Dominador's tragic death, or on September 15, 2005,[16] the GSIS maintained its denial of petitioner's claims and finally issued a Notice of Cancellation of the DCS of the subject property, as well as a final demand upon the occupants of the same to vacate therefrom. [17]

Petitioner filed a petition before the GSIS Board on February 3, 2006, docketed as GSIS Case No. 002-06, and sought that the title over the subject property be consolidated in his name.[18] Petitioner also prayed that in the event that the claim was denied and that he be required to pay, that the basis of payment be the original purchase price stated in the DCS.[19]","This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] (Petition) under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court which assails the Decision[2] (assailed Decision) dated March 16, 2016, and the Resolution[3] (assailed Resolution) dated July 20, 2016 of the Court of Appeals Eleventh Division (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 136562. The assailed Decision, and the assailed Resolution dismissed the appeal lodged by herein petitioner Felimon C. Torres (petitioner) and affirmed the Decision[4] of respondent Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) Board of Trustees (GSIS Board) dated March 8, 2012 in GSIS Case No. 002-06 which, in turn, dismissed petitioner's petition therein.

This case is set against the factual backdrop of a military pilot who died in the line of duty, and whose abrupt passing resulted in unpaid amortizations which now endanger the right of his heir to the socialized housing he worked to secure during his brief lifetime. Within this milieu, the Court seizes the opportunity to study more closely how justice can be discerned and served within the dispassionate confines of the law, and give life to the mandate of a socialized institution with rules that work to further and not frustrate its first purpose. As well, the Court here reminds that the duties of good faith in contracts do not have shallow roots but, instead, underpin the precisely defined duties and obligations that color the way we must relate to one another within the contractual sphere. So that contractual good faith is not so much a superimposed duty on the parties in the event of dispute, but is instead unearthed to be its irreducible core.
","The Court here is presented with a two-part issue for resolution: whether Dominador's DCS was covered by the SRI and, consequently, whether the cancellation of the DCS was warranted by virtue of non-payment of amortizations.

The Court approaches the instant issue with the clear applicability of the pertinent and unambiguous GSIS issuances set within the larger context of the purpose and mandate of the GSIS and largest framework of equity and justice.

Proceeding therefrom, the Court here finds that while the GSIS Board is correct in ruling that Dominador's DCS is not covered by the SRI, the cancellation of the DCS and the demand for petitioner and the occupants of the subject property to vacate are, nevertheless, unwarranted. Instead, in view of GSIS Resolution No. 48 and in the interest of justice, petitioner, as the sole heir of Dominador, must be allowed to avail of a restructuring of the outstanding amortizations due on Dominador's housing loan account, so that he and whoever may be occupying the subject property on account of said DCS be secured in their occupation of the same.","ACCORDINGLY, the instant Petition is hereby GRANTED. The Decision dated March 16, 2016 and the Resolution dated July 20, 2016 of the Court of Appeals Eleventh Division in CA-G.R. SP No. 136562 are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

Accordingly, the case is REMANDED to respondent GSIS Board of Trustees for determination of the loan payment restructuring pursuant to PPG No. 232-13 and related remedies as may be proper in favor of herein petitioner Felimon C. Torres for the full payment of the outstanding obligations of the subject housing loan account in the name of Dominador C. Torres, Jr. in GSIS Case No. 002-06.

Despite the foregoing, petitioners claim that they did not receive regular or special holiday pay, rest day pay, service incentive leave pay, 13th month pay, and Emergency Cost of Living Allowance (ECOLA) from CORPS.[11]

Due to these grievances, sometime in January 2015, petitioners filed a Request for Assistance (RFA) with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) – National Conciliation Mediation Board (NCMB) through the Single-Entry Approach (SEnA). In their RFA, petitioners cited monetary claims consisting of nonpayment/underpayment of wages, overtime pay, service incentive leave pay, holiday pay, SSS, PhilHealth, and Pag-IBIG contributions.[12]

During the conciliation-mediation conference conducted on March 3, 2015 before the NCMB, CORPS offered to pay petitioners their trust fund savings and cash bonds. CORPS' representative, Benjamin Sesgundo (Sesgundo), offered to petitioners the checks representing such payments, but they refused to accept them and to sign the quitclaims and release as they demanded to be paid the rest of their money claims. Sesgundo informed CORPS management of petitioners' demands.[13]

In another conciliation-mediation conference held on March 10, 2015, CORPS, through Sesgundo, asked petitioners to submit their signed resignation letters before the checks, which they were told would cover all their claims, were distributed to them. Relying on Sesgundo's assurances that the new checks covered all their money claims, petitioners submitted their signed resignation letters. Petitioners were also made to sign separate quitclaims antedated to March 3, 2015. Thereafter, CORPS, through Sesgundo, distributed the checks.[14]

Upon receipt of the checks, petitioners realized that they were the same checks that Sesgundo had offered to them on March 3, 2015, which only covered the amounts of their trust fund savings and cash bond. They insisted on returning the checks but were convinced by CORPS that the checks for the other money claims would follow as the company was still in the process of validating and reconciling their monetary claims with company records.[15] This was reflected in the Minutes of Proceedings[16] taken during the March 1, 2015 conciliation-mediation conference, to wit:

The management received the LBC letter from the requesting parties & the same will be validated (DTR) with company records w/in this month of March. . . . and will wait for R3 & other claims to be reconciled by mgt.[17]

Petitioners alleged that it was only due to these assurances that they agreed to accept the checks from CORPS in payment or as refund of their trust fund savings and cash bond.[18] Petitioners attempted to report for work the following day, but they were prevented from doing so by their supervisors as they had already supposedly resigned. By the end of March 2015, CORPS still did not pay petitioners' money claims as promised, and petitioners were still not allowed to report for duty.[19]","Before this Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] assailing the Consolidated Decision[2] dated February 15, 2018 and the Consolidated Resolution[3] dated November 8, 2018 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 144925 and CA-G.R. SP No. 145329. The CA ruled that the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) did not commit grave abuse of discretion in its Resolutions dated December 29, 2015[4] and February 24, 2016[5] in NCR Case No. 04-04334-13[6] and NCR Case No. 05-06076-15 (LAC No. 10-002857-15) when it reversed the Labor Arbiter's (LA) Decision[7] dated August 28, 2015. The NLRC held that petitioners had no intention to resign but, at the same time, were not illegally dismissed and remanded the case to the LA for the determination of petitioners' money claims.","The Petition is meritorious.

Case law instructs that there is forum shopping when the following elements are established: (a) identity of the patties or at least such parties who represent the same interests in both actions; (b) identity of the rights asserted and the relief prayed for, such relief being founded on the same circumstances; and (c) identity of the two preceding particulars, such that any judgment rendered in the other action will, regardless of which party is successful, amount to res judicata in the action under consideration, said requisites likewise constitutive of the elements of litis pendentia.[57]

The third element is wanting in this case. As correctly ruled by the CA, conciliation-mediation proceedings is a mandatory prerequisite for filing a labor complaint with the NLRC. The Labor Code, as amended by RA 10396, states:","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is GRANTED.

[G.R. No. 206321]

SLIMMERS WORLD INTERNATIONAL, ALBERT CUESTA, AND DINAH QUINTO, PETITIONERS, VS. MIGUEL KIM, RESPONDENT.
","On April 8, 1991, Adelaida, then 50 years old, became a lifetime member of Slimmers World. Nine years later, in June 2000, she availed of the fitness center's biometrics program or the 12-visit personal training program with Cuesta as her personal trainer. In the morning of July 25, 2000, Adelaida went for her last session with Cuesta.[6]

After her workout and while still within the premises, Adelaida complained of headache, nausea, and discomfort. The gym staff took her blood pressure which yielded a high result. Thus, she took her medication for hypertension. As she was changing her clothes, she vomited. Consequently, the gym staff brought her to Our Lady of Grace Hospital (OLGH) in a tricycle. At 9:33 a.m., the attending physician diagnosed her to be suffering from essential hypertension.[7]

At 12:50 p.m. of the same day, Adelaida was transferred to the Chinese General Hospital (CGH), which was equipped with more advanced facilities for better monitoring. There, she immediately underwent a CT scan which revealed a mass in her brain. The doctors informed Miguel that they could no longer do anything. Three days later, or on July 28, 2000, Adelaida died due to cerebral hemorrhage and severe hypertension.[8]

On October 17, 2000, Miguel sent a letter to Slimmers World, Cuesta, and Quinto demanding the payment of damages as their negligence caused the death of his wife. When they denied liability, Miguel filed a Complaint before the RTC on November 28, 2000.[9] In their Answer, Slimmers World, Cuesta, and Quinto insisted that Adelaida's concealment of her hypertension and their observance of proper procedure in medical emergencies absolved them from liability.[10]","Adelaida, then 59 years old, availed of the 12-visit personal training program of a fitness center. Shortly after her workout on her 12th session, she complained of a headache and vomited. The gym staff immediately brought her to the hospital. After three days, she died. Her husband, Miguel, is now suing the fitness center for damages.

Before the Court are two consolidated petitions for review on certiorari[1] under Rule 45, Rules of Court, assailing the Decision[2] and Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA) which affirmed with modification the Decision[4] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) finding Slimmers World International (Slimmers World), Albert Cuesta (Cuesta), and Dinah Quinto (Quinto) negligent in their operation of a fitness center and thus liable for damages resulting from the death of their client, Adelaida Kim (Adelaida), wife of Miguel Kim (Miguel).

Slimmers World, operated by Behavior Modification Inc., is a Philippine corporation engaged in the business of managing a chain of fitness centers. Cuesta was employed as its fitness trainer while Quinto was its managing director.[5]","The Court, however, cannot fully adopt these assumptions as a more thorough examination of the case records controverts the same. In the first place, in his own Pre-Trial Brief,[58] Miguel expressly averred that Adelaida complained of a headache after her exercises.[59] Second, Adelaida's friend, Ms. Rabaca, who was not at the fitness center that day, testified that before Adelaida went to the gym, Adelaida called her before 7:00 a.m. to ask if she was attending the session. Hence, it cannot be concluded that Adelaida complained of a headache as early as 6:30 a.m. as she was not at the gym yet before 7:00 a.m.[60] Third, Buenavista testified to the sequence of events as follows:
Q:
Can you tell us what area of Slimmers' World International, Caloocan Branch were you particularly in, Mr. Witness?
A:
We were in the weights area, ma'am.
Q:
And how about Mr. Cuesta?
A:
He was also there, ma'am.
Q:
And since you were very near Mr. Cuesta and Mrs. Kim, did you see what particular activities were done by Mrs. Kim at that time?
A:
A: Before they started the workout they do the warm up exercises first before they do the resistance exercises, ma'am and after that when Albert Cuesta asked me to assist him they were doing the shoulder exercise using dumbbells, I think it is very light dumbbell.
Q:
Do you remember what type of warm-up exercises they did?
A:
First they do the bike exercises for five minutes and after that they do the stretching exercise and body exercises, ma'am.
Q:
When they were exercising, did you notice the appearance of Mrs. Kim?
A:
Before they actually started Albert Cuesta asked her if she is doing okay, if she is doing fine. Usually before we start the exercising we check the general appearance of the client.
Q:
So before a client starts exercising, it is part of your responsibility to assess the condition of the client?
A:
We have to check the general appearance if she is feeling well, ma'am.
Q:
And at that time did you notice anything unusual about Mrs. Kim?
A:
No. ma'am.
Q:
What happened next?
A:
After that I asked Mr. Albert Cuesta about Mrs. Kim and he told me that they are in the reception area.
Q:
And after that?
A:
Mr. Albert Cuesta asked me to check on Mrs. Kim and when I arrived at the reception area two of my colleagues/co-workers Flor and Judith were checking on her blood pressure, ma'am.
Q:
So at that time when you checked on Mrs. Kim what did she tell you or what did you do, did you ask if she is feeling good?
A:
I asked her if she is feeling well at that time and then she told me ""masakit ang ulo ko"", that is what she said ma'am.
Q:
And after she said that, what did you do?
A:
I told Flor Galang that we should bring her to the doctor because I think that is an emergency situation, so I asked them that she should bring her to the hospital, ma'am.
Q:
Were you able to bring her to the hospital?
A:
That moment no, ma'am.
Q:
Why?
A:
Because Mrs. Kim refused to be brought to the hospital, ma'am.
Q:
And do you know the reason why she refused to be brought to the hospital?
A:
She told us that she's gonna be fine after a while, ma'am.[61] (Emphasis supplied)
Based on Buenavista's recollection above, it is clear that before Adelaida began exercising, he did not observe anything unusual about her nor did he hear any complaints. When Adelaida started exercising, she was in the weights section doing shoulder exercises, bike excercises for five minutes, then stretching and body exercises. After the exercises, Adelaida moved to the reception area where Buenavista asked her if she was feeling well, to which she replied, ""masakit ang ulo ko.""[62]

Accordingly, Adelaida had no complaints before she began her exercises. The moment she complained of a headache, the gym staff told her to sit on a couch, took her blood pressure, asked her if she had any medications and if so, told her to take them, and convinced her to be brought to a hospital.[63] Hence, regardless of the inconsistency in Buenavista's recollection of the precise time of events, he remained firm in his testimony that Adelaida's complaint came after she began her workout.

Against the findings of negligence, moreover, records show that Slimmers World et al. necessary precautions given the circumstances.","ACCORDINGLY, the Court resolves to:

","The precursor facts are undisputed.

G.R. No. 219421 is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] filed by the BCDA, which fulminates against the Decision[2] of the CA in CA-G.R. SP Nos. 140422 and 140490. The impugned Decision reversed the Order[3] of Branch 6 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Baguio City in Civil Case No. 7561-R, which confirmed the Final Award[4] of the tribunal in an arbitration case between the BCDA and CJH DevCo.

In the petition, CJH DevCo was impleaded as one of the respondents along with Cap-John Hay Trade and Cultural Center, Inc., Camp John Hay Golf Club, Inc. (CJH Golf), Creative Era Limited (Creative Era), Francor, Inc., Makati Foundry, Inc., V. R. Gonzalez Credit Enterprises, Inc., Norman R. Agojo, Ruben A. Alcober, Melinda T. Alcober and Ryan Joseph T.

The BCDA was formed under Republic Act No. 7227.[5] One of its primary purposes was to own, hold and/or administer several former military reservations held by the United States of America. This includes the 695-hectare property in Camp John Hay, Baguio City.[6]

Under the same Act, the BCDA was created to implement the government's policy to accelerate the sound and balanced conversion of former US military bases into alternative productive uses and enhance the benefits derived therefrom to promote the nation's economic and social development.[7]

Whence, Camp John Hay was transformed into the 625-hectare John Hay Special Economic Zone (JHSEZ). Thereupon, the BCDA publicly bid out the lease of a 247-hectare portion of the JHSEZ (leased property), including existing improvements for the development of a family-oriented public tourism complex, multiple-use forest watershed, and human resource development center.[8] The project was eventually awarded to CJH DevCo, the consortium which formed the joint venture.

Ensuingly, the BCDA, as lessor, and Fil-Estate Management, Inc., Penta Capital Investment Corporation, and CJH DevCo, as lessees, entered into a Lease Agreement[9] on October 19, 1996 (1996 Lease Agreement) for the use, management, and operation of the leased property.[10] The BCDA remained the owner of the 247-hectare portion while ownership of the improvements the CJH DevCo introduced thereon pertained to the latter. Nevertheless, CJH DevCo had the obligation to transfer ownership of the said improvements to BCDA at the end of the lease agreement.[11] Likewise, the BCDA authorized CJH DevCo to sublease the property to third persons.[12]","At the maelstrom of these consolidated Petitions are the actions of the Court of Appeals (CA) and the Commission on Audit (COA) in relation to the arbitration proceedings freely entered between the Bases Conversion Development Authority (BCDA) and CJH Development Corporation (CJH DevCo).

The precursor facts are undisputed.

G.R. No. 219421 is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] filed by the BCDA, which fulminates against the Decision[2] of the CA in CA-G.R. SP Nos. 140422 and 140490. The impugned Decision reversed the Order[3] of Branch 6 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Baguio City in Civil Case No. 7561-R, which confirmed the Final Award[4] of the tribunal in an arbitration case between the BCDA and CJH DevCo.
","The Court finds merit in the Petition for Review on Certiorari docketed as G.R. No. 219421.

Conversely, given CJH DevCo's failure to establish grave abuse of discretion on the part of the COA, the Petition for Certiorari in G.R. No. 241772 ought to be dismissed.

In the case at bench, it remains irrefutable that the Final Award has become final and executory. In actual fact, the BCDA and CJH DevCo filed their respective petitions for confirmation thereof. Both were in accord that the arbitral award is conclusive and binding upon them, determinative of their rights and interests.

CJH DevCo attached to its petition for confirmation a list of ""sub-­lessees, sub-locators, and other third parties who, in good faith, acquired vested rights in the leased property."" The RTC confirmed the Final Award in its entirety and issued the requisite Writ of Execution and Notice to Vacate, which included the sub-lessees occupying the leased premises.

During the pre-execution conference before the RTC, however, CJH DevCo filed an Omnibus Motion to exclude the sub-lessees from the enforcement of the February 11, 2015 Final Award, the April 4, 2015 Writ of Execution and the April 20, 2015 Notice to Vacate.

The controversy arose when CJH DevCo filed before the CA a Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition (With Urgent Applications for the Issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order and/or a Writ of Preliminary Injunction)[45] under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court in order to assail the Writ of Execution and the Notice to Vacate issued by the RTC, without waiting for the RTC to decide on the Omnibus Motion. To recapitulate, CJH DevCo asserted that the trial court, the ex-officio sheriff, and the sheriff committed grave abuse of discretion when they included the sub-lessees—who were not parties to the arbitration proceedings—in enforcing the arbitral award. CJH DevCo likewise maintained that there was no appeal or any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy available to it considering that at the time it filed the certiorari petition before the CA, the Notice to Vacate was about to be implemented without the RTC making a definite ruling on the following issues: one, whether the arbitral tribunal is binding on the sub-lessees; and two, whether it should vacate the property without the BCDA performing its obligation of returning the rent it already paid.[46] Subsequently, the petition was granted by the appellate court.","ACCORDINGLY, the Court rules as follows:

In G.R. No. 219421, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is GRANTED. The July 30, 2015 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP Nos. 140422 and 140490 is REVERSED AND SET ASIDE. The March 27, 2015 Order of Branch 6, Regional Trial Court of Baguio City in Civil Case No. 7561-R, confirming the Final Award dated February 11, 2015 in PDRCI Case No. 60-2012 is REINSTATED. The April 14, 2015 Writ of Execution and the Ex-Officio Sheriff's Notice to Vacate are likewise REINSTATED.

In G.R. No. 241772, the Petition for Certiorari is DISMISSED. The September 27, 2017 Decision No. 2017-312 of the Commission on Audit in COA CP Case No. 2015-610 is AFFIRMED.

"A.M. No. RTJ-16-2424 [Formerly A.M. No. 15-12-390-RTC], April 03, 2024","OFFICE OF THE COURT ADMINISTRATOR, PETITIONER, VS. HON. GLOBERT J. JUSTALERO, PRESIDING JUDGE, BRANCH 32, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT (RTC) OF ILOILO CITY, AND THE DESIGNATED ASSISTING JUDGE OF BRANCH 66, RTC OF BAROTAC VIEJO, ILOILO, RESPONDENT.","To recall, Judge Justalero, as the Presiding Judge of Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 32 of Iloilo City and the designated Assisting Judge of Branch 66, RTC of Barotac Viejo, Province of Iloilo, was declared guilty of gross ignorance of the law and procedure and gross misconduct. Specifically, this Court observed him to have committed the following infractions:
(1)
Judge Justalero resolved nullity cases in violation of Administrative Matter (A.M.) No. 02-11-10-SC, or the rules of procedure and basic guidelines for ensuring that cases initiated to declare the nullity of marriage or to annul a marriage are insulated from vice and fraud, by:




(a)
ruling on petitions for nullity of marriage on the merits, despite the lack of jurisdiction of the RTC, Branch 66, Barotac Viejo over it;[9]




(b)
brushing aside the Office of the Solicitor General's Motion for Reconsideration despite its non-receipt of a copy of the petition for declaration of nullity of void marriages and other documents;[10]




(c)
granting the motion to serve summons by publication after the actual dates of publication;[11]




(d)
ordering the conduct of investigation of collusion even before the return of service of summons;[12]




(d)
ruling on and admitting the formal offer of evidence of petitioner on the day of its filing, without awaiting the prosecutor's comment or objection thereto within the period given to interpose it;[13] and




(e)
disregarding incidents where: (i) the sheriffs return of service stated that summons was served on respondent when there is no actual proof of receipt of summons; and (ii) the collusion report was issued only three days from the issuance of the order directing the conduct of an investigation.[14]



(2)
Judge Justalero violated A.M. No. 08-7-429-RTC and Administrative Order (A.O.) No. 12-2010 by solemnizing marriages that were not raffled to his sala but were only referred to him by Judge Amador.[15]



(3)
Judge Justalero notarized affidavits of cohabitation of the parties whose marriage he would also solemnize in violation of the Rules on Notarial Practice of 2004 (Notarial Rules).[16]
As extensively discussed in this Court's ruling, the repeated disregard and unjustified noncompliance with the well-established rules, i.e., A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC, A.M. No. 08-7-429-RTC, A.O. No. 12-2010, and the Notarial Rules, constitute gross ignorance of the law and procedure and gross misconduct. While these are serious charges that warrant the extreme penalty of dismissal from the service, this Court deemed it proper to impose upon Judge Justalero the penalty of suspension from office without pay for one year, taking into consideration the fact that he had not been previously found liable for an administrative offense and that he had a heavy caseload.[17]
 
The case of Flores-Concepcion v. Castañeda[18] explains that there is no and fast rule in determining the imposable penalty, as this often lies within this Court's discretion pursuant to Article VIII, Section 11 of the Constitution, with due consideration to the gravity of the offense and the penalties previously imposed in similar cases. Nevertheless, the purpose of administrative penalties should be to restore and preserve the public trust in the judiciary. Specific to the penalty of suspension, it is a negative reinforcement that is meant to make the respondent suffer for tarnishing the court's reputation.[19]","This Court resolves the Letters dated July 27, 2023,[1] August 15, 2023,[2] and September 13, 2023[3] (collectively, Letters) submitted by Judge Globert J. Justalero (Judge Justalero), seeking to clarify this Court's January 18, 2023 Decision[4] that meted him the penalty of suspension from office without pay for one year, with stern warning that a repetition of the same or similar offenses shall be dealt with more severely.[5]

Foremost, we shall treat the Letters of Judge Justalero as his Motion for Partial Reconsideration of this Court's Decision. In his Letters, he prayed that this Court should: (1) consider the period within which he was placed under preventive suspension for purposes of counting the service of his one-year suspension; and (2) award him back salaries, allowances, and other economic benefits under equity considerations, citing this Court's Resolution in Re: Payment of Backwages and Other Economic Benefits of Judge Philbert I. Iturralde, RTC Branch 58, Angeles City (Iturralde)[6] and this Court's Decision in Office of the Court of Administrator v. Floro, Jr. (Floro).[7] He averred that he had no source of income during his preventive suspension, other than his teaching job, and had incurred several debts to undergo surgery.[8] ","Meanwhile, our ruling in Floro demonstrates that back salaries, allowances, and other economic benefits may be warranted when the imposition of the penalty, i.e., separation from the service, is ""not a penalty as [W]e ordinarily understand the word to mean. It [was] imposed instead out of necessity upon [Judge Florentino V. Floro, Jr. (Judge Floro)] due to a medically disabling condition of the mind which [rendered] him [unfit] to continue discharging the functions of his office.""[50] Thus, even if Judge Floro was found responsible for the delay in the resolution of his case, we awarded him back salaries, allowances and other economic benefits for a period corresponding to three years, considering the seven ""excruciating"" years of suspension during which he was unable to practice any profession.[51]

While the penalty imposed by this Court on Judge Floro was borne out of the medical condition that rendered him unfit in the service, the penalty of suspension meted to Judge Justalero serves as punishment for tarnishing the image of the courts, and is a negative reinforcement meant to restore and preserve the public trust in the judiciary.[52] Therefore, while Judges Floro and Justalero both underwent more than seven years of preventive suspension, the circumstances surrounding the two cases are very different for us to simply straightjacket the back salaries, allowances, and other economic benefits awarded under equity considerations.

Notwithstanding the completely different circumstances in Itturalde and Floro, there still exist equitable grounds for this Court to partially grant the back salaries, allowances, and other economic benefits that Judge Justalero could have earned during his preventive suspension. It bears stressing that the Decision found Judge Justalero's infractions to merit the penalty of suspension for a period of one year. In relation to such penalty, his continued suspension deprived him of his main source of income for a much longer time.

To reiterate, Judge Justalero was preventively suspended ""until further orders of [this] Court"" in the Resolution dated January 20, 2016.[53] Given that the OCA commenced its investigation on June 1, 2016 and that the delay in the disposition of the case was not attributable to him, Judge Justalero should have been reinstated no later than September 30, 2016 in accordance with Rule 140, Sections 5 and 10 of the Rules of Court, as amended.

On the other hand, since the judgment imposed upon Judge Justalero the penalty of one-year suspension from office without pay,[54] the back salaries, allowances, and other economic benefits corresponding to one year shall be deducted from the computation of those benefits that Judge Justalero could have earned from September 30, 2016.

"G.R. No. 260148, April 03, 2024","HERMINIO A. BESMONTE, PETITIONER, VS. NATIONAL POLICE COMMISSION-NATIONAL CAPITAL REGION (NAPOLCOM-NCR), RESPONDENT.","The present controversy had at its inception the conduct of a buy-bust operation for the purpose of apprehending a person who was suspected of illegally peddling dangerous drugs. The dramatis personae are Besmonte, a member of the Philippine National Police (PNP), and the suspect, Evangeline Abenojar (Abenojar).

Following a tip which was made by a confidential informant alleging that Abenojar was involved in the illegal drug trade, a buy-bust operation was conducted by Besmonte who, at that time, held the rank of Police Officer 2 (PO2), along with PO2 Gil Anos (PO2 Anos), and PO2 Junnifer Tuldanes (PO2 Tuldanes), at around 10:30 p.m. of April 11, 2003.

Based on the uniform narration[10] of Besmonte, PO2 Anos, and PO2 Tuldanes, upon arriving at the target site which was situated at Factor Compound, Almanza Uno, Las Piñas City, Abenojar called Besmonte's attention and asked the latter, ""Kukuha ba kayo?""[11] Besmonte, being the designated poseur-buyer, approached Abenojar and signified his intention to buy PHP 100.00 worth of shabu, a dangerous drug. Then, Abenojar left for a while. When she returned with a plastic sheet containing suspected shabu, she demanded payment from Besmonte. The buy-bust transaction was consummated when Besmonte gave Abenojar the marked money in exchange for the said plastic sheet containing suspected shabu. It was at this point that Besmonte held Abenojar's hand and introduced himself as a police officer. However, Abenojar resisted. PO2 Anos and PO2 Tuldanes as back-up members of the buy-bust team, assisted Besmonte by helping to restrain Abenojar. However, Abenojar was still trying to resist them by kicking and uttering vituperative words such as ""Putang ina nyo! Hindi naman kayo mga pulis! Mga adik kayo! Nagpapanggap Zang kayong mga pulis!""[12] Besmonte claimed that after exerting reasonable force, they successfully arrested Abenojar who was later charged with violation of Section 5, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165,[13] otherwise known as the Comprehensive Dangerous Drug Act of 2002, and violation of Article 151 of the Revised Penal Code (Resistance and Disobedience to a Person in Authority or the Agents of Such Person).[14]

Diametrically opposing the foregoing account, Abenojar asserted that the police officers tried to extort her and, failing to do so, physically harmed her.

Abenojar expounded that at around 9:30 p.m. of April 11, 2003, while she was on her way to the house of a certain Auring, she came across the three police officers who were wearing civilian clothes. One of the police officers shouted ""Hoy!!! Hoy!!!""[15] and asked about her name, residential address and what was inside her pocket. Abenojar pulled the amount of PHP 700.00 from her pocket but did not give the same to the police officers. This resulted in PO2 Tuldanes and PO2 Anos holding her arms while Besmonte cursed at her, blurting out ""Putang ina mo! Akina yang pera!""[16] When Abenojar still refused to give the money, Besmonte punch the left side of her face and kicked her knee. This caused Abenojar to feel intense pain and dizziness. Then, Abenojar was brought to a vacant lot where Besmonte declared, ""Tuluyan na natin yan dito.""[17] Abenojar then broke free and kicked Besmonte's thigh. However, Besmonte managed to kick her abdomen. The police officers then brought Abenojar to the Drug Enforcement Unit, Las Piñas City Police Station where she was incarcerated.[18]

In view of the foregoing, Abenojar filed a handwritten letter-­complaint[19] against Besmonte, PO2 Anos, and PO2 Tuldanes before the NAPOLCOM. To corroborate her claim of physical abuse at the hands of the members of the buy-bust team, Abenojar presented a Medical Certificate[20] which was issued on April 14, 2003 by Dr. Ferdinand C. Eusebio (Dr. Eusebio) of the Las Piñas City Health Office. Dr. Eusebio found that Abenojar sustained ""Left Zygomatic area (+) Swelling (+) Tenderness. Right Inguinal Area (+) Tenderness (-) Hematoma.""[21] In layman's terms, Dr. Eusebio reported that Abenojar's left cheek and groin area were swollen and tender.[22]

Thereafter, the Regional Investigation Unit of the NAPOLCOM, National Capital Region, as nominal complainant, formally charged Besmonte, PO2 Anos, and PO2 Tuldanes with Grave Misconduct as follows:
That on April 11, 2003 at around 9:30 in the evening at Las Piñas City and within the administrative jurisdiction of this Honorable Commission, PO2 Gil Anos, PO2 Herminio Besmonte and PO2 Junnifer Tuldanes taking advantage of their position as police officers, conspiring, confederating and helping one another did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously without legal ground arrest, search and detain complaining witness Evangeline Abenojar. Even without resistance from complaining witness respondent PO2 Tuldanes holds [sic] her right arm while PO2 Anos was holding her left arm, therafter without any aggression from the same complaining witness PO2 Besmonte hit her left face and threatens [sic] her by uttering scary words to wit: ""TULUYAN NA NATIN YAN DITO"", thereby inflicting upon her physical injuries and emotional sufferings [sic] and depriving her of liberty and freedom, to the damage and prejudice of complaining witness Evangeline Abenojar.

SP No. 161581.

The challenged issuances dismissed the Rule 43[4] Petition for Review[5] interposed by petitioner Herminio A. Besmonte (Besmonte) which, in turn, disputed the Civil Service Commission's (CSC) Decision No. 180629[6] dated November 22, 2018 and Resolution No. 1900696[7] dated June 18, 2019.

I.

A cursory review of the nature and manner of commission of the administrative offense of Grave Misconduct is imperative.
 
Misconduct is a transgression of some established and definite rule of action, more particularly, unlawful behavior or gross negligence by the public officer.[43] It is the intentional wrongdoing or deliberate violation of a rule of law or standard of behavior.[44]

In administrative cases, misconduct can be classified as either simple or grave. Simple misconduct has been defined as an unacceptable behavior which transgresses the established rules of conduct for public officers, work-related or not.[45] On the other hand, in grave misconduct, the elements of corruption, clear intent to violate the law, or flagrant disregard of an established rule must be manifest.[46]

Corruption as an element of grave misconduct consists in the act of an official or fiduciary person who unlawfully and wrongfully uses his or her station or character to procure some benefit for himself/herself or for another person, contrary to duty and the rights of others.[47] Clear intent to violate the law or flagrant disregard of an established rule presupposes that there is an order or regulation defied by the public official.[48] In Imperial, Jr. v. Government Service Insurance System:[49]
Flagrant disregard of rules is a ground that jurisprudence has already touched upon. It has been demonstrated, among others, in the instances when there had been open defiance of a customary rule; in the repeated voluntary disregard of established rules in the procurement of supplies; in the practice of illegally collecting fees more than what is prescribed for delayed registration of marriages; when several violations or disregard of regulations governing the collection of government funds were committed; and when the employee arrogated unto herself responsibilities that were clearly beyond her given duties. The common denominator in these cases was the employee's propensity to ignore the rules as clearly manifested by his or her actions.[50]
Without any of these elements, the transgression of an established rule is properly characterized as simple misconduct only.[51]
","ACCORDINGLY, the petition is PARTIALLY GRANTED. The Decision dated October 29, 2021 and the Resolution dated March 28, 2022 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 161581 are hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION in that petitioner Herminio A. Besmonte is found GUILTY of Simple Misconduct and is ORDERED suspended from office for a period of six (6) months."
"G.R. No. 250613, April 03, 2024","ELENITA V. MACALINAO, KENNETH V. MACALINAO AND KRISTEL V. MACALINAO, PETITIONERS, VS. CERINA, A.K.A. CERENA N. MACALINAO AND CINDY N. MACALINAO, RESPONDENTS.
","The facts which gave rise to the present controversy involve two marriages and two families who share a husband and father, whose death brought about the question of who may claim the proceeds of his death benefits.

For one, owing to the relevant law's guidance as to how the proceeds of the death benefits in question may be distributed to the beneficiaries, this issue is theoretically knotted as it invites the Court to make the journey into the territory of a longstanding doctrinal debate over a matter that the New Civil Code[6] is decidedly silent on—the share of a surviving spouse in the event that said spouse concurs with one legitimate child, or with legitimate children in the context of an intestate succession. For another, the foregoing debate, once settled by the Court, inevitably bleeds into the reality of the lives of the subject surviving families, in a manner that reveals what perhaps may be a discerned gap in the law.

Faced with the uncommon question of who between the long estranged legal spouse and the subsequent spouse by a bigamous marriage may claim rights to the compensation and benefits for a seafarer's death, the Court finds, pursuant to the relevant POEA rules and their cross-reference to the rules on succession, that only the surviving legitimate spouse may receive the proceeds of the death benefits alongside the deceased spouse's children from both marriages.

A straightforward recollection of the relevant facts which inform the Court's disposition is called for.

Pedrito G. Macalinao (Pedrito) and herein respondent Cerena Negapatan Macalinao (Cerena) married on June 5, 1981, and they were blessed with one child, herein respondent Cindy Macalinao (Cindy). However, only four years after they were married, Pedrito and Cerena separated in fact.[7]

On April 3, 1990, with his marriage to Cerena subsisting, Pedrito entered into a marriage with Elenita, after which they lived together as husband and wife for 25 years, until Pedrito's death on June 26, 2015.[8]

Before his death, Pedrito worked as a seafarer employed by Excel Marine Co. Ltd./Fair Shipping Corporation (Excel Marine). Since he died onboard the vessel of Excel Marine and was a member of the Association of Marine Officers and Seafarers Union of the Philippines (AMOSUP), his death benefits were determined to be in the amount of USD 93,057.88 or PHP 4,506,309.52.[9]
 
In August 2016, Cerena and Cindy (collectively, respondents) filed a petition for the declaration of nullity of the marriage of Pedrito and Elenita. The RTC, however, noted that it was not in accord with A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC Re: Rule on Declaration of Absolute Nullity of Void Marriages and Annulment of Voidable Marriages. The following month, the RTC held a clarificatory hearing where it was established that respondents' true intention in filing the petition was to undertake a settlement of the estate of Pedrito.[10] Based on the said clarification, the RTC ordered the petition to be amended, and respondents subsequently filed an Amended Petition for the Settlement of Estate of the deceased Pedrito, with the issue of the declaration of nullity of the marriage of Pedrito and Elenita considered a secondary issue therein.[11] The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) entered its appearance.[12]

In its Order dated March 27, 2017, the RTC dropped Excel Marine as respondent on the condition that it would issue, as it did, a manager's check in the name of the Heirs of Pedrito Macalinao with the face value equivalent to the computed benefits of Pedrito.[13] Excel Marine later deposited the amount of PHP 4,506,309.52 to the Land Bank of the Philippines (later to the Office of the Clerk of Court of RTC, Muntinlupa City) as the full and complete settlement of its obligation in the instant case.[14]

During the pre-trial, the following facts, among others, were agreed upon by the parties as undisputed:
(i)
Pedrito married Cerena on June 5, 1981;


(ii)
Pedrito and Cerena had one child, Cindy;


(iii)
On April 3, 1990, Pedrito married Elenita;


(iv)
Pedrito and Elenita had two children, Kenneth and Kristel;


(v)
At the time of the second marriage between Pedrito and Elenita, the marriage between Pedrito and Cerena was still existing;


(vi)
There was no filing of any petition for declaration of nullity of the marriage between Pedrito and Cerena; they were only separated in fact for over 24 years prior to Pedrito's death;


(vii)
Cerena, for her part, contracted a second marriage with one Rene Paredes (Rene) on February 7, 1992;


(viii)
Elenita received the cadaver of Pedrito when it was repatriated to the Philippines from Japan;


(ix)
Elenita also received the allotment as spouse of Pedrito based on the latter's employment contract;


(x)
The only property left by Pedrito upon his death are the subject death benefits.[15]
Due to the parties' failure to amicably settle, the RTC determined that the sole issue for its disposition was whether the subject death benefits form part of the estate of Pedrito and, in case they do, the manner by which the total amount may be divided among the claiming parties.[16]
","This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] (Petition) under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court which assails the Decision[2] dated August 29, 2019 and Resolution[3] dated November 25, 2019 of the First Division of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 112739.

The assailed Decision denied the appeal of herein petitioners Elenita V. Macalinao (Elenita), Kenneth V. Macalinao (Kenneth), and Kristel V. Macalinao (Kristel) (collectively, petitioners), and affirmed the September 12, 2018 Decision[4] of Branch 207, Regional Trial Court of Muntinlupa City (RTC). Similarly, the assailed Resolution denied petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration[5] and affirmed the assailed Decision.
","The Petition is partly meritorious, albeit for reasons different from those it brought forth.

The assailed Decision and Resolution are affirmed with the crucial modifications on the matter of how the death benefits by reason of Pedrito's death should be treated, and how they must be distributed to the beneficiaries as contemplated by both the POEA Memorandum Circular vis-à-vis the New Civil Code rules on succession.

To finally put an end to the instant controversy, the Court must first, necessarily, reframe the initial lens from which the principal issue is construed, and definitively answer the two questions on which the disposition pivots: 
(i)
Do the proceeds of the death benefits form part of Pedrito's estate?


(ii)
How and among whom should the proceeds of the death benefits be distributed?
The Court now resolves that: (i) the proceeds of the death benefits are directly payable to the beneficiaries not as a form of inheritance, but as proceeds from a death benefit; (ii) the only qualified beneficiaries to claim the same are Cerena as the legitimate surviving spouse, Cindy as Pedrito's legitimate child from the first marriage, and Kenneth and Kristel, as Pedrito's illegitimate children from the bigamous marriage, and the death benefits shall be distributed among them in accordance with Articles 999 and 983 of the New Civil Code in relation to its Articles 892 and 895, as modified by Article 176 of the Family Code.","ACCORDINGLY, the instant petition is hereby PARTLY GRANTED.

"G.R. No. 260944, April 03, 2024","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. FERNAN CALINES Y MAGASTINO, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","Calines was charged with frustrated homicide and murder in two separate Informations,[4] the accusatory portions of each read:

CRIMINAL CASE NO. 16-CR-11674
(frustrated homicide)

That on the 19th day of December, 2016, at Sitio Pasanan, Ambassador, Municipality of Tublay, Province of Benguet, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with intent to kill, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack and assault NIDA CALASIAO SABADO by striking her several times with a piece of wood, thus performing all the acts of execution which would have produced the crime of Homicide as a consequence but nevertheless did not produce it by reason of causes independent of the will of the accused, that is, by the act of the offended party in running away and the timely and able medical assistance rendered to her which prevented her death, to her damage and prejudice.[5]

CRIMINAL CASE NO. 17-CR-11741
(murder)

That on or about the 19th day of December, 2016, at Sitio Pasanan, Ambassador, Municipality of Tublay, Province of Benguet, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with intent to kill and without any sufficient provocation or reason whatsoever, by means of treachery and use of superior strength, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously strike several times with a piece of wood, SKY SABADO y CALASIAO, a minor being three (3) years and eight (8) months of age at the time of incident, thereby inflicting fatal wounds on the different parts of the body of SKY SABADO y CALASIAO which caused his death, to the damage and prejudice of his heirs.

That in the commission of the crime, the qualifying aggravating circumstances of treachery and use of superior strength as the accused, a fully grown adult, attacked SKY SABADO y CALASIAO, a child of tender years and therefore incapable of defending himself against the attacks committed by the accused who consciously adopted and employed a method or means of attack which directly insured its execution without risk to himself.[6]

During the scheduled arraignment on March 13, 2017, the defense counsel manifested that Calines intended to plead guilty to both charges but requested for the cancellation thereof to give him time to explain the consequences of his plea.[7]","Before the Court is an ordinary Appeal[1] seeking to reverse and set aside the Decision[2] dated June 7, 2021 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 13812, which affirmed with modification the Consolidated Judgment[3] dated November 15, 2019 of the Regional Trial Court of La Trinidad, Benguet, Branch 63 (RTC) in Criminal Case Nos. 16-CR-11674 and 17-CR-11741, finding accused-appellant Fernan Calines y Magastino (Calines) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of attempted homicide and murder, respectively.","The Appeal has no merit.

Calines conviction for murder and attempted homicide must be upheld
Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) states:

Article 248. Murder. – Any person who, not falling within the provisions of Article 246 shall kill another, shall be guilty of murder and shall be punished by reclusion temporal in its maximum period to death, if committed with any of the following attendant circumstances:

1. With treachery, taking advantage of superior strength, with the aid of armed men, or employing means to weaken the defense or of means or persons to insure or afford impunity.

Jurisprudence dictates that the elements of murder are: (1) that a person was killed; (2) that the accused killed him or her; (3) that the killing was attended by any of the qualifying circumstances mentioned in Article 248 of the RPC; and (4) that the killing is not parricide or infanticide.[36]

Meanwhile, Article 6 of the RPC states that there is an attempt to commit a felony when the offender directly commences its commission by overt acts but was unable to perform all the acts of execution which should have produced the felony by reason of some cause or accident other than his or her own spontaneous desistance.

In turn, the Court held that attempted homicide is committed when the accused intended to kill the victim, as manifested by the use of a deadly weapon in the assault, and the wound/s sustained by the victim was/were not fatal.[37]

In this case, all the elements of murder and attempted homicide are present as will be discussed below.

It bears to recall that Sky was only three years old when he was killed by Calines. Moreover, the corresponding Information filed against him alleged the qualifying circumstances of treachery and abuse of superior strength. Jurisprudence teaches that the killing of a child of tender years is deemed ipso facto qualified by treachery due to his or her inherent defenselessness.[38] Therefore, the CA correctly appreciated the qualifying circumstance of treachery in the killing of Sky, especially considering that he had no way of defending himself. The CA also correctly ruled that abuse of superior strength is already absorbed in treachery. Thus, Calines was properly adjudged to have committed the crime of murder.","ACCORDINGLY, the Appeal is DISMISSED. The Decision dated June 7, 2021 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 13812 is hereby AFFIRMED, as follows:

(1)

"G.R. No. 265610, April 03, 2024","WALTER L. BORROMEO AND JIMMY N. PARCIA, PETITIONERS, VS. LAZADA E-SERVICES PHILIPPINES, INC., ALEX DORONOLLO, ALLAN ANCHETA, RICHARD DELANTAR, AND SAM REYES, RESPONDENTS.","On April 1, 2016[6] and July 16, 2017,[7] Borromeo and Parcia, respectively, signed an Independent Contractor Agreement (Agreement) with Lazada, where they agreed to provide logistics and delivery services for the company using their own motor vehicles. Their respective contracts provided that they would be paid a service fee in the amount of PHP 1,200.00 for a full day's work. Borromeo's contract was good for one year, unless earlier terminated pursuant to Clause 6 of the Agreement or renewed in writing, while the engagement of Parcia was for a duration of six months, unless earlier terminated pursuant to Clause 7 or renewed in writing at the sole discretion of Lazada.[8]

As riders, Borromeo and Parcia were tasked to pick-up products sold through the Lazada platform from its merchants and deliver them to Lazada's warehouse. According to them, Reyes, the route dispatcher team leader, would provide them a route sheet which contained their assigned merchants from whom they will pick-up the products for transfer to the warehouse. Borromeo and Parcia had to report to the monitoring supervisor and route monitoring staff of Lazada the moment they arrive at the location of their assigned merchants to be able to scan the products. They also had to inform them, through text messages or phone calls, the number of products they picked-up from the said merchants. Aside from the route sheet, Borromeo and Parcia were also directed to retrieve defective items from the return department for return to the merchants, which was no longer part of their job as riders but which they could not refuse for fear that they would not be given new routes for pick-up.[9]

On August 18 and 19, 2017, Borromeo and Parcia were informed that they would be terminated on August 23, 2017 because Lazada was reducing personnel at its pick-up department, and that it would be retaining only five pick-up riders. This prompted Borromeo and Parcia to file before the NLRC a complaint for illegal dismissal, nonpayment of overtime pay, holiday pay, holiday premium pay, rest day premium pay, service incentive leave pay, and 13th month pay, illegal deductions on their respective surety bonds, regularization, as well as for payment of moral and exemplary damages and attorney's fees.[10]

Borromeo and Parcia claimed that they were regular employees of Lazada not only because their work were directly related and usually desirable to the business of Lazada which was the selling of products online, but also due to the fact that RGServe and Dynamic were labor-only contractors. They assert that their dismissal was illegal as it was made without legal basis since they did not commit any misconduct against Lazada. Procedural due process was likewise not observed before their services were terminated.[11]

Lazada moved for the dismissal of the complaint and countered that Borromeo and Parcia were independent contractors and not its employees for the following reasons: (a) they make use of their own vehicles in providing the contracted services; (b) they were duly registered and licensed to perform delivery and transportation services with the pertinent business permits, Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) and Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) registrations; and (c) their individual contracts explicitly provided that there will be no employer-employee relationship between the parties.[12]

Lazada further claimed that its contract with Borromeo expired on March 30, 2017 and the same was not renewed because Borromeo did not agree to do last mile delivery services. On the other hand, its contract with Parcia was still in effect when he was informed that there was going to be a change from first mile pick up to last mile delivery. Since Parcia no longer went back to work after asking for time to consider the proposed change in his service route, Lazada decided to terminate the contract. It served a Notice of Pre-Termination[13] dated September 5, 2017, but Parcia refused to accept it. Lazada argued that Borromeo and Parcia were not illegally dismissed because they were never its employees. Thus, the case did not fall within the jurisdiction of the Labor Arbiter, and Borromeo and Parcia were not entitled to their monetary claims which were reserved only for regular employees. There was also no basis to implead Doronollo, Ancheta, Delantar, and Reyes.[14]

In a Decision,[15] the Labor Arbiter dismissed Borromeo and Parcia's complaint for lack of jurisdiction after finding that there was no employer-employee relationship between the parties. The Labor Arbiter held that the Agreement between the parties, the BIR Authority for Borromeo and Parcia to print official receipts, BIR Certificate of Registration, and DTI Certificate of Business Name Registration in their names sufficiently proved that Borromeo and Parcia were not employees of Lazada, but that they were separately engaged as independent contractors to undertake delivery and transportation business using motor vehicles registered in their names at the rate of PHP 1,200.00 for a full day of actual service, inclusive of fuel costs, telephone contacts with customers and other expenses, payable every 15th and 30th day of the month. The fact that Borromeo and Parcia issued BIR official receipts for the service fees they received and that Lazada did not deduct the mandatory Social Security System (SSS), PhilHealth, and Pag-Ibig contributions from their fees all the more showed that they were not its employees. The parties' desire not to be bound by the employer-employee relationship was expressly stipulated in the Agreements they signed.[16]

The Labor Arbiter continued that the control test in determining the existence of employer-employee relationship between the parties was not also satisfied in that it was not sufficiently shown that Lazada controlled the means and methods by which they individually fulfilled their obligations as Lazada's only concern was that they get the deliveries done. Lazada's act of providing them with route sheets did not negate the existence of independent contractor agreement since the route sheets only apprised them where to pick-up the parcels for delivery to Lazada's warehouse, and eventually for dispatch to the buyers, and it was not a means to dictate upon them the method to be employed to attain the desired result. Thus, instead of being illegally dismissed, the Labor Arbiter found that the Agreement between Lazada and Parcia was pre-terminated on September 5, 2017 under Clause 7 thereof, while Lazada's contract with Borromeo ended on March 30, 2017. The Labor Arbiter concluded that since no employer-employee relationship existed between the parties, their contracts were governed by the Civil Code and the Labor Arbiter had no jurisdiction over the complaint.[17]

The Labor Arbiter also noted that Borromeo and Parcia did not implead as indispensable parties RGServe and Dynamic, the manpower agencies that initially hired them as delivery riders for Lazada. As such, their unsubstantiated allegation that RGServe and Dynamic were mere labor-only contractors which made them regular employees of Lazada could not be passed upon.[18] The Labor Arbiter disposed of the case in this wise:","This resolves the Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] assailing the Decision[2] and Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA), which found that the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) did not act with grave abuse of discretion when it affirmed the ruling of the Labor Arbiter dismissing the complaint filed by Walter L. Borromeo (Borromeo) and Jimmy Parcia (Parcia) against Lazada E-Services Philippines, Inc. (Lazada), Alex Doronollo[4] (Doronollo), Allan Ancheta (Ancheta), Richard Delantar (Delantar), and Sam Reyes (Reyes) (collectively, Lazada et al.) for lack of jurisdiction on the ground that there is no employer-employee relationship between the parties.
Borromeo started to render service as a pick-up rider for Lazada on February 5, 2015 until March 31, 2016 under RGServe Manpower Services (RGServe). On the other hand, Parcia commenced his services as Lazada's pick-up rider from March 31, 2012 until March 31, 2016 under Dynamic Personnel Assistance Manpower (Dynamic).[5","A party desiring to appeal an adverse judgment, final order, or resolution rendered by the CA, the Sandiganbayan, the Court of Tax Appeals, the Regional Trial Courts or other courts, when allowed by law, in cases other than criminal cases where the penalty imposed is death, reclusion perpetua or life imprisonment,[43] may file a petition for review on certiorari before this Court.[44] However, before this Court takes cognizance of such petition, the basic procedural standards set forth under Rule 45 must first be satisfied.[45] These are as follows:

(1)
that the petition does not only exclusively raise questions of law, but also that it distinctly sets forth those legal issues;
(2)
that it be filed within 15 days of notice of the adverse ruling that impels it;
(3)

(6)
that it is manifestly meritorious;
(7)
that it is not prosecuted manifestly for delay; and
(8)
that the questions raised in it are of such substance as to warrant consideration.[46] (Citations omitted)
Inasmuch as petitioners were not able to file their petition within the 15-day reglementary period, one of the requisites mentioned above, this Court is at liberty to deny outright or deny due course to the Rule 45 Petition they filed.[47] The dismissal of a belatedly-filed petition also finds support under Section S(a), Rule 56 of the Rules of Court. The Section reads:

Section 5. Grounds for dismissal of appeal. – The appeal may be dismissed motu proprio or on motion of the respondent on the following grounds:","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is GRANTED.

Case No. 15-534:
On 27th day of June 2013, or sometime prior or subsequent thereto, in the [C]ity of Makati, the Philippines, [the] accused, conspiring and confederating together, with intent to defraud and by means of false pretenses, misrepresentations and fraudulent acts made or executed prior to or simultaneously with the commission of fraud, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously defraud complainant, Oaña Credit Solutions, Inc. [(Oaña Credit)], herein represented by Rommelito S. Tolentino, in the following manner: accused, in order to convince [Oaña Credit] to grant them a bridge financing loan represented to [Oaña Credit] that they will cause the release to [Oaña Credit] or its representative the proceeds of the pre-approved loan with PS Bank Zapote Branch, but such representations were false, the truth being that accused never had [the] intention to release the proceeds of the PSBank loan to Oaña [Credit], but rather keep the proceeds to themselves and profit therefrom, which representations were solely made to convince [Oaña Credit] to approve the bridge loan, and release to accused the amount of [PHP] 2,565,325[.00], but accused do not intend to pay or honor the same, as in fact said amount was not paid to [Oaña Credit], nor the proceeds of the PSBank loan released to [Oaña Credit], to the damage and prejudice of the latter in the aforesaid amount of [PHP] 2,565,325[.00].","This Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] inveighs against the Decision[2] and the Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA), which found petitioner Maycel Balucero Nanzan (Nanzan) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of other deceits, as defined and penalized under the first paragraph of Article 318 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), and which denied her Motion for Reconsideration[4] thereof, respectively, in CA-G.R. CR No. 43447.","The Petition is denied for lack of merit.

At the outset, the Court reiterates that only questions of law may be entertained in a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45, and an examination of questions of facts is allowed only in exceptional circumstances.[51] ""The determination of whether the elements of the crimes charged exist pertains to question of facts as this requires the recalibration of the whole evidence presented.""[52] Petitioner seeks to overturn the findings of the lower courts on the ground that ""facts of weight and substance have been overlooked, misapprehended, or misapplied,"" specifically that the CA sustained her conviction by ""conveniently ignoring and glossing over the existence of the [real estate mortgage] in this whole matter ""[53]

Indeed, Nanzan bemoans the purported failure of the courts a quo to duly consider the existence of the real estate mortgage executed between the parties, which, if taken into account, would have supposedly negated her criminal liability.[54] She insists that the presentation of the real estate mortgage itself was unnecessary since the contents thereof are not in issue; hence, substitutionary evidence may suffice to prove its existence. In this case, petitioner argues that the loan agreement itself proves the existence of the real estate mortgage since it makes specific reference thereto in its provisions.[55]

Nanzan's thesis cannot pass judicial muster.

It is an inviolable principle that the ""[t]he court shall consider no evidence which has not been formally offered.""[56] Nanzan continuously harps on the real estate mortgage as the legal mooring of her innocence, however, the lower courts could not appreciate the same for the simple reason that such instrument was never even offered as evidence.

PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PETITIONER, VS. SEN. ANTONIO F. TRILLANES IV, RESPONDENT.
","Former Senator Antonio F. Trillanes IV (Trillanes) is a former active member of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), particularly the Philippine Navy, with the rank of Lieutenant Senior Grade.[1]

On July 27, 2003, Trillanes led a group of armed soldiers known as the Magdalo Group and took over the Oakwood Premier Apartments in Makati City. This event has been since known as the Oakwood Mutiny. Because of his acts, Trillanes, along with the other members of the Magdalo Group involved in the Oakwood Mutiny, were charged with the crime of Coup d’etat under Article 134-A of the Revised Penal Code (RPC). The case was filed before Branch 148 (Branch 148), Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Makati City, and docketed as Criminal Case No. 03-2784, titled People of the Philippines v. Antonio F. Trillanes, IV, et al. (the Coup d’etat Case).[2]

During the pendency of the Coup d’etat Case, Trillanes won a Senate seat in the 2007 elections.

On November 29, 2007, during a hearing in the Coup d’etat Case before Branch 148, Trillanes and the other members of the Magdalo Group walked out of the court and proceeded to take over the Manila Peninsula Hotel. Trillanes and the Magdalo Group called for the ouster of then President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. This event is now known as the Manila Peninsula Incident.[3]

Police authorities attempted to serve a warrant of arrest for direct contempt issued by Branch 148, but Trillanes and his group refused to receive it. Thus, the police were eventually forced to break into the hotel to arrest Trillanes and his group.[4]

Because of the Manila Peninsula Incident, Trillanes, among others, was subsequently charged with Rebellion in 2007. The case was filed before Branch 150 (Branch 150), RTC Makati City, and docketed as Criminal Case No. 07-3126, titled People of the Philippines v. Sen. Antonio F. Trillanes IV, et al.[5] (the Rebellion Case).[6]

On November 24, 2010, former President Benigno S. Aquino, III (President Aquino) issued Proclamation No. 75, Series of 2010 (Proclamation No. 75).[7] Proclamation No. 75 granted amnesty to all active and former personnel of the AFP and the Philippine National Police (PNP), and their supporters, who have or may have committed crimes punishable under the RPC, the Articles of War, or other laws, in connection with the Oakwood Mutiny, the Marines Stand-Off, and the Manila Peninsula Incident.[8]","These consolidated cases require the Court to determine the limits of presidential power weighed against the protections granted under the Bill of Rights. In resolving this issue, the Court, as it is sworn to do, anchors its ruling on the Constitution and the supremacy of the rule of law.
The Court affirms the value of procedural rules in enforcing and protecting the fundamental right to due process and the equal protection of the laws. Indeed, the duty of governing a country requires the exercise of great powers. In the government's zeal to perform its duty, there can be a risk to take certain laws and rules lightly upon the belief that these are minor irregularities justified by the importance of the task at hand. Nonetheless, no intention, no matter how lofty, warrants a violation of fundamental freedoms and of cornerstone public policies that help keep our system of justice alive.

In these consolidated cases, the Court upholds the Constitution and reaffirms that no one, not even the President, is above the law.","G.R. No. 241494

The Court first resolves the procedural issues.

Procedural Issues

Trillanes did not commit forum shopping
The meaning of forum shopping is well established. In Top Rate Development Construction & General Services, Inc. v. Paxton Corporation,[110] the Court explained:

FORUM SHOPPING is committed by a party who institutes two or more suits indifferent courts, either simultaneously or successively, in order to ask the courts to rule on the same or related causes or to grant the same or substantially the same reliefs, on the supposition that one or the other court would make a favorable disposition or increase a party's chances of obtaining a favorable decision or action.[111]

Further, in City of Taguig v. City of Makati,[112] the Court ruled:

Ultimately, what is truly important to consider in determining whether forum-shopping exists or not is the vexation caused the courts and parties-litigant by a party who asks different courts and/or administrative agencies to rule on the same or related causes and/or to grant the same or substantially the same reliefs, in the process creating the possibility of conflicting decisions being rendered by the different fora upon the same issue.[113] (Emphasis supplied; citation omitted)

The test to ascertain if forum shopping exists is whether in two or more cases, there is identity of parties, rights, causes of action, and reliefs sought.[114] With respect specifically to litis pendentia, it exists when the following elements concur: (a) identity of the parties in the two actions; (b) substantial identity in the causes of action and in the reliefs sought by the parties; and (c) the identity between the two actions should be such that any judgment that may be rendered in one case, regardless of which party is successful, would amount to res judicata in the other.[115]

Here, Trillanes impleaded the respondents, in their official capacities, and sought to have Proclamation No. 572 declared invalid and unconstitutional. On the other hand, the matters then pending in Branch 148 and Branch 150 pertained to the Omnibus Motions filed by the People, through the DOJ, to issue warrants of arrest and HDOs against Trillanes. In his comments on these motions, Trillanes asked for the denial of the Omnibus Motions. He assailed the legal and factual bases of the Omnibus Motions and prayed that the trial courts deny the issuance of warrants of arrest and HDO i.e., that he has been granted amnesty and that the dismissals of the Rebellion and Coup d’etat Cases have become final and immutable. He did not raise in his comments the issue of the unconstitutionality of Proclamation No. 572. Trillanes filed the Certiorari Petition for the specific purpose of having Proclamation No. 572 declared unconstitutional and to bar Branch 150 and Branch 148 from hearing and granting the Omnibus Motions.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Certiorari, Prohibition, and Injunction, dated September 5, 2018 filed by petitioner Antonio F. Trillanes IV in G.R. No. 241494 is GRANTED. Proclamation No. 572 is declared VOID.

Further, the Petition for Review with Prayer for the Issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction and Set the Case for Oral Argument, dated June 15, 2021 filed by the People in G.R. No. 256660 is DENIED.

Finally, the Petition for Review with prayer for the Issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction and Motion to Set the Case for Oral Argument, dated March 24, 2021, in G.R. No. 256078 is DENIED."
"A.C. No. 13995, April 03, 2024","JHYCKE G. PALMA, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. LADIMIR IAN G. MADURAMENTE, RESPONDENT.","Palma claims to be the duly elected President of The Great Warrior, a homeowner's association purportedly registered with the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board. Allegedly, The Great Warrior engaged the legal services of Maduramente for several cases.[3]

One of the cases was Civil Case No. 6502-3, filed before Branch 3, Municipal Trial Court in Cities of General Santos City (MTCC), which involved an action for Injunction against Palma and all other persons claiming rights under her (Palma's group).[4] Plaintiffs in that case prayed for Palma's group to vacate the land they were occupying and pay for the damages they caused.[5]

Notably, Palma stated that plaintiffs therein moved to declare them in default because Maduramente failed to file their Answer on time. Fortunately, the MTCC eventually accepted their belatedly filed Answer and issued the order for the pre-trial conference. However, Maduramente failed to appear during the pre-trial conference and did not even file a pre-trial brief. Thus, the MTCC declared Palma's group in default.[6] Only plaintiffs therein were allowed to present evidence, which ultimately led to the resolution of the case in their favor.[7]

Verily, Maduramente allegedly promised to remedy the situation by filing a motion for reconsideration, which was nonetheless denied. He then filed a notice of appeal but this was not given due course by the MTCC on the ground that it was filed out of time. Palma added that they repeatedly asked Maduramente to withdraw from the case but he took so long to do so. It was only after they made incessant requests did Maduramente eventually withdraw and surrender the records of the case to Palma.[8]

Palma also narrated that Maduramente represented her group, in another case, an action for the Declaration of Nullity of Sale, Cancellation of Certificate of Title, and Damages, docketed as Civil Case No. 8506 before Branch 23, Regional Trial Court of General Santos City (RTC).[9] Palma's group intervened in that case on the ground that they have a better right over the property in dispute.[10] However, Palma claimed that Maduramente also represented the plaintiffs, in violation of the rule against conflict of interest.[11]

For Maduramente's part, he stated that he failed to attend the pre-trial conference for Civil Case No. 6502-3 because he was in Manila at the time. As proof, he attached an itinerary ticket. He claimed that it was Palma who did not attend said conference despite being advised to do so.[12] As to the belated filing of the notice of appeal, he stated that this was due to the inadvertence of his staff.[13]

Anent Civil Case No. 8506, Maduramente argued that there was no conflict of interest. He admitted that he was indeed the counsel on record of plaintiffs in that case. However, he only acted as counsel for Palma's group, as intervenors, because they were being harassed by the named landowners through requests for the disconnection of their electricity. Maduramente stated that the Complaint-in-Intervention was filed by Palma's group primarily to save on expenses.[14]
","Before the Court is an administrative Complaint[1] filed by Jhycke G. Palma (Palma) against respondent Ladimir Ian G. Maduramente (Maduramente). Palma imputes negligence to Maduramente and alleges that the latter violated the rule against conflict of interest. Accordingly, she prays that Maduramente be disbarred from the practice of law.[2]","The Court adopts the recommendation of the IBP BOG.

It is settled that membership in the Bar is a privilege burdened with conditions.[22] Only those who exhibit special fitness not only in intellect, but also in moral character, may continue to enjoy such privilege.[23] At all times, lawyers are expected to conduct themselves with great propriety, and their behavior must be beyond reproach.[24]

Verily, once a lawyer agrees to take up the cause of a client, they owe fidelity to such cause and must be mindful of the trust and confidence reposed in them.[25] Any dereliction of duty by a lawyer affects the client.[26] Hence, they are expected to commit their entire devotion to the interest of the client, to the end that nothing be taken or withheld from his or her client, save by the rules of law, legally applied.[27]

Similarly, lawyers are duty-bound to avoid representing conflicting interests.[28] This is because the relationship between a lawyer and their client is imbued with the highest level of trust and confidence.[29] They are expected to turn down an offer for professional employment or the engagement of legal services, no matter how attractive the fees may be, if accepting the same would result to a violation of the prohibition against conflict of interest.[30]

The relevant provisions of the CPR in relation to a lawyer's responsibility in handling cases, and avoiding the representation of conflicting interests are as follows:
Canon 17 - A lawyer owes fidelity to the cause of his client and he shall be mindful of the trust and confidence reposed in him.

Canon 18 - A lawyer shall serve his client with competence and diligence.

Canon 15 - A lawyer shall observe candor, fairness and loyalty in all his dealings and transactions with his clients.

Rule 15.03. - A lawyer shall not represent conflicting interests except by written consent of all concerned given after a full disclosure of the facts.
Nonetheless, the CPR has been repealed by A.M. No. 22-09-01-SC,[31] or the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability (CPRA).[32] The CPRA includes a transitory provision, which states that it shall be applied to all pending and future cases, unless not feasible or would work injustice.[33] As the exceptions are not present in the instant case, the Court deems the application of the provisions of the CPRA to be proper.[34]

Concomitantly, the following provisions of the CPRA are pertinent to the instant case:","ACCORDINGLY, the Court finds respondent Atty. Ladimir Ian G. Maduramente GUILTY of violating the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability and the Lawyer's Oath. The Court imposes the following penalties against him:
1. SUSPENSION from the practice of law for a period of one year for gross negligence in the performance of his duty; and

2. SUSPENSION from the practice of law for a period of one year for an intentional violation of the conflict of interest rules.
However, considering that he has already been disbarred, these penalties can no longer be imposed but should nonetheless be considered if he should subsequently apply for the lifting of his disbarment. In view of his continuing disbarment, a penalty of a FINE in the amount of PHP 110,000.00 is imposed upon him for each offense.

Let a copy of this Decision be furnished to the Office of the Bar Confidant, to be appended to Atty. Ladimir Ian Maduramente's personal records as attorney. Likewise, let copies of this Decision be furnished to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines and the Office of the Court Administrator for dissemination to all courts in the country."
"G.R. No. 254465, April 03, 2024 ","JONATHAN DY CHUA BARTOLOME, PETITIONER, VS. TOYOTA QUEZON AVENUE, INC., LINCOLN T. LIM, ESTEBAN DELA PAZ, JR., JOSEFINA DE JESUS, AND PAULINE BACALING, RESPONDENTS.","Sometime in March 2009, petitioner Bartolome was hired by respondent Toyota Quezon Avenue, Inc. (TQAI) as a marketing professional trainee of its Vehicles Sales Department. In August 2010, he became a regular employee with the assigned task of selling Toyota brand cars, products, and services.[4]

On December 28, 2015, Bartolome received from the Human Resources Department of TQAI a Notice of Decision for Habitual Absences for the month of October 2015 and a Notice of Explanation for Habitual Absences for the month of November 2015. On top of these, he received another notice placing him under a seven-day suspension for a third offense.[5] To these notices, he submitted his reply.

On January 22, 2016, Bartolome and the management had a meeting where he got assisted by his sibling as counsel. After the meeting, he thought that the matter was already closed and settled. But in a subsequent marketing professionals' meeting, TQAI President Lim uttered the following unsavory remarks against him for bringing his lawyer-sibling to the meeting:[6]
""Kung hindi ba kayo nagaabsent gagawa ba kami ng paraan, kung sinusunod nyo nyo (sic) protocol natin gagawa ba kami ng paraan[?] Ayaw naman naming kayo higpitan kasi kailangan namin gawin. Bakit isa lang ba kayong empleyado sa opisinang ito, bakit only child ba kayo? Kung only child pwede kaso pag only child normally ano nangyayari pag only child ""spoiled"". Wag nyo naman kami subukan, tapos magdadala kayo ng tatay/nanay para isumbong kami, tapos icc: nyo kung sino man dapat nyo icc:""[7]
On January 25, 2016, TQAI referred the processing and sale of a car to Bartolome. By the time he finished processing the document, the client was already on board a vehicle which had a leather cover seat, albeit this accessory should not be included in the package. All he could do, however, was hand in the signed documents to the client.[8] Later on, he explained the incident to TQAI Group Retail Manager De Jesus and requested an investigation.[9] De Jesus responded ""[a]langan namang pati si Oda pagbayarin mo pa. Ano ba ang pinaglalaban mo?"" He was, therefore, left with the impression that he will be solely liable for the incident.[10]

On February 5, 2016, he voluntarily submitted documents explaining the incident and requesting an investigation. De Jesus simply collected the documents and did nothing more. Later, he found out that De Jesus paid for the leather seats cover, an action which could be taken against him (as if he admitted the incident and paid for it).[11]

After a few days, many of his accounts were unceremoniously withdrawn and transferred to another marketing professional without any explanation. On March 1, 2016, he was transferred to another team.[12] When he protested the sudden transfer of accounts, De Jesus told him, ""[a]yaw ka na pahawakan ng accounts ni Boss Lincoln. Accounts nya yan. Siya ang may say.""[13]

Still, he tried to process one particular sale under these accounts only to be stopped by TQAI General Sales Manager Dela Paz, who refused to sign the vehicle sales proposal. Dela Paz told him, ""[h]indi ka pwede magrelease sa kliyenteng ito. Pwede mo iprocess pero ipangalan mo sa iba."" He retorted, ""[e]h bakit ko po ipapangalan sa iba e, ako ang nagtrabaho?""[14] Dela Paz merely tapped another marketing professional to process the transaction. Dela Paz would subsequently refuse to sign off his sales proposal and pushed his unit allocation to the end of the line each time despite the ""first to submit/pay reservation"" policy.[15]

Meantime, his transfer to a new team did not go well either. His new boss Susan Sobreviñas asked him ""[a]no plano mo, magreresign ka?"" It then became clear to him that his transfer to another team was intended to force his resignation. On March 9, 2016, when he was asked by De Jesus to sign his 2015 Performance Scorecard, he raised certain concerns about it. A week after, he got back the scorecard which this time bore grades lower than when he first received it. He was nonetheless constrained to sign it under protest.[16]

Thereafter, he had another encounter with Dela Paz when the latter pressured him to sign a memorandum accepting changes in his performance bonus. That encounter was followed by his receipt of yet another Memorandum dated March 16, 2016, asking him to explain why he failed to meet his sales quota for the month of February 2016. On March 30, 2016, he replied that had he been allowed to release the units under his accounts, he would have met or exceeded his quota for February 2016.[17]

According to Bartolome, these series of events and the eventual hostile working environment which he endured every day made it impossible and unbearable for him to continue working for TQAI. Thus, he was forced to give up his position and tender his resignation letter on March 31, 2016, effective April 30, 2016. He also requested approval of his terminal leave beginning April 4, 2016. When he tried to process his clearance on April 21, 2016, he was treated like a stranger-criminal and was subjected to undue harassment. After almost three months of processing his clearance, he claimed that he received his last salary on July 9, 2016. It was less than what he ought to receive as salary; it also did not include his 13th month pay nor his earned commissions.[18]

On August 4, 2016, he filed a Complaint for illegal/constructive dismissal and money claims, titled Jonathan Dy Chua Bartolome v. Toyota Quezon Avenue, Inc., Lincoln Lim, Franklin T. Lim, Esteban Dela Paz, Glecy Gamboa, Josefina De Jesus, and Pauline Bacaling, docketed as NLRC NCR Case No. 08-09774-16.[19]","This Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] seeks to reverse the following dispositions of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 155436:
1)
Decision[2] dated January 22, 2020, reversing the finding of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) that petitioner Jonathan Dy Chua Bartolome (Bartolome) was constructively dismissed by respondents Toyota Quezon Ave, Inc., Lincoln T. Lim (President Lim), Esteban Dela Paz, Jr. (Dela Paz), Josefina De Jesus (De Jesus), and Pauline Bacaling; and


2)
Resolution[3] dated November 19, 2020, denying petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration.","As a rule, the Court, not being a trier of facts, will not take cognizance of factual issues, much less analyze or weigh evidence all over again. As an exception, however, it may proceed to probe and resolve factual issues where it appears that the findings of the Court of Appeals are contrary to those of the NLRC and the labor arbiter, as in this case.[34]

Constructive dismissal arises ""when continued employment is rendered impossible, unreasonable or unlikely; when there is a demotion in rank and/or a diminution in pay; or when a clear discrimination, insensibility or disdain by an employer becomes unbearable to the employee.""[35] In such cases, the impossibility, unreasonableness, or unlikelihood of continued employment leaves an employee with no other viable recourse but to terminate his or her employment.[36]

By definition, constructive dismissal can happen in any number of ways. At its core, however, is the gratuitous, unjustified, or unwarranted nature of the employer's action. As it is a question of whether an employer acted fairly, it is inexorable that any allegation of constructive dismissal be contrasted with the validity of exercising management prerogative.[37]","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated January 22, 2020, and Resolution dated November 19, 2020 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 155436 are REVERSED. Respondent Toyota Quezon Ave, Inc., Lincoln T. Lim, Esteban Dela Paz, Jr. and Josefina De Jesus are SOLIDARILY LIABLE for the illegal dismissal of petitioner Jonathan Dy Chua Bartolome. They are ordered to PAY him the following:
1)
full Backwages computed from April 1, 2016 up to the finality of this Decision;


2)
separation pay equivalent to one month pay for every year of service, with a fraction of at least six months considered as one whole year, computed from March 2009 up to the finality of this Decision;


3)
commissions in the amount of PHP 83,341.80 plus adjustment of PHP 3,115.14 and PHP 6,230.28 representing two accounts excluded from his total commission; and


4)
moral and exemplary damages in the amount of PHP 70,000.00.
Respondents are further ordered to PAY attorney's fees to petitioner equivalent to 10% of the total monetary award.
 
The total monetary award shall earn legal interest at 6% per annum from finality of this Decision until fully paid.

"G.R. No. 257723, April 01, 2024","AURORA O. ARAGON-MABANG,* PETITIONER, VS. OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSMAN, RESPONDENT.","On May 9, 2012, the Department of Budget and Management issued Special Allotment Release Order No. BMB-G-12-T-000002360 and Advice of NCA Issued (Fund 101) covering PHP 3,800,000.00 to the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos (NCMF) as the implementing agency for the livelihood project of Congressman Simeon A. Datumanong (Cong. Datumanong) of the 2nd District of Maguindanao in the Municipalities of Ampatuan, Datu Abdullah Sanki, and Mamasapano. The amount shall be sourced from the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) of Cong. Datumanong for the fiscal year of 2012.[6]

In a Letter[7] dated July 16, 2012, Cong. Datumanong requested Mehol K. Sadain (Sadain), then Secretary/Commissioner and Chief Executive Officer of the NCMF, to implement the Sustainable Livelihood Projects - Soapmaking, Candle Making, and Fish Processing (project), through the non-government organization (NGO) Maharlikang Lipi Foundation, Inc. (MLFI). He authorized Sadain to release the fund from his PDAF to MLFI.[8]

Accordingly, the NCMF initially released the amount of PHP 3,420,000.00 to MLFI on July 31, 2012 and retained ten percent of the allocated PDAF, which pertained to three percent (3%) or PHP 114,000.00 as monitoring expenses, and seven percent (7%) or PHP 266,000.00 as retention fee or final tranche. This was through an unnumbered and undated disbursement voucher[9] (1st DV) signed by Mabang, Fedelina D. Aldanese (Aldanese), and Sadain.

Mabang, as the Acting Chief of the Management Audit Division (MAD) under the Finance Management Services of the NCMF, certified that the expenses/advances were necessary, lawful, and incurred under her direct supervision. Aldanese, as the Acting Chief Accountant of the NCMF, certified that the supporting documents were complete, proper, and attached, as well as that the cash was available. Sadain approved the payment. Check No. 446187[10] dated July 31, 2012 was issued in favor of MLFI, who in turn, issued a receipt[11] dated August 8, 2012 to the NCMF.[12]

On August 10, 2012, the NCMF, represented by Sadain; the Office of Cong. Datumanong, represented by Cong. Datumanong; and MLFI, represented by its President, Gracita Cecilia Mascenon, entered into a Memorandum of Agreement[13] (MOA) in connection with the project pursuant to NCMF Resolution No. 48,[14] series of 2012 dated July 25, 2012.[15]

Subsequently, Mabang, NCMF Director III Galay M. Makalinggan (Makalinggan), Aldanese, and Sadain, signed an unnumbered DV[16] dated February 13, 2013 (2nd DV) in the same capacities as that of the 1st DV, except that Mabang and Makalinggan both certified that the expenses/advances were necessary, lawful, and incurred under their direct supervision. Queenie E. Rodriguez likewise signed the 2nd DV to certify that she received the payment from the NCMF. Check No. 84530[17] dated February 14, 2013, covering the retention fee of PHP 266,000.00 was issued to MLFI, who then issued a receipt[18] to the NCMF on the same day.[19]

The OMB-Field Investigation Office (FIO) filed a Complaint[20] dated June 30, 2015 for Grave Misconduct and Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service against Sadain, Makalinggan, Aldanese, Mabang, and NCMF Cashier Olga S. Galido (collectively, public respondents).[21]

The OMB-FIO alleged in its complaint that: (1) the NCMF violated Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) Resolution No. 12-2007 dated June 29, 2007, in awarding the project to MLFI without conducting a public bidding or negotiated procurement; (2) the NCMF likewise violated Commission on Audit (COA) Circular No. 2007-001 dated October 25, 2007 because it did not properly undertake the process in selecting the NGO as it was Cong. Datumanong who personally chose MLFI; (3) the NCMF released the fund to MLFI even before the execution of the MOA; and (4) public respondents conspired with one another when they processed the DVs, executed the MOA, and released the check payments to MLFI.[22]

Mabang denied conspiring with her co-public respondents. She stressed that: (1) she did not have any contact with Cong. Datumanong or anybody from his office; (2) she was not the principal signatory to the DVs and only signed them after all the supporting documents were attached; and (3) she merely performed her duties, which are procedural, mechanical, and non-discretionary, in good faith.[23]","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] filed by Aurora O.

The CA affirmed the Decision[4] dated December 16, 2016, and Order[5] dated March 30, 2017, of the Office of the Ombudsman (OMB) in OMB-C-A-15-0277 finding Mabang, among others, guilty of Grave Misconduct and Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service and meting out on them the penalty of dismissal from the service, together with its accessory penalties.","The Court modifies the ruling of the CA.

The petition is not barred by res judicata.

While the June 15, 2022, Resolution of the Court in G.R. Nos. 257724 and 261349 is a minute resolution, it is considered a full disposition of the case and operates as res judicata with respect to the same issues and subject matter involving the same parties. However, it is not binding precedent as to the other parties who held different positions and discharged different functions.[47]

To recall, Sadain was the Secretary/Commissioner and Chief Executive Officer of the NCMF while Aldanese was the Acting Chief Accountant of the NCMF. In contrast, Mabang was the Acting Chief of the MAD. Evidently, they discharged different functions.

Verily, the Resolution dated June 15, 2022, of the First Division of the Court in G.R. Nos. 257724 and 261349 cannot prevent the Court from considering the merits of Mabang's petition.

Mabang is guilty of Simple Misconduct only.

When the CA affirms the factual findings of the OMB, the general rule is that the Court shall respect these findings and shall no longer disturb it. One of the recognized exceptions to this rule is when there is a misapprehension of facts.[48] This exception exists in the present case.

Misconduct is the ""transgression of some established and definite rule of action, more particularly, unlawful behavior or gross neglect of duty by a public officer."" To be considered grave, there must be corruption, willful intent to violate the law, or to disregard established rules.[49]

Here, the CA affirmed the finding of the OMB that Mabang is liable for Grave Misconduct and Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service because she signed the DVs which enabled the release of the funds to MLFI, an NGO that was chosen by Cong. Datumanong without a public bidding or negotiated procurement.

The Court agrees in part.","WHEREFORE, the Petition is PARTIALLY GRANTED.

Petitioner Aurora O. Aragon-Mabang is found GUILTY of Simple Misconduct and is SUSPENDED FROM OFFICE for six (6) months without pay reckoned from the time the Decision dated December 16, 2016, of the Office of the Ombudsman was implemented, with a warning that a repetition of the same or similar acts will be dealt with more severely.

The period within which petitioner Aurora O. Aragon-Mabang was dismissed from service pending appeal is creditable in the implementation of the penalty of six (6) months suspension herein imposed. All her rights, emoluments, benefits, and privileges removed by, and forfeited in, the assailed Decision of the Office of the Ombudsman are hereby RESTORED."
"G.R. Nos. 245330-31, April 01, 2024","COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE AND COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS, PETITIONERS, VS. PHILIPPINE AIRLINES, INC., RESPONDENT.
","On January 29, 2003, however, the BIR issued BIR Ruling No. 001-2003,[9] which revoked the earlier issuance. Relying on the Certification dated December 20, 2002 of the Department of Energy (DOE), stating that aviation gas, fuel, and oil for use in domestic operation of domestic airline companies are locally available in reasonable quantity, quality, and price, the BIR declared that PAL's importations would no longer be tax-exempt ""for as long as there is such available domestic supply of petroleum products.""[10]

Thereafter, on various dates between April to June of 2005, PAL imported Jet A-1 fuel and paid the corresponding specific taxes due thereon under protest.[11]

PAL then lodged a request for refund with the CIR for the specific taxes it paid in the total amount of PHP 258,629,496.00. When its request remained unacted, PAL filed a judicial claim for refund before the CTA on May 7, 2007, through a Petition for Review.[12]

Both the CIR and the COC filed their respective Answers[13] to the Petition and raised similar special and affirmative defenses, to wit: (1) PAL failed to exhaust all administrative remedies; (2) BIR Ruling No. 001-2003 is a valid interpretation of the provisions of the Tax Code; (3) PAL failed to appeal BIR Ruling No. 001-2003 to the Secretary of Finance in accordance with the Tax Code; (4) in essence, PAL asked the CTA to overturn the factual determinations of the DOE in pursuing its refund claim, which cannot be allowed under the doctrine of separation of powers; and (5) the specific taxes purportedly paid in May and June of 2005 were not properly documented.[14]

The case then proceeded to trial.[15] After the formal offer of evidence and submission of memoranda by the parties, the case was deemed submitted for decision. However, PAL filed a Motion to Reopen Trial and/or Leave of Court to File Supplemental Memorandum,[16] which was granted by the CTA Second Division in its January 20, 2015 Resolution.[17] Thereafter, the case was again submitted for resolution.

In its original Decision,[18] the CTA Second Division partially granted the Petition and ordered the CIR and the COC to refund or issue a tax credit certificate in favor of PAL in the reduced amount of PHP 88,542,854.00.[19] The CTA found that PAL was able to satisfy the conditions provided under Section 13 of Presidential Decree No. 1590, which would qualify its importations for tax exemption. Nevertheless, the CTA ratiocinated that it could not grant the full amount claimed by PAL given that certain official receipts evidencing payment of specific taxes were denied admission for PAL's failure to present the original receipts.[20]

Thereafter, the CIR and the COC filed their separate Motions for Partial Reconsideration,[21] whereas PAL filed a Motion for Partial Reconsideration of Decision and/or to Reopen the Case for Presentation of Evidence on May 13, 2016.[22] In its Resolution,[23] the CTA Second Division resolved to grant respondent's Motion, while denying CIR and COC's similar bids for reconsideration.

PAL then presented an additional witness and other documentary exhibits in the subsequent hearings conducted by the CTA.[24]

In the meantime, the CIR filed a Petition for Review[25] before the CTA En Banc, docketed as CTA EB No. 1488. The COC likewise filed its own Petition,[26] which was docketed as CTA EB No. 1494. The two cases were then consolidated given that they arose from the same assailed rulings of the CTA Second Division in CTA Case No. 7632.[27]

Eventually, the CTA Second Division issued its September 9, 2016 Amended Decision[28], which increased the amount originally ordered to be refunded to PAL from PHP 88,542,854.00 to PHP 258,629,494.00.

The CIR moved for reconsideration from the Amended Decision, but this was rejected by the CTA Second Division in its January 9, 2017 Resolution.[29] Consequently, the CIR filed a Supplement to the Petition for Review[30] before the CTA En Banc to inveigh against the Amended Decision.

The Petitions, including the Supplement filed by the CIR, were given due course and the parties were directed to submit their respective memoranda. Thereupon, the case was deemed submitted for decision.[31]

In the challenged Decision, the CTA En Banc denied the Petitions for lack of merit and affirmed the assailed rulings of the CTA Second Division, as modified by its Amended Decision.[32] The CTA En Banc declared that PAL was able to sufficiently prove the existence of the requisites laid down under Section 13 of Presidential Decree No. 1590 in order for its importations to qualify for tax exemption. With regard to the requisite that the imported articles or goods must be used in PAL's transport and non-transport operations, the CTA En Banc held that the Authority to Release Imported Goods (ATRIGs) submitted by PAL constituted sufficient proof thereof. ATRIGs were issued by the CIR and/or his duly authorized representatives, upon verification and processing of the importation documents submitted by taxpayers and may be regarded as entries in official records which constitute prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated. Thus, the contents in the subject ATRIGs — to the effect that the Jet A-1 aviation fuel ""will be used exclusively for domestic flight operation"" or ""will be used exclusively for daily domestic flight operation"" — must be given weight. The ATRIGs were also further supported by the testimony of the witnesses presented by PAL.[33] As to the other requisite that aviation fuel was not legally available in reasonable quantity, quality, or price during the time of importation, the CTA En Banc agreed with PAL that the Certification issued by the Air Transportation Office (ATO) to that effect was in line with its general powers under its charter. Likewise, the Certification also stood as prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. The CTA En Banc rejected the CIR and the COC's argument that only the DOE was in a position to determine the local availability of Jet A-1 aviation fuel.[34] The CTA En Banc also found no error on the part of the CTA Second Division when it granted PAL's motion to reopen the trial for presentation of additional evidence. It emphasized that the proceedings before the CTA were not strictly governed by the technical rules of evidence.[35]

Both the CIR and the COC moved for reconsideration, but their motions were denied in the disputed Resolution.[36]

Hence, the CIR and the COC, through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), instituted the present Petition,[37] arguing that the CTA En Banc erred in concluding that PAL was able to prove that the imported aviation fuel would be used for its transport and non-transport operations, and that it was not locally available in reasonable quantity, quality, or price.[38] They likewise maintained that in upholding the CTA Second Division's grant of PAL's motion to reopen the case for presentation of evidence, the CTA En Banc violated the well-settled rule that tax refunds are strictly construed against the taxpayer.[39]","This Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] oppugns the Decision[2] and the Resolution[3] of the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) En Banc in CTA EB Nos. 1488 and 1494, which affirmed respondent Philippine Airlines, Inc. (PAL)'s entitlement to refund of the specific taxes it paid for the importation of Jet A­-1 aviation fuel between April to June of 2015, and which denied both Motions for Reconsideration[4] filed by petitioners Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) and Commissioner of Customs (COC).
The facts of this case are uncomplicated.

Under its statutory franchise,[5] PAL is exempt from the payment of taxes and duties on ""all importations by the grantee of aircraft, engines, equipment, machinery, spare parts, accessories, commissary and catering supplies, aviation gas, fuel, and oil, whether refined or in crude form and other articles, supplies, or materials,""[6] as long as such articles, supplies, or materials are ""for the use of the grantee in its transport and non-transport operations and other activities incidental thereto and are not locally available in reasonable quantity, quality, or price.""[7] The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) confirmed PAL's exemption in its BIR Ruling No. 13-99.[8]","The Petition must fail.

At the core of this controversy is the proper interpretation and application of Section 13 (2) of Presidential Decree No. 1590, which reads:

SECTION 13. In consideration of the franchise and rights hereby granted, the grantee shall pay to the Philippine Government during the life of this franchise whichever of subsections (a) and (b) hereunder will result in a lower tax:

Accused-appellant argues that the inconsistencies in the statements given by the private complainant cast doubt on his guilt thereby warranting his acquittal. He posits that the private complainant was unsure as regards the date when accused-appellant started sexually exploiting her. This allegedly shows that the private complainant's account was not categorical or straightforward, thus eroding her credibility as a witness, as she could not have been mistaken of such a fateful tribulation allegedly involving the accused-appellant, had it ever truly happened.[62] Further, accused-appellant argues that private complainant's admission that she was already engaged in this kind of activity prior to their meeting on December 31, 2016 casts doubt as to his culpability. He emphasizes that it is highly unlikely that he or anybody for that matter, would still need to act as a procurer of private complainant when the latter, on her own, already knows well the loops of the trade.[63]

We are not convinced. It is a well-settled rule that ""if the testimonial inconsistencies do not hinge on any essential element of the crime, such inconsistencies are deemed insignificant and will not have any bearing on the essential fact or facts testified to. These inconsistencies, if at all, even indicate that the witness was not rehearsed.""[64]

Jurisprudence dictates the essential elements of violation of Section 5 (b) of Republic Act No. 7610 are as follows: (1) the accused commits the act of sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct; (2) the said act is performed with a child exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse; and (3) the child whether male or female, is below 18 years of age.[65]

All the elements are present in the case at bar.","FOR THESE REASONS, the appeal is DISMISSED. The assailed January 29, 2020 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 12128 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATIONS. Accused-appellant XXX is GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of:

Manigos (accused­appellant Manigos) (collectively, accused-appellants).","The Court grants the appeal.

The right to speedy disposition of cases is provided for in Section 16,[70] Article III, of the 1987 Constitution. In determining whether the right to speedy disposition of cases has been violated, the following guidelines in Cagang v. Sandiganbayan[71] must be considered:
First, the right to speedy disposition of cases is different from the right to speedy trial. While the rationale for both rights is the same, the right to speedy trial may only be invoked in criminal prosecutions against courts of law. The right to speedy disposition of cases, however, may be invoked before any tribunal, whether judicial or quasi-judicial. What is important is that the accused may already be prejudiced by the proceeding for the right to speedy disposition of cases to be invoked.

Second, a case is deemed initiated upon the filing of a formal complaint prior to a conduct of a preliminary investigation. This Court acknowledges, however, that the Ombudsman should set reasonable periods for preliminary investigation, with due regard to the complexities and nuances of each case. Delays beyond this period will be taken against the prosecution. The period taken for fact-­finding investigations prior to the filing of the formal complaint shall not be included in the determination of whether there has been inordinate delay.

Third, courts must first determine which party carries the burden of proof. If the right is invoked within the given time periods contained in current Supreme Court resolutions and circulars, and the time periods that will be promulgated by the Office of the Ombudsman, the defense has the burden of proving that the right was justifiably invoked. If the delay occurs beyond the given time period and the right is invoked, the prosecution has the burden of justifying the delay.

If the defense has the burden of proof, it must prove first, whether the case is motivated by malice or clearly only politically motivated and is attended by utter lack of evidence, and second, that the defense did not contribute to the delay.

Once the burden of proof shifts to the prosecution, the prosecution must prove first, that it followed the prescribed procedure in the conduct of preliminary investigation and in the prosecution of the case; second, that the complexity of the issues and the volume of evidence made the delay inevitable; and third, that no prejudice was suffered by the accused as a result of the delay.

Fourth, determination of the length of delay is never mechanical. Courts must consider the entire context of the case, from the amount of evidence to be weighed to the simplicity or complexity of the issues raised.

An exception to this rule is if there is an allegation that the prosecution of the case was solely motivated by malice, such as when the case is politically motivated or when there is continued prosecution despite utter lack of evidence. Malicious intent may be gauged from the behavior of the prosecution throughout the proceedings. If malicious prosecution is properly alleged and substantially proven, the case would automatically be dismissed without need of further analysis of the delay.

Another exception would be the waiver of the accused to the right to speedy disposition of cases or the right to speedy trial. If it can be proven that the accused acquiesced to the delay, the constitutional right can no longer be invoked.

In all cases of dismissals due to inordinate delay, the causes of the delays must be properly laid out and discussed by the relevant court.","WHEREFORE, the appeal is granted. The Decision dated February 22, 2022, and Resolution dated May 23, 2022, of the Sandiganbayan in Criminal Case Nos. SB-17-CRM-2397, SB-17-CRM- 2398, and SB-17-CRM-2400 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE:

(a) Dasmariñas-Abubot Rosario 115 kV Line;
(b) Rosario S/S Equipment;
(c) Tayabas 115 kV Switchyard; and
(d) Ternate S/S Equipment.[6]
A Joint Application[7] was filed by TRANSCO and Meralco with the ERC on April 17, 2012. They sought for the approval of the sale of the subject STAs in favor of Meralco under the terms of their Contract to Sell.[8]

Finding the Joint Application sufficient in form and substance, the ERC issued an Order and Notice of Public Hearing setting the case for initial hearing on July 4, 2012.[9]

Petitioner National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP) filed a Petition for Intervention (With Opposition)[10] on June 29, 2015 claiming that it was not informed about the sale contract between TRANSCO and Meralco. NGCP based its cause on its authority and responsibility to operate, manage, and maintain the nationwide transmission system of the Philippines under Republic Act No. 9136, otherwise known as the ""Electric Power Industry Reform Act of 2011"" (EPIRA) and its implementing rules. NGCP averred that in the operation of the subject STAs, it incurred considerable improvement and upgrade costs, which were not considered and included in the sale contract. Accordingly, Meralco, as buyer of the STAs, should pay NGCP the improvement and upgrade costs as additional value to the agreed cost with TRANSCO.[11]

The ERC granted NGCP's Petition for Intervention.[12] Hearings on the Joint Application were conducted.","This Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assails the Amended Decision[2] dated September 15, 2017 and Resolution[3] dated May 31, 2018 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R.

Preliminarily, the Court affirms the finding of the CA that it has jurisdiction to entertain the petition for review (Rule 43) filed by Meralco. The reckoning time to count the 15-day reglementary period to appeal should be from the receipt of the Third Order denying Meralco's Motion to Re-open Proceedings.

It should be emphasized that the ERC gave due course to Meralco's Motion to Re-open Proceedings and required TRANSCO, NGCP, and PEZA to file comment/opposition.[52] It did not deny outright said motion on the basis that it is a prohibited pleading. The ERC recognized the supervening matters raised in Meralco's motion and the respective comments/opposition of TRANSCO, NGCP, and PEZA. Even in its Opposition[53] to Meralco's Motion, NGCP did not raise any procedural infirmity but foremost refuted the substantial averments in said motion.

The CA was correct in holding that it was only upon the issuance of the Third Order that the ERC can be considered to have issued a judgment that finally disposed of the case, taking into consideration such supervening matters. The First and Second Orders of the ERC did not attain finality since the Motion to Re-open Proceedings is still a continuation of the proceedings in view of the supervening matters raised by Meralco.

At the outset, the Court takes judicial notice of DOJ Circular No. 18[28] dated May 10, 2022 which expressly revoked DOJ Circular No. 027 dated June 26, 2018. The recent circular aligned its provisions with the Court-issued Plea Bargaining Framework in Drugs Cases. Consequently, We deem the prosecution's objection to Raul's plea bargain in Criminal Case No. 2017-­24487 as effectively withdrawn.[29]

In People v. Montierro,[30] the Court laid down the following guidelines to be observed in plea bargaining in drugs cases:
1. Offers for plea bargaining must be initiated in writing by way of a formal written motion filed by the accused in court.

2. The lesser offense which the accused proposes to plead guilty to must necessarily be included in the offense charged.

3. Upon receipt of the proposal for plea bargaining that is compliant with the provisions of the Plea Bargaining Framework in Drugs Cases, the judge shall order that a drug dependency assessment be administered. If the accused admits drug use, or denies it but is found positive after a drug dependency test, then he/she shall undergo treatment and rehabilitation for a period of not less than six (6) months. Said period shall be credited to his/her penalty and the period of his/her after-care and follow-up program if the penalty is still unserved. If the accused is found negative for drug use/dependency, then he/she will be released on time served, otherwise, he/she will serve his/her sentence in jail minus the counselling period at [a] rehabilitation center.

4. As a rule, plea bargaining requires the mutual agreement of the parties and remains subject to the approval of the court. Regardless of the mutual agreement of the parties, the acceptance of the offer to plead guilty to a lesser offense is not demandable by the accused as a matter of right but is a matter addressed entirely to the sound discretion of the court.
Though the prosecution and the defense may agree to enter into a plea bargain, it does not follow that the courts will automatically approve the proposal. Judges must still exercise sound discretion in granting or denying plea bargaining, taking into account the relevant circumstances, including the character of the accused.
5. The court shall not allow plea bargaining if the objection to the plea bargaining is valid and supported by evidence to the effect that:
the offender is a recidivist, habitual offender, known in the community as a drug addict and a troublemaker, has undergone rehabilitation but had a relapse, or has been charged many times; or

when the evidence of guilt is strong.
6. Plea bargaining in drugs cases shall not be allowed when the proposed plea bargain does not conform to the Court-issued Plea Bargaining Framework in Drugs Cases.

7. Judges may overrule the objection of the prosecution if it is based solely on the ground that the accused's plea bargaining proposal is inconsistent with the acceptable plea bargain under any internal rules or guidelines of the DOJ, though in accordance with the plea bargaining framework issued by the Court, if any.

8. If the prosecution objects to the accused's plea bargaining proposal due to the circumstances enumerated in item no. 5, the trial court is mandated to hear the prosecution's objection and rule on the merits thereof. If the trial court finds the objection meritorious, it shall order the continuation of the criminal proceedings.

9. If an accused applies for probation in offenses punishable under [Republic Act No.] 9165, other than for illegal drug trafficking or pushing under Section 5 in relation to Section 24 thereof, then the law on probation shall apply.[31]
Here, the State ascribes grave abuse of discretion on the part of the RTC when it approved Raul's plea bargain despite the objection of the prosecution on the ground that DOJ Circular No. 027 prohibits plea bargaining for illegal sale of dangerous drugs under Section 5 to the lesser offense of illegal possession of drug paraphernalia under Section 12 of Republic Act No. 9165.","ACCORDINGLY, the petition is GRANTED. The Decision and the Resolution dated December 10, 2020 and July 21, 2021, respectively, of the Court of Appeals in CA G.R. SP No. 12222 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

Criminal Case No. 2017-24487 and Criminal Case No. 2017-24488 against Raul Domen y Aurellano are REMANDED to the court of origin to determine: (1) whether the evidence of guilt is strong; and (2) whether Raul Domen y Aurellano is a recidivist, habitual offender, known in the community as a drug addict and a troublemaker, has undergone rehabilitation but had a relapse, or has been charged many times.

In case the trial court finds Raul Domen y Aurellano qualified to avail of the benefits of plea bargaining, a drug dependency assessment shall be conducted pursuant to A.M. No. 18-03-16-SC."
"G.R. No. 234681, May 29, 2024","JUANITO ANRO SALVADOR, KEN RUSSEL SALVADOR AND MICHAEL SALVADOR, PETITIONERS, VS. MARIA MINDA A. SALVADOR, FOR HERSELF AND IN REPRESENTATION OF THE MINORS ALEXIS SALVADOR, JEFFREY SALVADOR, ANTHONY SALVADOR, AND HYACINTH SALVADOR YEE, RESPONDENTS.","Maria Minda A. Salvador (Maria) sought to claim co-ownership over properties inherited by her brother-in-law, Juanito Anro Salvador (Juanito) from the latter's parents Anatolio Salvador (Anatolio) and Rosario Canoy Salvador (Rosario). Maria insisted that her late husband, Franklin Salvador (Franklin), was also the son of Anatolio and Rosario. There is no dispute that Rosario is Franklin's mother, but Juanito asserted that Franklin's father is Celedonio Salvador (Celedonio), Rosario's second husband, after Anatolio.

It is also agreed that Franklin was born after Anatolio died, though his exact birth date is disputed. The parties diverge on the date of Anatolio's death, Juanito claimed that his father died in 1942, whereas Maria asserted that he died on April 4, 1944. Maria alleged that Franklin was born on September 30, 1944, after Anatolio's death, but before Rosario's second marriage. Juanito contended that even before Anatolio's death, Rosario was already cohabiting with Celedonio, and that Franklin was the result of the cohabitation.[5]

In 1976, Juanito migrated to the United States of America. On February 16, 1977, his mother Rosario signed a Sworn Statement of the True Current and Fair Market Value of Real Properties which constituted Juanito's inheritance from Anatolio. Rosario designated herself merely as the administrator on behalf of the owner, Juanito.[6]

In 1993, Franklin registered his own birth, supplying his information and signing as the ""Informant"" in the Certificate of Live Birth. Rosario was still alive at this time but did not sign or certify that she attended the birth of Franklin. Rosario died on October 24, 1995. Franklin died on May 31, 2000, leaving behind children from different women, his surviving wife, Maria and their children, Alexis, Jeffrey, and Anthony, all surnamed Salvador.[7]

In 2001, Juanito returned to Cebu and discovered that Franklin had disposed of some of the properties Juanito inherited from Anatolio. Some properties appeared to have been sold after Franklin had already died. Also in 2001, Maria filed two Complaints for Estafa against Juanito, which were dismissed by the Office of the Provincial Prosecutor. Maria filed a Petition for Review with the Department of Justice, which denied the petition.[8]

In 2005, Maria and her children Alexis, Jeffrey, and Anthony, as well as Franklin's daughter with another woman, Hyacinth, all surnamed Salvador (collectively, Maria, et al.), instituted a Complaint for Declaration of Nullity of Documents, Reconveyance of Property, Partition, Recovery of Possession, Quieting of Title, Damages with Prayer for Preliminary Injunction against Juanito, as well as Ken Russel Salvador and Michael Salvador, who are Franklin's sons from his first wife, (collectively, Juanito, et al.).[9] The case was docketed as Civil Case No. AV-1320 before the RTC, Branch 26, Argao, Cebu.[10]

In their Complaint[11] before the RTC, Maria, et al. alleged that Anatolio and Rosario acquired several pieces of real property, which should have been passed on to Juanito and Franklin after their parents' deaths. Maria, et al. claimed that the properties should have been transferred to them after Franklin's death, as his heirs. They presented 30 Tax Declarations pertaining to these properties. Maria, et al. assert that Juanito caused the partition, subdivision and adjudication of some of these properties, including the shares belonging to Maria, et al. as heirs of Franklin.[12]

Maria, et al. claimed that they made several attempts to ""enter the property [sic] or take possession thereof, or gather the fruits""[13] as well as oral demands against Juanito but they were prevented from the ""beneficial use, enjoyment and participation of the said property [sic][.]""[14] The Complaint did not specify which property or properties they were referring to, however, they alleged that Juanito continued to enjoy the fruits of the properties including the ""ancestral house.""[15]

In his Answer,[16] Juanito asserted that the properties claimed by Maria, et al. are the exclusive properties of Anatolio, who is not Franklin's father. He claimed that he and Franklin were raised as full-blood brothers, but he had heard from others that this was not true.[17]

In their Formal Offer of Exhibits,[18] Maria, et al. repeatedly stated that Franklin is entitled to a ""one-half share"" of these properties since he is the full-blood brother of Juanito.[19] As to the two properties registered in Franklin's name, Maria, et al. stated that Juanito was also claiming those as his own properties since these were inherited from Anatolio.[20] Juanito admitted the existence and genuineness of all the Tax Declarations, but opposed the claim that Franklin was entitled to any share.[21] As to the Tax Declarations in Franklin's name, Juanito stated that these were ""[proof] of usurpation of [Juanito's] lawful rights by [Maria, et al.]""[22] In the RTC Decision, the trial court stated that Maria sought to divide the properties placed in Juanito's name since Franklin is also a son of Anatolio.[23] It appears from the foregoing that the subject properties are part of the estate of Anatolio, which ought to be divided among his legal heirs. The parties merely disagree as to whether Franklin is an heir entitled to a share therein.","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari,[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the Decision,[2] dated March 30, 2017, and the Resolution,[3] dated August 25, 2017, of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CEB CV No. 05292. The CA upheld the Regional Trial Court (RTC) Decision,[4] dated November 11, 2013, finding that Franklin Salvador (Franklin) is the legitimate child of Anatolio Salvador (Anatolio).","Juanito claims to be the only son of Anatolio and Rosario. Juanito et al. claimed before the RTC that Anatolio died in 1942, two years before Franklin was allegedly born in 1944. Maria et al., however, presented several witnesses and documentary evidence to prove that Anatolio died in 1944. Conversely, Juanito testified that he did not seek proof of his father's date of death and relied only on the word of others.[35] Both the RTC and the CA agreed that Maria, et al. had sufficiently proven that Anatolio died in 1944.

It is well established that the Court is not a trier of facts. The Court's function in petitions for review on certiorari under Rule 45 is limited to reviewing errors of law that may have been committed by the lower courts or tribunals. It is not this Court's function to analyze or weigh evidence that have already been considered in the lower courts, especially in this case where the RTC and CA agree as to the sufficiency of the evidence presented.[36] At this stage of the proceedings, it must be beyond debate that Anatolio died on April 4, 1944.

Juanito, et al. mainly question the RTC's appreciation of Franklin's Birth Certificate, which was belatedly registered in 1993. Juanito, et al. assert that the RTC erred in admitting Franklin's Birth Certificate because the same was acquired through delayed registration and applied for by Franklin alone, without any other person attesting to his date of birth.

In the case of Baldos v. Court of Appeals, the Court explained the probative value of a delayed registration of birth:
Applications for delayed registration of birth go through a rigorous process. The books making up the civil register are considered public documents and are prima facie evidence of the truth of the facts stated there. As a public document, a registered certificate of live birth enjoys the presumption of validity. It is not for Reynaldo to prove the facts stated in his certificate of live birth, but for petitioners who are assailing the certificate to prove its alleged falsity. Petitioners miserably failed to do so. Thus, the trial court and the Court of Appeals correctly denied for lack of merit the petition to cancel the late registration of Reynaldo's birth.[37] (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)
Notably, Juanito, et al. did not object to the authenticity and due execution of Franklin's Birth Certificate before the RTC. They merely asserted that the same is ""self-serving,"" from the simple fact that Franklin caused such registration. Neither did they present any evidence to corroborate their allegations that Franklin did not comply with the process for delayed registration. Furthermore, this argument is being raised for the first time on appeal.","FOR THESE REASONS, the Petition is DENIED. The Decision, dated March 30, 2017, and the Resolution, dated August 25, 2017, of the Court of Appeals in C.A.-G.R. CEB CV No. 05292 are AFFIRMED with the modification that the case be REMANDED to the Regional Trial Court, Branch 26, Argao, Cebu which is DIRECTED to issue an order requiring the parties to implead the other indispensable parties, if any, for the determination of their respective rights and to proceed with partition and reconveyance."

MAESTRADO, JR., REPRESENTED BY HIS MOTHER, NENITA MAESTRADO, TONY L. MONTANTE, ALVIN D. PAL, VENJIE PLASQUITA, FRANKIE L. SABIO, AND MARIJUL O. UNDAP, PETITIONERS, VS. SAN ROQUE METALS, INC., RESPONDENT.","This case originated from several complaints for illegal dismissal[6] filed by 35 employees against Prudential Customs Brokerage Services, Inc. (PCBSI) and SRMI. Subsequently, in a Decision[7] dated April 30, 2012, the ELA ruled that PCBSI and SRMI illegally dismissed the employees, and accordingly, ordered them to pay backwages and separation pay in lieu of reinstatement. PCBSI and SRMI appealed[8] before the NLRC, which, in a Resolution[9] dated December 28, 2012, reversed the ELA and held that the employees were employed by PCBSI only and not SRMI, who only contracted PCBSI's services. The NLRC also ordered PCBSI to reinstate the employees without backwages and without loss of seniority rights. The employees moved to reconsider, which the NLRC denied in a Resolution[10] dated April 11, 2013. Consequently, they filed a Petition for Certiorari with the CA.[11]

In a Decision[12] dated July 27, 2015, the CA found grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC and reinstated the ELA's Decision. Both PCBSI and SRMI moved to reconsider the CA's Decision, which the CA denied in its September 16, 2015 and October 9, 2015 Resolutions.[13] Thus, both PCBSI and SRMI lodged separate Petitions for Review on Certiorari[14] with the Court, which were both denied in a Resolution dated March 2, 2016.[15] The Court also denied with finality the PCBSI and SRMI's motions to reconsider through its August 3, 2016 Resolution[16] and ordered that an entry of judgment[17] be issued. As stated earlier, the affirmed ELA Decision held that: (a) the employees were illegally dismissed; (b) the SRMI and PCBSI share solidary liability; and (c) the employees were entitled to backwages and separation pay.

After the finality of the judgment, 12 of the original 35 employees entered into separate compromise agreements[18] with PCBSI and SRMI, namely: Leo A. Abad, Romeo Abella, Mamie Agapay, Feleciano S. Bahan, Ruel R. Bahan,[19] Angelita Cabañas, Jovilito G. Maestrado, Jr.[20] (represented by his mother, Nenita Maestrado), Tony L. Montante, Alvin D. Pal, Venjie Plasquita, Frankie L. Sabio, and Marijul O. Undap (collectively, petitioners).

In these similarly worded compromise agreements, each of the petitioners agreed to receive a settlement amount and employment with SRMI as the ""full, complete, and final satisfaction of [their] labor complaint against SRMI and PCBSI."" By signing the compromise agreement each of the petitioners also manifested ""that having received in full all [their] claims subject matter of [their labor complaint] against SRMI and PCBSI and any other claims arising from [them], [they have] no further claims, rights, or actions of whatsoever nature, whether past, present or contingent against PCBSI and their stockholders, directors, officers, authorized representatives, or [successors-in-interest].""[21]

Subsequently, all parties attended the pre-execution conference before the ELA. There, petitioners signed the compromise agreements before the ELA, who wrote a note on the final page of each of the compromise agreements stating: ""without prejudice to the outcome of the pre-execution conference/proceedings,"" the employees submitted to the ELA their motion to admit the computation of the monetary awards due them.[22] PCBSI and SRMI then filed their comment[23] to the motion, arguing that: (a) the computation must be set aside and a new one made since petitioners are no longer entitled to monetary awards because they executed compromise agreements; and, (b) SRMI should not be made solidarity liable to pay backwages and separation pay following jurisprudence, which states that if the liability is ""with punitive character, such as... backwages and separation pay because of an illegal dismissal of the contractor's employee, the liability should be solely that of the contractor in the absence of proof that the principal conspired with the contractor in the commission of illegal dismissal.""[24]","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assailing the Decision[2] and the Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA), which partially granted the Resolutions[4] of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC). The NLRC ruling denied the Petition for extraordinary remedies filed by respondent San Roque Metals, Inc. (SRMI), which sought to annul the Order[5] of the Executive Labor Arbiter (ELA).","The Petition has merit.

When the Court reviews a decision of the CA in a Petition for Certiorari assailing a ruling of the NLRC, its scope of review is limited to the correctness of the CA's finding of grave abuse of discretion.[37] In labor cases, the NLRC gravely abuses its discretion when ""its findings and conclusions are not supported by substantial evidence, which refers to that amount of relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion,"" or when its ruling finds no basis in the evidence and applicable statutes and case law.[38]

As will be explained below, the CA erred in ascribing grave abuse of discretion in the NLRC ruling, considering that the latter is supported by substantial evidence and applicable case law.

To recall, the NLRC's invalidation of the compromise agreements is grounded on the following: (1) that the consideration of the compromise agreements is unconscionably low; and (2) that the ELA's notation created an ambiguity in the contracts, which made it doubtful that petitioners signed them with full understanding of their terms and conditions.

The NLRC held that the compromise agreements must be closely scrutinized because they are also quitclaims, which the law looks upon with disfavor. This is correct. As a rule, quitclaims executed by employees are frowned upon for being contrary to public policy,[39] and ""are largely ineffective to bar recovery of the full measure of a worker's rights, and the acceptance of benefits therefrom does not amount to estoppel.""[40]

Thus, to determine whether a quitclaim is valid, the Court has held that the following must be present: (1) the employee executes a deed of quitclaim voluntarily; (2) there is no fraud or deceit on the part of any of the parties; (3) the consideration of the quitclaim is credible and reasonable; and (4) the contract is not contrary to law, public order, public policy, morals or good customs, or prejudicial to a third person with a right recognized by law.[41] Absent these elements, a quitclaim may be invalidated. Consequently, an invalidated quitclaim does not have the effect of res judicata between the parties.

The NLRC is correct that the considerations for these compromise agreements, even when coupled with petitioners' continued employment by SRMI, are not reasonable. As tabulated[42] by the NLRC, the amounts stated in the compromise agreements represent a small portion—ranging from 5.20% to 23.42%—of what petitioners stand to receive under the final judgment:","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated April 30, 2019 and Resolution dated December 22, 2020 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 08742-MIN are REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

Contrary to Art. III, Section 5(b) of R.A. 7610 (The Anti-Child Abuse Act).""[3]
On arraignment, Joven pleaded not guilty to the offenses charged. Thereafter, trial on the merits ensued.[4]

The prosecution presented AAA and her mother, BBB. The presentation of the following witnesses was dispensed with:
Dr. Gwendolyn Luna (Dr. Luna) of the xxxxxxxxxxx in Dagupan City, as the defense admitted her findings and the contents of the Medico-Legal Report; and
Police Officer 1 Jonabel Celso of the Philippine National Police - xxxxxxxxxxx, Pangasinan, as the defense also admitted that the Police Certification attached to the records was a faithful reproduction of the police blotter entries.[5]
Before BBB's testimony, the defense admitted the following:
AAA was a minor being only 17 years old;
AAA's mental state as observed in her house;
AAA was impregnated but the identity of the father remains unknown since there were three alleged assailants; and
AAA gave birth to a child.[6]","When a person has sexual intercourse with a child through force, threat, or intimidation, the crime of rape is committed. A child does not have the capacity to give consent to a sexual act.

The case presents an opportunity for the Court to clearly demonstrate the application of Republic Act No. 7610 or the Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act vis-à-vis Article 266 of the Revised Penal Code, involving a child who is 12 years old or below 18.

This Court resolves an appeal from the June 3, 2021 Decision[1] of the Court of Appeals affirming with modification the Regional Trial Court's conviction[2] of Paul Joven y Senenche (Joven) of two counts of violation of Section 5(6) of Republic Act No. 7610. The Court of Appeals modified the Regional Trial Court's conviction of Joven by convicting him instead of two counts of rape under Article 266-A, paragraph 1, in relation to Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code, as amended.

In three separate Informations, Joven was charged with three counts of other sexual abuse punished under Article III, Section 5(b) of Republic Act No. 7610. The accusatory portions of the Informations read:","The Court deems it appropriate to discuss the proper designation of the crime committed by accused-appellant given the variation in the findings of the Regional Trial Court and the Court of Appeals. As correctly found and explained by the Court of Appeals, accused-appellant should be convicted of two counts of rape under Article 266-A, paragraph 1, in relation to Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, instead of other sexual abuse punished under Section 5(b) of Republic Act No. 7610.

It is worth noting that on March 4, 2022, Republic Act No. 11648[41] was enacted, amending the Revised Penal Code, the Anti-Rape Law, and Republic Act No. 7610. The law increased the age of sexual consent from 12 years old to 16 years old. This is a welcome development as it provides stronger protection for children from rape and sexual exploitation and abuse. However, Republic Act No. 11648 is not applicable in this case, given that the crime was committed within the period of January to March 2016 prior to the law's enactment. Moreover, the case involves a victim whose age is not covered by the amendment.

Based on the Informations, the charge against accused-appellant was ""other sexual abuse,""[42] as defined in Article III, Section 5 (b) of Republic Act No. 7610 as ""[t]hose who commit the act of sexual intercourse ... with a child exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse.""[43] The allegations in the Informations stated that accused-appellant ""willfully and unlawfully indulge [AAA], a seventeen (17) year old minor child ... into sexual intercourse with him due to coercion and undue influence on his part, to the prejudice and damage of the said minor child.""[44] Although the Informations stated that the acts were ""[c]ontrary to Art. III, Section 5(b) of R.A. 7610 (The Anti-Child Abuse Act),""[45] it is the factual allegations in the Informations that determine the crime being charged.[46]

As the charges against accused-appellant were for other sexual abuse, we now examine whether the elements of other sexual abuse exist in this case. Section 5(b) of Republic Act No. 7610 reads:
SECTION 5. Child Prostitution and Other Sexual Abuse. — Children, whether male or female, who for money, profit, or any other consideration or due to the coercion or influence of any adult, syndicate or group, indulge in sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct, are deemed to be children exploited in prostitution and other sexual abuse.

The penalty of reclusion temporal in its medium period to reclusion perpetua shall be imposed upon the following:

....

(b) Those who commit the act of sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct with a child exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse; Provided, That when the victim is under twelve (12) years of age, the perpetrators shall be prosecuted under Article 335, paragraph 3, for rape and Article 336 of Act No. 3815, as amended, the Revised Penal Code for rape or lascivious conduct, as the case may be: Provided, That the penalty for lascivious conduct when the victim is under twelve (12) years of age shall be reclusion temporal in its medium period[.] (Emphasis supplied)
For a successful prosecution of other sexual abuse, the prosecution must establish the following elements: ""(1) the accused commits the act of sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct;""[47] (2) ""the said act is performed with a child exploited in prostitution""[48] or subjected to other sexual abuse;[49] and (3) ""the child, whether male or female, is below 18 years of age.""[50] As correctly held by the Court of Appeals, accused-appellant cannot be held liable for other sexual abuse as the second element of the crime is not present in this case.[51]","ACCORDINGLY, the appeal is DENIED. The June 3, 2021 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 43909 is hereby AFFIRMED WITH MODIFICATION. Accused-appellant Paul Joven y Senenche is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of two counts of rape under Article 266-A, paragraph 1, in relation to Article 266-B, of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, and is sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua in each count. Furthermore, accused-appellant shall pay AAA PHP 75,000.00 as civil indemnity, PHP 75,000.00 as moral damages, and PHP 75,000.00 as exemplary damages for each count of rape.

That the crime was committed with the aggravating circumstance the accused MARK ANTHONY ROMERO [y] FLORES is a recidivist, having been previously convicted by final judgment of the crime of Slight Illegal Detention under paragraph 3 of Article 268, which is embraced in the same title of the Revised Penal Code.
When arraigned on August 2, 2019, Romero entered a plea of not guilty. During the preliminary conference on September 16, 2019, the parties stipulated on the following:
(i)
the identity of Romero as the one charged and arrested in this case;


(ii)
he and his unknown companion owned the tricycle which was pointed to and recognized by private complainant AAA to be the same one she boarded on the night of July 24, 2019;


(iii)
Romero had pictures at the gallery of the xxxxxx Municipal Police Station from his previous cases, one of which involved illegal detention with attempted rape;


(iv)
on July 24, 2019 and immediately prior and subsequent to said date, Romero did not leave Catanduanes;


(v)
Romero resided in xxxxxxxxxxx, near the xxxxxxxxxxx River;


(vi)

(vii)
 on said date, Romero was already released from detention from the xxxxxxxxxxx District Jail.[5]","This Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] assails the Decision[2] dated November 2, 2022 and Resolution[3] dated April 18, 2023 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 15062 titled People of the Philippines v. Mark Anthony Romero y Flores, finding petitioner Mark Anthony Romero y Flores (Romero) guilty of forcible abduction, and denying his Motion for Partial Reconsideration, respectively.","We affirm the conviction with modification.

Settled is the rule that unlike in civil cases, an appeal in a criminal case opens the entire case for review on any question, including one not raised by the parties.[29] Thus, though Romero only assails his conviction for forcible abduction, nothing hinders the Court from determining the proper offense committed in this case.

To recall, Romero was charged with kidnapping with rape, a special complex crime defined and penalized under Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659,[30] viz.:
Article 267. Kidnapping and serious illegal detention. – Any private individual who shall kidnap or detain another, or in any other manner deprived him of his liberty, shall suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua to death:
If the kidnapping or detention shall have lasted more than five days.
If it shall have been committed simulating public authority.
If any serious physical injuries shall have been inflicted upon the person kidnapped or detained; or if threats to kill him shall have been made.
If the person kidnapped or detained shall be a minor, female or a public officer.
The penalty shall be death where the kidnapping or detention was committed for the purpose of extorting ransom from the victim or any other person, even if none of the circumstances above-mentioned were present in the commission of the offense.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DENIED.

"A.M. No. 24-02-09-SC, May 28, 2024",RE: DRAFT DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE-NATIONAL PROSECUTION SERVICE'S [DOJNPS] RULES ON PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATIONS AND INQUEST PROCEEDINGS,"In a Letter dated October 27, 2023 addressed to Undersecretary Raul T. Vasquez (Usec. Vasquez), Chief Justice Alexander G. Gesmundo (the Chief Justice) transmitted the comments of the members of the banc to the DOJ for its consideration.

Through a Letter[2] dated January 22, 2024, Usec. Vasquez highlighted the matters adopted by the DOJ from the Court's comments in its final version of the DOJ-NPS Rules, attaching a complete copy of the same.

The Chief Justice wrote a letter[3] dated February 7, 2024 addressed to the banc, urging its members to recognize the authority of the DOJ to promulgate its DOJ-NPS Rules consistent with jurisprudence that the conduct of preliminary investigation [and inquest proceedings] is not a judicial function but part of the prosecution's job, a function of the executive.[4] The Chief Justice further stated that this would entail the repeal of the affected provisions under Rule 112 of the current Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure.
 
A brief history of the rules on preliminary investigation


Under the Rules of Court promulgated in 1940 (1940 Rules of Court), preliminary investigation is defined as a previous inquiry or examination made before the arrest of the defendant by the judge or officer authorized to conduct the same, with whom a complaint or information has been filed imputing the commission of an offense cognizable by the Court of First Instance, for the purpose of determining whether there is a reasonable ground to believe that an offense has been committed and the defendant is probably guilty thereof, so as to issue a warrant of arrest and to hold him for trial.[5] The 1964 version of the Rules of Court (1964 Rules of Court) essentially maintained such a definition but used the term ""preliminary examination"" instead of preliminary investigation.[6] In People v. Montilla,[7] the Court ruled that ""our statutory rules and jurisprudence required prima facie evidence, which was of a higher degree or quantum, and was even used with dubiety as equivalent to 'probable cause.'"" It noted, however, that such problems and confusing concepts were clarified by the 1985 amendment of the Rules of Court.

The 1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure reve1ied to the term preliminary investigation, which it defined as an inquiry or proceeding for the purpose of determining whether there is sufficient ground to engender a well-founded belief that a crime cognizable by the Regional Trial Court has been committed and that the respondent is probably guilty thereof, and should be held for trial.[8] This definition was maintained in the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure promulgated in 2000 (2000 Rules).[9] As noted in Montilla, the quantum of evidence required in preliminary investigation is such evidence as suffices to ""engender a well-founded belief' as to the fact of the commission of a crime and the respondent's probable guilt thereof. ","The Court's Sub-Committee on the Revision of the Rules of Criminal Procedure (Sub-Committee),[1] received from one of its members from the Department of Justice (DOJ), a copy of the draft DOJ Circular on the proposed Rules on Preliminary Investigation and Inquest Proceeding in the National Prosecution Service (DOJ-NPS Rules). Coincidentally, the Court's rules on Preliminary Investigation (Rule 112) are among those to be revised under the Proposed Rules on Criminal Procedure. Thus, to ensure harmony between the DOJ's conduct of preliminary investigations or inquest proceedings and our existing court procedures, the Sub-Committee solicited comments from the members of the banc.","Per the 1940 Rules of Court, every justice of the peace, municipal judge or city fiscal shall have jurisdiction to conduct preliminary investigation of all offenses alleged to have been committed within his municipality or city, cognizable by the Court of First Instance.[22] The same is true under the 1964 Rules of Court, with the addition of the authorized officer's provincial jurisdiction.[23] In the 2000 Rules, preliminary investigation is required to be conducted for offenses where the penalty prescribed by law is at least four years, two months, and one day without regard to the fine.[24] This was retained under the amended rules in 2005.[25]
 
Authority of the DOJ to promulgate its own rules and its repercussions on Rule 112 of the 2000 Rules
 

As illustrated above, preliminary investigation, as a vehicle to determine whether a person should be indicted, used to be a function shared by judges and prosecutors. The paradigm, however, shifted to one of exclusivity in favor of public prosecutors. As early as 1986 in Salta v. Court of Appeals,[26] the Court has held that the conduct of preliminary investigation is an executive, not a judicial function. Thus:
A preliminary investigation is intended to protect the accused from the inconvenience, expense, and burden of defending himself in a formal trial until the reasonable probability of his guilt has first been ascertained in a fairly summary proceeding by a competent officer. It is also intended to protect the State from having to conduct useless and expensive trials. Section 1, Rule 112 of the present Rules of Court states that it is conducted for the purpose of determining whether there is sufficient ground to engender a well-founded belief that a crime cognizable by the court has been committed and that the respondent is probably guilty thereof and should be held for trial. The preliminary investigation pm per is, therefore, not a judicial function. It is a part of the prosecution's job, a function of the executive.[27] (Emphasis supplied; citation omitted.)
This pronouncement was reiterated m the 1997 case of People v. Navarro,[28] where the Court has held:
It must be stressed that preliminary investigation is an executive, not a judicial, function. As the officer authorized to direct and control the prosecution of all criminal actions, a prosecutor is primarily responsible for ascertaining whether there is sufficient ground to engender a well-founded belief that an offense has been committed and that the accused is probably guilty thereof.[29]
By reason of this shift in the nature of preliminary investigation, the Court has adopted a policy of non-interference in the public prosecutor's conduct thereof.","FOR THESE REASONS, the Court hereby RECOGNIZES the AUTHORITY of the Department of Justice to promulgate its 2024 DOJ­ National Prosecution Service Rules on Preliminary Investigations and Inquest Proceedings (2024 DOJ-NPS Rules).

Thereafter, and once the 2024 DOJ-NPS Rules are promulgated by the DOJ, the pertinent provisions of Rule 112 of the 2000 Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure, as amended, inconsistent therewith are deemed REPEALED. This shall be without prejudice to the Court's promulgation of its own rules of procedure, of a new rule touching upon preliminary investigation, consistent with the 2024 DOJ- NPS Rules.

Let a copy of the 2024 DOJ-NPS Rules be endorsed to the Sub­ Committee on the Revision of the Rules of Criminal Procedure for its guidance and appropriate action."
"G.R. No. 258510, May 28, 2024","JESS CHRISTOPHER S. BIONG, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON AUDIT, ET AL., RESPONDENTS.","Sometime in August 2010, the Comptrollership/Accounting Unit of PhilHealth Region III found that there were no inspection and acceptance reports (IARs) on the deliveries. Hence, the payments due to Silicon Valley were withheld by PhilHealth Region III.[8]

Thereafter, Rodolfo M. Balog (Balog), Vice President of PhilHealth Region III, consulted Trinidad Gozun (Gozun), State Auditor IV and Audit Team Leader of PhilHealth Region III, who suggested that in lieu of IARs, alternative documents may be attached to the disbursement voucher (DV).

Accordingly, PhilHealth Region III attached the following documents: (1) Certification from the General Services Unit (GSU) issued by petitioner Biong, as the Head of the GSU, that the supplies were delivered; (2) Supplies Withdrawal Slips (SWSs) which contained the items requisitioned by the end-users; and (3) Monthly Report of Supplies and Materials Inventory (MRSMI) prepared by the GSU to support the journal entry voucher of the Comptrollership/Accounting Unit.[9]

After evaluation of the documents, PhilHealth Region III processed and released the Philippine Veterans Bank Check Nos. 5227 (PHP 117,207.95) and 5226 (PHP 373,094.20), both dated December 22, 2010, and Check- Nos. 5274 (PHP 398,934.59) and 5273 (PHP 216,962.78), both dated December 30, 2010, to Silicon Valley.[10]

A month after, or on January 31, 2011, petitioner Biong discovered incidents of theft of office supplies and falsification of SWSs in the GSU office.[11]

In an Incident Report[12] dated February 22, 2011, petitioner Biong revealed that inks and toners delivered by Masangkay Computer Center on January 20, 2011, and January 24, 2011, respectively, and inks delivered by PC Worx on January 28, 2011, were declared missing on January 31, 2011. In the same report, petitioner Biong recommended that an official and more thorough investigation be conducted by the PhilHealth Legal Office on the alleged loss of office supplies and expressed the willingness of GSU personnel to cooperate with the investigation.[13]

According to petitioner Biong, he was informed by Susan David (David) and Mary Joy Cruz (Cruz), the personnel in charge of inventories and issuances, that some of the inks and toners which were delivered by PC Worx on January 28, 2011, and were stored inside the GSU Office were missing.[14] Consequently, they held a meeting on February 19, 2011, at the Managements Services Division (MSD) Office to clarify the sequence of events that transpired. Thereafter, they requested David, Cruz, and Jenalyn Deang to submit their respective statements relative to their personal knowledge of the alleged theft of office supplies.[15]

In her statement, Cruz accused Jajomar Marbebe (Marbebe), who at that time was a project-based employee, of routinely bringing inks out of the office.[16] When confronted, however, Marbebe denied Cruz's allegations. He explained that he had other sources of income which allowed him to obtain loans to purchase houses and a motorcycle and put up a sari-sari store.[17] Thereafter, his contract was no longer renewed on March 17, 2011.[18]

On March 18, 2011, petitioner Biong wrote a letter to signify his intention to file a request for a relief of accountability in connection with the missing office supplies and a Request for Relief from Accountability from Loss of Property[19] with the COA Audit Team.[20] However, it does not appear from the records whether an audit decision had been issued on petitioner Biong's request for relief of accountability.

Thereafter, the COA Audit Team issued the subject NDs to officers of PhilHealth Region III, including Biong, on the purchases of printer inks and toners of PhilHealth Region III from Silicon Valley.

The subject matter of ND No. 11-002-000(10) dated July 5, 2011, was PO No. 09-236 dated December 4, 2009.[21] On the other hand, ND No. 11-003-000(20) dated August 15, 2011, pertained to (i) PO No. 043 dated April 25, 2008, (ii) PO No. 160 dated November 4, 2008, and (iii) PO No. 09-005 dated February 4, 2009.[22]","This resolves the Petition for Certiorari[1] under Rule 64 in relation to Rule 65 of the Rules of Court filed by Jess Christopher S. Biong (petitioner Biong) assailing Decision No. 2019-040[2] of the Commission on Audit (COA). In the assailed Decision, the COA approved with modification the Notice of Disallowance (ND) No. 11-002-000-(10)[3] dated July 5, 2011, ND No. 11-003-000(10)[4] dated August 15, 2011, and COA RO3 Decision No. 2012-46.[5]

The disallowed amounts pertain to payments made by the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) Region III to Silicon Valley, with office at SM Pampanga, San Jose, City of San Fernando, Pampanga,[6] for office supplies, particularly printer inks and toners, purchased under Purchase Order (PO) No. 09-236 dated December 4, 2009, PO No. 043 dated April 25, 2008, PO No. 160 dated November 4, 2008, and PO No. 09-005 dated February 4, 2009.[7]","The petition is meritorious.

At the outset, it is worth noting that the COA did not dispute Biong's contention that he was not served a copy of Decision No. 2019-040 dated March 21, 2019,[74] before the COA issued the Notice of Finality of Decision No. 2021-252.

Evidently, there was an invalid service of the COA's Decision to petitioner Biong. As a result, petitioner Biong was deprived of his right to due process: he was not given the opportunity to file a motion for reconsideration because, by the time he secured a copy of the assailed Decision, the COA had already issued the Notice of Finality of Decision No. 2021-252.[75]

On this score alone, the Notice of Finality of Decision No. 2021-252 should be set aside. The failure of the COA to serve a copy of its decision to petitioner Biong is in clear violation of Section 7 of the 2009 Revised Rules of Procedure of the Commission on Audit which states:
SECTION 7. Service of Copies of ND/NC/NS, Order or Decision. — The ND, NC, NS, order, or decision shall be served to each of the persons liable/responsible by the Auditor, through personal service, or if not practicable through registered mail ... (Italics supplied.)
The COA's failure to abide by their own rules of procedure is tantamount to grave abuse of discretion.

On the merits of the case, the Court likewise finds for petitioner Biong.

As a rule, the COA's findings of fact are generally accorded great respect, if not finality, by the Court as long as they are supported by substantial evidence because of their presumed expertise over matters falling under their jurisdiction.[76] Nonetheless, the Court will not hesitate to exercise its expanded power of judicial review under the second paragraph[77] of Section 1, Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution upon a showing that the COA's decision is tainted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.[78]

In De Castro v. Commission on Audit,[79] the Court held that ""the power of COA to disallow expenditures proceeds from its duty to prevent irregular, unnecessary, excessive, or extravagant expenditures or uses of government funds or property, and those which are illegal and unconscionable.""[80] Thus, in the absence of any finding that an expenditure falls under any of these anomalous types on disbursements, a disallowance is unwarranted.[81]

Here, the disallowance was based on the COA' s finding that the payments made to Silicon Valley were irregular expenditures.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Certiorari is GRANTED. The assailed Commission on Audit Decision No. 2019-040 dated March 21, 2019, and Notice of Finality of Decision No. 2021-252 dated November 17, 2021, are SET ASIDE."
"G.R. No. 264196, May 28, 2024","ROBINSONS APPLIANCES CORPORATION (ROBINSONS FORUM), PETITIONER, VS. HON. SECRETARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY, HON. UNDERSECRETARY ROWEL S. BARBA AND DTI-FAIR TRADE ENFORCEMENT BUREAU-ENFORCEMENT DIVISION RESPONDENTS.","Robinsons Appliances Corporation is a domestic corporation that owns and operates Robinsons Appliances, Robinsons Forum branch located in Mandaluyong City, the store subject of this case.[8]

On January 29, 2016, pursuant to Bureau Order Nos. 16-09, 16-10, 16-11 and 16-12, Series of 2016, the DTI-FTEB conducted an inspection and investigation on the business premises of Robinsons Appliances. The purpose of the investigation was to determine the store's compliance with the Mandatory Philippine National Standard (PNS) pursuant to Republic Act No. 4109, or An Act to Convert the Division of Standards Under the Bureau of Commerce into a Bureau of Standards, to Provide for the Standardization and/or Inspection of Products and Imports of the Philippines and for Other Purposes.[9]

In the course of its inspection, the DTI-FTEB discovered 15 sets of flat iron bearing the Hanabishi brand for sale at Robinsons Appliances with the Philippine Standard (PS) Mark but without the required PS License Number.[10] As a result, a Formal Charge with Prayer for the Issuance of a Preventive Measure Order[11] was filed against Robinsons Appliances before the DTI-­FTEB Adjudication Division for violation of Sections 3.5,[12] 5.1,[13] 6.1.1[14] and 6.2.1[15] of DAO No. 2-2007, in relation to Section 4, DAO No. 4, Series of 2008 (DAO No. 4-2008) and its Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR), in relation to PNS 254-1:1994 Amd. 01:2000, pursuant to Republic Act No. 4109.[16]

In its Answer,[17] Robinsons Appliances countered that the products subject of the formal charge were merely supplied to it under a consignment agreement with Fortune Buddies Corporation (Fortune Buddies), which is the manufacturer and/or principal distributor of the 15 Hanabishi flat irons. It averred that Fortune Buddies is solely responsible for ensuring that its products comply with the PNS on the required markings. Robinsons Appliances also questioned the authority of the DTI-FTEB in conducting the inspection and investigation.[18]

After due proceedings, the DTI-FTEB Adjudication Division rendered a Decision[19] with the following dispositive portion:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, this Office rules in favor of the Complainant. Judgment is hereby rendered ordering respondent to pay the total amount of Twenty[-]Five Thousand Pesos ([PHP] 25,000.00) as fine for violation of Sections 6.1.1 and 6.2.1 of Department Administrative Order No. 2 Series of 2007 at the Cashier's Office, Ground Floor UPRC Building, 315 Senator Gil Puyat Avenue, Makati City upon finality of this Decision and the subject products are deemed FORFEITED in favor of the government for safekeeping until its eventual disposal.

The decision of this Office shall serve as a warning for a more severe penalty to be imposed should a similar violation is committed by the same respondent.","This Court resolves the Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] filed by Robinsons Appliances Corporation, Robinsons Forum Branch (Robinsons Appliances), seeking the reversal of the Decision[2] and Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA). The CA dismissed the Petition for Certiorari[4] filed by Robinsons Appliances that assailed the Decision[5] of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), Office of the Secretary (DTI Secretary), which affirmed the Decision[6] of the DTI Fair Trade and Enforcement Bureau (DTI-­FTEB). The DTI-FTEB found Robinsons Appliances liable for violating Sections 6.1.1 and 6.2.1 of Department Administrative Order No. 2, Series of 2007 (DAO No.2-2007). Accordingly, the DTI-FTEB imposed a fine of PHP 25,000.00 against Robinsons Appliances and ordered the forfeiture of 15 sets of Hanabishi flat iron being sold by Robinsons Appliances in favor of the government.[7]","The Petition should be denied for lack of merit.
 
The CA properly dismissed the Petition for Certiorari for being the wrong remedy and for its belated filing
 

It is settled that the special civil action for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court is intended to correct errors of jurisdiction or grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.[41] Section 1 mandates that a Rule 65 petition may only be resorted to when there is no appeal, or any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. While Our ruling in Carpio-Morales v. Court of Appeals[42] recognized exceptions to the general rule that a petition for certiorari would not prosper if there existed a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy, none of the enumerated exceptions[43] are present in this case.

Here, Robinsons Appliances could have filed a petition for review under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court to appeal the judgment of the DTI. Section 1 of Rule 43 provides the remedy of an appeal from the judgment or order of a quasi-judicial agency in the exercise of its quasi-judicial functions, such as the DTI. Due to the availability of the remedy of an appeal via Rule 43, this Court agrees with the CA that the filing of a Petition for Certiorari to assail the DTI Secretary's Decision was the wrong remedy.

Robinsons Appliances argues that the ruling of the DTI Secretary is appealable via a petition for certiorari before the proper court, citing Article 166 of Republic Act No. 7394. According to Robinsons Appliances, Article 166, which provides that the decision of the DTI Secretary becomes final 15 days from receipt unless a petition for certiorari is filed with the proper court, does not distinguish between administrative cases initiated by a consumer and those initiated by the DTI or its offices motu proprio. Thus, as the instant case was initiated by the DTI-FTEB, it still falls within the ambit of Article 166, contrary to the CA's ruling.[44]

The argument fails to impress.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED. The Decision dated February 15, 2021 and the Resolution dated October 19, 2022 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 157330 are AFFIRMED. Robinsons Appliances Corporation, Robinsons Forum Branch is liable to PAY PHP 25,000.00 as fine for its violation of Sections 5.1, 6.1.1, and 6.2.1 of Department Administrative Order No. 2, series of 2007, and Section 4 of Department Administrative Order No. 4, series of 2008, in relation to Section 4 of its Implementing Rules and Regulations. The 15 sets of Hanabishi flat irons are deemed FORFEITED in favor of the government for safekeeping until its eventual disposal."
"A.C. No. 13628, May 28, 2024 ","HELEN A. PAEZ, PETITIONER, VS. ATTY. ALFONSO D. DEBUQUE, RESPONDENT.","The records evince that the parties executed three deeds of sale with varying terms and conditions. The ""Deed of Absolute Sale with Assignment of Mortgage""[5] (first deed of sale) stated that the total consideration for the subject realty was PHP 500,000.00, where PHP 300,000.00 was to be paid to the Rural Bank to cover Paez's mortgage loan and the remaining PHP 200,000.00 was to be paid to her.[6]

The ""Deed of Absolute Sale""[7] (second deed of sale) stated that the purchase price was PHP 300,000.00, which was to be paid solely to Paez. Moreover, she was to pay the capital gains tax, documentary stamp tax, transfer tax, and the current real property tax.[8]

Paez later executed the ""Deed of Absolute Sale""[9] (third deed of sale), with only her signature affixed. The terms stipulated in this document were the same as in the second deed of sale anent the PHP 300,000.00 purchase price, as well as the payment of taxes to be shouldered by her.[10]

Hereupon, the narratives of the parties diverged.

Paez asserted that under the first deed of sale where the consideration for the realty was PHP 500,000.00, the amount of PHP 300,000.00 was to be paid to the Rural Bank, while the remaining PHP 200,000.00 was to be paid to her. This consideration was later reduced to PHP 300,000.00 and made payable solely to her.[11]

Since Paez was then detained at the Pasay City Jail, she appointed her sister, Raylene Paez-Rezano (Rezano) as her attorney-in-fact for her dealings regarding the sale of the subject realty.[12] Atty. Debuque agreed to pay the remaining balance but failed to do so.[13] He requested Paez to prepare a deed of sale, purportedly so that he could send the full payment.[14] Thereupon, Paez caused the preparation of the third deed of sale, which she signed and sent to Atty. Debuque.[15] Still and all, he failed to pay the full purchase price and Paez never received any payment from him throughout the duration of her incarceration.

Upon her release from detention, Paez discovered the existence of the first deed of sale from the Rural Bank, which was supposedly signed by her and Atty. Debuque. Pursuant to such document, she no longer had any interest in the subject realty. This impelled Paez to confront Atty. Debuque, but he denied the existence of the first deed of sale. Instead, he showed her the second deed of sale between Paez and Rezano. Atty. Debuque, however, refused to pay the remaining balance, claiming that he no longer owed Paez any amount.[16]

On the other hand, Atty. Debuque insisted that he already paid the remaining balance by way of installment, which he handed to Rezano.[17]

The records disclose that Atty. Debuque filed two Answers on two different dates, i.e., November 29, 2012[18] and May 22, 2013.[19]

In his Answer dated November 29, 2012, Atty. Debuque claimed having paid the total price of PHP 250,000.00.[20] He also admitted that he advised Rezano to prepare another deed of absolute sale, which was intended to avoid penalties on the unpaid taxes. He also agreed to pay for its notarization.[21] On the other hand, in his Answer dated May 22, 2013, he averred that he ""had already paid completely in [installment] basis until the year 2009 the total consideration of. . . [PHP] 300,000.00.""[22]

Later on, Atty. Debuque avowed in his Reply and Comment to Position Paper of the Complainant[23] dated November 29, 2013 that he had no knowledge of the execution of the third deed of sale, which reflected the consideration worth PHP 300,000.00. He maintained that Paez executed the third deed of sale to evade the taxes and other fees which she undertook to pay.[24]

Yet again, in his Position Paper,[25] Atty. Debuque stated that the remaining balance was PHP 200,000.00, out of which, PHP 171,430.00 was already paid in installments. The only remaining balance was PHP 28,870.00.[26]

During the two mandatory conferences, only Paez appeared.[27]","Before this Court is a Verified Complaint[1] filed by petitioner Helen A. Paez (Paez) against respondent Atty. Alfonso D. Debuque (Atty. Debuque) for violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR)[2] and the Lawyer's Oath.
At the vortex of the instant controversy is an 800-square-meter lot covered under Transfer Certificate Title No. T-210051 in Barangay Pagduque, Dumangas, Iloilo (subject realty).[3] The disputatious subject realty was mortgaged to the Rural Bank of Dumangas (Rural Bank) for Paez's loan worth PHP 300,000.00 and in danger of being foreclosed. Since Paez was then incarcerated, she decided to sell the property to Atty. Debuque. Part of their agreement was that he would first pay her loan with the Rural Bank.[4]","After a judicious study of the case, the Court finds that the actuations of Atty. Debuque constitute a violation of the CPRA.

On April 11, 2023, the Court En Banc approved the CPRA.[35] As an institutional imperative, the CPRA is meant to foster an environment where ethical conduct performs a dedicated role in the administration of justice. In particular, the standards embodied in the CPRA uniquely address the characteristics of the Filipino lawyer as an amalgamation of influences and moorings, i.e., familial, cultural, religious, academic, political, and philosophical. Inherently a social being, the Filipino lawyer inevitably develops and cultivates relations, preferences, and biases. The conscious adoption of ethical standards that accounts for such relationships and personal choices balanced against the demands of right and justice is envisioned to govern and regulate these personal choices and make them consistent with the institutional objectives.[36]

The canons of the CPRA are rules that lawyers must adhere to, including the manner in which a lawyer must conduct themselves.

Under its General Provisions, the CPRA shall be applied to all pending and future cases, except to the extent that in the opinion of the Court, its retroactive application would not be feasible or would work injustice, in which case the procedure under which the cases were filed shall govern.[37]

In the case at bench, the Court finds and so rules that the CPRA applies.

Atty. Debuque was found liable for violation of Canon I, Rule 1.01 of the CPR. This provision is reiterated in the CPRA under Canon II, Section 1, which states:

SECTION 1. Proper conduct. — A lawyer shall not engage in unlawful, dishonest, immoral, or deceitful conduct[.]

Be that as it may, the Court still finds Atty. Debuque to have flouted the following provisions of Canon II, Sections 2, 5 and 11 of the CPRA, viz.:

SECTION 2. Dignified conduct. — A lawyer shall respect the law, the courts, tribunals, and other government agencies, their officials, employees, and processes, and act with courtesy, civility, fairness, and candor towards fellow members of the bar.

. . . .

SECTION 5. Observance of fairness and obedience. — A lawyer shall, in every personal and professional engagement, insist on the observance of the principles of fairness and obedience to the law.

. . . .

SECTION 11. False representations or statements; duty to correct. — A lawyer shall not make false representations or statements. A lawyer shall be liable for any material damage caused by such false representations or statements.","ACCORDINGLY, respondent Atty. Alfonso D. Debuque is declared GUILTY of violation of Canon II, Section 1 of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability. He is SUSPENDED from the practice of law for three years effective immediately from receipt of this Decision with a STERN WARNING that a repetition of any of the offenses involved in this case or a commission of similar acts will merit a more severe penalty. Atty. Alfonso D. Debuque is also DIRECTED to INFORM this Court of the date of his receipt of this Decision to determine the reckoning point of the effectivity of his suspension.

Let copies of this Decision be furnished to the Office of the Bar Confidant, to be appended to the personal record of respondent Atty. Alfonso D. Debuque as an attorney; the Integrated Bar of the Philippines, for their information and guidance; and the Office of the Court Administrator, for dissemination to all the courts in the country."
"G.R. No. 223845, May 28, 2024","JOSELLER M. GUIAO, PETITIONER, VS. PHILIPPINE AMUSEMENT AND GAMING CORPORATION, PHILIPPINE CHARITY SWEEPSTAKES OFFICE, AND THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT, RESPONDENTS.","On April 26, 2016, Guiao, then a member of the House of Representatives and Vice Chairperson of the House Committee on Youth and Sports Development, filed a Petition for Mandamus before this Court against the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation, Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office, and Office of the President, alleging that they failed in their duty to comply with the funding requirements in Section 26 of Republic Act No. 6847, otherwise known as the Philippine Sports Commission Act.[3] The pertinent portion of Section 26 as cited by Guiao provides:

SECTION 26. Funding. — . . . .

To finance the country's integrated sports development program, including the holding of the national games and all other sports competitions at all levels throughout the country as well as the country's participation at international sports competitions, such as, but not limited to, the Olympic, Asian, and Southeast Asian Games, and all other international competitions, sanctioned by the International Olympic Committee and the International Federations, thirty percent (30%) representing the charity fund of the proceeds of six (6) sweepstakes of lottery draws per annum, taxes on horse races during special holidays, five percent (5%) of the gross income of the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation, the proceeds from the sale of stamps as hereinafter provided, and three percent (3%) of all taxes collected on imported athletic equipment shall be automatically remitted directly to the Commission and are hereby constituted as the National Sports Development Fund. Further, the Philippine Postal Service Office is hereby authorized to print paper and gold stamps which shall depict sports events and such other motif as the Philippine Postal Service Office may decide, at the expense of the Commission. Any deficiency in the financial requirements of the Commission for its sports development program shall be covered by an annual appropriation passed by Congress.[4] (Emphasis supplied)

Guiao claimed that the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation committed grave abuse of discretion when it failed to remit 5% of its gross income to the Philippine Sports Commission for the National Sports Development Fund, as mandated in Section 26 of Republic Act No. 6847.[5]

In support of his allegations, Guiao attached a Memorandum[6] dated November 5, 1993 addressed to then President Fidel V. Ramos, issued by his Executive Secretary, which sought the President's approval of the percentage allocations made by the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation as to its income, as follows:

 	Prior	Proposed
BIR Franchise Tax	5.0%	5.0%
NG Share	45.12%	47.5%
NPC Subsidy	-	4.75%
PSC Share	4.75%	4.51%
PAGCOR	45.13%	38.24%
Total	100%	100%
Guiao alleged that such recommendation by the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation was approved by the President in a Memorandum dated November 10, 1993.[7] Thereafter, in another Memorandum dated February 20, 1995, the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation again recommended to the President the following allocation of its earnings:[8]","For the extraordinary writ of mandamus to issue, there must be a showing of a clear legal right demandable by petitioner and a correlative legal duty to perform an act on the part of respondent.
Before this Court is a Petition for Mandamus[1] under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court filed by Joseller M. Guiao (Guiao), seeking to compel the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation, Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office, and Office of the President to remit funds to the Philippine Sports Commission, as provided under Section 26 of Republic Act No. 6847.[2]","Based on the foregoing, we rule that petitioner has legal standing to file this Petition in his capacity as legislator.

In any case, this Court has, on occasion, relaxed the rules on standing when the issues involved are of transcendental importance, or those that are so important so as to be imbued with paramount public interest.[67] Leeway is given to petitions filed by parties who have no personal or substantial interest in the challenged governmental act but nonetheless raise ""constitutional issue[s] of critical significance.""[68] This was demonstrated in Kilusang Mayo Uno Labor Center v. Hon. Garcia, Jr.,[69] in this wise:

Assuming arguendo that petitioner is not possessed of the standing to sue, this court is ready to brush aside this barren procedural infirmity and recognize the legal standing of the petitioner in view of the transcendental importance of the issues raised. And this act of liberality is not without judicial precedent. As early as the Emergency Powers Cases, this Court had exercised its discretion and waived the requirement of proper party.[70]

This was likewise demonstrated in Agan, Jr. v. Philippine International Air Terminals Co., Inc.,[71] thus:

Standing is a peculiar concept in constitutional law because in some cases, suits are not brought by parties who have been personally injured by the operation of a law or any other government act but by concerned citizens, taxpayers or voters who actually sue in the public interest. Although we are not unmindful of the cases of Imus Electric Co. v. Municipality of Imus and Gonzales v. Raquiza wherein this Court held that appropriation must be made only on amounts immediately demandable, public interest demands that we take a more liberal view in determining whether the petitioners suing as legislators, taxpayers and citizens have locus standi to file the instant petition. In Kilosbayan, Inc. v. Guingona, this Court held ""[i]n line with the liberal policy of this Court on locus standi, ordinary taxpayers, members of Congress, and even association of planters, and non-profit civic organizations were allowed to initiate and prosecute actions before this Court to question the constitutionality or validity of laws, acts, decisions, rulings, or orders of various government agencies or instrumentalities."" Further, ""insofar as taxpayers' suits are concerned . . . (this Court) is not devoid of discretion as to whether or not it should be entertained."" As such"". . . even if, strictly speaking, they [the petitioners] are not covered by the definition, it is still within the wide discretion of the Court to waive the requirement and so remove the impediment to its addressing and resolving the serious constitutional questions raised."" In view of the serious legal questions involved and their impact on public interest, we resolve to grant standing to the petitioners.[72] (Citations omitted)

Verily, this Court has time and again relaxed the rules of procedure to advance substantial justice.[73] The allegations of manifest contravention of the legal funding of the Philippine Sports Commission, the premier government agency responsible for the development and advancement of the nation's sports program, is a constitutionally significant issue that deserves this Court's attention.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Mandamus is GRANTED. The Memoranda dated November 5, 1993 and February 20, 1995 of the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation is hereby deemed VOID for being in contravention of Section 26 of Republic Act No. 6847. The Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation is ORDERED to account and remit the full amount of 5% of its gross income per annum from 1993 to present in favor of the Philippine Sports Commission.

Moreover, respondent Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office is ORDERED to account and remit to the Philippine Sports Commission the 30% representing the charity fund of the proceeds of six sweepstakes or lottery draw per annum, including its lotto draws, for the years 2006 to present."
"A.M. No. P-23-105 (Formerly OCA IPI No. 18-4848-P), May 28, 2024","ATTY. BONIFACIO A. ALENTAJAN, COMPLAINANT, VS. REYNER S. DE JESUS, SHERIFF IV, BRANCH 109, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, PASAY CITY, RESPONDENT.","Atty. Alentajan alleged that following the ruling in Roxas v. Republic Real Estate Corporation,[2] and the consequent remand of Civil Case No. 2229-P to the RTC for execution proceedings, he filed on January 24, 2017 an Amended Motion for Issuance of Alias Writ of Execution, which the RTC granted. In the Alias Writ of Execution[3] dated September 15, 2017 (subject writ), the RTC directed De Jesus as follows:

NOW THEREFORE, you are hereby commanded to cause the implementation of the decision of this Court as modified by the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court upon the plaintiff thru the Commission on Audit pursuant to COA Circular No. 2001-002.

In case sufficient personal properties of the plaintiff cannot be found to satisfy the amount of the said judgment, costs, interest[,] and your fees thereon, then you are hereby directed to levy the real property/ies of the said plaintiff and to sell the same or so much thereof in the manner provided for by law for the satisfaction of the said judgment and make a return of this writ with your proceedings indorsed thereon within sixty (60) days from receipt hereof.[4]

Atty. Alentajan then intimated that sometime in May 2018, De Jesus collected from him the amount of PHP 35,000.00 purportedly for the publication and posting of the notice of auction sale. However, as of the date of the Letter-Complaint, De Jesus has yet to cause the execution of the subject writ; and worse, he could no longer be located.[5]

In his Comment,[6] De Jesus denied the accusations against him. He maintained that sometime in May 2018, he was just informed by a staff of the RTC that Atty. Alentajan left an envelope for him containing cash in the amount of PHP 32,000.00 (and not PHP 35,000.00 as alleged by Atty. Alentajan), purportedly for the payment of the publication of the auction sale. De Jesus claimed that sometime in the first week of June 2018, he chanced upon Atty. Alentajan within the court premises and told him that: (a) he (De Jesus) has yet to receive a copy of the subject writ, and that once he does, the same will still be served to the Commission on Audit (COA); and (b) Atty. Alentajan should just get back the envelope pending the foregoing. However, Atty. Alentajan got mad at him and threatened him. Further, he pointed out that the adverse party is questioning Atty. Alentajan's personality to appear in Civil Case No. 2229-P, and hence, this issue must be resolved first before he could act on the subject writ. In light of these, he claimed that the complaint against him is premature and bereft of merit.[7]","This administrative matter arose from a Letter-Complaint[1] dated June 25, 2018 and received by the Court on July 20, 2018 filed by complainant Atty. Bonifacio A. Alentajan (Atty. Alentajan), praying, inter alia, that respondent Reyner S. De Jesus (De Jesus), Sheriff IV of Branch 109, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Pasay City be dismissed from the service.","The Court adopts with modifications the findings and recommendations of the JIB, as will be explained hereunder.

Gross Neglect of Duty.

Gross Neglect of Duty is considered as a serious charge under Section 14(d) of Rule 140, as further amended. In Son v. Leyva,[20] the Court explained that ""[g]ross neglect of duty or gross negligence 'refers to negligence characterized by the want of even slight care, or by acting or omitting to act in a situation where there is a duty to act, not inadvertently but willfully and intentionally, with a conscious indifference to the consequences, insofar as other persons may be affected. It is the omission of that care that even inattentive and thoughtless men never fail to give to their own property.' It denotes a flagrant and culpable refusal or unwillingness of a person to perform a duty. In cases involving public officials, gross negligence occurs when a breach of duty is flagrant and palpable.""[21]

As applied to sheriffs, such as respondent in this case, it must be stressed they ""play an important role in the administration of justice. They are tasked to execute final judgments of the courts. If not enforced, such decisions become empty victories of the prevailing parties. As agents of the law, sheriffs are called upon to discharge their duties with due care and utmost diligence because in serving the court's writs and processes and implementing its orders, they cannot afford to err without affecting the integrity of their office and the efficient administration of justice.""[22] Further, they ""ought to know that they have a sworn responsibility to serve writs of execution with utmost dispatch. When writs are placed in their hands, it is their ministerial duty to proceed with reasonable celerity and promptness to execute them in accordance with their mandate. Unless restrained by a court order, they should see to it that the execution of judgments is not unduly delayed. Accordingly, they must comply with their mandated ministerial duty as speedily as possible. As agents of the law, high standards are expected of sheriffs.""[23]","ACCORDINGLY, the Court finds respondent Reyner S. De Jesus, Sheriff IV, Branch 109, Regional Trial Court, Pasay City, GUILTY of gross neglect of duty; violation of Supreme Court rules, directives and circulars that establish an internal policy, rule of procedure, or protocol; and simple misconduct. He is meted with the following penalties:

(a)
For gross neglect of duty, respondent is meted with the penalty of FINE of PHP 210,000.00;
 	 
(b)
For violation of Supreme Court rules, directives and circulars that establish an internal policy, rule of procedure, or protocol, respondent is meted with a FINE of PHP 110,000.00; and

For simple misconduct, respondent is meted with a FINE of PHP 110,000.00."
"G.R. No. 267946, May 27, 2024","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. NELL JACKEL TUAZON Y PANLAQUI, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","Under Information dated September 2, 2016, Nell was charged with trafficking of persons committed against 16-year-old AAA viz.:
That on or about the 19th day of August 2016, in the City of xxxxxxxxxxx, Philippines, a place within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, did then and there willfully, unlawfully[,] and feloniously engage the services of [AAA], a sixteen (16) year old minor, a trafficked person for prostitution through sex peddler for and in consideration of P[HP] 4,500.00 to the damage and prejudice of said [AAA].

Contrary to law.[5]
The case was raffled to xxxxxxxxxxx, Regional Trial Court, xxxxxxxxxxx. On arraignment, Nell pleaded not guilty.[6]

AAA and Police Officer 1 Joseneal Leaño (PO1 Joseneal) of xxxxxxxxxxx Police Station testified for the prosecution.

AAA testified that she was born on February 25, 2000, as evidenced by her birth certificate and she was 16 years old at the time of the incident.[7] On August 18, 2016, she and her friends went to a birthday celebration of one Jamaica Martin in xxxxxxxxxxx City. After the party or around 12 a.m. of August 19, 2016, she and her friends went to xxxxxxxxxxx, xxxxxxxxxxx to eat porridge.[8] Then she received text message from a certain ""Mamu Respito"" (Mamu) whom she met in 2016 during a volleyball game. Mamu asked her to see her on Acacia Lane to meet with their friends from the volleyball league.[9] AAA agreed and told Mamu to wait for her because she would have to change her clothes first.[10]

When she arrived at Acacia Lane, she saw Mamu standing in front of a green car. Mamu then instructed her to get inside the car; both of them boarded and took the rear seat. Minutes later, Mamu disembarked and a woman named ""Lian"" went inside the car and sat beside her.[11] Thereafter, two men came in. One of them was Nell who took the driver's seat, while the other man took the passenger's seat. Nell locked the doors and drove to xxxxxxxxxxx Hotel xxxxxxxxxxx on xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx City.[12] AAA was nervous, but she kept silent. On their way, she immediately texted Mamu to ask where the car was headed. Mamu replied that she would have to xxxxxxxxxxx wait for their friends in xxxxxxxxxxx.[13]

Around 2:45 a.m. of August 19, 2016, they arrived at xxxxxxxxxxx. Nell talked with a male service crew and handed him money.[14] Thereafter, AAA, Lian, Nell, and the other man went inside xxxxxxxxxxx and proceeded to Room 12A.[15] There was no one in the room, contrary to Mamu's promise that their volleyball friends were there. AAA thus suspected that she was already sold by Mamu to Nell for sexual pleasure. Nell himself also disclosed that he paid Mamu PHP 5,000.00.[16] Moments later, Lian and the other man stepped out of the room, leaving her alone with Nell. She immediately went inside the comfort room as she was worried what Nell might do. As soon as she went out the comfort room, she saw Nell naked in the bed.[17] Nell then stood, laid her on the bed, kissed her on the neck and breasts, inserted his finger, and then his penis into her vagina. AAA was crying the whole time and resisted, but to no avail.[18] Fortunately, a service crew rang the doorbell, so she took the opportunity to get away from him. She went to the comfort room again and locked the door.[19] She texted one Jommel Mulacruz (Jommel) and asked the latter to get her out of the hotel room.[20] When she came out from the comfort room, Nell continued kissing and molesting her.[21] Thereafter, the doorbell rang again; this time, it was the hotel manager who informed Nell that several police officers were waiting outside xxxxxxxxxxx.[22] The manager told her to leave the room, while a service crew showed her the way out. She went outside xxxxxxxxxxx and was comforted by Jommel and several police officers. One police officer stayed with her while the others went to Room 12A where Nell was.[23] When the police officers came out with Nell, she pointed him out to the police officers and identified him as the man who abused her inside the hotel room.[24]

Meanwhile, PO1 Joseneal testified that on August 19, 2016, he was assigned as beat patroller in the area around xxxxxxxxxxx.[25] By 2:45 a.m., a person later identified as Jommel approached and told him that AAA was brought to xxxxxxxxxxx by a certain man. PO1 Joseneal, together with PO1 Rowel Concha (PO1 Rowel), and PO1 Peter Belingon, Jr. (PO1 Peter), went to xxxxxxxxxxx and told the crew that they received a report involving a minor who was brought to xxxxxxxxxxx.[26] PO1 Joseneal, accompanied by a crew, proceeded to Room 12A and he saw Nell. On their way out, they saw AAA who was crying. Thereafter, PO1 Joseneal asked AAA who was with her in Room 12A; She pointed Nell. Thereafter, PO1 Joseneal then brought AAA, Nel, and Jommel to the Women and Children Protection Desk of xxxxxxxxxxx City Police Station.[27] Together with PO1 Rowel, and PO1 Peter, they executed their joint affidavit.[28]

The parties stipulated on the proposed testimonies of PO1 Rowel and PO1 Peter that they were among the arresting officers who apprehended Nell on August 19, 2016; testimony of Police Officer 2 Stacy Mae Clores that she assisted in taking the respective statements of AAA, PO1 Joseneal, PO1 Rowel, and PO1 Peter;[29] and of Dr. Ian Paolo Virtucio that he examined AAA and per his Medico-Legal Report No. R-004-16E dated August 19, 2016, AAA had deep healed lacerations at 3, 5, 8, & 9 o'clock positions.[30]","This Appeal seeks to reverse the following disposition of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

2) Resolution[4] dated November 22, 2022, denying accused-appellant, Nell's motion for reconsideration.","Nell is guilty of qualified trafficking.

Republic Act No. 9208, Section 3(a), as amended by Republic Act No. 10364, defines ""Trafficking in Persons"" as:
. . . recruitment, obtaining, hiring, providing, offering, transportation, transfer, maintaining, harboring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders by means of threat, or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the person, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person for the purpose of exploitation which includes at a minimum, the exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs.

The recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, adoption or receipt of a child for the purpose of exploitation or when the adoption is induced by any form of consideration for exploitative purposes shall also be considered as 'trafficking in persons' even if it does not involve any of the means set forth in the preceding paragraph.[54]
Section 4(a), of Republic Act No. 9208, as amended, further enumerates the acts that fall under the term ""trafficking"" in persons, thus:
(a)
To recruit, obtain, hire, provide, offer, transport, transfer maintain, harbor, or receive a person by any means, including those done under the pretext of domestic or overseas employment or training or apprenticeship, for the purpose of prostitution, pornography, or sexual exploitation.[55]
Brozoto v. People[56] ordained that ""[t]he gravamen of the crime of trafficking is 'the act of recruiting or using, with or without consent, a fellow human being for [inter alia,] sexual exploitation."" Brozoto further elucidated:
Human beings are not chattels whose sexual favors are bought or sold by greedy pimps. Those who profit in this way by recruiting minors are rightfully, by law, labeled as criminals. They should be the subject of aggressive law enforcement, prosecuted, tried, and when proof beyond reasonable doubt exists, punished.[57] (Emphasis supplied)
Further, People v. Casio[58] enumerated the elements of trafficking under the expanded definition of Republic Act No. 10364, the amendatory law, thus:
(1)
The act of ""recruitment, obtaining, hiring, providing, offering, transportation, transfer, maintaining, harboring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national border["";]


(2)
The means used include ""by means of threat, or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the person, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person""[;] [and]


(3)
The purpose of trafficking includes ""the exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs[.][59]
Meanwhile, Section 6(a) of Republic Act No. 9208, as amended, states that the crime is deemed qualified when the victim is a ""child."" A ""child"" is ""a person below 18 years of age or one who is over 18 but is unable to fully take care of or protect himself/herself from abuse, neglect, cruelty, exploitation or discrimination because of a physical or mental disability or condition.""[60]

The offense was committed on August 19, 2016. Thus, the provisions of Republic Act No. 10364, which was approved on February 6, 2013, and amended Republic Act No. 9208, are applicable.","ACCORDINGLY, the Appeal is DENIED.

ENRIQUEZ, REPRESENTED BY ARMANDO ENRIQUEZ, RESPONDENTS.","The present case stemmed from a Complaint[5] for Declaration of Nullity and Cancellation of Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. P-3,588,[6] issued in the name of Hrs. of Florencio Enriquez, rep. by: Armando Enriquez,"" and Declaration of Ownership over Lot Nos. 3564, 3566, and 3567 (subject lots), with prayer for issuance of temporary restraining order (TRO) and/or writ of preliminary injunction (WPI) filed by petitioners and their now deceased siblings, Estelita F. Enriquez, Derticio F. Enriquez, Rosita Ruste Vda. De Enriquez, Policarpo Enriquez, and attorney-in-fact, Abelardo F. Enriquez (Abelardo),[7] on August 5, 2002 against the Heirs of Florencio F. Enriquez (Florencio), represented by Armando Enriquez (Armando; collectively, respondents).[8] In their prayer for preliminary injunctive relief, petitioners sought to enjoin: (1) the continuation of the proceedings in the ejectment case earlier filed by respondents in July 2002 before Branch 4, Municipal Trial Court, Zamboanga City (MTC), docketed as Special Civil Action No. 6256- 571,[9] and (2) respondents from further entering the subject lots and causing irreparable damage to petitioners' interest.[10]

As culled from the records, petitioners and Florencio are the heirs of the late Faustino W. Enriquez (Faustino), who died on August 9, 1956. Petitioners alleged that in 1948, Faustino bought three parcels of agricultural land, the subject lots, from one Ong Yok in consideration of the sum of PHP 5,000.00. Albeit the name of Florencio, Faustino's eldest son, was placed as the vendee in the ""Escritura de Venta""[11] covering the three lots, petitioners argued that Faustino bought the subject lots for his children by his second marriage, herein petitioners.

Fulfilling their father's intention, Florencio executed a Deed of Sale, likewise denominated as ""Escritura de Venta,""[12] on July 18, 1952 covering the subject lots in favor of petitioners. Due to an inadvertent omission of Tita's name in said Deed, Florencio subsequently executed an Affidavit[13] on September 28, 1956 to rectify such omission.[14] Petitioners asserted that they have been in open and continuous possession of the subject lots, which they have cultivated by planting coconut trees and other minor crops.[15]

Sometime in 1989, Abelardo took charge of the cultivation of the subject lots after their brother Romeo, who was previously in charge of its administration, left for abroad. To his surprise, Abelardo received a letter from respondents' counsel on June 22, 2002 demanding them to vacate the subject lots. Upon verification, Abelardo discovered that a free patent covering Lot No. 3564 was issued in Florencio 's name by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR). Thereafter, OCT No. P-3,588 covering Lot No. 3564 was issued on July 18, 1997 in respondents' name. Subsequently, Abelardo received summons from the MTC in the ejectment case filed against them.

Petitioners argued that the DENR had no jurisdiction over Lot No. 3564 since it is not a part of the public domain, having been owned by one Ong Yok since 1931 until the sale to Faustino. Moreover, they were the ones who have been paying the realty taxes thereon.[16]","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court filed by Julieta F. Enriquez, Romeo F. Enriquez (Romeo), and Tita E.

The assailed CA rulings reversed and set aside the Decision[4] dated July 27, 2009 of Branch 14, Regional Trial Court, Zamboanga City (RTC) in Civil Case No. 5289 granting petitioners' Complaint for Declaration of Nullity and Cancellation of Title and Declaration of Ownership.","The Petition is granted.

Prefatorily, it must be stressed that in a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, only questions of law can be raised. For a question to be one of law, the same must not involve an examination of the probative value of the evidence presented by the litigants or any of them.[52]

A question of law arises when there is doubt as to what the law is on a certain state of facts, while there is a question of fact when the doubt arises as to the truth or falsity of the alleged facts. For a question to be one of law, its resolution must not involve an examination of the probative value of the evidence presented by the litigants but must rely solely on what the law provides on the given set of facts. If the facts are disputed or if the issues require an examination of the evidence, the question posed is one of fact. The test, therefore, is not the appellation given to a question by the party raising it, but whether the appellate court can resolve the issue without examining or evaluating the evidence, in which case, it is a question of law; otherwise, it is a question of fact.[53]

In this case, petitioners assert that the issue raised in this case, i.e., whether the CA erred in refusing to remand the case to the RTC for the conduct of trial and resolution of the case on the merits, is purely one of law since it simply requires a determination of whether the RTC gravely erred or abused its discretion in deciding on the merits of the case despite the issues not having been joined due to the absence of a pre-trial, and thereafter submitting the case for resolution. Viewed in this light, the Court agrees that the question as presented is one of law that a petition for review on certiorari contemplates.

Nonetheless, the resolution of this issue will necessarily require the Court to review the entire records of the case, including the entire proceedings before the trial court, to determine whether indeed (i) the hearing and presentation of evidence conducted before the trial court were simply for the determination of whether petitioners' prayer for the issuance of a WPI should be granted, and (ii) the issues have not been joined, due to the absence of a pre-trial, and thereafter submitted for resolution. A review of the records is rendered unavoidable considering that the RTC explicitly stated in its Decision that ""[i]ssues having been joined, pre-trial and trial on the merits proceeded.""[54] Verily, these entail factual determination that is not proper in a Rule 45 petition.

The foregoing notwithstanding, case law has recognized several exceptions to the rule, namely: (a) when the findings are grounded entirely on speculation, surmises or conjectures; (b) when the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible; (c) when there is grave abuse of discretion; (d) when the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts; (e) when the findings of facts are conflicting; (f) when in making its findings the CA went beyond the issues of the case, or its findings are contrary to the admissions of both the appellant and the appellee; (g) when the findings are contrary to those of the trial court; (h) when the findings are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based; (i) when the facts set forth in the petition as well as in the petitioner's main and reply briefs are not disputed by the respondent; (j) when the findings of fact are premised on the supposed absence of evidence and contradicted by the evidence on record; and (k) when the CA manifestly overlooked certain relevant facts not disputed by the parties, which, if properly considered, would justify a different conclusion.[55]","ACCORDINGLY, the Court resolves to GRANT the Petition for Review on Certiorari. The assailed Decision dated January 8, 2014 and the Resolution dated September 19, 2014 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 02026-MIN are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The case is hereby REMANDED to Branch 14, Regional Trial Court, Zamboanga City for trial on the merits and resolution of the case docketed as Civil Case No. 5289 WITH DISPATCH."

Contrary to law, qualified by the circumstance of minority of offended party ""AAA"" (17 years old).[7]

On arraignment, Sofia pleaded not guilty to the crimes filed against her. Thereafter, pre-trial and trial on the merits ensued.[8]

The prosecution presented Dr. Janice Joy Goboc Tan (Dr. Tan), AAA, BBB, FFF, and Senior Police Officer I Dennis O. Valdehueza (SPO1 Valdehueza) as its witnesses.[9]","Individuals engaged in trafficking of persons may be validly arrested through a decoy solicitation from a law enforcement officer. It is a form of an entrapment operation conducted not only to catch offenders in flagrante but also to facilitate ""the rescue of trafficked victims.""[1]
This Court resolves a Notice of Appeal[2] challenging the Court of Appeals Decision,[3] affirming the Regional Trial Court's Decision[4] finding Ceferina Mendez (Sofia) a.k.a. ""Soping/Sofia"" guilty of three counts of qualified trafficking in persons.

Three separate Informations were filed against Sofia charging her with qualified trafficking in persons and child abuse.[5] They read:","The Office of the Solicitor General countered that Sofia's guilt was proven beyond reasonable doubt. It insisted that the testimony of the prosecution witnesses proved that Sofia committed the crime charged.[33]

Finally, it denied that Sofia was instigated to commit the offense, given that the criminal intent to perform the acts originated from Sofia herself. It maintained that even prior to the entrapment operation, Sofia had already been pimping minors and was the subject of several complaints.[34]

In the assailed Decision, the Court of Appeals sustained Sofia's conviction.[35] It affirmed the Regional Trial Court's finding that all elements of the crime trafficking in persons were established by the prosecution.[36] It also found unmeritorious Sofia's claim of instigation and stressed that similar to a buy-bust operation in drugs cases, the decoy solicitation of the police officers cannot be considered as a means to induce or instigate the perpetrator.[37]

As to the alleged nonreceipt of payment, the Court of Appeals emphasized that ""the act of receiving the money as payment is not an element of the crime.""[38]

Dissatisfied with its Decision, Sofia filed a Notice of Appeal with the Court of Appeals.[39]

On March 22, 2023, this Court resolved to note the records of this case forwarded by the Court of Appeals and to require the parties to submit their supplemental briefs.[40]

The People of the Philippines, through the Office of the Solicitor General,[41] and Sofia[42] respectively manifested that they would no longer file supplemental briefs.

The issues for this Court's resolution are:

Whether accused-appellant Ceferina Mendez a.k.a. ""Soping/Sofia"" is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of three counts of qualified trafficking in persons; and

Whether there was a valid entrapment operation.

We find the appeal unmeritorious.","ACCORDINGLY, the Appeal is DISMISSED. The February 10, 2022 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR HC No. 02343 is AFFIRMED. Accused-appellant Ceferina Mendez a.k.a. ""Soping/Sofia"" is found GUILTY of the following:

That on the 7th day of November 2014, at around 6:00 o'clock in the evening, and sometime prior thereto, at xxxxxxxxxxx, xxxxxxxxxxx, xxxxxxxxxxx, Province of Cebu, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused being the owner of ""Freda's KTV Bar"", did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously, commit trafficking in persons in large scale and with a minor victim, by obtaining, harboring, hiring, maintaining and/or providing [AAA, BBB, and CCC], 16 years old, by means of fraud, deception and taking advantage of the victims' vulnerability for purposes of prostitution and sexual exploitation.

The commission of the crime is attended to by qualifying circumstances having been committed against a child ([CCC]) and in large scale.","Under the law, actual prostitution of a victim is not required for a trafficking case to prosper.[1] Moreover, the accused's knowledge of the victim's minority is ""inconsequential with respect to qualifying the crime of Trafficking in Persons.""[2]

This Court resolves an appeal assailing the Decision[3] of the Court of Appeals affirming the Regional Trial Court's conviction[4] of Wilfreda Laput Campos (Campos) for qualified trafficking of persons under Section 4(a) and (e) in relation to Section 6(a) and (c), of Republic Act No. 9208 or the ""Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003,"" as amended by Republic Act No. 10364 or the ""Expanded Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2012.""","The issue for this Court's resolution is whether accused-appellant Wilfreda Laput Campos is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of qualified human trafficking, as punished by Section 4(a) and (e), in relation to Section 6(a) and (c), of Republic Act No. 9208, as amended by Republic Act No. 10364.

This Court denies the appeal and sustains the conviction of accused-appellant.

The offense of trafficking in persons is defined in Section 3(a) of Republic Act No. 9208 or the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act as amended by Republic Act No. 10364 or the Expanded Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2012:
Section 3. Definition of Terms. – As used in this Act:

(a)
Trafficking in Persons – refers to the recruitment, obtaining, hiring, providing, offering, transportation, transfer, maintaining, harboring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders by means of threat, or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the person, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person for the purpose of exploitation which includes at a minimum, the exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs.


The recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, adoption or receipt of a child for the purpose of exploitation or when the adoption is induced by any form of consideration for exploitative purposes shall also be considered as 'trafficking in persons' even if it does not involve any of the means set forth in the preceding paragraph.
In People v. Casio,[55] the elements of trafficking in persons were enumerated based on its expanded definition:
Under Republic Act No. 10364, the elements of trafficking in persons have been expanded to include the following acts:
     
 	
(1)
The act of ""recruitment, obtaining, hiring, providing, offering, transportation, transfer, maintaining, harboring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders;""
 	
(2)
The means used include ""by means of threat, or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the person, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person""
 	
(3)
The purpose of trafficking includes ""the exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs[.]""[56] (Emphasis in original)
In this case, the accused-appellant was charged with violation of qualified trafficking in persons, punishable under Section 4(a) and (e) of the Expanded Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2012. The acts punishable under said provisions are as follows:
SEC. 4. Acts of Trafficking in Persons. – It shall be unlawful for any person, natural or juridical, to commit any of the following acts:

(a)
To recruit, obtain, hire, provide, offer, transport, transfer, maintain, harbor, or receive a person by any means, including those done under the pretext of domestic or overseas employment or training or apprenticeship, for the purpose of prostitution, pornography, or sexual exploitation;



. . . .


(e)
To maintain or hire a person to engage in prostitution or pornography[.]
Section 6 of Republic Act No. 9208 provides for the circumstances that qualify the crime. Here, the particular qualifying circumstances are ""the trafficked person is a child""[57] and ""the crime is committed...in large scale""[58] as provided in Section 6(a) and (c). Qualified trafficking is ""committed in large scale if committed against three (3) or more persons, individually or as a group.""[59]

All the elements of qualified trafficking in persons are present in this case.","ACCORDINGLY, the appeal is DISMISSED. The January 27, 2021 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

LOPEZ, JR., NAMELY: DELIA DE GUZMAN LOPEZ AND LORRAINE DE GUZMAN LOPEZ, AND RODOLFO BARNACHEA, SR., RESPONDENTS.","On March 9, 2017, Mercuria B. Magsi (Magsi), represented by her daughter Maria Frances M. Mangaoang, filed a Complaint[6] against the Heirs of Ignacio A. Lopez, Jr. (Ignacio), namely: Delia De Guzman and Lorraine De Guzman Lopez, and Rodolfo Barnachea, Sr. (Rodolfo) (collectively, respondents), for Forcible Entry and Damages docketed as Civil Case No. 14049, after failing to arrive at an amicable settlement with the respondents.[7] In the Complaint, Magsi stated that she worked as an employee at the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) in Baguio City from February 1964 until her retirement in 2004. During her employment with DPWH, she resided at the National Government Dormitory, Dormitory I, in Jungle Town, Engineers' Hill, Baguio City and became a member of the Engineers Hill Lotless Homeseekers Association, Inc. (Association).[8]

Magsi stated that sometime in 1969, Republic Act No. 5941 was passed, amending Republic Act No. 1361, granting the National Government the authority to sell cottages in Baguio City, including the lot on which subject property is located, as follows:
Sec. 3. [. . .] that every cottage and lot on which it is built including the furniture and equipment in Jungle Town and Engineer's Hill shall be sold at a price to be fixed by the committee on Appraisal payable in ten yearly installments, to the present lessee or occupant thereof who has continuously leased or occupied them for not less than three years prior to the date of the approval of this amendatory act, unless such lessee or occupant refuses to exercise the right herein granted [. . .].[9]
Magsi submitted her application on March 20, 1981. The Association referred her application to the Screening and Recommending Awards Committee for Lot No. 59, SWO-1-01039. After due proceedings, Magsi was awarded Lot No. 50 since she had been occupying the said lot and had built a bodega therein since 1981.[10]

In 1990, Magsi introduced several repairs on the bodega located in Lot No. 50. In 1991, it was rebuilt into a residential house after a major earthquake hit Baguio City. In 1993, Magsi declared her residential house/building for tax purposes. On the other hand, Lot No. 50 was earlier declared for tax purposes as early as 1990.[11] Magsi further narrated that one Ernesto A. Hernandez filed an application over a lot in Engineers' Hill, which led to an investigation conducted by the Land Management Services of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR). However, Ernesto's application was denied since the lot application encroached upon Lot No. 50.[12]

Magsi averred that she often traveled to the United States but she always made it a point to visit Lot No. 50. She also instructed her children to handle the processing of the award and titling of the lot, but some of her children got married and moved out, leaving only Magsi and her two younger children as occupants of the lot. According to her, she had been in possession of Lot No. 50 since 1981, while awaiting for the issuance of the title under Republic Act No. 1361, as amended by Republic Act No. 5941.[13]","Before this Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, seeking to set aside the Decision[2] and the Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 156585, which reversed and set aside the Decision[4] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 5, Baguio City, in Civil Case No. 8842-R. The RTC affirmed the Decision[5] of the Municipal Trial Court in Cities (MTCC), Branch 3, Baguio City in Civil Case No. 14049.","The petition is meritorious.

An action for forcible entry is governed by Rule 70, Section 1 of the Rules of Court, which provides:
Section 1. Who may institute proceedings, and when. — Subject to the provisions of the next succeeding section, a person deprived of the possession of any land or building by force, intimidation, threat, strategy, or stealth, or a lessor, vendor, vendee, or other person against whom the possession of any land or building is unlawfully withheld after the expiration or termination of the right to hold possession, by virtue of any contract, express or implied, or the legal representatives or assigns of any such lessor, vendor, vendee, or other person, may, at any time within one (1) year after such unlawful deprivation or withholding of possession, bring an action in the proper Municipal Trial Court against the person or persons unlawfully withholding or depriving of possession, or any person or persons claiming under them, for the restitution of such possession, together with damages and costs.
Thus, the following elements must be alleged and proved: (1) that the plaintiff had prior physical possession of the property; (2) that the plaintiff was deprived of possession either by force, intimidation, threat, strategy or stealth; and (3) that the action was filed within one year from the time the owners or legal possessors learned of their deprivation of the physical possession of the property.[36] The main point of contention is whether Magsi was able to prove that she had a prior physical possession over the subject property.

We rule in the affirmative.

It is undisputed that Magsi occupied and built a residential house on Lot No. 50 as early as 1991. In 1993, she declared her residential house/building for tax purposes. Meanwhile, based on OCT No. P-3097 of the Register of Deeds of Baguio City, Lot No. 49 was awarded to Ignacio through a Special Patent pursuant to Republic Act No. 1361 on July 27, 2004. Notably, the parties stipulated that the property sought to be recovered by Magsi encroaches upon Lot No. 49, which is titled in the name of Ignacio. Such fact is also supported by the sketch plan of land prepared by Geodetic Engineer Bobby M. Villena.[37] Thus, while the CA correctly held that possession can be acquired through juridical acts, i.e., the execution and registration of the deed of absolute sale in favor of Ignacio, Magsi's prior physical possession since 1991 has been well­-established and even admitted by respondents. While Magsi did not have prior physical possession over the entire Lot No. 49, the subject property whose possession Magsi seeks to recover is inside Lot No. 49. Therefore, as between Magsi and the respondents, Magsi sufficiently proved that she had a prior physical possession of the subject property.

As correctly pointed out by Magsi, this case is in stark contrast with the factual milieu in the cases of Mangaser and Spouses Orencia.","ACCORDINGLY, the present petition is GRANTED.

SORIANO,** RESPONDENTS.","At the pith of the instant Petition is the disapproved accident insurance claim filed by respondent Romeo D. Soriano (Romeo).

Romeo was employed as an account executive at Shooters Guns and Ammunition Corporation, a business engaged in the selling of firearms and ammunitions. He obtained accident insurance policies from the following insurance companies: 
Name of Insurer
Policy No. & Coverage
Malayan Insurance
RJ-0054200100008 for [PHP] 1,000,000.00
Great Domestic Insurance
PA 2670 for [PHP] 1,000,000.00
Commonwealth Insurance
PA-980764 12-29-01 for [PHP] 1,000,000.00
FGU Insurance
BPA-100162 for [PHP] 1,000,000.00
UCPB Insurance
CGY00PD-PlP000558 for PHP 500,000.00
Philam Life Insurance
W443343 and W443344 for [PHP] 300,000.00 and [PHP] 500,000.00, respectively.[5]
On January 29, 2001, Romeo tripped as he was coming out of the bathroom, causing his right eye to hit the arm rest of a chair. He called out to his spouse, respondent Maria Luisa R. Soriano (Luisa), who promptly rushed to his side.[6]

Romeo was immediately brought to the clinic of Dr. Reynaldo Villanueva (Dr. Villanueva). After a series of check-ups, he was admitted at the Manuel J. Santos Hospital in Butuan City and underwent an enucleation, a surgical procedure involving the removal of his right eye. The post-operative diagnosis was ""traumatic endophthalmitis, absolute glaucoma, OD, SIP Enucleation and implant."" On account of the surgery, he incurred medical expenses in the sum of PHP 31,060.00.[7]

Consequently, Romeo filed written notices of injury with the above­named insurance companies. To his dismay, his claims were disapproved based on the joint affidavit of their former household helpers, Merced Amor (Amor) and Rofe Dellera (Dellera), who denied the occurrence of the accident. The joint affidavit was secured by Pablito Bais (Bais), who was hired to investigate the veracity of Romeo's claims. Meanwhile, a similar affidavit was secured by Manila Adjusters & Surveyors Company, the credit investigator of petitioner The Philippine American Life and General Insurance [Philam Life] Company (Philam Life).[8]

The disapproval of the claims prompted Romeo and Luisa (spouses Soriano) to lodge separate complaints before the RTC against Bais and the insurance companies for accident insurance proceeds, specific performance, damages, and attorney's fees. These complaints were docketed as Civil Case Nos. 5119, 5120, 5122, 5136, 5159, and 5160. The issues were joined and the case was set for pre-trial. The parties failed to reach a settlement. Thus, trial on the merits ensued.[9]

During the trial, spouses Soriano presented themselves and Dr. Villanueva as witnesses.[10] On the other hand, Philam Life and Bais proffered the testimony of Dellera and the medical opinion of Dr. Mario J. Valenton (Dr. Valenton), a credited physician of Philam Life.[11]

In due course, the RTC rendered its Judgment, dismissing the complaints based on the equipoise rule. The spouses Soriano moved for reconsideration, but their plea was denied in the Omnibus Resolution dated January 21, 2015.[12] Undeterred, they sought recourse before the CA, which granted their appeal via the repugned Decision.

The CA held that the RTC erroneously applied the equipoise rule given that ""the evidence of [s]pouses Soriano holds more weight than that of the insurance companies and Bais.""[13] Primarily, the CA banked on the medical findings and testimony of Dr. Villanueva, who performed the enucleation. Moreover, it drew attention to Dellera's admission that she noticed Romeo wearing a plaster on his right eye when he came home on January 29, 2001.[14]

Likewise, the CA found Romeo's claim of accident more credible, postulating that if his claim of accident were untrue, it follows that he deliberately caused the injury on his eye to claim insurance benefits. The CA also held that ""a self-inflicted injury that leaves [sic] a permanent damage on his eye seems very improbable considering that he could have injured other parts of his body to claim insurance proceeds.""[15]

Nevertheless, the CA affirmed the dismissal of the spouses Soriano's complaints against Bais as no evidence was adduced indicting him for acting with malice or bad faith in conducting his investigation of their claims.[16]","This Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] impugns the Decision[2] and the Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA), which reversed the Regional Trial Court (RTC) Judgment[4] and which denied the subsequent motion for reconsideration, respectively, in CA-G.R. CV No. 04447-MIN.","The Court finds no compelling reason to cast aside the disposition of the CA.

At the outset, Philam Life and Bais raise issues which involve questions of fact. As a rule, these cannot be entertained in a Rule 45 petition. Under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, jurisdiction is generally limited to the review of errors of law committed by the court a quo. The Court is not obliged to review all over again the evidence which the parties adduced in the court a quo. Of course, the general rule admits of exceptions, such as where the factual findings of the CA and the trial court are conflicting or contradictory, as in this case.[20]

In Spouses Zapanta v. Rustan Commercial Corporation,[21] the Court so decreed:
In civil cases, the quantum of evidence to be observed is preponderance of evidence. Preponderance of evidence means that the evidence adduced by one side is superior to or has greater weight than that of the other. It means that evidence which is more convincing to the Court as worthy of belief than that which is offered in opposition thereto. Under Section 1, Rule 133 of the Revised Rules on Evidence, in determining whether or not there is preponderance of evidence, the court may consider the following: (a) all the facts and circumstances of the case; (b) the witnesses' manner of testifying, their intelligence, their means and opportunity of knowing the facts to which they are testifying, the nature of the facts to which they testify, the probability or improbability of their testimony; (c) the witnesses' interest or want of interest, and also their personal credibility so far as the same may ultimately appear in the trial; and (d) the number of witnesses, although it does not mean that preponderance is necessarily with the greater number.[22]
Moreover, Spouses Zapanta teaches that when the evidence of the parties are evenly balanced or when there is doubt on which side the evidence preponderates, the decision should be against the party with the burden of proof, according to the equipoise doctrine.[23]

As unequivocally ruled by the CA, the RTC erred in applying the equipoise rule considering that spouses Soriano were able to prove through preponderance of evidence that Romeo's injury was caused by an accident, thus entitling him to the proceeds of the subject accident insurance policies.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED. The February 22, 2018 Decision and the June 20, 2018 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 04447-MIN are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION.

"G.R. No. 252347, May 22, 2024","RUDY T. AMPOLITOD, PETITIONER, VS. TOP EVER MARINE MANAGEMENT PHILS. INC., TEMM MARITIME CO., LTD., AND CAPT. OSCAR D. ORBETA, RESPONDENTS.","On June 27, 2015, Rudy T. Ampolitod was hired by Top Ever Marine Management Phils. Inc. (Top Ever) for and in behalf of its principal, TEMM Maritime Company, Ltd. (TEMM Maritime) as an Able-Bodied Seaman to work on board the vessel ""M/V"" Coral Opal for a period of nine months. Prior to this employment, Ampolitod was hired continuously by Top Ever for and on behalf of TEMM Maritime since 2009 to work on board different vessels under various positions.[5] Prior to his deployment, Ampolitod was given a clean bill of health by the company-designated doctors.[6]

On August 25, 2015, Ampolitod joined ""M/V"" Coral Opal. Sometime in October 2015, almost two months after embarkation and while on board the vessel, Ampolitod suddenly felt dizzy, weak, and tired. On October 22, 2015, Ampolitod requested permission from the vessel's Master to have a medical examination at a medical clinic in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, United States of America for his complete blood count (CBC).[7] According to his Hematology results, Ampolitod had a platelet count of 51 L, below the normal platelet count of 150-400.[8]

On October 25, 2015, Ampolitod noticed bruising on his legs, arms, and other body parts. In addition, Ampolitod felt dizzy and had blurred vision.[9] The following day, the vessel's Master sent him to West Jefferson Medical Center for medical treatment. The attending physician diagnosed Ampolitod with Thrombocytopenia and was advised to see a hematologist.[10] In addition, Ampolitod was declared unfit to work and recommended his repatriation.[11]

On October 29, 2015, Ampolitod was medically repatriated and arrived in the Philippines on October 30, 2015. On October 31, 2015, respondents had him admitted at the Manila Doctors Hospital where he was monitored and treated by the hematology team from that day until November 21, 2015. The company-designated physician's impression was Pancytopenia Secondary to Idiopathic Thrombocytopenia Purpura. Said condition is compatible with Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS), as confirmed by the November 16, 2015 bone marrow biopsy result.[12] The company-designated physician also sent a specimen of Ampolitod's bone marrow for cytogenetic analysis to the Molecular Cytogenetics Laboratory of St. Luke's Medical Center. The cytogenetic report of December 10, 2015 showed that Ampolitod's illness is not genetic in nature.[13]

Respondents claim that during medical history taking at Manila Doctors Hospital, Ampolitod admitted that sometime in June 2015, he suffered from Isolated Anemia but was subsequently cleared for employment abroad. Ampolitod was asymptomatic until three months later when he noted anterior chest wall petechial and right calf and arm hematoma.

Ampolitod started treatment on October 31, 2015, and continued until May 2016 for almost seven months. Sometime in May 2016, Ampolitod's treatment was discontinued after his CBC showed normal result and that he was already fit to work.[14] Even after the discontinued treatment, the company physician recommended that Ampolitod continue monitoring his CBC.[15] Thus, Ampolitod regularly underwent CBC testing at Capital University Medical Center in his province in Cagayan De Oro. Ampolitod furnished the company-designated physicians his CBC results from January 20, 2016 until August 5, 2017, all of which showed below than normal results, especially on the platelet count. Ampolitod also continued to suffer from dizziness, bruising on his body, and blurred vision.[16]

During this time, Ampolitod also regularly visited Dr. Alisa Q. Queja (Dr. Queja), an internal medicine-hematologist in his hometown, for follow­up monitoring of his CBC. In a Medical Certificate dated September 6, 2017, Dr. Queja, under diagnosis MOS, declared Ampolitod ""Not fit to work.""[17] Ampolitod also sought the medical opinion of Dr. May S. Donato-Tan (Dr. Donato-Tan), an internal medicine cardiologist at the Philippine Heart Center, who declared him permanently disabled.

Consequently, on November 3, 2017, Ampolitod filed before the Labor Arbiter (LA) a complaint to recover permanent total disability benefits.[18]

During the mandatory conference, the parties agreed to refer the matter to a third doctor - Dr. Ivy Mae Escasa (Dr. Escasa), an internal medicine-adult hematologist In a Report dated January 25, 2018, Dr. Escasa confirmed Ampolitod's MDS and made the following remarks: (1) placed his survival at 8.8 years; (2) that he has a low risk to develop acute myeloid leukemia; and (3) she recommended that Ampolitod not be allowed to work as a seafarer anymore. However, the report of Dr. Escasa did not indicate that the illness was work-related.[19]","This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] filed by petitioner Rudy T.

However, the foregoing rule admits of certain exceptions, such as when the lower courts have conflicting findings of fact.[39]

In this case, the conflicting factual findings by the LA on one hand, and the NLRC as affirmed by CA on the other, compels this Court to delve into the records and examine for itself the questioned findings.[40]","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is GRANTED.

"G.R. No. 241649, May 22, 2024","RON DE GUZMAN DIMAAPI, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","This case stemmed from an Information[5] filed before the RTC charging Dimaapi, Jerry Supranes (Supranes), and a John Doe of the crime of robbery, the accusatory portion of which reads:
That on or about 19th of September 2010, in Barangay Dinahican, Municipality of Infanta, Province of Quezon, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with intent to gain, armed with hammer, scissors[,] and other instruments used to open wall[s] and door[s], conspiring, confederating[,] and mutually helping each other, did then and there, willfully, feloniously[,] and unlawfully, destroyed the wall of the house with store owned by ZENAIDA ANGARA, and once inside[,] take, steal[,] and cart away the following: a) cash amounting to more or less PHP 20,000.00 and packs of Marlboro and Philip Cigarettes amounting to more or less PHP 35,000.00, with the total amount of PHP 55,000.00, without the complainant's consent and against her will[,] and to the damage and prejudice of the complainant in the aforementioned amount, afterwards the accused forcibly pushed the door of the room wherein the complainant and her children were located, which the complainant pushed back the said door of the room wherein the accused tried to enter.[6]
Dimaapi was arraigned and pleaded not guilty on March 8, 2011. Almost two years later, Supranes was apprehended and also pleaded not guilty. The John Doe remained at large, thereby leaving Dimaapi and Supranes to stand trial.[7]

The prosecution alleged that private complainant Zenaida Angara (Angara) owns a grocery store, portions of which she and her family use as their house/living quarters. At around 3:00 a.m. of September 19, 2010, Angara and her kids were sleeping in a room inside said store when her stay­ in store saleslady, Lorena Atendido (Atendido), knocked at Angara's room to inform the latter that she saw a person inside the store with a flashlight. Angara let Atendido inside the room, and thereafter, called her brother-in­ law, Jerribel Madriaga (Madriaga) via mobile phone, asking him to help. While waiting for Madriaga, Angara slightly opened the door to peek, and saw a man-later identified as Dimaapi-who, upon seeing Angara peeking, turned off his flashlight and rushed towards the room. Fortunately for Angara, she was able to immediately close the door and block it.[8]

Shortly thereafter, Madriaga, together with the barangay tanods (Madriaga, et al.) arrived and climbed the roof of Angara's store to retrieve the keys to the store through a hole in the ceiling so that they could enter through the store's front door. While they were on the roof, Madriaga, et al. saw two men fleeing but they failed to recognize them as they were wearing bonnets. Upon getting the keys, Madriaga, et al. went and opened the store's front door. They immediately searched the entire store and eventually found Dimaapi underneath an empty box of soy sauce and in between sacks of rice and cases of beer at the bodega. Madriaga, et al. then apprehended Dimaapi and found out that the latter was equipped with a hammer, a pair of scissors, a pair of pliers, a pair of longnose pliers, a screwdriver, a cutter, a double­ bladed knife, a bonnet, and a set of keys. Madriaga, et al. then questioned Dimaapi about his companions and the latter replied that he was with Supranes and another man whose name he does not know.[9]

After Dimaapi was detained, Madriaga, et al., together with Angara who had come out from her room, checked the grocery store and discovered that PHP 20,000.00 worth of coins and PHP 35,000.00 worth of cigarettes were already missing. Furthermore, they saw that a wall of the grocery store which was made of galvanized iron was destroyed, thereby surmising that Dimaapi and his cohorts were the ones who destroyed it to gain entry into the store. Thereafter, they brought Dimaapi to the barangay hall and turned him over to the responding police officers.[10]

In defense, Dimaapi denied the allegations against him. He averred that on the date and time of the incident, he was buying bread and cigarettes from a nearby bakery when Angara invited him to go to her store. According to Dimaapi, when he arrived at Angara's store, she told him to enter the store, which he did. Dimaapi then claimed that a few moments later, barangay tanods arrived, arrested him, and detained him at the barangay hall. Finally, Dimaapi said that he was taken to the police station and it was only then that he found out that he was being charged with robbery.[11]

For his part, Supranes interposed the defenses of denial and alibi. He maintained that from around 7:00 p.m. of September 18, 2010, until around 7:00 a.m. of September 19, 2010, he was sleeping at his house located in Purok Kamias, Brgy. Ungos Real, Quezon, with his mother and sister. After waking up, he ate breakfast and left his house at around 8:30 a.m. to report to his work as a kargador in the same area.[12]","Assailed in this Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court are the Decision[2] dated February 27, 2018 and the Resolution[3] dated August 17, 2018 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR No. 39790 which partially affirmed the Decision[4] dated February 3, 2017 of Branch 65, Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Infanta, Quezon. The CA resolution, in effect, upheld the conviction of petitioner Ron De Guzman Dimaapi (Dimaapi) for the crime of robbery in an inhabited house, as defined and penalized under Article 299 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).","The Petition is without merit.

In criminal cases, an appeal throws the entire case wide open for review and the reviewing tribunal can correct errors, though unassigned in the appealed judgment, or even reverse the trial court's decision based on grounds other than those that the parties raised as errors. The appeal confers the appellate court full jurisdiction over the case and renders such court competent to examine records, revise the judgment appealed from, increase the penalty, and cite the proper provision of the penal law.[21]

Given this consideration, the Court upholds Dimaapi 's conviction with modification as to his civil liability ex delicto, as will be explained hereunder.

Pertinent portions of Article 299 of the RPC, as amended, read:
Article 299. Robbery in an inhabited house or public building or edifice devoted to worship. - Any armed person who shall commit robbery in an inhabited house or public building or edifice devoted to religious worship, shall be punished by reclusion temporal, if the value of the property taken shall exceed PHP 50,000, and if--

(a) The malefactors shall enter the house or building in which the robbery was committed, by any of the following means:

x x x x

2. By breaking any wall roof or floor or breaking any door or window.

x x x x

When the offenders do not carry arms, and the value of the property taken exceeds PHP 50,000, the penalty next lower in degree shall be imposed.

The same rule shall be applied when the offenders are armed, but the value of the property taken does not exceed PHP 50,000.

When said offenders do not carry arms and the value of the property taken does not exceed PHP 50,000, they shall suffer the penalty prescribed in the two next preceding paragraphs, in its minimum period.

If the robbery be committed in one of the dependencies of an inhabited house, public building, or building dedicated to religious worship, the penalties next lower in degree than those prescribed in this article shall be imposed.
In Tumog v. People,[22] the Court reiterated that ""[t]o be convicted of this form of robbery, it is necessary that the following elements are proved: (1) unlawful taking; (2) of personal property belonging to another; (3) with intent to gain; and (4) with force upon things, i.e., by breaking any wall, roof, or floor or breaking any door or window to enter the building where the robbery is committed. Additionally, the penalty to be imposed is dependent on the value of the things taken and whether or not the offender carries arms.""[23]

Here, it is well to recapitulate that while the CA noted that Dimaapi was not found to be in possession of the cash and goods stolen from Angara's grocery store, his complicity in the robbery committed thereat was nevertheless proven beyond reasonable doubt through circumstantial evidence.

The Court agrees.","ACCORDINGLY, the instant Petition is DENIED. The Decision dated February 27, 2018 and the Resolution dated August 17, 2018 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 39790 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. Petitioner Ron De Guzman Dimaapi is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of robbery in an inhabited house, as defined and penalized under Article 299 (a)(2) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended. He is sentenced to suffer the penalty of imprisonment for an indeterminate period of eight years and one day of prision mayor, as minimum, to 14 years, eight months, and one day of reclusion temporal, as maximum; and is ordered to pay Zenaida Angara the amount of PHP 55,000.00 as actual damages,with legal interest at the rate of 6% per annum from finality of this Decision until full payment."

WENA FE DALAGAN, WARDEN, TAGUIG CITY JAIL FEMALE DORMITORY, RESPONDENTS.","On June 5, 2014, an Information charged petitioner with Plunder.[3] Through the Order of Commitment (commitment order)[4] dated July 9, 2014, the Sandiganbayan directed the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP) to take custody of petitioner. The Order of Commitment reads:
We hereby commit to you the person of [PETITIONER], who is charged with PLUNDER (Section 2, R.A. No. 7080) in SB-14-CRM-0238, entitled People of the Philippines versus JUAN PONCE ENRILE, ET AL., and for violation of Section 3(e), of R.A. No. 3019 in SB-14-CRM-0241-0255, entitled People of the Philippines versus JUAN PONCE ENRILE, ET AL., pursuant to this Court's Minute Resolution dated July 9, 2014.[5]
In her Petition for Habeas Corpus[6] dated January 13, 2021, petitioner stated that she was under detention at the Taguig City Jail-Female Dormitory, BJMP-National Capital Region Compound, Camp Bagong Diwa, Taguig, Metro Manila (Taguig City Jail Female Dormitory) since July 9, 2014[7] or close to nine years.[8] Because of such prolonged detention amounting to a violation of her right to speedy trial, petitioner's only recourse was to invoke the remedy of habeas corpus before this Court.[9]

Several pleadings were exchanged between the parties exhaustively arguing their positions on habeas corpus and an accused's right to speedy trial under the Constitution.

On January 17, 2023, the Court issued a Resolution granting the Petition for Habeas Corpus and setting stringent conditions for petitioner's release from detention. In all, We found that petitioner's confinement, though in accordance with a court order of the Sandiganbayan, has become oppressive thus infringing upon her right to liberty.[10]

Thus, the dispositive portion of Our Resolution states:[11]
WHEREFORE, the Petition for Habeas Corpus dated January 13, 2021 is GRANTED subject to the following conditions:

1) Petitioner Jessica Lucila G. Reyes shall personally attend the hearings of the criminal cases filed against her before the Sandiganbayan;

2) Petitioner shall submit a quarterly periodic report to the Clerk of Court of the Sandiganbayan of her whereabouts;

3) Petitioner shall secure a travel authority from the Sandiganbayan in cases of foreign travel on her part, and to physically present herself to the Sandiganbayan and submit a report of her return within five days of her arrival in the country;

4) Petitioner shall submit to this Court, through the Office of the Clerk of Court, a quarterly report of her compliance with the foregoing conditions.

The release of petitioner shall be without prejudice to her re-arrest and detention should she fail to comply with any of the conditions stated herein.","Before this Court is the Omnibus Motion[1] filed by the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG). In the Omnibus Motion, the OSG essentially argues that the factual and legal bases of this Court's January 17, 2023 Resolution should be reconsidered and re-examined.[2]","The Court resolves to DENY WITH FINALITY the Omnibus Motion dated February 3, 2023 for failure to advance substantial arguments to merit reconsideration of the factual and legal bases cited in Our January 17, 2023 Resolution.

At the outset, We note that the substantive arguments in the Omnibus Motion were rehashed and already exhaustively passed upon by this Court in the January 17, 2023 Resolution. To recall, in the assailed Resolution, We have already exhaustively presented a discussion on the constitutional right to liberty against the right to speedy trial. We also held that the ""right to speedy trial is violated when: (1) the proceeding is attended by vexatious, capricious, and oppressive delays; or (2) unjustified postponements of the trial are asked for and secured; or (3) without cause or justifiable motive, a long period of time is allowed to lapse without the party having his or her case tried."" We also laid down the standards in the grant of the writ of habeas corpus anchored on a violation of the right to speedy trial. And based on these standards, We have concluded that the writ of habeas corpus is available to petitioner. Her confinement, though in accordance with a court order of the Sandiganbayan, violates her constitutional right to speedy trial and infringes on her right to liberty.[25]

We have specifically and categorically identified the special attendant circumstances which merited the grant of the writ of habeas corpus. For reference, we reiterate:
Petitioner was able to prove that her detention had become a form of vexatious restraint, despite being detained by virtue of a court order. Petitioner has been under detention at the Taguig City Jail Female Dormitory since July 9, 2014, pursuant to the commitment order issued by the Sandiganbayan. While such order is lawful, petitioner's continued detention had become an undue restraint on her liberty due to the peculiar protracted proceedings attendant in the principal case.

As pointed out by petitioner, the proceeding was delayed due to the wrong markings in the prosecution's evidence. In order to correct the said errors, the Sandiganbayan was constrained to schedule additional preliminary conferences, which have considerably delayed the progress of the case. During the pre-trial stage, the Sandiganbayan issued two pre-trial orders, over her objection. To date, petitioner stated that it is not clear which between these two pre-trial orders are controlling, in accordance with Section 4, Rule 118 of the Rules of Court. Moreover, during trial, the Sandiganbayan has so far allowed only one witness per day, notwithstanding that trial is scheduled only twice a week and that the witnesses' testimonies are cumulative or similar in nature. Petitioner further contextualized the delay by noting that thousands of bundled marked exhibits are to be considered by the Sandiganbayan. To date, petitioner has been in detention for close to nine years, without assurance of the resolution of the case in sight, or that it can be speeded in accordance with law. She maintains that the trial commenced only on March 3, 2022, notwithstanding that the information was filed as early as June 5, 2014.","ACCORDINGLY, the Omnibus Motion dated February 3, 2023 is DENIED WITH FINALITY. No further pleadings shall be entertained. Let entry of judgment be issued in due course."

CR HC No. 07727, which affirmed with modification the Joint Decision[3] dated August 14, 2015 of Branch 207, Regional Trial Court of xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx (RTC) in Criminal Case Nos. 12-017, 12-018, and 12-019, finding Adrales guilty beyond reasonable doubt of three counts of qualified trafficking in persons under Section 4(a), in relation to Section 6(a) of Republic Act No. (RA) 9208[4] or the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003.","The appeal has no merit.

""Section 3(a) of RA 9208 defines the term 'Trafficking in Persons' as the 'recruitment, transportation, transfer or harboring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders by means of threat or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the persons, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person for the purpose of exploitation which includes at a minimum, the exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs.' The same provision further provides that '[t]he recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of a child for the purpose of exploitation shall also be considered as 'trafficking in persons' even if it does not involve any of the means set forth in the preceding paragraph.""[66]

Relatedly, Section 4 of the same law provides for an enumeration of acts constituting ""Trafficking in Persons"" which provides:

SECTION 4. Acts of Trafficking in Persons. — It shall be unlawful for any person, natural or juridical, to commit any of the following acts:

(a) To recruit, transport, transfer, harbor, provide, or receive a person by any means, including those done under the pretext of domestic or overseas employment or training or apprenticeship, for the purpose of prostitution, pornography, sexual exploitation, forced labor, slavery, involuntary servitude or debt bondage; . . .

Thus, the elements of ""Trafficking in Persons"" within the context of Section 4(a) of RA 9208 are as follows: (a) the act of ""recruitment, transportation, transfer or harboring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders""; (b) the means used which include ""threat or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the person, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another""; and (c) the purpose of trafficking is exploitation which includes ""exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs.""[67] Additionally, Section 6(a) of RA 9208 explicitly provides that ""Trafficking in Persons"" shall be in its qualified form ""when the trafficked person is a child.""

The Court agrees with the courts a quo that the prosecution was able to establish all the elements of the offense. In the case at bar, the testimony of AAA was direct, straightforward, and consistent. She clearly narrated that Adrales befriended her, and from there recruited her, frequently contacted her through text messages, and transported her to the places where she was to engage in sexual activities. This was not just with one man, but with two other men, and multiple times at that. In all these instances Adrales, as observed by both courts a quo, was with AAA before, during, and after her sexual encounters. AAA was also forthright that both she and Adrales were paid for her sexual ""services,"" and that this was the main reason why she was enticed to continue with the arrangement. Indeed, Adrales took advantage of AAA's invulnerability and would have continued to do so had Raquel not discovered the infidelity of her husband, which led to a confrontation with AAA and, in turn, led to AAA relating the incidents to her family.[68] Finally, AAA's minority was proven by the presentation of her Birth Certificate.[69]","ACCORDINGLY, the appeal is DISMISSED. The Decision dated March 26, 2018 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR HC No. 07727 is AFFIRMED. Accused-appellant Adrian Adrales y Jurado a.k.a. ""Alicia Bakla"" is hereby found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of three counts of the crime of qualified trafficking in persons, as defined and penalized under Section 4(a), in relation to Section 6(a) and Section 10(c) of Republic Act No. 9208. He is sentenced to suffer the penalty of three counts of life imprisonment and to pay a fine of PHP 2,000,000.00 per count. He is likewise ORDERED to pay AAA the amounts of PHP 500,000.00 as moral damages and PHP 100,000.00 as exemplary damages for each count, all with legal interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of finality of this Decision until full payment."
"G.R. No. 262975, May 21, 2024","MAGKAKASAMA SA SAKAHAN, KAUNLARAN (MAGSASAKA) PARTY-LIST, REPRESENTED BY ITS SECRETARY­ GENERAL, ATTY. GENERAL D. DU PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS AND SOLIMAN VILLAMIN, JR., RESPONDENTS.","Two petitions to deny due course were filed before the COMELEC against the Villamin MIP: one by Atty. Du,[6] and another by Irish Fajilagot Alfon, Sandy Pande Santos, Jeffrey D. Cortazar, Jayson Molina, John Christopher Alrey Buena (Alfon et al.).[7]

In the first petition, Atty. Du claimed that Villamin does not have any legal standing to sign or file an MIP on behalf of the Party and has made an untruthful statement in his MIP when he misrepresented himself as the National Chairperson of the Party. According to Atty. Du, Villamin is the former National Chairperson of MAGSASAKA who was voted out of MAGSASAKA's Council of Leaders and expelled from the organization due to anomalous activities akin to ponzi or pyramiding schemes involving DV Boer, Inc. (DV Boer), Villamin's family corporation. As a result, two provincial coordinators of MAGSASAKA lodged letter-complaints against Villamin, Soliman Villamin, Sr., Joselyn Villamin, Crisanto ""King"" Cortez (Cortez), Marianne Co, and Joseph Masacupan (Villamin et al.), who were also members of the Council of Leaders. On June 28, 2019, the Council of Leaders decided to conduct an investigation on the activities of DV Boer and appointed Lejun Dela Cruz (Dela Cruz) to investigate the matter.[8]

On November 3, 2019, Dela Cruz relayed to the Council of Leaders that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued an advisory against DV Boer, the Department of Agriculture was on the ""look-out"" for DV Boer, and there was public confusion on whether the members of MAGSASAKA and those behind DV Boer were one and the same. Based on the report, the Council of Leaders suspended Villamin et al. from the Council of Leaders until their names were cleared of any impropriety, illegality, or unethical behavior so as not to drag the name of the Party in the said activities.[9]

On December 21, 2019, MAGSASAKA held a General Assembly where the attending members were informed of the suspension of Villamin et al. from the Council of Leaders. This was immediately followed by an election of a new set of Council of Leaders. Atty. Du claimed that Villamin et al. were notified of the meeting, but Villamin disputed this, maintaining that only Cortez was notified. Villamin, believing that his group's ouster was substantially and procedurally infirm, reported the incident to the COMELEC.[10]

On June 26, 2021, the MAGSASAKA faction of Atty. Du (Du faction) held another General Assembly, elected a new set of Council Leaders, and expelled Villamin et al. from the Party due to their involvement in the DV Boer scam, and the issuance of a warrant of arrest against them for syndicated estafa.[11]

In the second petition, Alfon et al. averred that they filed complaints against Villamin for estafa, syndicated estafa, and violations of the Securities Regulations Code for collecting investments from the public despite not having the necessary license from the SEC. They claimed that Villamin's filing of the MIP puts the election process in mockery or disrepute.[12]

On November 25, 2021, the COMELEC First Division issued a Resolution[13] in favor of Villamin, finding that his removal was in violation of MAGSASAKA's Saligang Batas at Alituntunin ng Magkakasama sa Sakahan, Kaunlaran (Saligang Batas).[14] The COMELEC held that Villamin was neither notified of the meetings nor given a chance to refute the allegations against him contrary to the provisions of the Saligang Batas, thereby violating his right to due process. Even the general assemblies where he was suspended and expelled were not conducted in accordance with the Saligang Batas. Since MAGSASAKA failed to show that Villamin was validly suspended and eventually removed, he remained to be the National Chairperson when he filed his MIP.[15] The relevant portions of the assailed November 25, 2021 Resolution of the COMELEC First Division read:
Measured against these standards, We find that the procedure conducted by the faction of Petitioner Du in the suspension, removal from office, and replacement of Respondent [Villamin et al.] were not in accord with the procedure laid down in the Party's Saligang Batas at Alituntunin and were done in bad faith. Specifically, the procedure undertaken by the faction of Petitioner Du violated the right to due process guaranteed by the Saligang Batas at Alituntunin and the manner provided in Article VIII regarding the removal of elected party officials.[16]

....

All these show that Respondent [Villamin et al.] were not accorded their right to due process as inscribed in the Party's Saligang Batas at Alituntunin. Furthermore, the events leading to the suspension of Respondent [Villamin et al.] betray the bad faith of Petitioner Du s group. As such, We find that their suspension is invalid.[17]","While the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) has jurisdiction over intra-party leadership disputes, it cannot arrogate unto itself the interpretation of party rules contrary to the party's established practices and confer party leadership to someone whom the party has already expelled.

Before the Court is a Petition for Certiorari (with Application for Issuance of Writ of Preliminary Injunction, Status Quo Ante and/or Temporary Restraining Order)[1] filed by Magkakasama sa Sakahan, Kaunlaran (MAGSASAKA) Party-list (Party), represented by its Secretary General, Atty. General D. Du (Atty. Du). MAGSASAKA claims that the COMELEC committed grave abuse of discretion in issuing COMELEC First Division Resolution[2] dated November 25, 2021 and COMELEC En Banc Resolution[3] dated September 9, 2022 in the consolidated cases of SPP No. 21-002 (MIP) and SPP No. 21-003 (MIP).

MAGSASAKA is an organization duly accredited and registered by the COMELEC on January 17, 2019 as a regional party in Region III. For the May 9, 2022 National and Local Elections, two Manifestations of Intent to Participate (MIP) were filed under the name of MAGSASAKA. The first was filed by Atty. Du as MAGSASAKA Secretary General,[4] and the second by Soliman Villamin, Jr. (Villamin), claiming to be the MAGSASAKA National Chairperson (Villamin MIP).[5]","The Court is not persuaded.
 
Prior notice is not required under MAGSASAKA's Saligang Batas
 

Several members of the Court pointed out that nothing in the records show that Villamin was given prior notice of the expulsion proceedings against him, and that such omission was admitted by MAGSASAKA and Atty. Du. While such may be the case, the lack of prior notice did not render Villamin's removal as National Chairperson invalid.

Atienza v. COMELEC[87] tells us that the requirements of due process do not apply to the internal affairs of political parties. Being considered private organizations, the rights of party members are based on the organization's charter, which is a contract among party members.[88] Accordingly, the dispute within the party, in this case between MAGSASAKA and Villamin, should be resolved within the bounds of the party's charter, and not on any other consideration.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is GRANTED. The COMELEC First Division Resolution dated November 25, 2021 and the COMELEC En Banc Resolution dated September 9, 2022 in the consolidated cases of SPP No. 21-002 (MIP) and SPP No. 21-003 (MIP), finding Soliman Villamin, Jr. as the duly authorized representative to file the Manifestation of Intent to Participate (MIP) in the Party-List System of Representation for the 2022 National and Local Elections, and denying Magkakasama sa Sakahan, Kaunlaran (MAGSASAKA) Party-List's petition to deny due course to the said MIP are REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

CITY GOVERNMENT OF TAGUM, CITY ASSESSOR AND CITY TREASURER OF TAGUM, PROVINCE OF DAVAO DEL NORTE, RESPONDENTS.","This Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] seeks to reverse the twin dispositions of the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc in CTA EB No. 1930:
1)
Decision[2] dated June 30, 2020, affirming the dismissal of the Petition for Prohibition filed by petitioner National Food Authority (NFA) to enjoin respondents City Government of Tagum, its City Assessor and City Treasurer and the Province of Davao del Norte from collecting real property taxes in the total amount of PHP 2,643,816.53; and


2)
Resolution[3] dated November 4, 2021 denying NFA's motion for reconsideration.","Taxes cannot be charged against the Republic of the Philippines from which the power to tax emanates in the first place. For the ""power to destroy"" ought not be used against the very entity that wields it.","We reverse.

At the outset, We stress anew that the principle of local autonomy under the 1987 Constitution simply means decentralization. It does not make local governments sovereign within the state or an imperium in imperio.[71] They are bound by the following tax principles in the exercise of their constitutionally delegated power to tax:
a)
Under Article X, Section 5 of the 1987 Constitution, ""[e]ach local government unit shall have the power to create its own sources of revenues and to levy taxes, fees, and charges subject to such guidelines and limitations as the Congress may provide, consistent with the basic policy of local autonomy. Such taxes, fees, and charges shall accrue exclusively to the local governments.""


b)
The basic rationale for the current rule on local fiscal autonomy is the strengthening of LGUs and the safeguarding of their viability and self-sufficiency through a direct grant of general and broad tax powers. The fundamental law nevertheless did not intend the delegation to be absolute and unconditional. Its exercise in fact is subject to limitations, among them, (a) the taxpayer should not be over-burdened or saddled with multiple and unreasonable impositions; (b) the resources of the national government, too, should not be unduly disturbed; and (c) local taxation should be fair, uniform, and just.[72]


c)
Although the power to tax is inherent in the State, the same is not true for LGUs. While the mandate to impose taxes granted to LGUs is categorical and long established in the 1987 Philippine Constitution, the same is not all encompassing as it is subject to limitations as explicitly stated in Article X, Section 5 of the 1987 Constitution. Being mere creatures of the State, LGUs cannot defeat national policies through enactments of contrary measures. They are governmental agencies, the establishment of which did not divest the State of any of its sovereignty.[73]



Verily, ""[w]hen local governments invoke the power to tax on national government instrumentalities, such power is construed strictly against local governments. The rule is that a tax is never presumed and there must be clear language in the law imposing the tax. Any doubt whether a person, article or activity is taxable is resolved against taxation. This rule applies with greater force when local governments seek to tax national government instrumentalities.""[74]
This is not merely a tax policy but rooted in the very exercise of the inherent power of taxation of the national government—exemptions of agencies of government are recognized, i.e., the means or agencies selected by the government as necessary or convenient to the exercise of its functions cannot be subjected to the taxing power.[75] More, taxes are financial burdens imposed for the purpose of raising revenues with which to defray the cost of the operation of the Government, and a tax on property of the Government, whether national or local, would merely have the effect of taking money from one pocket to put it in another pocket.[76]

In MIAA,[77] the Court was more emphatic, thus, ""[t]he reason for the rule does not apply in the case of exemptions running to the benefit of the government itself or its agencies. In such a case the practical effect of an exemption is merely to reduce the amount of money that has to be handled by the government in the course of its operations. For these reasons, provisions granting exemptions to government agencies may be construed liberally, in favor of non-tax liability of such agencies. ""There is, moreover, no point in national and local governments taxing each other, unless a sound and compelling policy requires such transfer of public funds from one government pocket to another.""[78]

Even Section 133(o) of the Local Gov't Code,[79] as amended, recognizes the basic principle that local governments cannot tax the national government, which historically merely delegated to local governments the power to tax. While the 1987 Constitution now includes taxation as one of the powers of local governments, local governments may only exercise such power subject to such guidelines and limitations as the Congress may provide.[80]

More than being a mere transfer of funds from one pocket of the government to the other, as laid down in Basco v. PAGCOR,[81] the whole point why LGUs cannot tax the national government instrumentalities is they absolutely have no power by taxation or otherwise, to retard, impede, burden or in any manner control the operation of constitutional laws enacted by Congress to carry into execution the power vested in the [national government]. This doctrine emanates from the ""supremacy"" of the National Government over LGUs.[82] Otherwise, mere creatures of the State can defeat national policies [through] extermination of what local authorities may perceive to be undesirable activities or enterprise using the power to tax as ""a tool for regulation.""[83]","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated June 30, 2020 and Resolution dated November 4, 2021 of the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc in CTA EB No. 1930 are REVERSED.

LIBIRAN-METEORO, RESPONDENT.","Uy alleged that he was a representative of the Maliliw Lending Corporation. Sometime in the last quarter of 2012, Atty. Libiran-Meteoro accompanied her client Rowena Lopez (Lopez), to Maliliw Lending Corporation's office to assist Lopez in a transaction. Later on, Atty. Libiran-Metereo returned and applied for a personal loan herself which she promised to pay via post-dated checks. Relying on her representations that the post­dated checks will be good when they fall due, he agreed.[2]

Atty. Libiran-Meteoro thus issued three postdated checks in favor of Maliliw Lending Corporation, two of which are described as: (1) RCBC Savings Bank Check No. 1492854 dated March 14, 2013, in the amount of PHP 122,500.00; and (2) RCBC Savings Bank Check No. 1492855 dated April 14, 2013 in the amount of PHP 122,500.00 (subject checks). As it was, the subject checks got dishonored when they were deposited on their respective due dates, due to ""ACCOUNT CLOSED"" and ""DAIF"" or drawn against insufficient funds. He allegedly called Atty. Libiran-Meteoro's attention regarding the dishonored checks but his calls were ignored.[3]

He discovered that in 2014, Atty. Libiran-Meteoro had been suspended from the practice of law for six months for gross misconduct in Barrientos v. Atty. Libiran-Meteoro.[4] Despite this, she again committed acts constituting gross misconduct[5] and was not deterred from defrauding businesspersons like him. She allegedly continued to evade his calls, causing him damage in the amount of PHP 245,000.00.[6]",Complainant William S. Uy (Uy) charged respondent Atty. Elerizza A. Libiran-Meteoro (Atty. Libiran-Meteoro) with gross misconduct for issuing two bouncing checks and failing to pay her debt despite demands.[1],"First off, Members of the Bar are now governed by the new Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability (CPRA) which took effect on May 30, 2023. Notably, its provisions shall be applied to all pending and future cases, except where the same would not be feasible or would work injustice.[20] Though Atty. Libiran-Meteoro's acts were committed way back 2012, the provisions of the CPRA shall nonetheless serve as the metric to determine her administrative liability.

Lawyers are instruments for the administration of justice. As vanguards of our legal system, they are expected to maintain not only legal proficiency but also a high standard of morality, honesty, integrity, and fair dealing.[21] Thus, lawyers may be disciplined for any conduct, whether in their professional or in their private capacity, if such conduct renders them unfit to continue to be officers of the court.[22]   
 ","ACCORDINGLY, respondent Atty. Elerizza A. Libiran-Meteoro is found GUILTY of gross misconduct for her issuance of worthless checks, in violation of Canon II, Sections 1 and 2 of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability. She is DISBARRED from the practice of law and her name is ORDERED stricken off from the Roll of Attorneys, effective immediately.

She is also found GUILTY of violation of the IBP rules and issuances governing membership in the IBP for her failure to report the change in her residence or office address and is meted a FINE in the amount of PHP 35,000.00.

MACASAET, AND WILFREDO P. CU, PETITIONERS, VS. COMMISSION ON AUDIT, RESPONDENT.","In 1966, PNCC, formerly Construction Development Corporation of the Philippines (CDCP), was incorporated as a stock corporation pursuant to Batas Pambansa Blg. 68, otherwise known as the ""Corporation Code of the Philippines"" (Corporation Code). CDCP was engaged in the business of general construction.[4]

In 1977, CDCP was granted a franchise under Presidential Decree No. (PD) 1113 to construct, operate, and maintain toll facilities in the North Luzon Expressway (NLEX) and South Luzon Expressway (SLEX).[5] The franchise was effective for a period of 30 years from May 1, 1977,[6] or until May 1, 2007.[7]

During its operations, CDCP incurred substantial credit obligations from both private and government sources. However, CDCP could not settle its maturing credit obligations to several government financial institutions (GFIs) as they fell due.[8]

On February 23, 1983, then President Ferdinand E. Marcos issued Letter of Instruction (LOI) No. 1295 for the rehabilitation of CDCP and the conversion of its obligations to its creditor GFIs into equity in CDCP.[9] Following the debt-to-equity conversion, the government became the owner of 76.8% of the authorized capital stock of CDCP.[10] It was also renamed as PNCC to reflect the extent of the government's equity investment in CDCP.[11]

In 1986, then President Corazon Aquino issued Presidential Proclamation No. 50, creating the Asset Private Trust that shall take title to and possession of, conserve, provisionally manage, and dispose of government assets which have been identified for privatization,[12] including the government's equity shares in PNCC.[13] In relation thereto, then President Corazon Aquino issued Administrative Order (AO) No. 59, directing all executive agencies, offices, and instrumentalities of the government to take steps to dissolve government acquired-asset corporations which had not been disposed of to the private sector.[14]

Pursuant to the directive for the privatization of PNCC, several agreements were executed between PNCC and private entities for the eventual turn-over of PNCC's tollway operations in the NLEX, SLEX, and the Metro Manila Skyway.[15]

In anticipation of PNCC's turn-over of its tollway operations to private entities and the inevitable retrenchment or retirement of PNCC's officers and employees,[16] the PNCC Board of Directors (Board) passed several resolutions (collectively, Board Resolutions) for the payment of gratuity benefits to its directors and senior officers, as follows:
(1)
Resolution No. BD-028-2005 dated March 29, 2005, authorizing the grant of gratuity pay to the outgoing directors equivalent to one month gross remuneration for every year of continuous and uninterrupted service;


(2)
Board Resolution No. BD-031-2007 dated April 25, 2007, authorizing the creation of PNCC Retirement/Resignation/Gratuity Benefit Program [(Retirement Fund)] for Directors and Senior Officers. Under this Resolution, retirement gratuity [was] granted[,] in addition to retirement benefits, to Executive Directors such as President and [Chief Executive Officer] (CEO), Executive Vice-President (EVP), Senior Vice[-]President (SVP), Corporate Secretary and Assistant Corporate Secretaries and its Corporate Secretariat Staff;


(3)
Board Resolution No. BD-043-2007 dated August 30, 2007, creating a Board of Trustees of the PNCC Retirement Fund with the power and authority to approve full and partial payments and releases of advance payments of retirement gratuity to eligible beneficiaries or entitled members of the Board and Senior Management;


(4)
Board Resolution No. BD-019-2009 dated August 27, 2009, grant cash gratuity to [petitioner] Mr. Rolando L. Macasaet, former President and Chairman of the Board and its subsidiaries, and (to petitioner] Mr. Wilfredo P. Cu, former President of PNCC and PNCC Skyway Corporation and its subsidiaries; and


(5)
Resolution No. BD-031-2008 dated November 5, 2008, granting additional powers and duties to the [PNCC] BOD to re-align and distribute savings and other income from its budget to the retirement trust fund and implement payment of regular gratuity approved under [Board] Resolution No. BD-028-2005, as amended.[17]
On the basis of the Board Resolutions, PNCC paid gratuity benefits to Arthur N. Aguilar (Aguilar), Ma. Theresa T. Defensor (Defensor), Garth Noel P.E. Tolentino (Tolentino), Jeremy Z. Parulan (Parulan), Fermin S. Lusung (Lusung), Antonio T. Vilar[18] (Vilar), Marvin V. Paule (Paule), Enrique C. Cuejilo, Jr.[19] (Cuejilo, Jr.), Roy Eduardo T. Lucero (Lucero), Ottomama Marajom[20] Benito (Benito), Guillermo N. Hernandez (Hernandez), Abraham A. Puruganan (Puruganan), Rolando L. Macasaet (Macasaet), Wilfredo P. Cu (Cu), Segundo M. Gaston (Gaston), Manuel Luis C. Antonio (Antonio), and Jaime Manuel F. Armonio (Armonio) (collectively, gratuity recipients), in the total amount of PHP 90,748,975.21, from years 2007 to 2010.[21]

After the conduct of post-audit, the COA Audit Team issued ND No. 11-002-(2007-2010)[22] dated July 8, 2011, and disallowed the grant of gratuity benefits.[23] As stated in the ND, the disbursement was disallowed because it was contrary to COA Circular No. 85-55-A dated September 9, 1985, or the Amended Rules and Regulations on the Prevention of Irregular, Unnecessary, Excessive or Extravagant Expenditures or Uses of Funds and Property, as well as Section 2[24] of the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) Circular Letter No. 2002-2 dated January 2, 2002. It further stated that the disbursement was excessive and unreasonable because PNCC has been incurring losses from 2003 to 2006. In addition, the gratuity benefits were found to be extravagant, given that the members of the Board are only entitled to reasonable per diems under the law. Finally, the disbursement was disallowed for being illegal upon the finding that the Board had no authority to create the Retirement Fund.[25]","Before the Court is a Petition for Certiorari[1] (Petition) under Rule 64 in relation to Rule 65 of the Rules of Court assailing the Resolution No. 2020-479[2] of the Commission on Audit (COA).

The COA Proper did not act with grave abuse of discretion in sustaining the disallowance of the gratuity benefits in question and holding that petitioners are civilly liable to return the disallowed disbursements.

In petitions for certiorari assailing the findings of the COA Proper in disallowance cases, it is settled that Section 7,[74] Article IX-A of the 1987 Constitution and Section 2,[75] Rule 64 in relation to Rule 65, Section 1[76] of the Rules of Court limit the permissible scope of inquiry only to errors of jurisdiction or grave abuse of discretion.[77]

For the COA Proper to have acted with grave abuse of discretion, petitioners must show that COA Resolution No. 2020-479 is bereft of legal or evidentiary basis, was reached in a capricious or whimsical exercise of judgment, is in utter and blatant disregard of the applicable law and rules,[78] or was rendered arbitrarily or in disregard of the evidence on record.[79]

None of the foregoing circumstances are present in the case at bar. As further discussed below, the COA Proper judiciously exercised its discretion in issuing Resolution No. 2020-479. 
 
ND No. 11-002-(2007-2010) has already become final and executory as to Aguilar and Lusung because they failed to observe the procedure for appeal therefrom.
 

At the outset, it must be pointed out that both Aguilar and Lusung did not sign the Appeal Memorandum,[80] which questioned ND No. 11-002-(2007-2010) before the COA-CGS. Lusung appears to have initiated the appeal process only in the Petition for Review with the COA Proper[81] which he signed; meanwhile, Aguilar began his appeal process only in the present Petition, where his signature appears in the Verification and CNFS.[82] This means that both Aguilar and Lusung did not appeal the ND to the Director of the COA-CGS.

Pertinently, Sections 48 to 50[83] of PD 1445[84] (Government Auditing Code of the Philippines) provide the procedure for appeals from decisions of COA. Under Section 51 of the same law, ""[a] decision of the Commission or of any auditor upon any matter within its or his jurisdiction, if not appealed as herein provided, shall be final and executory."" Similarly, under Section 8,[85] Rule IV of the 2009 Revised Rules of Procedure of the COA, the decisions of COA auditors, as the authorized representatives[86] of the COA, shall become final upon the expiration of six (6) months from the date of receipt thereof, unless an appeal to the Director is taken within that period.

In view of the foregoing, ND No. 11-002-(2007-2010) must already be taken as final and executory against Aguilar and Lusung, given that they both failed to appeal the ND to the COA-CGS Director within the prescribed period.

In any case, even if the Court considers Aguilar and Lusung to have timely filed their appeal, the Court finds that the COA did not act with grave abuse of discretion in holding them civilly liable to return the disallowed disbursements under the ND No. 11-002-(2007-2010), as discussed below.

"A.C. No. 13842 (Formerly CBD Case No.18-5810), May 21, 2024","ATTY. WILFREDO GARRIDO, JR., COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. LORENZO G. GADON, RESPONDENT.","Garrido, Jr. seeks the disbarment of Gadon for allegedly: (1) engaging in falsehoods in an impeachment complaint filed by the latter before the House of Representatives in August 2017 and (2) filing baseless criminal cases against several Supreme Court employees. The particulars behind these allegations were summarized by the IBP-CBD as follows:[2]
[Gadon] filed [before the House of Representatives] an Impeachment Complaint dated August 2, 2017 against [then de facto] Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno [(Sereno)]. In his verification, he swore that the allegations therein [were] ""true and correct of his personal knowledge or based on authentic documents.""

In the Impeachment Complaint, [Sereno] purportedly falsified a Temporary Restraining Order [(TRO)] of the Supreme Court in G.R. No. 206844-45, by tampering and altering the contents of the draft TRO sent by [Associate] Justice [Teresita] [Leonardo-De Castro], [(Justice De Castro)] and pursuant thereof, issued a ""blanket TRO.""

During the hearing before the House Committee on Justice on November 22, 2017, Gadon disclosed that it was Manila Times reporter Jamar Canlas [(Canlas)], who confirmed the said information with [Justice De Castro]. He admitted that it was not based on his personal knowledge but rather from a secondary source. He likewise admitted that he has not seen the ""draft TRO"" nor a copy of the ""blanket TRO"" issued by [Sereno].

On the same day, Justice De Castro issued a statement categorically denying [Gadon's] claim.

On November 27, 2017, [Canlas] also denied, under oath that Justice De Castro was his source or that he disclosed such to [Gadon].

It was also raised in the [Impeachment] Complaint that [Sereno] instructed a Supreme Court official to call Judges Juanita Guerrero, Amelia Fabros-Corpuz, and Patria Manalastas-De Leon, to order them not to issue warrants of arrest against the accused Senator Leila De Lima in connection with the Information filed against the latter.

However, two of the above-mentioned Judges categorically denied the allegations before the Justice Committee during the hearing on February 19, 2017 [sic].

In a Press Conference on February 22, 2018, [Gadon] made a statement that ""[i]f CJ Sereno does not resign by March 1, 2018, he will file criminal charges against other Supreme Court officials."" [Garrido, Jr.] cited:

""Talagang idadamay ko lahat. This will be the end of their careers. Lahat ng pinaghirapan, lahat mawawala. Yan ay mangyayari dahil sa katigasan ng ulo ni Sereno.""

[Garrido, Jr.] asserts that [Gadon] knows for a fact that the criminal cases he threatens to file are groundless. [Gadon] himself claims that he will file such cases because of [Sereno's] stubbornness, and not because these criminal cases are meritorious.

In an interview, however, [Sereno] said that she will never resign. Hence, on March 12, 2018, [Gadon] filed graft charges against several court officials.
In retort, Gadon filed an Answer[3] downplaying the allegations against him for being vague and unsubstantiated. Gadon maintains that the complaint failed to provide ""a clear and concise statement of facts"" that he violated any norm of legal ethics.[4] He also argued that the claim that he made perjurious statements in the impeachment complaint is not valid since Garrido, Jr. himself was never present in any of the impeachment hearings conducted by the House Committee on Justice.[5]","This resolves the administrative Complaint[1] filed before the Integrated Bar of the Philippines – Commission on Bar Discipline (IBP-CBD) by complainant Atty. Wilfredo M. Garrido, Jr. (Garrido, Jr.) against respondent Atty. Lorenzo G. Gadon (Gadon).","The Court modifies the recommendation of the IBP-BOG.

Gadon Committed Perjury in the
Verification in his Impeachment
Complaint

We agree with the finding of the IBP-CBD that Gadon committed perjury in the verification of his impeachment complaint[14] against Sereno, a former de facto Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.

During the November 22, 2017 hearing of the House Committee on Justice, it was revealed that one of the allegations in the impeachment complaint—i.e., that the then Chief Justice Sereno falsified a TRO of the Supreme Court in G.R. Nos. 206844-45[15]—was not based on Gadon's personal knowledge or on any authentic records. Worse, it was further uncovered that such allegation was only founded on hearsay or based merely on what Gadon was told by a journalist. This is attested by the Records of Proceedings for the said hearing no less:
....
REP. LEACHON. Because for so long a time, I've been wondering how these things all happen that's why we have this hearing, Atty. Gadon.

MR. GADON. Yes, Your Honor.

REP. LEACHON. Yeah, I worked with ... I worked actually with ... at the Supreme Court for about four years of my life during the time that I was at my law school. Ang trabaho dyan...pagka well of course they will have their meeting division or [en] banc and then, of course, it is a [collegial] body and they will meet and they will agree on a certain point before the issuance of a resolution. Yung pinagkukwento mo doon sa mga... sa complaint mo na ... na merong desisyon iyong en banc, may desisyon iyong division meron nang napagkasunduan tapos iba and lalabas sa resolusyon. Those are internal matters, Atty. Gadon, of which no other party except members of the Supreme Court would have knowledge as to the occurrence of such meeting and as to the decision.

So, as for you to conclude, later on, that if the resolution that was released was entirely different from the decision that was reached by the en banc or by the division at nagkakaroon nga ng falsification in the sense that the group actually participated in an event of which iba ang nangyari pagkatapos and under the Revised Penal Code that is actually falsification.","ACCORDINGLY, the Court finds respondent Lorenzo G. Gadon GUILTY of Gross Misconduct which is punishable by DISBARMENT. However, in view of his disbarment in In Re: Atty. Lorenzo G. Gadon's Viral Video Against Raissa Robles, the said penalty shall no longer be imposed but shall nevertheless be recorded in his personal file pursuant to Canon VI, Section 42 of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability. Accordingly, and in view of his previous disbarment, a FINE in the amount of PHP 150,000.00 is imposed upon the respondent, which shall be paid within a period not exceeding three months from receipt of this Decision in accordance with Canon VI, Section 41 of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability. He is further directed to submit to this Court proof of payment within 10 days from said payment.

Moreover, in view of his earlier disbarment and being a repeat offender, the respondent is adjudged INELIGIBLE FOR JUDICIAL CLEMENCY.

In ND Nos. 11-027 (10) and 11-039, the grant of Transportation Allowance for CY 2010 and 2011, respectively, to job order contractors was disallowed because of the lack of approval from the Office of the President (OP). Additionally, the NDs cited that the grant was not in accordance with the Collective Negotiation Agreement (CNA) executed between the PhilHealth, ROV and the PhilHealth Insurance Corporation PHIC Employees Association because what was provided for in the CNA is the provision of shuttle services, and not cash assistance.[24]

The benefits in the rest of the assailed NDs were disallowed for lack of legal basis.[25]","This resolves the Special Civil Action for certiorari[1] (Petition) under Rule 65, in relation to Rule 64, with prayer for Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) and Writ of Preliminary Injunction (WPI) filed by petitioner Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) assailing the December 20, 2017 Decision No. 2017-422[2] of the Commission on Audit (COA) Commission Proper (CP) and its September 24, 2018 Resolution[3]. The COA CP affirmed with modification the June 10, 2014 Decision[4] of the COA Regional Office No. V Office of the Regional Director (COA ROV), which affirmed the 19 Notices of Disallowance (ND) addressed to the PhilHealth Regional Office No. V (ROV) covering the payment of various benefits and allowances to job order contractors and project-based contractors in the total amount of PHP 4,146,213.85.","The Petition is partly meritorious.

At the outset, the Court's review of COA decisions on a Rule 64 petition is limited to a review of jurisdictional errors or grave abuse of discretion. The Court's intervention is justified only when it is clearly shown that the COA acted without or in excess of jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.[55]

As held in Miralles v. Commission on Audit,[56] grave abuse of discretion exists when the assailed decision or resolution is not based on law and the evidence but on caprice, whim, and despotism, thus:
The Constitution vests the broadest latitude in the COA in discharging its role as the guardian of public funds and properties by granting it ""exclusive authority, subject to the limitations in this Article, to define the scope of its audit and examination, establish the techniques and methods required therefor, and promulgate accounting and auditing rules and regulations, including those for the prevention and disallowance of irregular, unnecessary, excessive, extravagant, or unconscionable expenditures or uses of government funds and properties."" In recognition of such constitutional empowerment of the COA, the Court has generally sustained the COA's decisions or resolutions in deference to its expertise in the implementation of the laws it has been entrusted to enforce. Only when the COA has clearly acted without or in excess of jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction has the Court intervened to correct the COA's decisions or resolutions. For this purpose, grave abuse of discretion means that there is on the part of the COA an evasion of a positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law or to act in contemplation of law, such as when the assailed decision or resolution rendered is not based on law and the evidence but on caprice, whim[,] and despotism.[57] (Emphasis supplied; citation omitted)
Absent this breach, the Court generally sustains the decisions of administrative authorities, especially one which is constitutionally created, such as the COA, not only on the basis of the doctrine of separation of powers but also for their presumed expertise in the laws they are entrusted to enforce.[58]
.
Here, the Petition failed to prove that the COA committed grave abuse of discretion in affirming the assailed NDs. Nevertheless, the Court must clarify the liability of the individuals identified in the NDs in light of jurisprudential guidelines.

PhilHealth's position is anchored on what it believes is its fiscal autonomy granted under Republic Act No. 7875.[59] According to PhilHealth, this grant has been confirmed by Opinions of the OGCC, letters from the OP, and legislative deliberations.[60]

However, the view that PhilHealth enjoys absolute authority to determine the grant of benefits and allowances to its employees had already been consistently rejected by the Court.

In the 2023 case of PhilHealth v. COA,[61] the Court had outlined case law settling the issue of the limits of the fiscal independence of PhilHealth. In the 2016 case of PhilHealth v. COA,[62] and reiterated in 2021 in PhilHealth v. COA,[63] the Court held that while Republic Act No. 7875 granted PhilHealth the liberty to fix the compensation of its personnel, it does not necessarily mean that PhilHealth has an unbridled discretion to issue any and all kinds of allowances, circumscribed only by the provisions of its charter.[64]

The Court thus held that PhilHealth is bound by the provisions of the Salary Standardization Law;[65] Presidential Decree No. 1597 on the requirement of Presidential approval for the grant of allowances, honoraria, and other fringe benefits;[66] Public Sector Labor-Management Council Resolution No. 4, Series of 2022 issued by the DBM, which requires qualifications to the grant of CNA incentives by government-owned and controlled corporations, such as PhilHealth;[67] and other prevailing rules and regulations issued by the OP and the DBM.[68]","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is PARTLY GRANTED. The Decision in COA Decision No. 2017-422, dated December 20, 2017, and the Resolution in COA CP Case No. 2014-572, dated September 27, 2018, are AFFIRMED WITH MODIFICATIONS, as follows:

"G.R. No. 259862, May 21, 2024 ","SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON AUDIT, RESPONDENT.","In 2012, the SSS-Luzon North Cluster received three Notices of Disallowance (ND) in relation to CNA incentives paid to its rank-and-file employees between 2005 and 2008, specifically:

ND No.
Benefit Subject of Disallowance
Amount (PHP)
2012-001-(2008)[4]
Additional CNA Incentives for 2008
3,626,505.53

Additional CNA Incentives for 2008
464,264.34
TOTAL
PHP 20,703,254.08

The COA CAR disallowed the CNA incentives due to the following reasons:

Firstly, the grant of incentives was contrary to Sections 5.7 and 7.1 of the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) Budget Circular (BC) No. 2006-01[7] in that there were excessive accruals of cash incentives for the years 2006 to 2008, which were then made the basis for paying additional cash incentives after revaluation of further savings made in 2009.[8]

Secondly, there were violations of Section 2 of Public Sector Labor-Management Council (PSLMC) Resolution No. 02, Series of 2003,[9] and of Sections 5.0, 6.1, 6.1.2 and 7.1.1 of DBM BC No. 2006-01.[10] In the disallowed grant, all the savings out of the Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) was the basis for computing the 80% allocation for cash incentives although these were not conclusively generated out of cost-cutting measures, as one of the conditions for the grant of cash incentives, and as identified in the CNA.[11]

Lastly, the COA Audit Team found that Section 6.1.3 of the DBM BC No. 2006-01[12] was also not followed because the maximum allocation of 80% out of the savings from MOOE was made the basis for computing cash incentives even if benefits in other forms were already being enjoyed by the rank-and-file employees.[13]

In addition to the three reasons stated, the COA CAR also disallowed the grant of CNA incentives for the year 2005 in ND No. 2012-002-(2010) because this form of incentive was not provided in the CNA[14] for this period, and thus, contrary to Section 5.1 of the DBM BC No. 2006-01.[15] Similarly, the conditions for the grant set in Section 3 of PSLMC Resolution No. 02, Series of 2003,[16] were not met in 2005 and 2007, which resulted in the irregular or excessive disbursement.[17]

The assailed NDs also required the return of the disallowed amounts by the recipients, the certifying officers, and the approving officers. Other than the payees, the persons determined to be liable in the various transactions were Luis V. Olais, for approving the payment; Myrna C. Lacsamana, for certifying that the supporting documents are proper and legal; and Daniel T. Caput, for certifying that funds are available.[18]","This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] (Petition) under Rule 64 filed by the Social Security System (SSS) seeking to annul and set aside the December 17, 2021 Decision[2] of the Commission on Audit (COA) Commission Proper (CP) in Decision No. 2021-425. The COA CP approved the April 5, 2016 Decision[3] of the COA Cordillera Administrative Region (COA CAR) in Decision No. 2016-014, which affirmed the disallowance of the grant of Collective Negotiation Agreement (CNA) incentives to the rank-and-file employees of the SSS-Luzon North Cluster, while modifying the total disallowed amount on account of computational error.","The Petition must fail.

At the outset, it must be emphasized that Rule 64 petitions assailing COA decisions are limited to a review by this Court of jurisdictional errors or claims of grave abuse of discretion.[41] This regard by the Court for the decisions of administrative authorities, especially those which are constitutionally created, such as the COA, is underpinned by the doctrine of separation of powers, as well as the recognition of the presumed expertise in the laws these administrative bodies are entrusted to enforce.[42]

The Court explained in Madera v. COA[43] that grave abuse of discretion exists when the assailed decision or resolution is not based on law and the evidence, but on caprice, whim, and despotism, thus:
The Constitution vests the broadest latitude in the COA in discharging its role as the guardian of public funds and properties. In recognition of such constitutional empowerment, the Court has generally sustained the COA's decisions or resolutions in deference to its expertise in the implementation of the laws it has been entrusted to enforce. Thus, the Constitution and the Rules of Court provide the remedy of a petition for certiorari in order to restrict the scope of inquiry to errors of jurisdiction or to grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction committed by the COA. For this purpose, grave abuse of discretion means that there is, on the part of the COA, an evasion of a positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law or to act in contemplation of law, such as when the assailed decision or resolution rendered is not based on law and the evidence but on caprice, whim[,] and despotism.[44] (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted).
This case must then be weighed against the same standard.

The Court finds that this Petition failed to prove that the COA committed grave abuse of discretion in affirming the assailed NDs. Hence, the Petition must be dismissed.

CV No. 114839.

In the assailed issuances, the CA directed the execution pending appeal of the Decision[4] dated October 28, 2019, rendered by Branch xxxx, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Quezon City in Criminal Case No. R-QZN-17-03746-CR insofar as it ordered XXX (petitioner) to extend future monthly support to AAA (private respondent) and their child BBB in the amount of PHP 15,000.00.","The petition has no merit.

In partially granting the motion for issuance of a writ of execution, the CA cited Rule 39, Section 2 of the Rules of Court in that an execution pending appeal requires three conditions; first, the prevailing party must file a motion therefor; second, there must be a good reason for the issuance of a writ of execution; and third, the good reason must be stated in a special order.[33]

In turn, the ""good reason"" relied upon by the CA in the first assailed Resolution was Rule 39, Section 4 of the Rules of Court. It reads:
SEC. 4. Judgments not stayed by appeal. — Judgments in actions for injunction, receivership, accounting and support, and such other judgments as are now or may hereafter be declared to be immediately executory, shall be enforceable after their rendition and shall not, be stayed by an appeal taken therefrom, unless otherwise ordered by the trial court. On appeal therefrom, the appellate court in its discretion may make an order suspending, modifying, restoring or granting the injunction, receivership, accounting, or award of support.

The stay of execution shall be upon such terms as to bond or otherwise as may be considered proper for the security or protection of the rights of the adverse party.
To recall, the CA explained that there are two types of support in the RTC Decision – future monthly support amounting to PHP 15,000.00 and support in arrears or the unpaid accumulated monthly support of PHP 15,000.00 ""to be reckoned from March 2013 up to the present."" Pursuant to its discretion, the CA held that the immediate execution of the judgment on future support was with a good reason. However, as to the support in arrears, the CA found that private respondent's justification, i.e., dire financial need, was not a good reason to execute the judgment pending appeal.[34] As stated in the first assailed Resolution:
Thus, the part of the RTC's judgment ordering [petitioner] to give monthly support of Php15,000.00 is immediately executory and enforceable as early as the rendition of said, judgment. Section 4, Rule 39, above-quoted constitutes enough ""good reason"" for an execution pending appeal for the grant of future support.","WHEREFORE, the Petition is DISMISSED.

"G.R. No. 262749, May 20, 2024","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. JJJ,* ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","In three Informations, accused-appellant was charged with Child Pornography under Section 4(a)[9] of RA 9775, in relation to RA 10175, committed as follows:

CR-HC No. 12991. The CA Decision affirmed with modification as to damages the Decision[3] dated April 30, 2019, of Branch xxxxxxxxxxx, Regional Trial Court[4] (RTC), xxxxxxxxxxx, Laguna in Criminal Case Nos. SC-22926, SC-22927, SC-22928, SC-22929, SC-22930, and SC-22931.

In Criminal Case Nos. SC-22927, SC-22930, and SC-22931, the RTC found JJJ (accused-appellant) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Qualified Trafficking in Persons, defined and penalized under Republic Act No. (RA) 9208,[5] as amended by RA 10364.[6]

In Criminal Case Nos. SC-22926, SC-22928, and SC-22929, the RTC dismissed the charges of Child Pornography, defined and punished under RA 9775,[7] in relation to RA 10175,[8] against the accused-appellant.","The appeal is dismissed.

Well settled is the rule that an appeal in a criminal case opens the entire case for review on any question including one not raised by the parties.[56] As such, an ""appeal confers the appellate court full jurisdiction over the case and renders such court competent to examine records, revise the judgment appealed from, increase the penalty, and cite the proper provision of the penal law.""[57]

With the foregoing, the Court affirms accused-appellant's conviction of Qualified Human Trafficking under RA 9208, as amended by RA 10364, and sustains the dismissal of the charges for Child Pornography under RA 9775, in relation to RA 10175, on the ground of double jeopardy.

However, Child Pornography is an offense separate and distinct from Qualified Human Trafficking and is not subsumed in the latter offense. The Court will elucidate hereunder for the guidance of the bench and bar. 
 
The CA is correct in affirming accused-appellant's conviction of Qualified Trafficking in Persons under RA 9208, as amended by RA 10364
 

Accused-appellant was charged with three (3) counts of Qualified Trafficking in Persons penalized under Section 4(a) RA 9208, as amended by RA 10364. Section 3(a) of RA 9208, as amended by RA 10364, defines Trafficking in Persons as follows:
SEC. 3. Definition of Terms. — As used in this Act: 
 
(a)
Trafficking in Persons — refers to the recruitment, obtaining, hiring, providing, offering, transportation, transfer, maintaining, harboring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders by means of threat, or use of force, or other fo1ms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the person, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person for the purpose of exploitation which includes at a minimum, the exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs.



The recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, adoption or receipt of a child for the purpose of exploitation or when the adoption is induced by any form of consideration for exploitative purposes shall also be considered as 'trafficking in persons' even if it does not involve any of the means set forth in the preceding paragraph.
On such score, Section 4(a) of the same law provides:
SEC. 4. Acts of Trafficking in Persons. — It shall be unlawful for any person, natural or juridical, to commit any of the following acts: 
 
(a)
To recruit, obtain, hire, provide, offer, transport, transfer, maintain, harbor, or receive a person by any means, including those done under the pretext of domestic or overseas employment or training or apprenticeship, for the purpose of prostitution, pornography, or sexual exploitation[.]
In light of the foregoing, the elements of Trafficking in Persons are: (1) the act of recruitment, obtaining, hiring, providing, offering, transportation, transfer, maintaining, harboring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders; (2) the means used include by means of threat, or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the person, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person; and (3) the purpose of trafficking includes the exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs.[58]","WHEREFORE, the appeal is DISMISSED. The Decision dated June 21, 2021 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 12991 is AFFIRMED. Accused-appellant JJJ is GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of three counts of Qualified Trafficking in Persons defined and penalized under Republic Act No. 9208, as amended by Republic Act No. 10364, in Criminal Case Nos. SC-22927, SC-22930 and SC-22931 filed with Branch xxxxxxxxxxx, Regional Trial Court, xxxxxxxxxxx, Laguna. She is sentenced to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and to PAY a FINE amounting to PHP 2,000,000.00 for each count. Further, she is also ORDERED to PAY each of the victims AAA, BBB, and CCC the amounts of PHP 500,000.00 as moral damages, and PHP 100,000.00 as exemplary damages.

All monetary awards shall earn the legal interest of 6% per annum from the date of the finality of this Decision until its full payment."
"G.R. No. 237638, May 20, 2024","BGS REALTY, INC., REPRESENTED BY ITS ATTORNEY-IN-FACT MIGUEL ANGELO SARTE SILVERIO, PETITIONER, VS. DEMETRIO AYDALLA AND HEIRS OF JOSE AYDALLA, RESPONDENTS.","The case involved agricultural lots designated as Lot Nos. 4064-A and 4064-B (collectively, subject lots) with areas of about 2.2040 and 0.3002 hectares, respectively, located at Kilikao, Daraga, Albay, which were subjected to the coverage of the Operation Land Transfer (OLT) Program.[4]

Records reveal that in 1972, petitioner acquired the subject lots, together with other lots having an aggregate area of 63 hectares, from Porfirio Vda. De Los Baños, Inc.[5]

Sometime in 1973, petitioner applied for the conversion of the subject lots into non-agricultural use, and thus, identified the tenants who would be given disturbance compensation and home lots in lieu of displacement or ejectment. Eight tenants, among whom were Demetrio Aydalla (Demetrio) and Jose Aydalla (Jose) (collectively, respondents), filed a case for specific performance before the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudicatory Board (DARAB) for determination of disturbance compensation. The case was resolved in 1984 in their favor. Consequently, Certificate of Land Transfer (CLT) Nos. 0-5798 and 0­-0526697 and Emancipation Patent (EP) Nos. 148144 and 018918 were issued in favor of Demetrio and Jose, respectively.[6]

The details of the EPs are as follows:


Lot No.
EP No.
Status
1. Demetrio
4064-A
A-148144
--
2. Jose
4064-B
A-018918
Registered on February 4, 1989.[7]

On February 18, 1998, petitioner filed a Petition[8] for declaration of nullity of CLT Nos. 0-5798 and 0-0526697 and EP Nos. 148144 and 018918 (nullity case) with the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) – Agrarian Reform Regional Office for Region V (DARRO-V) against respondents.

On October 15, 1998, petitioner filed an amended petition[9] against Demetrio and the heirs of Jose and sought the following reliefs:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, it is respectfully prayed that after due investigation and hearing, decision be made:

a. Declaring as nullity OLT Nos. 0-05798 and 0-0526697 issued to respondents Demetrio Aydalla and Jose Aydalla;

b. To cancel emancipation patents Nos. 148144 and 018918, for Demetrio Aydalla and Jose Aydalla, respectively, generated by the Provincial Agrarian Reform Office of the DAR, Province of Albay, and to declare the same as without force and effect;

c. Declaring the status of respondents as recognized tenants-beneficiaries of the DAR to be null and void and without force and effect;

d. That a declaration of non-tenancy relationship between Respondents and Petitioner be issued.
Likewise, petitioner prays for such other relief as may be just and equitable under the premises.[10] (Emphasis omitted)
Thereafter, Demetrio filed a Motion to Dismiss[11] dated November 5, 1998, on the grounds of prescription, DARRO-V's lack of jurisdiction, and res judicata.

According to Demetrio, the issues raised in the petition had already been settled in CAR Case No. 782[12] between Luis Los Baños, the previous owner, and Ceferino Aydalla, their father. Considering that the petition was filed one year after the EPs were issued and registered in their name, Demetrio argued that the case no longer concerned the implementation of agrarian reform matters, and thus, it fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of the DARAB.[13]","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari (Under Rule 45)[1] which seeks the reversal of the Decision[2] dated June 15, 2017, of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 137366 denying the petition for review filed by BGS Realty, Inc. (petitioner), represented by its attorney-in-fact Miguel Angelo Sarte Silverio. Likewise assailed in the petition is the CA's Resolution[3] dated January 29, 2018, denying petitioner's motion for reconsideration.","The petition is bereft of merit.

The Order dated May 9, 2000, is merely an interlocutory order that could not have fully disposed of the nullity case


A reading of the fallo of the Order dated May 9, 2000, reveals that Regional Director Andres merely gave due course to the petition for declaration of nullity of CLTs, viz.:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, Order is hereby issued GIVING DUE COURSE to the petition for the declaration of nullity of CLTs issued to tenants covering lot 4064-A and lot 4064-B.

SO ORDERED.[47] (Emphasis supplied)
To stress, the above fallo only states that the Order was issued ""giving due course"" to the petition, not that it was granting the petition or nullifying the CLTs and EPs in question.

It is settled that an interlocutory order deals with preliminary matters, i.e., the Motion to Dismiss and the Opposition to Motion to Dismiss. In other words, it is not a judgment on the merits. The Order dated May 9, 2000, being interlocutory, cannot attain finality because, by its very nature, it may be modified or rescinded upon sufficient grounds at any time before final judgment;[48] likewise, it is not subject to execution. Consequently, the Order dated July 28, 2000, which affirmed in toto the Order dated May 9, 2000, is likewise only an interlocutory order and thus not subject to appeal.[49]

Although Regional Director Andres stated that the subject lots are no longer within the sphere of the OLT Program, it is also worth noting that nowhere in the body of the Order dated May 9, 2000, did Regional Director Andres declare that respondents' CLTs and EPs are null and void.

It is settled that where there is conflict between the fallo and the body of a decision, it is the fallo that controls regardless of what appears in the body of the decision as it is the fallo that ""invests rights upon the parties, sets conditions for the exercise of those rights, and imposes corresponding duties or obligation.""[50]

To the Court's mind, it is immaterial whether Regional Director Andres intended to nullify respondents' CLTs and EPs when he issued the Order dated May 9, 2000, for it is the fallo, not the body of the decision, that is the subject of an order of execution. Hence, respondents aptly pointed out that there is nothing to execute on the Order dated May 9, 2000, because it contains no order of cancellation of the CLTs and EPs.[51]

Assuming arguendo that the Order dated May 9, 2000, is a judgment on the merits, the petition still fails.

There are four exceptions to the doctrine of immutability of judgment: (1) the correction of clerical errors; 2) nunc pro tunc entries which causes no prejudice to any party; (3) void judgments; and (4) supervening events.[52]","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is hereby DENIED. The Decision dated June 15, 2017, and the Resolution dated January 29, 2018, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 137366 are AFFIRMED."
"G.R. Nos. 264919-21, May 20, 2024","GLORIA MARIS SHARK'S FIN RESTAURANT, INC., PETITIONER, VS. PACIFICO Q. LIM, RESPONDENT.","Respondent Pacifico Q. Lim (Lim) is engaged in construction, as well as in the restaurant business. He avers that prior to the establishment of Gloria Maris, he already concocted the name ""Gloria Maris Shark's Fin Restaurant."" He further claims that he had already thought of the logo, which shall be a fin of a shark enclosed in a plate of irregular shape.[10]

Thus, in 1993, Lim allegedly offered a proposal to the owners of a restaurant located on the premises of the Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP), which, as Lim claimed, was about to go out of business.[11]

After several meetings, ""Gloriamaris Shark's Fin Restaurant Inc."" was registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on January 26, 1994,[12] by the following incorporators: Dominador B. Menguito (Menguito), Pedro O. Manalo, Lorenzo Q. Dy, Edmundo L. Tan, and respondent Lim.[13]

Gloria Maris avers that a graphic artist was hired to submit a sample drawing of the Gloria Maris trademark. After the approval of the said trademark, the Board of Directors entrusted to Lim the trademark's registration with the IPO.[14]

However, it was only in 2005 or more than 10 years after Gloria Maris' registration with the SEC, that three trademarks were registered with the IPO: ""GLORIA MARIS WOK SHOP & DESIGN"" on August 28, 2005,[15]""GLORIA MARIS DIMSUM KITCHEN WITH LOGO AND DESIGN"" on August 28, 2005,[16] and ""GLORIA MARIS SHARK'S FIN RESTAURANT AND LOGO"" on October 31, 2005.[17] All these trademarks, however, were registered in the name of Lim as the owner.

Thereafter, Lim ventured into franchising where he was able to franchise the concept of Gloria Maris restaurant to several companies.[18]

Gloria Maris allegedly discovered, that contrary to what they had thought, the registration of the trademark entrusted to Lim was registered in his own name and after he had left the company.[19]

On December 4, 2009, Gloria Maris filed separate petitions to cancel Trademark Registration Nos. 4-2004-009149,[20] 4-2004-009150,[21] and 4- 2004-009151.[22]","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court filed by petitioner Gloria Maris Shark's Fin Restaurant, Inc. (Gloria Maris), assailing the Decision,[2] dated March 18, 2022, and the Resolution,[3] dated December 19, 2022, of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP Nos. 162466, 162467 and 162468. The assailed Decision reversed the separate Decisions, all dated August 6, 2019, issued by the Office of the Director General (ODG) of the Intellectual Property Office (IPO) in Appeal Nos. 14-2012-0009,[4] 14-2012-0010,[5] and 14-2012-0011.[6]  The assailed Decision reinstated the separate Decisions, all dated February 23, 2012, of the Bureau of Legal Affairs (BLA) of the IPO in Decision Nos. 2012-32,[7] 2012- 33,[8] and 2012-34.[9]","In its Petition, Gloria Maris asserts that the later use and registration by Lim is unlawful.[41] Gloria Maris insists that Lim is not the owner of the ""Gloria Maris"" mark and trade name.[42] Finally, it claims that it is not estopped from asking for the cancellation of Lim's registrations since the subject trademarks were obtained in bad faith.[43]

In his Comment,[44] Lim maintains that he is the owner of the trademarks. He echoes the ruling of the CA that the evidence adduced by Gloria Maris failed to overcome the presumption that he is the prima facie owner of the trademarks.[45] Moreover, laches had set in against Gloria Maris.[46]

Gloria Maris, in its Reply,[47] counters that Lim's registration is only prima facie evidence of his ownership of the registered trademarks. Hence, the said trademarks may still be canceled since these were made in bad faith. Therefore, Gloria Maris is not estopped from assailing its validity.[48]

Gloria Maris further argues that the evidence that  it presented constituted substantial evidence to establish that it owns the trademark ""Gloria Maris.""[49]

The Petition is meritorious.

Before delving into the merits, the Court notes that the apparently confusing similarity between Gloria Maris' trade name and the trademarks registered by Lim is not at issue in this case, as aptly determined by the ODG.[50] The sole issue in this case is the propriety of Lim's registration of the subject marks.

As a general rule, a petition for review on certiorari filed under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court should only and strictly involve questions of law. However, intellectual property disputes, especially when it comes to trademarks, are highly factual in nature and require a review of the evidence presented by the parties. Moreover, among the exceptions to the rule is when, as in the present case, the findings of the ODG and the CA are conflicting.[51]

In relation to this, proceedings before the IPO are administrative in nature. Therefore, they are governed by the principles and doctrines of the law on administrative adjudication.[52] Consequently, the quantum of proof required in intellectual property cases is substantial evidence, or evidence a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. Furthermore, administrative agencies are not bound by the technical rules of procedure that are usually applicable in courts of law.[53] Indeed, the primordial purpose of the rules of procedure is to facilitate the attainment of justice, rather than its frustration. It should never be used to defeat the substantive rights of any party.[54]

On appeal before the ODG, Gloria Maris submitted, among others, its Bureau of Internal Revenue Certificate of Registration under the name of ""Gloriamaris Shark's Fin Restaurant,"" the registration date of which is dated March 17, 1997.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari filed by petitioner Gloria Maris Shark's Fin Restaurant, Inc. is GRANTED. The Decision dated March 18, 2022, and the Resolution, dated December 19, 2022, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP Nos. 162466, 162467 and 162468 are REVERSED.

Consequently, the following Certificates of Registration in the name of Pacifico Q. Lim are ordered CANCELLED:
1. Certificate of Registration No. 4-2004-009149 for GLORIA MARIS WOK SHOP AND DESIGN;

2. Certificate of Registration No. 4-2004-009150 for GLORIA MARIS DIMSUM KITCHEN WITH LOGO; and

RODOLFO DACALOS, JR., RESPONDENTS.","The instant Complaint is an offspring of a 1997 labor case filed by complainants against Timothy Bakeshop, a sole proprietorship. In 1999, the labor arbiter (LA) rendered a Decision in favor of complainants. On appeal, the NLRC affirmed the LA ruling with modification, increasing the monetary awards due to complainants. The Rule 65 Petition filed by Timothy Bakeshop to the Court of Appeals was dismissed in 2008. Records reveal that Timothy Bakeshop no longer appealed to the Court; hence, the NLRC ruling attained finality.[2]

Respondents, then entered their appearance at the execution stage as counsels of Timothy Bakeshop before the LA wherein they filed a Motion to Stay Execution of Judgment and to Declare the Proceedings of the Case Null and Void. Said Motion was denied. Aggrieved, respondents, on behalf of Timothy Bakeshop, filed an Appeal to the NLRC but the same was also denied. Respondents then filed a Rule 65 Petition for Certiorari before the CA, which was, however, likewise denied in a Decision dated July 31, 2015. In its ruling, the CA held, among others, that ""it is worth reiterating that [Timothy Bakeshop, through respondents] had apparently employed dilatory tactics by filing numerous pleadings and motions notwithstanding the fact that the case had already attained finality."" The CA then went on to say that ""Under the circumstances, [Timothy Bakeshop's] recourse cannot but be regarded as dilatory move. It must be borne in mind that an abuse of the judicial process is a blatant mockery of justice.""[3]

Citing the foregoing observations of the CA, complainants filed the instant administrative disciplinary case against respondents, praying that: (a) they be spared from the endless delays and suffering in their quest for justice; and (b) respondents be properly disciplined and stopped from endlessly subverting the administration of justice through abuse of judicial processes.[4]

For their defense, respondents averred that despite the filing and the pendency of the actions taken by respondents, complainants have succeeded in having the Decision executed and fully satisfied. The real properties of respondents' clients were levied, auctioned, and the titles of the lots were ultimately transferred to the complainants names. Hence, it was wrong for complainants to say that respondents' actions delayed or impeded the execution of the Decision. Further, respondents insisted that Jane Kyamko (Kyamko), the owner of Timothy Bakeshop, went to them for help as to the alleged forged Complaint by complainants. According to Kyamko, complainants confessed to her that they did not actually file the Complaint in the labor case. Respondents believed that Kyamko had a valid grievance.[5]","For the Court's resolution is an administrative Complaint[1] dated October 15, 2015 filed by complainants Inocentes Domie Balansag, Joel Molejon, and Bonifacio Catarata (complainants) against respondents Atty.

While it is true that respondents indeed owe fidelity to the cause of his client and is expected to serve the latter with competence and diligence, professional rules, however, impose limits on a lawyer's zeal and hedge it with necessary restrictions and qualifications.[10] Lawyers are required, under the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability (CPRA), to assist in the speedy and efficient administration of justice.[11] Furthermore, lawyers are required to observe fairness and obedience to the law.[12]

In this regard, case law instructs that a lawyer does not have an unbridled right to file pleadings, motions, and cases, as he or she pleases[13] as limitations thereto may be inferred from, inter alia, Canon II, Sections 2 and 5, and Canon III, Sections 2 and 7, all of which respectively read:

It likewise asserted ownership over the properties, contending that such acquisition was necessary for the improvement of the electricity transmission system.[11]

Consequently, the property owners resorted to filing the Complaint to compel TRANSCO to exercise its power of eminent domain and to pay just compensation over the subject properties.[12] In response, TRANSCO filed its Answer with Special and Affirmative Defenses and Counterclaim[13] seeking the dismissal of the Complaint for lack of merit.

Following this, the property owners filed a Motion to Require Defendant to Comply with Republic Act No. 10752. They averred that TRANSCO should be ordered to deposit to the court a provisional amount equivalent to the current zonal valuation of the subject properties from the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR). TRANSCO then filed its Comment/Opposition alleging that the Complaint was not covered by Republic Act No. 10752. Assuming that the law would be applicable, TRANSCO argued that the requirement of depositing 100% of the value of the property should be based on its value at the time of taking.[14]

Meanwhile, a Motion for Partial Withdrawal of Complaint was filed by the heirs of Rosario P. Plata, which the RTC later granted in its October 12, 2020 Order.[15]

In its October 13, 2020 Resolution,[16] the RTC granted the Motion to Require Defendant to Comply with Republic Act No. 10752 and ordered TRANSCO to deposit to the Clerk of Court, an amount equivalent to 100% of the subject properties' value based on the current relevant zonal valuation of the BIR, in the amount of PHP 138,448,000.00. TRANSCO moved for reconsideration but was denied by the RTC.[17]

Afterwards, TRANSCO filed a Manifestation with Motion to Archive and, later, a Motion for Leave to Implead Indispensable Party. In both Motions, TRANSCO prayed that NGCP be impleaded as an indispensable party and requested that the case be archived pending NGCP's inclusion.[18]

In its July 26, 2021 Resolution,[19] the RTC denied both Motions for lack of merit, viz.:

The prior Petition sought to reverse the Resolution[4] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) denying TRANSCO's Motion to Archive and Motion for Leave to Implead Indispensable Party, as well as its Resolution denying its Motion for Reconsideration.

The present controversy arose from a Complaint[5] filed by Clemente P. Untiveros, spouses Jose and Teodora Pagcaliwagan, Lucila M. Plata, the heirs of Juan and Geronima Torres, spouses Leonisa and Natalio Lopez, spouses Bernardo and Anita Pagcaliwagan (collectively, Untiveros et al.), along with the heirs of Rosario P. Plata, for inverse condemnation under Rule 67 of the Rules of Court, in connection with Republic Act No. 10752,[6] against TRANSCO before the RTC. They claimed to be the registered owners of seven parcels of land located in Barangay Bucal, Batangas City (subject properties) which were affected by the Batangas-Makban 230KV Transmission Line owned by TRANSCO.[7]

TRANSCO is a government-owned and controlled corporation created under Republic Act No. 9136,[8] tasked with the operation and maintenance of the nationwide power transmission system. Significantly, these functions were turned over to the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP) on January 15, 2009, following the enactment of Republic Act No. 9511[9] and the execution of the Concession Agreement[10] among the Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation (PSALM), TRANSCO, and NGCP.","We find merit in this Petition.

Time and again, this Court has underscored that the right to file a special civil action of certiorari is neither a natural right nor a fundamental aspect of due process.[37] It is a prerogative writ, never demandable as a matter of right, but is issued solely based on judicial discretion.[38] Hence, an individual who seeks a writ of certiorari must strictly adhere to the provisions of the Rules and the law.[39] Undoubtedly, the observance of these procedural rules is paramount, as these were designed to facilitate the adjudication of cases and to address the issue of delays in the administration of justice.[40]

Nevertheless, if strict adherence to the rules of procedure would hinder rather than aid in the administration of justice, especially in instances where the circumstances of the case underscore the need for substantive justice, this Court may relax the application of these procedural rules in the exercise of its equity jurisdiction.[41] To put it simply, this Court has the discretion to relax the application of procedural rules for compelling reasons to alleviate a litigant from an injustice that is disproportionate to their procedural lapses.[42]

After a perusal of the records, it is evident that petitioner failed to comply with certain procedural requirements in its Petition before the CA, particularly Rule 46, Section 3[43] in relation to Section 2,[44] and Rule 65, Section 4[45] of the Rules of Court. However, considering the exceptional circumstances brought about by the pandemic, along with the substantial merits of the case, this Court deems it proper to relax the rules and proceed to resolve the case on its merits.

At the crux of this controversy is whether the RTC committed grave abuse of discretion in denying petitioner's Motion to Archive and the Motion for Leave to Implead Indispensable Party.

Turning Our attention first to the denial of the Motion to Archive, it is relevant to revisit Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) Circular No. 89-2004,[46] which echoed the guidelines in OCA Circular No. 7-A-92[47] regarding the archiving of cases, thus:
II. CIVIL CASES

In ci vii cases, the court may, motu proprio or upon motion, order that a civil case be archived only in the following instances:

(a) When the parties are in the process of settlement, in which case the proceedings may be suspended and the case archived for a period not exceeding ninety (90) days. The case shall be included in the trial calendar on the day immediately following the lapse of the suspension period.

(b) When an interlocutory order or incident in the civil case is elevated to and is pending resolution/decision for an indefinite period before a higher court which has issued a temporary restraining order or writ of preliminary injunction.

(c) When defendant without fault or neglect of plaintiff, can not be served with summons within six (6) months from issuance of original summons.
From the foregoing, We concur with the keen observations of the RTC that the ground raised by petitioner, i.e., the pending inclusion of an indispensable party 1s not among those instances that would warrant the archiving of civil cases. Given this fact, this Court affirms the RTC's denial of the Motion to Archive.

Next, to address the matter regarding the denial of the Motion for Leave to Implead Indispensable Party, it becomes imperative to ascertain if NGCP is an indispensable party in the subject case for inverse condemnation.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is GRANTED. The Resolutions dated June 16, 2022 and March 16, 2023 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 171508 are REVERSED. Let the case be REMANDED to the court of origin for the inclusion of National Grid Corporation of the Philippines as an indispensable party, and to proceed with the case with dispatch."
"G.R. No. 244071, May 15, 2024","SHIELA MARIE B. CAFRANCA AND MA. JOSEPHINE B. CAFRANCA, PETITIONERS, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","Petitioners were charged with homicide in relation to Article 4(1) of the Revised Penal Code for the death of Oscar Duran (Oscar). The accusatory portion of the Information reads:
That on or about the 23rd day of March 2011, in the City of Muntinlupa, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring and confederating together and mutually helping and aiding one another, threaten victim OSCAR DURAN y DEL CARMEN then 76 years old, with the infliction upon his person of a wrong amounting to a crime that is, by attempting to hit him with a steel chair and, thereafter, shouting invective or slanderous words such as 'Putang ina mong matanda ka, ididimanda kita', 'Matanda ka na walang pinagkatandaan', and such other words of similar import, which thus threatened and caused irritation or annoyance on the said victim; that as a direct, natural and logical consequences of such threatening acts and vexations or annoying words uttered by the herein accused against Oscar Duran, the latter suffered heart seizure or Cardiorespiratory arrest which directly caused his untimely death.

Contrary to law.[6]
On arraignment, petitioners pleaded not guilty.[7] Trial on the merits ensued thereafter.","The barking of a dog in the dead of night caused a heated verbal tussle between neighbors, ending in the death of one and the incarceration of four. The family of the departed seeks retribution, while those incarcerated plead innocence.

The Court is once again tasked to determine whether guilt beyond reasonable doubt has been established in these consolidated Petitions for Review on Certiorari[1] emanating from the same factual backdrop in appeal of the Decision[2] (Assailed Decision) and Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA). The CA affirmed the Decision[4] of the Regional Trial Court of Muntinlupa (RTC), finding petitioners Shiela Marie Cafranca y Bello (Shiela), Raymark Velasco (Mamark), Carlito Orbiso y Abique (Carla), and Ma. Josephine Cafranca y Bello (Majo) (collectively, petitioners) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of homicide under Article 249 in relation to Article 4(1) of the Revised Penal Code.[5]","At the outset, it is noted that the consolidated Petitions raise questions of fact, which are generally beyond the purview of an appeal by certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.[40] The issue of whether the prosecution was able to prove beyond reasonable doubt that petitioners committed the alleged felonious acts and that said acts resulted in the death of Oscar requires Us to re-examine the evidence on record. Clearly, these are questions of fact.

Concededly, jurisprudence has established exceptions to said rule, such as when the trial court ignored, misunderstood, or misconstrued cogent facts and circumstances of substance which, if considered, would alter the outcome of the case.[41] Petitioners insist that this case falls under said exception.[42]

The contention is well-taken.

Praeter Intentionem

Criminal liability is incurred by any person committing a felony although the wrongful act be different from that which is intended. This is embodied in Article 4(1) of the Revised Penal Code, which provides:
Criminal Liability. — Criminal liability shall be incurred:

1. By any person committing a felony (delito) although the wrongful act done be different from that which he intended.
In order that a person may be criminally liable for a felony different from that which the offender intended to commit, it is indispensable that (a) that a felony was committed; and (b) that the wrong done to the aggrieved person be the direct consequence of the crime committed by the offender.[43]

One who commits an intentional felony is responsible for all the consequences which may naturally or logically result therefrom, whether foreseen or intended or not. The rationale of the rule is found in the doctrine, el que es causa de la causa es causa del mal causado, or the person who is the cause of the cause is the cause of the evil caused.[44] Thus, the Court has held that even if the victim is suffering from an internal ailment, there is criminal liability if the act of the accused is the efficient cause of death, accelerated the death, or the proximate cause of death.[45]

Guided by the foregoing principles, We now resolve the present case.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petitions are GRANTED. The Decision dated February 28, 2018 and the Resolution dated January 15, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 38832 are MODIFIED.

GUT-OMEN, EDWARD B. LIKIGAN, SOLEDAD THERESA F. WANAWAN, JEROME M. FALINGAO, ABDON A. IMINGAN AND RONALD C. KIMAKIM, ACCUSED-APPELLANTS.","In his Complaint dated January 24, 2007, Harry C. Dominguez (Dominguez), then a gubernatorial candidate in the Mountain Province, charged the now-deceased Maximo B. Dalog,[7] then Governor of Mountain Province, Pagteilan, Kollin, Gut-omen, Likigan, Emilio B. Pinangga, and Wanawan with violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019 and violation of Republic Act No. 9184, relative to the procurement of one unit of Mitsubishi van in the amount of PHP 1,000,000.00.[8] Dominguez averred that the bidding was rigged since no public bidding actually took place, there was no posting on the Government Electronic Procurement System (GEPS), the vehicle was purchased from an unauthorized dealer, and there was no transparency in the procurement because there was no consistency in the identification of the source of the funds. The case was docketed as OMB-L-C-07-0106-A.

In its Resolution[9] dated March 25, 2009, Graft Investigation & Prosecution Officer Judy Anne Doctor-Escalona recommended the dismissal of the charges against therein respondents. As evidenced by the documents submitted by the complainant, the Office of the Ombudsman (OMB) found that a public bidding had, in fact, taken place for the procurement of the vehicle in question. Relative to the posting requirement on GEPS, the OMB, however, found that the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) failed to post on GEPS, however, there was no internet access or service provider in Bontoc, Mountain Province, at the time the bidding was conducted, thus, preventing them from complying with this requirement. As for the source of the funds, since the National Government deposited the funds in the general fund account of the provincial government of Mountain Province, the indication of ""general fund"" as the source of the funding was not erroneous. With respect to the allegation that the vehicle was overpriced, the OMB held that complainant failed to support the charge since he did not provide canvass sheets indicating the specifications of the items which should match those items subject to the alleged overpricing. More, the quotation submitted by complainant from Motorplaza, Inc. in the amount of PHP 781,000.00 was only for the Mitsubishi L-300 Versa Van, excluding expenses for the ambulance equipment and accessories. The OMB further found that complainant failed to prove that Ronhil Trading, Inc. was an unauthorized dealer. Ultimately, the OMB concluded that complainant failed to specify the acts indicating corrupt practices to prove that there was indeed a violation of Republic Act No. 3019.[10]

Thereafter, Dominguez filed another Letter-Complaint dated February 5, 2007 requesting the National Bureau of Investigation-Cordillera Administrative Region (NBI-CAR) to investigate the allegations of anomalous transactions regarding the purchase of one unit of Mitsubishi L-300 Versa Van (subject vehicle), the same vehicle subject of the investigation of the OMB. Implicated in this charge were Dalog, Marrero, Lizardo, Macli-ing, Pagteilan, Kollin, Gut-omen, Likigan, Wanawan, Falingao, Imingan, and Pachingel, who were all officials and employees of the Provincial Government of Mountain Province; together with Kimakim, as the owner/proprietor of Ronhil Trading, Inc. from which the subject vehicle was purchased.[11]","These Appeals[1] assail the following dispositions of the Sandiganbayan in SB-17-CRM-1495:
Decision[2] dated March 24, 2023 convicting accused-appellants Theodore B. Marrero (Marrero),[*] Nenita D. Lizardo (Lizardo), Helen K. Macli-ing (Macli-ing), Paulo P. Pagteilan (Pagteilan), Lily Rose T. Kollin (Kollin), Florence R. Gut-omen (Gut-omen), Edward B. Likigan (Likigan), Soledad Theresa F. Wanawan (Wanawan), Jerome M. Falingao (Falingao), Abdon A. Imingan (Imingan), Ronald C. Kimakim (Kimakim), and Abelard T. Pachingel (Pachingel)[3] (collectively, accused-appellants) for violation of Section 3(e)[4] of Republic Act No. 3019, as amended;[5] and

Resolution[6] dated June 13, 2023 denying their respective motions for reconsideration.","We acquit.

Violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019 requires the following elements: (1) the accused must be a public officer discharging administrative, judicial, or official functions; (2) he or she must have acted with manifest partiality, or evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence; and (3) his or her action caused undue injury to any party, including the Government, or gave any private party unwarranted benefits, advantage, or preference in the discharge of his or her functions.[68]

Public officer requirement

There is no issue as to the presence of the first element. Except for Kimakim, accused-appellants are all public officers. As for Kimakim though, he is a private individual who allegedly received unwarranted benefit from the questioned transaction and acted as a co-conspirator of his co-accused.[69]

Manifest partiality and evident bad faith


Anent the second element, the Court has held that:
The second element provides the different modes by which the crime may be committed, that is, through ""manifest partiality,"" ""evident bad faith,"" or ""gross inexcusable negligence."" In Uriarte v. People, this Court explained that Section 3 (e) of RA 3019 may be committed either by dolo, as when the accused acted with evident bad faith or manifest partiality, or by culpa, as when the accused committed gross inexcusable negligence. There is ""manifest partiality"" when there is a clear, notorious, or plain inclination or predilection to favor one side or person rather than another. ""Evident bad faith"" connotes not only bad judgment but also palpably and patently fraudulent and dishonest purpose to do moral obliquity or conscious wrongdoing for some perverse motive or ill will. ""Evident bad faith"" contemplates a state of mind affirmatively operating with furtive design or with some motive of self-interest or ill will or for ulterior purposes. ""Gross inexcusable negligence"" refers to negligence characterized by the want of even the slightest care, acting or omitting to act in a situation where there is a duty to act, not inadvertently but wilfully and intentionally, with conscious indifference to consequences insofar as other persons may be affected.[70] (Emphasis supplied)
These three mental elements are distinct from one another and the existence of any of them suffices to support a conviction for violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019.

The Sandiganbayan held that accused-appellants acted with manifest partiality when they proceeded with the procurement process and awarded the contract to Kimakim despite alleged irregularities in the bidding procedure. They purportedly violated Republic Act No. 9184 when they specified the brand name and model of the vehicle in the procurement documents, when they deviated from the purpose of the procurement, and when they revised the procurement documents upon discovery of the deviation from the original intent of the procurement.[71]","ACCORDINGLY, the Appeals are GRANTED. The assailed Decision dated March 24, 2023 and Resolution dated June 13, 2023 of the Sandiganbayan in SB-17-CRM-1495 are REVERSED. Accused-appellants THEODORE B. MARRERO, NENITA D. LIZARDO, HELEN K.

GALAN, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, BRANCH 30, ILOILO CITY, ILOILO, RESPONDENT.","In an Information[2] dated March 9, 2019 filed before Branch 38, RTC of Iloilo City, Galan and co-accused Praud Joan L. Animas (Animas) were charged with violating Section 5 of Republic Act No. 9165, otherwise known as the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002. The accusatory portion of the Information reads:
That on or about the 7th day of March 2019, in the City of Iloilo, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, said accused, with deliberate intent and without any justifiable motive, conspiring, confederating, and helping each other, did then and there willfully, unlawfully, knowingly, and criminally dispense, sell, trade, distribute, deliver, and give away to poseur buyer IO1 REMSON TIU one (1) small heat-sealed transparent plastic sachet (marked as ""BB-PA 3/7/19""), containing 0.1689 gram of white crystalline substance which tested positive for the presence of Methamphetamine Hydrochloride, or Shabu, a dangerous drug, per Chemistry Report No. PDEAROVI­ DD019-094[,] without being authorized by law or the Dangerous Drugs Board to dispense, sell, trade, distribute, deliver, or give away the same, in consideration of THREE THOUSAND Pesos ([PHP 3,000.00]), using a previously subscribed one thousand peso bill, bearing Serial No. AJ851281, and two (2) pieces one thousand peso boodle bills, as buy-bust money, which were likewise recovered from the person, possession, and control of accused PRAUD JOAN ANIMAS y LOPEZ alias ""Lab-lab"" upon the arrest of both accused","This administrative case stemmed from a Letter[1] dated March 8, 2019, written by Executive Judge Victor E. Gelvezon (Executive Judge Gelvezon) informing the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) of the March 7, 2019 arrest of respondent Gerson O. Galan (Galan), Utility Worker I, Branch 30, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Iloilo City, for selling dangerous drugs.","The Court agrees with the findings and recommendations of the JIB. Galan's participation in illegal drug activities, wherein he was charged and convicted pursuant to a buy-bust operation, constitutes grave misconduct and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service.

Jurisprudence defines misconduct as ""a transgression of some established and definite rule of action, more particularly, unlawful behavior or gross negligence by a public officer.""[18] In Grave Misconduct, as distinguished from Simple Misconduct, the elements of corruption, clear intent to violate the law or flagrant disregard of established rules, must be manifest and established by substantial evidence.[19]

On the other hand, acts may constitute conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service when they tarnish the image and integrity of the respondent's public office.[20] It refers to acts or omissions that violate the norm of public accountability and diminish — or tend to diminish — the people's faith in the Judiciary.[21]

In this case, Galan was caught red-handed participating in illegal drug activities during a buy-bust operation, and found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of committing the offense punishable under Section 12 of Republic Act No. 9165, viz.:
Section 12. Possession of Equipment, Instrument, Apparatus and Other Paraphernalia for Dangerous Drugs. - The penalty of imprisonment ranging from six (6) months and one (1) day to four (4) years and a fine ranging from Ten thousand pesos (P10,000.00) to Fifty thousand pesos (P50,000.00) shall be imposed upon any person, who, unless authorized by law, shall possess or have under his/her control any equipment, instrument, apparatus and other paraphernalia fit or intended for smoking, consuming, administering, injecting, ingesting, or introducing any dangerous drug into the body . . .
It goes without saying that Galan demonstrated unlawful behavior and a manifest intent to violate the law in performing the criminal act that he was convicted of. Further, the fact that he was an employee of a court necessarily tasked with the adjudication of drug-related cases, while himself being involved in criminal drug operations, adversely and gravely affected the image and integrity of the court to the general public, in which he was known to be an employee. Undoubtedly, Galan committed grave misconduct and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service.

The Court reminds Galan that the image of a court of justice is necessarily mirrored in the conduct, official or otherwise, of the men and women who work thereat, from the judge to the least and lowest of its personnel. Thus, it becomes the imperative sacred duty of each and every one in the court to maintain its good name and standing as a true temple of justice. As front liners in the administration of justice, court personnel should live up to the strictest standards of honesty and integrity in the public service, and in this light, are always expected to act in a manner free from reproach. Any conduct, act, or omission that may diminish the people's faith in the Judiciary should not be tolerated.[22]","ACCORDINGLY, the Court finds respondent Gerson O. Galan GUILTY of gross misconduct and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service. He is hereby ordered to PAY a FINE of PHP 150,000.00, with FORFEITURE of his retirement and other benefits, except accrued leave credits. Likewise, he is PERPETUALLY DISQUALIFIED from re­employment in any government agency or instrumentality, including any government-owned and controlled corporation or government financial institution.

This Decision shall take effect immediately upon respondent Gerson O. Galan's receipt of a copy of the same. Respondent Gerson O. Galan shall inform this Court in writing of the date he received a copy of this Decision.

In response to the invitation, three contractors submitted their letters of intent and applications for eligibility. The Abstract of Bids,[6] which was certified correct by the members of the Bids and Awards Committee of the Municipality of Mayantoc, reflected the names of the bidders/contractors, their respective bid amounts and bonds, and the remarks of the Bids and Awards Committee, as follows:

Then Mayantoc Municipal Mayor Tito G. Razalan (Mayor Razalan) issued on November 20, 2009 the corresponding Notice of Award[10] in favor of JQG Construction. Thereupon, the Municipality of Mayantoc issued a Notice to Proceed,[11] informing JQG Construction that the Contract Agreement[12] between them had been approved and that it may commence the construction of the Project.

During the administration of Mayantoc Mayor Iluminado E. Pobre (Mayor Pobre), Audit Team Leader Jean M. Daliva (Daliva) submitted to him Technical Evaluation Report No. 2010-04-042 dated April 12, 2011 in connection with the Project.[13] In the report, the audit team noted several deficiencies, for which Daliva requested the submission of several documents to facilitate its technical evaluation and inspection. She also requested the concerned official/s identified therein to comment on the observations.[14]

In compliance with Daliva's request, Mayor Pobre instructed Engineer Rodolfo F. Corpuz (Engr. Corpuz), the municipal engineer and Bids and Awards Committee Chairperson, to submit the documents requested by the COA.[15]

As it happened, a Notice of Suspension[16] was issued to halt the payment due to JQG Construction in the amount of PHP 23,048,230.15 for the construction of the Project in view of the local government unit's submission of incomplete supporting documents. The Notice of Suspension named the persons responsible for the incomplete submission, as follows:","Before the Court is a Petition for Certiorari[1] under Rule 64, in relation to Rule 65, of the Rules of Court, seeking to set aside Decision No. 2018-212[2] and the Resolution[3] in Decision No. 2020-386 of respondent Commission on Audit (COA).

The subject controversy involves a Contract Agreement[4] entered into between the Municipality of Mayantoc, Tarlac (Municipality of Mayantoc) and JQG Construction and Supplies (JQG Construction) for the construction of the Mayantoc Memorial Park in Mayantoc, Tarlac (Project).","At the vortex of the instant Petition is this pivotal query—Did the COA correctly disallow the payment to JQG Construction relative to the construction of the Mayantoc Memorial Park?

This Court answers in the affirmative. Still and all, the exceptional circumstances surrounding the case strongly impel the Court to remand it to the COA for the determination of the adjusted disallowed amount.

The issuance of an audit letter or an Audit Observation Memorandum is an initiatory step in the investigative audit to determine the propriety of disbursements made. If after an in-depth investigation, there is a finding that the transaction should be suspended or disallowed, a Notice of Suspension, Notice of Disallowance or Notice of Charge shall be issued. It is the Notice of Suspension, Notice of Disallowance or Notice of Charge that becomes final and executory, absent any motion for reconsideration or appeal.[46] Necessarily, the findings and conclusions in the notices may vary from the initial observation contained in the audit letter or Audit Observation Memorandum. In light of the audit investigation, an additional person may be held liable, the amount to be suspended or disallowed may change, or the nature of participation of the persons initially held responsible may be modified.

In the present controversy, Salazar was initially held responsible in the Notice of Suspension as the municipal treasurer ""[f]or paying the disbursements.""[47] However, in the Notice of Disallowance, she was held liable for her role as a Bids and Awards Committee member ""[f]or declaring the winning bidder, JQG Construction and Supplies, as the Bidder with the Lowest Calculated and Responsive Bid for the construction of Mayantoc Memorial Park despite the deficiencies noted.""[48] As enunciated, this modification is a necessary consequence of the audit investigation. In fact, other Bids and Awards Committee members not initially named in the Notice of Suspension were similarly identified as liable in the Notice of Disallowance. The variation in Salazar's nature of participation under the Notice of Suspension and Notice of Disallowance is of no moment; it is not tantamount to either a denial of due process or equal protection of the laws.

In Saligumba v. Commission on Audit,[49] the Court held that ""[d]ue process is complied with 'if the party who is properly notified of allegations against him or her is given an opportunity to defend himself or herself against those allegations, and such defense was considered by the tribunal in arriving at its own independent conclusions'.""[50] The essence of due process is the fair and reasonable opportunity to be heard or to explain one's side.[51]

Here, Salazar actively participated in the proceedings before the COA. She appealed the Notice of Disallowance to the COA regional director and filed her Petition for Review with the COA Proper. Clearly, she was afforded the opportunity to present her side in every stage of the proceedings. Despite the variance in the Notice of Suspension and the Notice of Disallowance, she was nevertheless afforded all opportunity before COA Regional Office No. III and the COA Proper to state her case against any liability as a member of the Bids and Awards Committee. By virtue of her active participation in the proceedings, any defect in the Notice of Suspension and the Notice or Disallowance had effectively been waived.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Certiorari is GRANTED IN PART. The January 31, 2018 Decision No. 2018-212 and the January 31, 2020 Resolution in Decision No. 2020-386 of the Commission on Audit are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION.

The case is REMANDED to respondent Commission on Audit for the determination of the disallowed amount, as reduced by the reasonable value of the services rendered by the payee/contractor. Petitioner Nilda G. Salazar, along with the other persons named liable in the Notice of Disallowance, are declared solidarily liable for the adjusted disallowed amount."

TEHANO-ANG, PRESIDING JUDGE, BRANCH 1, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, TAGUM CITY, DAVAO DEL NORTE, RESPONDENT.","The Office of the City Prosecutor (OCP) of Tagum City filed four Informations[15] indicting Garcia as well as King Paul Auditor (Auditor), Dexter Auditor, Leo Q. Perez, Jr., Rodrigo L. Marquez, Jr., Maita R. Palma, Mercylun T. Escobido and Ruby Imma G. Labajo, as officers, traders, managers, employees, and/or agents of Rigen Marketing, for the crime of syndicated estafa under Presidential Decree No. 1689,[16] section 1, paragraph 1, in relation to Article 315, paragraph 2 (a)[17] of the Revised Penal Code. The cases were docketed as Criminal Case Nos. 25236 to 25239 and raffled to Branch 1, Regional Trial Court of Tagum City, Davao Del Norte, presided by Judge Ang.

Subsequently, on November 25, 2019, Judge Ang issued an Order[18] which granted the prosecution's urgent motion for the issuance of commitment order for Auditor and directed the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG)-Camp Crame, Quezon City, to turn him over to the jurisdiction of the court.[19]

Thereupon, Auditor filed an urgent motion to hold in abeyance his transfer from the CIDG-Camp Crame to the jurisdiction of the court, which was, however, denied in an Order dated December 3, 2019.[20]

Given that some of the accused were at large, Judge Ang issued the Order[21] dated December 20, 2019, which relevantly reads:
The rest of the Accused might not have been arrested; but since they are involved in all these cases; they should all appear for the Prosecution and the Court to hear their respective Defense, in order to fast track the proceeding[;] as they are all free to appear, even if there is a pending Warrant to Arrest them; for their voluntary appearance will be the basis for this Court to grant their temporary liberty by posting a bailbond, even if the charge against them is non-bailable; provided that they will not jump bail and shall comply with their commitment to be present every time their cases will be called; for any way the concerns of the private complainants herein is only about the money they used to invest to acquire higher rate of profit.","No less than the Constitution states that a member of the judiciary ""must be a person of proven competence, integrity, probity and independence. ""It is, therefore, highly imperative that a judge should be conversant with basic legal principles. When a judge displays an utter lack of familiarity with the rules, he or she erodes the public's confidence in the competence of our courts. Once a heavy shadow is cast on a judge's moral, intellectual and attitudinal competence in view of their transgressions, then he or she can no longer don the judicial robe and perform the functions of a magistrate. The administration of justice cannot be entrusted to one who would readily ignore and disregard the laws and policies enacted by the Court to guarantee justice and fairness for all.[1]

For this Court's adjudication is the Complaint[2] of Rico John Colorines Garcia (Garcia), praying for the imposition of proper sanctions against Honorable Judge Virginia D. Tehano-Ang (Judge Ang) and that she be considered retired for all legal intents and purposes[3] in view of her violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct,[4] namely: Rules 1.01,[5] 1.02,[6] 1.03,[7] 2.01,[8] 2.02,[9] 3.01,[10] 3.02,[11] 3.07,[12] 3.08,[13] and 3.12.[14]","The Court adopts the factual findings and the recommendation of the JIB.

Prefatorily, it bears accentuating that an administrative complaint is not the appropriate remedy for the aberrant or irregular acts of judges where a judicial remedy is available, such as a motion for reconsideration, an appeal, or a petition for certiorari. The acts of judges in their judicial capacity are not subject to disciplinary action. Simply put, an inquiry into the correctness of a judge's official act is undeniably judicial in nature and is best settled through the available appropriate judicial remedies under the Rules of Court, and not by way of an administrative complaint.[57]

In the case at bench, the JIB infallibly considered Judge Ang's acts of granting the amendment of the Information, issuing a warrant of arrest without requiring Rosenda to file comment, and denying the oral manifestation to file a petition for change of venue, as judicial in nature and therefore cannot be properly probed into in this administrative complaint.

Besides, given that such acts were performed within the bounds of law and applicable rules, the same cannot be the subject of disciplinary liability. To be sure, the Rules of Court do not require that every accused be afforded the right to comment before a judge can amend the Information to include him or her thereon, or issue a warrant for their arrest. Moreover, the denial of the oral manifestation to file a petition for change of venue, is proper given that Judge Ang had no authority to rule on it. No less than the Constitution decrees that the power to order a change of venue or place of trial to avoid a miscarriage of justice is lodged with the Supreme Court.[58]

On this score, the explication of the Court in Tallado v. Judge Racoma[59] anent the interplay between disciplinary cases against judges and their judicial functions, is illuminating, viz.:
It is well-settled that disciplinary proceedings and criminal actions against judges are not complementary or suppletory to, nor a substitute for, these judicial remedies, whether ordinary or extraordinary. For, obviously, if subsequent developments prove the judge's challenged act to be correct, there would be no occasion to proceed against him at all. Besides, to hold a judge administratively accountable for every erroneous ruling or decision he renders, assuming he has erred, would be nothing short of harassment and would make his position doubly unbearable. To hold otherwise would be to render judicial office untenable, for no one called upon to try the facts or interpret the law in the process of administering justice can be infallible in his judgment. It is only where the error is tainted with bad faith, fraud, malice, or dishonesty that administrative sanctions may be imposed against the erring judge.[60]
Thus, there are two occasions when judges cannot be found administratively liable for acts performed in connection with their official duty: (1) Whenever they act within the bounds of the law and the applicable rules; and (2) Whenever they act erroneously but the error is made in good faith. Upon this point, only judicial errors tainted with fraud, dishonesty and corruption, gross ignorance, bad faith or deliberate intent to do an injustice will be administratively sanctioned.[61]

Certainly, Judge Ang cannot be sanctioned thereof as her foregoing acts were in accordance with the rules and were not even flawed.

Still and all, the same conclusion does not hold true anent the other charges in this Complaint. Judges cannot be subject to any liability—civil, criminal, or administrative—for any of their official acts, no matter how erroneous, as long as they act in good faith. As adumbrated above, judicial errors can only be sanctioned if tarnished with fraud, dishonesty and corruption, gross ignorance, bad faith or deliberate intent to do an injustice.[62]

The other charges questioning Judge Ang's official acts, although judicial in nature, fall within the ambit of an administrative proceeding as they are not simple errors of judgment. Judge Ang appallingly made a mockery of the rules of procedure in handling the instant criminal cases. Evidently, she deviated from the basic rules and settled jurisprudence that she devised her own guidelines. Judge Ang's repeated disregard of the applicable laws and rules manifest her gross ignorance of the law which the Court cannot tolerate.","ACCORDINGLY, the Court ordains as follows:
1.	
The Complaint against respondent Hon. Virginia D. Tehano-Ang, former Presiding Judge, Branch 1, Regional Trial Court, Tagum  City, Davao del Norte, is RE-DOCKETED as a regular administrative matter; and
 	
2.	
Hon. Virginia D. Tehano-Ang is found GUILTY of gross ignorance of the law or procedure. In lieu of dismissal from service which the Court can no longer impose, her retirement benefits are instead declared FORFEITED as penalty for her offense, except accrued, leave credits. She is, likewise, barred from re-employment in any branch or instrumentality of government, including government-owned or controlled corporations."

CASTAÑEDA, JR., IN HIS CAPACITY AS THE GENERAL MANAGER OF SAN RAFAEL WATER DISTRICT (SRWD), ON HIS OWN BEHALF AND ON BEHALF OF OTHER SRWD OFFICIALS AND EMPLOYEES, PETITIONERS, VS. COMMISSION ON AUDIT, RESPONDENT.","SRWD is a government-owned and controlled corporation (GOCC) organized under Presidential Decree No. 198,[6] as amended.

On July 1, 1989, Republic Act No. 6758,[7] otherwise known as the Compensation and Position Classification Act of 1989, was enacted by Congress. Under Section 12 thereof, all allowances are deemed included in the standardized salary rates prescribed therein except the following: (1) representation and transportation allowances; (2) clothing and laundry allowances; (3) subsistence allowances of marine officers and crew on board government vessels; (4) subsistence allowances of hospital personnel; (5) hazard pay; (6) allowances of foreign service personnel stationed abroad; and (7) such other additional compensation not otherwise specified as determined by the Department of Budget and Management (DBM)—all other additional compensation, whether in cash or in kind, being received by incumbents only as of July 1, 1989, not integrated into the standardized salary rates shall continue to be authorized.

For the period of January 1 to December 31, 2011, SWRD, through its BOD, paid 22 of its employees hired after December 31, 1999 (employee-recipients), additional benefits in the form of rice allowance, grocery allowance, medical allowance, and year-end financial assistance, in the total amount of PHP 1,727,409.75. Within the same period, SRWD likewise paid year-end financial assistance and cash gift to the members of its BOD in the total amount of PHP 239,000.00.[8]

On post-audit, the Audit Team Leader and the Supervising Auditor of SRWD issued Audit Observation Memorandum (AOM) No. 2012-008(11) finding that the payment of the additional allowances and bonuses to the employee-recipients and the members of its BOD are without legal basis. In response, SRWD explained that the questioned allowances and bonuses were paid in good faith, after securing authorization from the Local Water Utility Administration (LWUA) and the DBM.[9]

On November 21, 2012, the Audit Team Leader and Supervising Auditor issued ND Nos. 12-001-101(11)[10] and 12-002-101(11).[11]","Before the Court is a Petition for Certiorari[1] under Rule 65 in relation to Rule 64 of the Rules of Court filed by Engr.

Castañeda, Jr. (Castañeda, Jr.), in his capacity as General Manager of San Rafael Water District (SRWD), on his own behalf and on behalf of the other SRWD officials and employees (collectively, petitioners) assailing the Decision[2] and Resolution[3] of the Commission on Audit (COA).

The assailed COA issuances affirmed the Notices of Disallowance Nos. (NDs) 12-001-101(11)[4] and 12-002-101(11) both dated November 21, 2012,[5] which (1) respectively disallowed the payment of (a) additional allowances and bonuses to employees hired after December 31, 1999, amounting to PHP 857,340.75, and (b) year-end financial assistance and cash gift to the SWRD Board of Directors (BOD) for the period of January 1 to December 31, 2011, amounting to PHP 239,000.00, and (2) found petitioners liable for the refund of the disallowed amounts.","The petition lacks merit.

Propriety of the Disallowance

Petitioners impute grave abuse of discretion on the part of the COA for upholding ND Nos. 12-001-101(11) and 12-002-101(11) when the subject allowances were in keeping with a valid DBM authority and LWUA issuances.

The contention deserves scant consideration.   
 
I.
Rice Allowance, Grocery Allowance, Medical Allowance, and Year-End Financial Assistance granted to the employee-­recipients.

DBM-CCC No. 10-99 was issued pursuant to the authority given to the DBM under the first sentence of Section 12 of Republic Act No. 6758. Sub-paragraphs 5.4 and 5.5[54] of DBM-CCC No. 10-99 allows the grant of benefits, other than those specifically enumerated in the first sentence of Section 12, conditioned upon the incumbency requirement and the actual receipt of such allowances and benefits while being incumbents. Among those listed are rice subsidy and medical benefits. However, in the instant case, the employee-recipients are not incumbents as of July 1, 1989.

The Court has consistently construed the qualifying date to be July 1, 1989, or the effectivity date of Republic Act No. 6758, in determining whether an employee was an incumbent and actually receiving the non­integrated allowances so that he may be entitled to continuously receive them.[55] Accordingly, the Garcia Letter, which authorized the grant of the disallowed benefits to employees hired after December 31, 1999, is erroneous and cannot be relied upon. Director Garcia cannot, by his own interpretation, change the meaning and intent of the law. In Torcuator v. Commission on Audit,[56] the Court emphatically ruled that the ""DBM is constrained to abide by the explicit provision of the law that July 1, 1989 is the reckoning point, pursuant to Republic Act No. 6758, when allowances or fringe benefits may be granted to incumbent officers and employees.""[57] After the said date, the general rule of integration shall apply to allowances and benefits.

Stated differently, the Garcia letter cannot be invoked to change the specific date provided by the law. The implementing rules and regulations of a law cannot extend the law or expand its coverage, as the power to amend or repeal a statute is vested in the legislature.[58] The Court likewise observed that the Garcia Letter lacked any explanation as to why December 31, 1999, was prescribed as the reckoning date.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Certiorari is DISMISSED. The January 29, 2018 Decision in Decision No. 2018-188 and January 24, 2022 Resolution in Resolution No. 2022-118 of the Commission on Audit are AFFIRMED.

The Notice of Disallowance Nos. 12-001-101(11) and 12-002-101(11), both dated November 21, 2012, are hereby MODIFIED in that the payees are liable to the extent of the amount they received, while Engr. Numeriano Castañeda, Jr., and Ms. Marivel Suarez, acting as the authorizing officer and certifying officer, respectively, remain solidarily liable after deducting the actual amounts refunded by the employee-­recipients."

HONORABLE ERWIN VIRGILIO P. FERRER, EXECUTIVE JUDGE AND PRESIDING JUDGE, BRANCH 20, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, NAGA CITY, CAMARINES SUR, RESPONDENT.","In his Order[3] dated October 19, 2020, Judge Intia inhibited himself from handling Criminal Case Nos. 2019-0822 and 2019-0823 titled ""People v. Inda"" and his footnotes bore the following narrative, viz.:
When a judge maligns and speaks bad of another judge specially about cases pending in the sala of the latter, and instigates a lawyer or any person to go against a fellow judge, and the aspersion of everything except goodness and righteousness of the judge maligned reaches the litigants especially those who lost their cases decided by the judge maligned, the latter is placed in higher risk of all possible harm that can be thought of. I had been hearing for the past years that this judge has been maligning me but I kept my peace and instead prayed that he will realize the danger of what he is doing against me especially that he is doing these out of anger, malice, and envy, without any constructive purpose but to destroy me. I know because several persons to whom he confided told me, and even his staff speaks. But as he continues to put me down, his enemies multiply due to his personality/character manifested in his actions, some of which are as follows: 1) He shouted and lambasted a policeman witness in open court and ordered him to sit on the Judge chair while having trial, the Lady Prosecutor was already in tears when the fury of the judge subsided; 2) In a loud and offensive voice, he humiliated and insulted a Barangay Captain during a hearing. In these two and similar incidents, the victims and even the prosecutors were persuaded not to complain against this Judge. But just months ago, a Lady staff of the Judge complained to the Chief Justice, Supreme Court against this Judge who lambasted, shouted, insulted and humiliated her during a staff meeting. The Lady reported these criminal and damaging actions of the Judge to the police and her affidavit was subscribed before the Prosecution Office. All these incidents happened, are verifiable and are common knowledge in the legal circle, but the third incident came to my knowledge because I was informed by my staff and the affidavit and letter circulated through the different chat groups of the Court employees. He is so powerful that in a stroke of his pen, his Lady Staff was assigned to another Branch of RTC, Naga City. Just last week, I was informed by my staff that another letter circulated in relation to the Complaint of the Lady staff of this Judge, and she told me that since it is known in the legal circle that I and this Judge are not in good terms, I am one of the suspects as the author of the circulation. I tried to reach out and talk to this Judge for several times but I was refused. This is so disturbing on my part, I must talk, my Faithful Breast can no longer tolerate these matters.

A week ago, a fellow Lady Judge in this jurisdiction was ambushed, thanks GOD she survived but her aide was seriously wounded. This Judge (referred to in the first paragraph of this footnote) due to his temper, sudden outburst of emotions, and constant use of offensive language, has humiliated, embarrassed and angered many persons. God forbid, if his victims complain against him and worst, if something harmful happens to him, to quote my staff – 'since it is known in the legal circle that I and this Judge are not in good terms, I am one of the suspects.' I and this Judge were friends and I cherish our friendship despite all these things he did and is doing to me. In fact, my in-laws and his parents are close friends in their lifetime. Friendship is the reason why for so many years that this Judge has been renting a commercial space in the commercial building of my in-laws, no increase in monthly rental was collected from him, unlike other lessees. At one time, I told him that we will get the insurance of our cars from him, and yes we were given big discount. It was only last year when this Judge transferred the venue of his business to his house. (Proofs are the lease contract signed by this Judge and receipts of payment of his monthly rentals of his commercial space.) I have known [of] these activities of this Judge for a long time but it is for his good and his family to just remain silent. (Canon of Judicial Ethics, Rule 5.02 – A judge shall refrain from financial and business dealings that tend to reflect adversely on the court's impartiality, interfere with the proper performance of judicial activities, or increase involvements with lawyers or persons likely to come before the court. A judge should so manage investments and other financial interests as to minimize the number of cases giving grounds for disqualification; Art. 14 – The following cannot engage in the commercial profession either in person or by proxy, nor can they hold any direct administrative or economic position in commercial and industrial associations within the limits of his districts, provinces, or towns in which they discharge their duties: xxx judges and officials of the department of public prosecution in active service xxx) But I must break my silence now. In the world of business there are competitors and dissatisfied clients. To quote my staff again – ""since it is known in the legal circle that I and this Judge are not in good terms, I am one of the suspects.""[4] (Emphasis supplied)

To reiterate, Judge Intia accused Executive Judge Ferrer (ret.) of unbecoming conduct for the latter's alleged outbursts in open court against court personnel Valencia during a staff meeting.

"G.R. No. 257516, May 13, 2024","DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE­-REVENUE INTEGRITY PROTECTION SERVICE (DOF-RIPS), PETITIONER, VS. OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSMAN, FREDERICKS. LEAÑO, AND JEREMIAS C. LEAÑO,• RESPONDENTS.","The DOF-RIPS filed a Complaint before the OMB against Spouses Leaño, who are both employees of the Bureau of Customs (BOC),[6] for violations of the above-cited criminal laws and for Serious Dishonesty and Grave Misconduct. The DOF-RIPS alleged that pursuant to the conduct of a lifestyle check on Spouses Leaño, it was discovered that they made untruthful, misleading, and incomplete declarations in their joint annual Statements of Assets, Liabilities and Net Worth (SALN). Specifically, there was allegedly a false declaration of a house and lot located in Montefaro Village, Imus City, Cavite (Montefaro property) in their 2006 to 2018 SALNs. Furthermore, the DOF-RIPS observed that Spouses Leaño indicated in their 2007 to 2011 SALNs that the acquisition cost of said property was PHP 650,000.00, yet in their 2006 and 2012 to 2018 SALNs, they indicated the acquisition cost at only PHP 535,000.00.[7]

The DOF-RIPS also alleged that Spouses Leaño failed to declare a house and lot located in Golden Villas Subdivision, Imus City, Cavite (Golden Villas property) in their 2009 to 2018 SALNs, and a business interest over Framille General Merchandise (Framille) in their 2012 SALNs.[8]

The DOF-RIPS pointed out that per verification with the Land Registration Authority, no real property was registered in the names of Spouses Leaño or of any of their children. There was, however, a record of tax payments covering the Golden Villas property, with Spouses Leaño as the declared owners of the property. No similar record existed insofar as the Montefaro property was concerned.[9]

As to Spouses Leaño's alleged business interest over Framille, the DOF-RIPS averred that the documents gathered from the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and the Permits and Licenses Division of Imus, Cavite revealed Spouses Leaño's ownership of Framille.[10]","The instant Petition[1] for Certiorari (Petition) seeks to set aside the Joint Resolution[2] dated October 1, 2020 of public respondent Office of the Ombudsman (OMB), which dismissed the criminal complaints of petitioner Department of Finance-Revenue Integrity Protection Service (DOF-RIPS) against private respondents Spouses Frederick and Jeremias Leaño (Spouses Leaño), for violations of Section 7 of Republic Act No. 3019,[3] Section 8 of Republic Act No. 6713,[4] and Article 171(4) on Falsification of Public Document and Article 183 on Perjury of the Revised Penal Code. The Petition also assails the Joint Order[5] dated February 9, 2021 of the OMB, which denied the DOF-RIPS' Consolidated Motion for Reconsideration.","After a careful study of the allegations and the records of this case, the Court resolves to dismiss the Petition for failure to establish that the OMB committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.

As a general rule, the Court does not interfere with the OMB's exercise of its investigative and prosecutorial powers, and respects the initiative and independence inherent in said office.[23] In addition, the Court defers to the sound judgment of the OMB in recognition of the fact that a finding of probable cause is an executive determination and a highly factual inquiry which the OMB is best suited to make.[24] Where there is an allegation of grave abuse of discretion, however, the OMB's act cannot escape judicial scrutiny under the Court's own constitutional power and duty.[25]

Grave abuse of discretion implies a capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment tantamount to lack of jurisdiction. The OMB's exercise of power must have been done in an arbitrary or despotic manner that must be so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined or to act at all in contemplation of law.[26] For certiorari to prosper, mere disagreement with the findings of the OMB is not sufficient. There must be a showing that it conducted its proceedings in such a way that amounted to a virtual refusal to perform a duty under the law.[27]

In ascribing grave abuse of discretion against the OMB, the DOF-­RIPS maintains that Spouses Leaño are criminally liable for making false declarations in their SALNs. The DOF-RIPS highlights the tax declarations of the properties of Jeremias and Josielyn, which show that the Montefaro property was under the name of Josielyn, while the Golden Villas property was under the name of Jeremias. Hence, according to the DOF-RIPS, it was untruthful for Spouses Leaño to declare the Montefaro property in their SALNs, while at the same time, omitting the Golden Villas property therefrom. The DOF-RIPS points out that the tax declarations are evidence of ownership, against which the barangay certifications pertaining to Spouses Leaño's occupancy of the Montefaro property should bear no weight.[28] 

Additionally, the DOF-RIPS insists that the fact that the business of Spouses Leaño in Framille did not take off in 2012 should not be sufficient reason to not declare said business in their 2012 SALNs. At the very least, the lack of actual business operation may be better threshed out in a trial.[29]

The DOF-RIPS likewise argues that the elements of Falsification of Public Documents are present when Spouses Leaño intentionally made misdeclarations, inconsistencies, and non-declarations in their SALNs, despite their known legal obligation to disclose the truth.[30]

In the same vein, for repeatedly asserting falsehoods under oath in their SALNs even if they were required by law to declare true, detailed, and complete inventories of their properties, the DOF-RIPS argues that there is probable cause that Spouses Leaño committed multiple counts of perjury.[31]

The foregoing arguments, however, do not persuade and miserably fail to show how the OMB acted whimsically, arbitrarily, or capriciously in rendering its assailed Joint Resolution and Joint Order.","ACCORDINGLY, the Court DISMISSES the Petition for Certiorari for lack of merit. The Joint Resolution dated October 1, 2020 and the Joint Order dated February 9, 2021 of the Office of the Ombudsman are AFFIRMED."
"G.R. No. 206517, May 13, 2024 ","STABLEWOOD PHILIPPINES, INC. [FORMERLY ROLLS­ROYCE PHILIPPINES, INC., (FORMERLY ORCA ENERGY, INC.)], PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, RESPONDENT.","Stablewood is a domestic corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the Republic of the Philippines and registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).[5]

From January 1998 to July 2007, Stablewood, then carrying the name ""Orca Energy, Inc."" (Orca), was registered with the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) Revenue Region No. 8, Revenue District Office (RDO) No. 50 (South Makati). Later, it moved to RDO No. 47 (East Makati) due to a change of address.[6]

On April 7, 2006, Stablewood electronically filed its Annual Income Tax Return (ITR) for TY 2005, which reflected CWT overpayment in the amount of PHP 76,245,344.99.[7] On the said ITR, Stablewood marked the choice ""To be issued a Tax Credit Certificate"" in relation to its unutilized CWT for TY 2005.[8]

Subsequently, Stablewood carried over the tax overpayment indicated in its TY 2005 Annual ITR in its Quarterly Income Tax Returns for the first, second, and third quarters of the TY 2006.[9]

On November 24, 2006, Stablewood filed an administrative claim for refund of its excess CWT for TY 2005 in the amount of PHP 65,085,905.82 with BIR Revenue Region No. 8.[10] Thereafter, Stablewood filed its Annual ITR for TY 2006 electronically on April 2, 2007, and manually on April 12, 2007. In its TY 2006 Annual ITR, Stablewood indicated that it did not carry­over its unutilized CWT from TY 2005.[11]

The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) failed to act on Stablewood's administrative claim for refund. Hence, Stablewood filed a Petition for Review before the CTA on November 13, 2007.[12]

In its Answer, the CIR argued that taxes paid and collected are assumed to be in accordance with laws and regulations, and not refundable or creditable if the taxpayer fails to demonstrate that the tax was erroneously or illegally collected. The CIR added that it was incumbent on Stablewood to show that it complied with the provisions of Sections 204(C) in relation to Section 229 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC), as amended, which enumerate the requirements for refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate for taxes erroneously paid or illegally collected. The CIR argued that Stablewood failed to discharge its duty to prove that it is entitled to a refund or tax credit.[13]","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assailing the Decision[2] dated October 8, 2012 and the Resolution[3] dated March 22, 2013 of the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) En Banc (EB) in CTA EB Case No. 794, which affirmed the Decision[4] dated January 31, 2011 of the CTA Third Division (CTA Division) in CTA Case No. 7704, denying petitioner Stablewood Philippines, Inc.'s (Stablewood) claim for tax refund or issuance of tax credit certificate (TCC) of creditable withholding tax (CWT) for taxable year (TY) 2005 in the amount of PHP 65,085,905.82.","The Petition has no merit.

Under Section 76 of the NIRC, there are two options available to the corporation whenever it overpays its income tax for the taxable year: (1) to carry over and apply the overpayment as tax credit against the estimated quarterly income tax liabilities of the succeeding taxable years (also known as automatic tax credit) until fully utilized (meaning, there is no prescriptive period); and (2) to apply for a cash refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate within the prescribed period. Such overpayment of income tax is usually occasioned by the over-withholding of taxes on the income payments to the corporate taxpayer.[51]

Relatedly, the last paragraph of the said provision lays down the irrevocability rule, to wit:
SEC. 76. Final Adjustment Return. – Every corporation liable to tax under Section 27 shall file a final adjustment return covering the total taxable income for the preceding calendar or fiscal year. If the sum of the quarterly tax payments made during the said taxable year is not equal to the total tax due on the entire taxable income of that year, the corporation shall either:

(A) Pay the balance of tax still due; or

(B) Carry-over the excess credit; or

(C) Be credited or refunded with the excess amount paid, as the case may be.

In case the corporation is entitled to a tax credit or refund of the excess estimated quarterly income taxes paid during the year, the excess amount shown on its final adjustment return may be carried over and credited against the estimated quarterly income tax liabilities for the taxable quarters of the succeeding taxable years. Once the option to carry-over and apply the said excess quarterly income taxes paid against the income tax due for the taxable quarters of the succeeding taxable years has been made, such options shall be considered irrevocable for that taxable period and no application for cash refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate shall be allowed therefor[.] (Emphasis supplied)
Interpreting the above provision, the Court has held that a ""perfunctory reading of the law unmistakably discloses that the irrevocable option referred to is the carry-over option only. There appears nothing therein from which to infer that the other choice, i.e., cash refund or tax credit certificate, is also irrevocable. If the intention of the lawmakers was to make such option of cash refund or tax credit certificate also irrevocable, then they would have clearly provided so. In other words, the law does not prevent a taxpayer who originally opted for a refund or tax credit certificate from shifting to the carry-over of the excess creditable taxes to the taxable quarters of the succeeding taxable years. However, in case the taxpayer decides to shift its option to carryover, it may no longer revert to its original choice due to the irrevocability rule. As Section 76 [of the NIRC] unequivocally provides, once the option to carry over has been made, it shall be irrevocable. Furthermore, the provision seems to suggest that there are no qualifications or conditions attached to the rule on irrevocability.""[52]

Thus, considering the express provision of Section 76 of the NIRC, the fact that Stablewood indicated in its TY 2005 Annual ITR that its choice was to refund/obtain a tax credit certificate for its unutilized CWT for TY 2005 does not make this choice irrevocable. The subsequent carry-over of Stablewood's unutilized CWT for TY 2005 to the first to third quarters of TY 2006—which, to recall, is admitted by Stablewood, but which it claims to be a mistake or inadvertently done—was allowable. Moreover, as discussed above, once a taxpayer changes its choice from refund/tax credit certificate to carry-over of unutilized tax, the choice of carry-over becomes irrevocable.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DENIED. The assailed Decision dated October 8, 2012 and the Resolution dated March 22, 2013 of the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc in CTA EB Case No. 794 are hereby AFFIRMED."

No. 260801, May 13, 2024","MANCO SYNTHETIC INC.-EMPLOYEE LABOR UNION-ORGANIZED LABOR UNION IN LINE INDUSTRIES AND AGRICULTURE (MSI-ELU-OLALIA) AND MANILA CORDAGE COMPANY- EMPLOYEES LABOR UNION-ORGANIZED LABOR UNION IN LINE INDUSTRIES AND AGRICULTURE (MCC-ELU-OLALIA), PETITIONERS, VS. MANILA CORDAGE COMPANY (MCC) AND MANCO SYNTHETICS, INC. (MSI) RESPONDENTS.","The Organized Labor Union in Line Industries and Agriculture (OLALIA) is a legitimate labor organization, with petitioners serving as its local chapters in MCC and MSI. On the other hand, MCC and MSI are domestic corporations engaged in the rope-making business. Since MCC and MSI had no exclusive bargaining agent, OLALIA filed two Petitions for Certification Election before the DOLE Regional Office IV. The Petitions were granted, paving the way for the conduct of certification elections on January 27, 2016.[7]

In response to the conduct of certification elections, MCC and MSI filed formal protests to challenge the results, claiming that the voters in the elections were not their employees, but of independent contractors, Worktrusted Manpower Services Cooperative (WMSC) and Alternative Network Resources Unlimited Multi-Purpose Cooperative (ANRUMC). The Med-Arbiter granted the protests, which led to the filing of a Memorandum of Appeal by petitioners before the DOLE Secretary (certification election case).[8]

Meanwhile, pursuant to the visitorial and enforcement powers of the Regional Director of DOLE Regional Office No. IV-A (DOLE Regional Director) under Article 128 of the Labor Code, joint assessments were conducted in the premises of MCC and MSI on April 26, 2016, where workers of WMSC and ANRUMC were deployed. From its assessment, the DOLE Regional Director issued a separate Notice of Results[9] for each of the companies, but noted the same observations for both:
1.)	
NO CWW NOTIFICATION SUBMITTED TO DOLE
- NON-PAYMENT OF OT & ADDITIONAL; HOLIDAY PREMIUMS
2.)	
NON-PRESENTATION OF PAYROLLS [sic] RECORDS AND DTRS FROM OCTOBER 2014 TO THE TIME OF ASSESSMENT;
3.)	
NON-PRESENTATION OF PROOFS OF REMITTANCES OF SSS, PHILHEALTH AND PAG-IBIG CONTRIBUTIONS;
4.)	
NON-PRESENTATION OF PROOF OF PAYMENT OF 13TH MONTH PAY;
5.)	
VIOLATION OF ITEM 7 SECTION 7 OF D.O. 18-A (REPEATED HIRING CIRCUMVENTION OF P.D. 442 [sic] PROVISION ON SECURITY OF TENURE[)];
6.)	
VIOLATION OF ITEM 5, SECTION 7 OF D.O. 18-A (CONTRACTING OUT OF A JOB OR WORK THAT IS NECESSARY AND DESIRABLE OR DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE BUSINESS OR OPERATION);
7.)	
POOR WORKING ENVIRONMENT: HEAT AND NOISE POLLUTION[10]
The results of the inspection prompted MCC and MSI to submit a Memorandum explaining that they were not able to provide the workers' records as they were employees of WMSC and ANRUMC. They also lamented the fact that they were not given more time to coordinate with the service cooperatives to obtain the required records.[11]","This Court resolves the Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] filed by Manco Synthetic Inc.-Employee Labor Union-Organized Labor Union in Line Industries and Agriculture (MSI-ELU-OLALIA) and Manila Cordage Company-Employees Labor Union-Organized Labor Union in Line Industries and Agriculture (MCC-ELU-OLALIA) (collectively, petitioners), seeking to reverse the Amended Decision[2] and the Resolution[3] rendered by the Court of Appeals (CA). The assailed rulings reversed the earlier CA Decision,[4] which denied the Petition for Certiorari filed by Manila Cordage Company (MCC) and Manco Synthetics, Inc. (MSI) for lack of merit. The assailed CA rulings set aside the Resolutions[5] of the Office of the Secretary of Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) and held that no employer-employee relationship existed between the parties.[6]","The present Petition for Review stems from a special civil action for certiorari filed by respondents before the CA, to assail the supposed grave abuse of discretion of the DOLE Secretary, amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in finding the existence of an employer-employee relationship between the parties. Thus, for this Court to resolve the instant petition, it is necessary to determine whether the CA properly resolved the presence or absence of grave abuse of discretion in the DOLE Secretary's Decision, and not based on whether the latter's Decision on the merits of the case was strictly correct.[40]

In addition, since this Court is not a trier of facts, only questions of law raised in the present petition under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court are reviewable. As such, ""[f]actual findings of administrative or quasi-judicial bodies, including labor tribunals, are accorded much respect by this Court as they are specialized to rule on matters falling within their jurisdiction especially when these are supported by substantial evidence."" Only when the findings of fact of the CA are contrary to the findings and conclusions of the quasi-judicial agency is this Court constrained to review and resolve the factual issue [to] settle the controversy.[41]

Here, the factual findings of the CA and the DOLE Secretary were uniform in that WMSC and ANRUMC were discovered to be involved in labor-only contracting and not legitimate contractors, and that respondents were observed to be exercising the right to control and supervise the performance of duties of the workers deployed by WMSC and ANRUMC. In this regard, this Court does not find it necessary to delve into the factual circumstances and records of the case, given the consistent factual findings of the CA and the DOLE Secretary.

Notably, even with the same findings on questions of fact, the conclusion drawn by the CA differs from that of the DOLE Secretary on the question of whether members of petitioners should be deemed regular employees of respondents, by reason of the conclusive and binding effect that the CA ascribed in the NLRC Decision in the illegal strike case. Hence, while the CA opined in its Decision that the four-fold test for determining regular employment has been satisfied by the petitioners, it nonetheless held in the Amended Decision that no employer-employee relationship existed between the parties, echoing the NLRC Decision in the illegal strike case which already attained finality. This Court shall thus proceed to address such question of law posed by the present petition by discussing the legal ramifications, if any, as to the effect of the April 6, 2018 NLRC Decision in the illegal strike case, together with the September 16, 2020 Decision of this Court in the certification election case-both of which made independent albeit contrasting determinations on the existence of employer-employee relationship between the parties.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is GRANTED.

ALLISON LYNN AKANA, PETITIONER.","Lynetta Jatico Sekiya (Lynetta) was an American citizen residing in Honolulu, Hawaii, United States of America.[3] Lynetta died on February 13, 2017 in Honolulu and was survived by her husband, Stanley Tsugio Sekiya, and two daughters, Allison and Sheri-Ann Susana Chieko Matsuda.[4]

In Lynetta's last will and testament, she nominated Allison as her personal representative.[5] On September 17, 2019, Lynetta's last will and testament was informally admitted into probate by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit of State of Hawaii.[6] Letters Testamentary was issued in favor of Allison on September 18, 2019.[7] This was renewed on October 14, 2022.[8]

Among the properties included in Lynetta's estate is a parcel of land located in Pardo, Cebu City covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 110116[9] and Tax Declaration No. GRC6-12-079-00010.[10] In the tax declaration, it is indicated that the gross value of the property is PHP 896,000.00.[11]

Sometime in 2022, Allison filed a Petition for Allowance of Will Proved Outside the Philippines and Administration of Estate under Rule 77 of the Rules before the Municipal Trial Court in Cities (MTCC), Branch 11, Cebu City.[12] However, the MTCC dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction. The relevant portion of the MTCC Order states:
Considering that petitioner seeks for the recognition of the foreign court's judgment on probate, the court has no jurisdiction over the subject matter. Under Rule 77 of the Rules of Court: wills proved and allowed in a foreign country, according to the laws of such country, may be allowed, filed, and recorded by the proper Court of First Instance in the (RTC) [sic] Philippines.

Accordingly, the case is dismissed without prejudice as to its filing to the proper court.",This Court resolves a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] assailing the Orders[2] issued by the Regional Trial Court (RTC) that dismissed for lack of jurisdiction the Petition for Allowance of Will Proved Outside of the Philippines and Administration of Estate under Rule 77 of the Rules of Court filed by Allison Lynn Akana (Allison).,"The Petition is meritorious.

Direct recourse to this Court is proper considering that the present Petition raised a pure question of law


Preliminarily, this Court notes that from the dismissal of her petition by the trial court, Allison resorted to a direct appeal to this Court and bypassed the Court of Appeals. Rule 41, Section 2 of the Rules of Court provides the different modes of appeal from a decision of the RTC:
Section 2. Modes of appeal. —

(a)
Ordinary appeal. — The appeal to the Court of Appeals in cases decided by the Regional Trial Court in the exercise of its original jurisdiction shall be taken by filing a notice of appeal with the court which rendered the judgment or final order appealed from and serving a copy thereof upon the adverse party. No record on appeal shall be required except in special proceedings and other cases of multiple or separate appeals where law on these Rules so require. In such cases, the record on appeal shall be filed and served in like manner.

(b)
Petition for review. — The appeal to the Court of Appeals in cases decided by the Regional Trial Court in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction shall be by petition for review in accordance with Rule 42.


(c)
Appeal by certiorari. — In all cases where only questions of law are raised or involved, the appeal shall be to the Supreme Court by petition for review on certiorari in accordance with the Rule 45. (n)
We expounded on the foregoing in Heirs of Cabigas v. Limbaco:[24]
The first mode of appeal, the ordinary appeal under Rule 41 of the Rules of Court, is brought to the CA from the RTC, in the exercise of its original jurisdiction, and resolves questions of fact or mixed questions of fact and law. The second mode of appeal, the petition for review under Rule 42 of the Rules of Court, is brought to the CA from the RTC, acting in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction, and resolves questions of fact or mixed questions of fact and law. The third mode of appeal, the appeal by certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, is brought to the Supreme Court and resolves only questions of law.","ACCORDINGLY, the instant Petition is GRANTED.

DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY, RESPONDENT.","On February 10, 1998, Republic Act No. 8479, or the Downstream Oil Industry Deregulation Act of 1998, was approved to ""liberalize and deregulate the downstream oil industry in order to ensure a truly competitive market under a regime of fair prices, adequate and continuous supply of environmentally-clean and high quality petroleum products.""[9] Republic Act No. 8479, particularly Section 14 thereof, granted the DOE the power to monitor and publish daily international crude oil prices, and to follow the movement of domestic oil prices. Further, the DOE Secretary was given additional powers under Sec. 15 in connection with the enforcement of Republic Act No. 8479.

Pursuant to Republic Act No. 8479, the DOE issued Department Circular No. DC2019-05-0008, or the Revised Guidelines for the Monitoring of Prices in the Sale of Petroleum Products by the Downstream Oil Industry in the Philippines (DC2019-05-0008), which requires, among others, oil companies to submit a report to the Oil Industry Management Bureau (OIMB), containing the detailed computation with corresponding explanation and supporting documents on unbundled items comprising the Oil Company Price, as provided in the prescribed format therein.[10]

On June 21, 2019, PIP, an association of businesses operating in the downstream oil industry, together with Isla, PTT, and TPC, companies which are engaged in the business of petroleum products, then filed a Petition for Declaratory Relief with Application for Temporary Restraining Order and Writ of Preliminary Injunction before the RTC of Makati City, Branch 58.[11]

PIP et al. alleged that DC2019-05-0008 violated their rights and is contrary to Republic Act No. 8479 because: (1) Articles II, IV, and V thereof are forms of price control, and contrary to the policy of full deregulation of the downstream oil industry; (2) Articles II, IV, and V impose impossible requirements on oil companies and other related parties; (3) Articles II, IV, and V do not find support in Republic Act No. 8479, particularly with respect to its anti-trust provisions, with the passage of Republic Act No. 10667; and, (4) DC2019-05-0008 affects PIP et al. and other entities' right to a truly competitive market, and their right against disclosure of their trade secrets and/or privileged or confidential information. Essentially, PIP et al. claimed that DC2019-05-0008 is an ultra vires act of the DOE and prayed that it be declared invalid in its entirety. Moreover, they also prayed for the issuance of a temporary restraining order (TRO) and a writ of preliminary injunction against the DOE.[12]

On June 27, 2019, the RTC conducted the hearing on the application for TRO.[13] In its Order dated June 28, 2019, the RTC granted PIP et al.'s application and ordered the DOE not to enforce DC2019-05-0008 for a period of 20 days from the date of the issuance of the said Order.[14]

Subsequently, on July 12, 2019, PIP et al. filed an Amended Petition for Declaratory Relief with Application for TRO and Writ of Preliminary Injunction.[15] On July 15, 2019, the RTC proceeded to hear the application for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction.[16]","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] assailing the Decision[2] and the Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 164764, which partly granted the Petition for Certiorari[4] filed by the Department of Energy (DOE). In so ruling, the CA reversed and set aside the Resolution[5] dated August 14, 2019 and the Order[6] dated December 3, 2019 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Makati City, Branch 58, insofar as the same granted the application for the issuance of a writ of preliminary junction of Philippine Institute of Petroleum, Inc. (PIP), Isla LPG Corporation (Isla), PTT Philippines Corporation (PTT), and Total Philippines Corporation (TPC) (collectively, PIP et al.).[7] Further, the CA affirmed the RTC's order for the non-dismissal of the main case for the DOE's failure to establish forum shopping and litis pendentia.[8]","The Petition is unmeritorious.

A writ of preliminary injunction is a preservative remedy for the protection of substantial rights and interests. It is not a cause of action itself, but a mere provisional remedy adjunct to a main suit. The purpose of injunction is to prevent threatened or continuous irremediable injury to the parties before their claims can be thoroughly studied, and its sole aim is to preserve the status quo until the merits of the case are fully heard.[33]

The Rules of Court, Rule 58, Sec. 1 provides that a preliminary injunction may be granted by the court at any stage of an action or proceeding prior to the judgment or final order requiring a party or a court, agency. or a person to refrain from a particular act or acts; it may also require the performance of a particular act or acts, in which case it shall be known as a preliminary mandatory injunction. It may be issued when any of the following grounds are established:

(a) That the applicant is entitled to the relief demanded, and the whole or part of such relief consists in restraining the commission or continuance of the act or acts complained of, or in requiring the performance of an act or acts either for a limited period or perpetually;

(b) That the commission, continuance or non-performance of the act or acts complained of during the litigation would probably work injustice to the applicant; or

(c) That a party, court, agency or a person is doing, threatening, or is attempting to do, or is procuring or suffering to be done some act or acts probably in violation of the rights of the applicant respecting the subject of the action or proceeding, and tending to render the judgment ineffectual.[34]

To be entitled to the issuance of an injunctive writ, the following requisites must be present: (a) the applicant must have a clear and unmistakable right to be protected, that is a right in esse; (b) there is a material and substantial invasion of such right; (c) there is an urgent need for the writ to prevent irreparable injury to the applicant; and, (d) no other ordinary, speedy, and adequate remedy exist to prevent the infliction of irreparable injury.[35]

As will be discussed below, the Court finds that the said requisites were not met in the present case.

PIP et al. have no clear and unmistakable right
In Sumifru (Philippines) Corp. v. Spouses Cereño,[36] the Court had the opportunity to discuss the concept of a clear and unmistakable right that may protected by a writ of preliminary injunction, to wit:

A writ of preliminary injunction, being an extraordinary event, one deemed as a strong arm of equity or a transcendent remedy, must be granted only in the face of injury to actual and existing substantial rights. A right to be protected by injunction means a right clearly founded on or granted by law or is enforceable as a matter of law. An injunction is not a remedy to protect or enforce contingent, abstract, or future rights; it will not issue to protect a right not in esse, and which may never arise, or to restrain an act which does not give rise to a cause of action. When the complainant's right is doubtful or disputed, he does not have a clear legal right and, therefore, injunction is not proper. While it is not required that the right claimed by the applicant, as basis for seeking injunctive relief, be conclusively established, it is still necessary to show, at least tentatively, that the right exists and is not vitiated by any substantial challenge or contradiction.[37] (Citations omitted)

Here, PIP et al. primarily anchor their claim of a right in esse based on Republic Act No. 8479, Sec. 2, which provides for the full deregulation of the downstream oil industry:[38]","ACCORDINGLY, the instant Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED.

That[,] unfortunately, the newly constituted PCAB Board adopted and approved Board Resolution No. 915, Series of 2011 mandating the setting up of deadline for cooperatives such as herein plaintiff to reorganize and incorporate into a business corporation as a condition sine qua non for the continuous grant of the Contractor's License[,] thereby directing service cooperatives and herein plaintiff/petitioner to convert itself into a purely business corporation as a requirement for renewal of contractor's license for CY 2013-2014 and[,] likewise, giving all service cooperatives and the herein plaintiff a mandatory period to renew their respective licenses until CY 2012-2013 with the condition that plaintiff should be converted into a purely business corporation as a requirement for the renewal of license for CY 2013-2014...[P]er letter dated 13 January 2012 of OIC Rene E. Fajardo ... respondent reiterated its [directive] for herein service cooperative to convert itself into a purely business corporation in clear defiance of the state policy on the promotion and protection of cooperative[s] enunciated in the Philippine Constitution and articulated in the Cooperative Code of the Philippines under pain of denial of their application for the issuance of Contractor's License;[6]
PCAB, through the Office of the Solicitor General, responded in an Answer[7] dated March 21, 2013, as follows:
11. ..RA 9520, otherwise known as the Philippine Cooperative Code of 2008, has no specific provision authorizing a cooperative to undertake construction contracting per se.

12. While Article 23 of said law, which enumerates different types of cooperatives, provides three (3) activities that obliquely refer to construction, the same is limited by the condition that the activity must be intended to serve only the household members or regular members of the specific cooperative[.]

13. A further reading of RA 9520 would reveal that only agrarian reform cooperatives are given the privilege to undertake construction activities, but with a very limited scope[.]

14. RA 9520 also provides for the requirements for an agrarian reform cooperative to be organized and registered[.]

15. Clearly, the above-stated provisions of RA 9520 warrant only the grant of a special license for specific purposes.

16. Since plaintiff does not claim to be an agrarian reform cooperative, or an electric, housing or water service cooperative[,] and does not possess any of the qualifications in order to be organized and registered as such, then it cannot validly continue undertaking construction contracting under the Philippine Cooperative Code of 2008.

17. Interestingly, RA No. 4566 defines those who may qualify to apply for a contractor's license[.]

18. [P]laintiff... being a cooperative, must also comply with the existing law governing such.

19. Unfortunately, as discussed above, RA 9520 does not provide for a ""construction cooperative""; nor there was [sic] any showing that the Cooperative Development Authority (CDA), the government agency in charge of the registration and regulation of cooperatives, has already determined such type of cooperative.

20. More importantly, it must be pointed out that plaintiff's Contractor's License is a mere privilege. Well-settled is the rule that a license authorizing a person to enjoy a certain privilege is neither a property nor property right[.][8] (Citations omitted)","This Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] seeks to reverse and set aside the Decision[2] of the Court of Appeals (CA). The CA denied the appeal filed by petitioner Philippine Contractors Accreditation Board (PCAB), assailing the Decision[3] and Resolution[4] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) which enjoined the implementation of PCAB's Board Resolution No. 915, series of 2011 (Resolution No. 915) for lack of approval by the President of the Philippines.","The Petition must be dismissed.

PCAB claims that the CA erred in dismissing the appeal based on technicality as the application of the Rules of Court may be relaxed as the instant case involves a matter of paramount public interest.[21] PCAB likewise insists that Resolution No. 915 does not require approval from the President and/or confirmation from the CIAP to be implemented. It underlines that Section 5 of Republic Act No. 4566 and Rule 2 of the Rules and Regulations Governing Licensing and Accreditation of Constructors in the Philippines only refer to the issuance of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of Republic Act No. 4566 and not to any other issuances of PCAB.[22]

We ultimately rule for CMCM Cooperative. The findings of this Court shall be discussed in seriatim.
 
The CA was correct in dismissing PCAB's appeal pursuant to Rule 50, Section 2 of the Rules of Court
 

At the outset, the CA's finding that PCAB solely anchored its appeal on a purely legal question deserves respect from this Court. The primordial issue of the case involves the validity and application of Resolution No. 915. This ascertainment involves a purely legal question, and thus, the dismissal of PCAB's appeal before the CA is the unavoidable outcome.[23] As further held in Republic v. Caraig:[24]
[B]asic is the rule that a question of law arises when there is doubt as to what the law is on a certain state of facts, while there is a question of fact when the doubt arises as to the truth or falsity of the alleged facts. For a question to be one of law, the same must not involve an examination of the probative value of the evidence presented by the litigants or any of them. The resolution of the issue must rest solely on what the law provides on the given set of circumstances.[25]
Under Rule 41, Section 2 of the Rules of Court, there are two modes of appeal from a decision or final order of the trial court in the exercise of its original jurisdiction: (1) by writ of error under Rule 41, Section 2(a) if questions of fact or questions of fact and law are raised or involved; or (2) appeal by certiorari under Rule 41, Section 2(c), in relation to Rule 45, where only questions of law are raised or involved, viz.:[26]
Sec. 2. Modes of appeal. —

(a) Ordinary appeal. — The appeal to the Court of Appeals in cases decided by the Regional Trial Court in the exercise of its original jurisdiction shall be taken by filing a notice of appeal with the court which rendered the judgment or final order appealed from and serving a copy thereof upon the adverse party. No record on appeal shall be required except in special proceedings and other cases of multiple or separate appeals where the law or these Rules so require. In such cases, the record on appeal shall be filed and served in like manner.

....

(c) Appeal by certiorari. — In all cases where only questions of law are raised or involved, the appeal shall be to the Supreme Court by petition for review on certiorari in accordance with Rule 45.
Thus, this Court finds that the CA did not err in dismissing PCAB's appeal. Since what PCAB raised in its appeal was a pure question of law, its proper recourse was to file before this Court a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. In fact, Rule 50, Section 2 of the Rules of Court clearly mandates the outright dismissal of appeals made under Rule 41 thereof, if they only raise pure questions of law,[27] as in this case. Rule 50, Section 2 of the Rules of Court provides:
Sec. 2. Dismissal of improper appeal to the Court of Appeals. — An appeal under Rule 41 taken from the Regional Trial Court to the Court of Appeals raising only questions of law shall be dismissed, issues purely of law not being reviewable by said court. Similarly, an appeal by notice of appeal instead of by petition for review from the appellate judgment of a Regional Trial Court shall be dismissed.
 
An appeal erroneously taken to the Court of Appeals shall not be transferred to the appropriate court but shall be dismissed outright. (Emphasis supplied)
Given that the appeal filed by PCAB before the court a quo raised only questions of law, the CA committed no error in dismissing the Petition in fealty to Rule 50, Section 2 of the Rules of Court. To be sure, the CA's dismissal of PCAB's appeal was the only proper and unavoidable outcome.[28]

The above disquisition provides enough reason to end our discussion. Nevertheless, the Court deems it wise, in the interest of substantial justice, to take another look at this case.
 
Resolution No. 915 is null and void
 ","ACCORDINGLY, the instant Petition is DENIED and the Decision dated June 21, 2018 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 04454-MIN, and effectively, the Decision dated November 7, 2014 and Resolution dated May 2, 2016 of Branch 17, Regional Trial Court of Kidapawan City enjoining the implementation of Philippine Contractors Accreditation Board's Board Resolution No. 915, series of 2011 for lack of approval by the President of the Philippines, are AFFIRMED."
"G.R. No. 221043, July 31, 2024","NOZOMI FORTUNE SERVICES, INC., PETITIONER, VS. CELESTINO A. NAREDO, RESPONDENT.","The instant case stems from a complaint for illegal dismissal filed by respondent Celestino A. Naredo (Naredo) and several others (collectively, complainants) against Nozomi and its branch manager, Ludy Lasiog (Lasiog), as well as Samsung Electro-Mechanics Phils. (Samsung); its president, Jung Soo Lee; and human resources manager, Anna Roselle Dayday.[5] As a manpower business, Nozomi hired complainants and assigned them to Samsung on various dates between 2003 and 2005.[6] They were detailed as production operators for the various electronic components manufactured by Samsung.[7] Sometime in May 2010, Lasiog told complainants that Samsung would absorb them as regular employees if they passed its examination. Unfortunately, they failed to hurdle the tests and Samsung informed them that their services were no longer needed.[8] On July 15, 2010, complainants all tendered their voluntary resignation by submitting handwritten letters citing various personal reasons.[9] A month later, they instituted a complaint for illegal dismissal and regularization before the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC).[10] Complainants averred that they were actually regular employees of Samsung because they had been working for it for more than a year and the nature of their job was necessary and desirable to its usual business. Moreover, Nozomi was a mere labor-only contractor as it did not have substantial capital or investment and that the machines and equipment they used to perform their functions belonged to Samsung. Furthermore, it was Samsung which controlled and supervised them; Nozomi was merely a conduit for the payment of their wages.[11]

Nozomi countered that it was duly registered with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) as an independent job contractor, operating its own medical laboratory and diagnostic services center for its employees. Moreover, it owned various training facilities, had several service agreements with various companies, including Samsung, and had substantial capital to finance its operations.[12]

For its part, Samsung denied liability over complainants, insisting that they were Nozomi's employees who were only assigned to it pursuant to a service contract with Nozomi whenever it was short of regular employees.[13]

In due course, the Labor Arbiter dismissed the complaint for lack of merit. In his Decision,[14] he held that Nozomi carried on an independent business as a contractor. Having been duly registered with the DOLE, it thus enjoys the presumption of being a legitimate independent job contractor. Moreover, Nozomi adduced proof of having substantial capital, and of even having a 2009 net income of PHP 991,413,266.00.[15] Its several facilities, as evidenced by its registration with both the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and the Department of Health (DOH), cater to the medical needs of its employees. While Nozomi has several training facilities and audio-visual centers, finance and EDP centers nationwide, and fully computerized payroll and software development centers, it likewise maintains a separate office in every company which it has a service contract with in order to monitor and supervise its detailed employees.[16] As to the issue on who the complainants' actual employer was, it is clear that Nozomi hired them, paid their wages, exercised the power to discipline and terminate them, and controlled the means and methods in the performance of their work.[17] Hence, it cannot be gainsaid that complainants were Nozomi's regular employees, and not of Samsung. In resolving the argument on illegal dismissal, the LA declared complainants to have voluntarily resigned from their posts. It was incumbent upon them to prove the fact of dismissal before the burden shifted to their employer to prove that it was done for just cause. However, they failed to discharge this burden.[18] Their other monetary claims were also found to be baseless.[19]

On appeal, the NLRC affirmed the judgment[20] of the Labor Arbiter, finding that the conclusions reached upon were supported by the evidence on record. It was abundantly clear that Nozomi was complainants' employer after applying the fourfold test. Moreover, Nozomi was able to prove its status as a legitimate job contractor in this case and in nine other decided cases.[21] The NLRC likewise concurred with the finding that complainants failed to prove their illegal dismissal and entitlement to monetary claims.[22]

Complainants' motion for reconsideration having been rebuffed by the NLRC,[23] Naredo sought recourse before the CA via a Petition for Certiorari.[24]

In the impugned Decision, the CA upheld the finding that Naredo was not illegally dismissed. Nevertheless, it declared that Nozomi is a labor-only contractor and Samsung is respondent's true employer. The CA found the service contract between Nozomi and Samsung as defective since it only provided for deployment of manpower and not for performance of specific work.[25] The CA also declared that Nozomi failed to show other factors or conditions to qualify as an independent contractor aside from possessing substantial capital,[26] and rejected the contention that the DOLE Certificate of Registration confirmed the status of Nozomi as a legitimate independent contractor.[27] As a labor-only contractor, it follows that Samsung is Naredo's true employer and Nozomi merely acted as its agent.[28] Still, there was no proof that Naredo was illegally dismissed. Based on the records, the CA held that he voluntarily resigned.[29]

Nozomi's bid for partial reconsideration was denied in the oppugned Resolution, which led to the filing of the present Petition.

The main issue posited before the Court is whether or not the CA erred in finding grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in the rulings of the NLRC, and in declaring that Nozomi is a labor-only contractor.
","This Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] challenges the Decision[2] and the Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA), which declared that petitioner Nozomi Fortune Services, Inc. (Nozomi) is a labor-only contracting entity, and which denied the Partial Motion for Reconsideration[4] thereof, respectively, in CA-G.R. SP No. 125058.","The Petition is devoid of merit.

At the outset, it must be stressed that in deciding a Rule 45 petition inveighing against the CA's ruling on a Rule 65 petition, the Court is limited to determining whether the CA correctly determined the presence or absence of grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of the NLRC.[30] ""There is grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC when its findings and conclusions are not supported by substantial evidence, i.e., that amount of relevant evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion.""[31]

Additionally, while a Rule 45 petition is generally confined to questions of law, the Court may deviate from this rule when the findings of the labor tribunals on one hand, and the CA on the other, are in conflict,[32] as in the case at bench. In such instances, the Court is compelled to re-evaluate and re-­examine the attendant factual issues and findings.[33]

Guided by the foregoing principles, the Court finds that the CA correctly found grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC when it rendered its rulings.

Preliminarily, the Court takes this occasion to emphasize once more that a DOLE Certificate of Registration, by itself, is not a conclusive proof of legitimacy for a manpower provider. It only prevents the presumption of labor-only contracting from arising.[34] In Caballero v. Vikings Commissary,[35] this Court held that ""[t]o determine whether the contractor was engaged by the principal as a legitimate job contractor or a labor-only contractor, the totality of the facts and the surrounding circumstances are to be considered."" All the features of the relationship are assessed.[36]

Tested against the totality of circumstances established by the evidence presented, the Court finds that the CA correctly held that Nozomi is engaged in labor-only contracting.

The distinction between permissible job contracting and prohibited labor-only contracting is well-established. Caballero explains—
Permissible job contracting ""refers to an arrangement whereby a principal agrees to put out or farm out with a contractor or subcontractor the performance or completion of a specific job, work or service within a definite or predetermined period, regardless of whether such job, work or service is to be performed or completed within or outside the premises of the principal.""[37]
Simply put, permissible job contracting involves contracting out of work, job or service, while prohibited labor-only contracting involves the contracting out of only labor.[38]

This demarcation between the two types of contracting is provided by no less than the Labor Code itself:
ARTICLE 106. Contractor or Subcontractor. — Whenever an employer enters into a contract with another person for the performance of the former's work, the employees of the contractor and of the latter's subcontractor, if any, shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of this Code.

In the event that the contractor or subcontractor fails to pay the wages of his employees in accordance with this Code, the employer shall be jointly and severally liable with his contractor or subcontractor to such employees to the extent of the work performed under the contract, in the same manner and extent that he is liable to employees directly employed by him.

The Secretary of Labor and Employment may, by appropriate regulations, restrict or prohibit the contracting-out of labor to protect the rights of workers established under this Code. In so prohibiting or restricting, he may make appropriate distinctions between labor-only contracting and job contracting as well as differentiations within these types of contracting and determine who among the parties involved shall be considered the employer for purposes of this Code, to prevent any violation or circumvention of any provision of this Code.

There is ""labor-only"" contracting where the person supplying workers to an employer does not have substantial capital or investment in the form of tools, equipment, machineries, work premises, among others, and the workers recruited and placed by such person are performing activities which are directly related to the principal business of such employer. In such cases, the person or intermediary shall be considered merely as an agent of the employer who shall be responsible to the workers in the same manner and extent as if the latter were directly employed by him. (Emphasis supplied)
Based on the above-quoted provision of the Labor Code and pertinent jurisprudence, an entity is engaged in prohibited labor-only contracting when the following are present: ""(1) a person who supplies workers to an employer does not possess substantial capital or investment in the form of tools, pieces of equipment or machinery, work premises, among others; and (2) the workers are made to perform tasks which are directly related to the employer's principal business.""[39]","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED for lack of merit. The December 10, 2014 Decision and the September 3, 2015 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 125058 are AFFIRMED.

"G.R. No. 265651, July 31, 2024","TJ LENDING INVESTORS, INC., REPRESENTED BY TED JOSEPH B. PUNZALAN, PETITIONER, VS. SPOUSES ARTHUR YLADE AND LITA YLADE AND THE REGISTER OF DEEDS OF MANILA, RESPONDENTS.","The present Petition stemmed from a Complaint for sum of money filed by TJ Lending entitled, ""TJ Lending Investors, Inc., represented by its Collection Manager Eduardo M. Punzalan v. Sps. Nenita Generosa­-Cubing and Egmedio Cubing, Sps. Roberto Bueno and Elimar Generosa-Bueno, and Sps. Lita Generosa-Ylade and Arthur Ylade"", which was docketed as Civil Case No. 11-125134 (Collection Case) and raffled to Branch 173, RTC, Manila (RTC Branch 173).[7]

As may be gleaned from the Decision[8] dated June 22, 2012 of the RTC Branch 173 in the Collection Case, the Spouses Nenita Generosa­-Cubing and Egmedio Cubing (collectively, the Spouses Cubing) obtained a loan from TJ Lending in the amount of PHP 940,190.94, evidenced by a promissory note that they executed in favor of TJ Lending. In support of the loan, Lita, the sister of Nenita Generosa-Cubing,[9] executed and signed a co-maker statement, which made her solidarily liable with the Spouses Cubing for the payment of the loan obligation to TJ Lending. The Spouses Cubing defaulted in their payment that prompted TJ Lending to institute the Collection Case.

In its Decision,[10] the RTC Branch 173 held that the obligations of the Spouses Cubing, as principal debtors under the promissory note, and Lita, as co-maker and solidary debtor under the co-maker statement, must be complied with pursuant to Articles 1157[11] and 1159[12] of the Civil Code. However, the RTC Branch 173 dismissed the action against Arthur and the Spouses Roberto Bueno and Elimer Bueno because they were not signatories to the promissory note or the co-maker statement, viz.:
WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered ordering defendants Spouses Nenita Generosa-Cubing and Egmedio Cubing (jointly) and Lita Generosa-Ylade (solidarily) to pay TJ Lending Investors, Inc. the following sums, to wit:

1) [PHP] 940,190.94 with legal interest of twelve percent (12%) per annum from the filing of the complaint on February 7, 2011 up to its full satisfaction;

2) [PHP] 20,000.00 as attorney's fees; and

3) [PHP] 35,284.74 as cost of suit.

The actions against Spouses Roberto Bueno and Elimar Bueno and Arthur Ylade are hereby DISMISSED for lack of evidence.

SO ORDERED.[13] (Emphasis in the original)
The Decision of the RTC Branch 173 became final and executory.[14] To satisfy the judgment debt, the Sheriff attached and levied upon a real property located in Tondo, Manila and covered by TCT No. 170488 (subject property).[15] In the TCT, it is stated that the subject property ""is registered in accordance with the provisions of section 103 of the Property Registration Decree in the name of ARTHUR C. YLADE, married to Lita Ylade, both of legal age, Filipino citizens[.]""[16]

During the execution sale of the subject property, TJ Lending won as the highest bidder. The Sheriff then issued a Certificate of Sale[17] to TJ Lending.[18]

The subject property was not redeemed within the one-year redemption period.[19] Thus, the RTC Branch 173 issued a Final Deed of Sale[20] to TJ Lending.[21]

Arthur filed with the RTC Branch 173 a Motion to Nullify Levy and Execution Sale and to Cancel the Certificate of Sale and the Final Deed of Sale[22] (Motion to Annul Execution Sale). He averred that the judgment debt cannot be satisfied with the subject property that he exclusively owns considering that the Collection Case was dismissed as to him and he was not among the judgment debtors found liable by the RTC Branch 173; hence, the execution sale was null and void.[23]

However, the RTC Branch 173 denied Arthur's motion. It emphasized that Arthur was declared in default in the Collection Case; thus, he has lost his standing in court and cannot question the execution sale of the subject property. It also determined that Arthur has waived any objection to the execution sale due to his failure to redeem the subject property within the one-year redemption period.[24]

TJ Lending then sent a demand letter[25] to the Spouses Ylade and demanded the surrender of the Owner's Duplicate of TCT No. 170488.[26] However, the demand was unheeded. Thus, TJ Lending filed its Petition for the Surrender of Title against respondents which was docketed as Case No. P-16-0214 and raffled to RTC Branch 4.[27] It argued that respondents must be directed to surrender the Owner's Duplicate of TCT No. 170488 because the RTC Branch 173 already issued a Final Deed of Sale to TJ Lending.

In his Answer and Opposition to the Petition for Surrender of Title, Arthur insisted that the subject property is his exclusive property because he acquired it from the National Housing Authority (NHA) before he married Lita on December 28, 1985, although TCT No. 170488 was issued later, on August 7, 1986. Given that the Collection Case was dismissed against him and he was not found liable as a judgment debtor in that case, the execution sale of the subject property to satisfy the money judgment in the Collection Case was improper.[28]

Arthur further averred that, even assuming that the subject property is a conjugal property, a debt separately incurred by Lita cannot be automatically charged against the conjugal properties, unless it is established that the debt redounded to the benefit of the family. He argued that the judgment debt in the Collection Case has not been shown to have redounded to the benefit of his family considering that Lita was merely a co-maker for the principal debtors, the Spouses Cubing.[29]","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] (Petition) under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assailing the Decision[2] dated July 5, 2022, and the Resolution[3] dated February 14, 2023, of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 112633. The CA reversed and set aside the Decision[4] dated August 20, 2018, and the Resolution[5] dated October 22, 2018, of Branch 4, Regional Trial Court (RTC Branch 4), Manila, in Case No. P-16-0214 which granted the Petition for the surrender of Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 170488 filed by petitioner TJ Lending Investors, Inc. (TJ Lending) against respondents Spouses Arthur Ylade (Arthur) and Lita Ylade (Lita) (collectively, Spouses Ylade).[6]","The Petition is denied for lack of merit. The CA Decision and Resolution are affirmed with modification in that, the execution sale of the subject property is also declared null and void. 
 
TJ Lending failed to adduce preponderant evidence proving that the subject property is presumed conjugal under Article 160 of the Civil Code
 

The marriage between the Spouses Ylade was celebrated on December 28, 1985,[44] before the Family Code took effect in 1988.[45] As such, the property regime of the Spouses Ylade is that of conjugal partnership of gains under the Civil Code.[46]

Under Article 160 of the Civil Code, ""[a]ll property of the marriage is presumed to belong to the conjugal partnership, unless it be proved that it pertains exclusively to the husband or to the wife."" For the presumption to apply, TJ Lending should have presented a preponderance of evidence proving that the subject property was acquired during the marriage of the Spouses Ylade.[47] ""Proof of acquisition during the coverture is a condition sine qua non to the operation of the presumption in favor of the conjugal partnership.""[48] Otherwise said, the presumption cannot operate absent sufficient evidence proving that the property was acquired during the marriage.[49]

The Court finds that TJ Lending failed to present a preponderance of evidence proving that the subject property was acquired during the marriage of the Spouses Ylade which would, in turn, give rise to the presumption that the property belongs to the conjugal partnership.

To support its claim, TJ Lending relies on TCT No. 170488 which states that the subject property ""is registered in accordance with the provisions of section 103 of the Property Registration Decree in the name of ARTHUR C. YLADE, married to Lita Ylade, both of legal age, Filipino citizens[.]""[50] It also emphasizes that TCT No. 170488 was issued on August 7, 1986, during the subsistence of the marriage of the Spouses Ylade. Supposedly, the foregoing are sufficient proof that the property was acquired during the marriage of the Spouses Ylade.

The Court disagrees.","WHEREFORE, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED for lack of merit. The Decision dated July 5, 2022 and the Resolution dated February 14, 2023 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 112633 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION, in that:

" G.R. No. 239983, July 31, 2024","REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, REPRESENTED BY MAJOR GENERAL DIONISIO R. SANTIAGO, COMMANDING GENERAL OF THE ARMED FORCES OF THE PHILIPPINES (AFP) VISAYAS COMMAND, PETITIONER, VS. SPOUSES JOHNNY AND CHONA YU, RESPONDENTS.","The present case stemmed from a Complaint[5] filed by petitioner, praying for the RTC to enjoin Spouses Yu from constructing their residential house on the subject 252-square meter (sqm.) portion of Lot No. 933 (Lot 933), situated in Lahug, Cebu City, and direct the Register of Deeds (RD) to cancel Transfer Certificate of Title No. (TCT) 150040[6] issued in the latter's name and, in lieu thereof, issue a new title in the name of the Republic.[7]

Petitioner alleged that it, through the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) Visayas Command, is the absolute owner of Lot 933, consisting of 37,126 square meters, which was originally registered in the names of Francisco Racaza, Pantaleon Cabrera, and Josefina R. Martinez.[8] Additionally, it claimed that the said lot is part and parcel of the Camp Lapu-Lapu military reservation and is valued at more than PHP 100,000,000.00.[9]

Petitioner narrated that on October 19, 1938, the then-Commonwealth of the Philippines (Commonwealth) initiated expropriation proceedings and took possession of several parcels of land forming part of the Banilad Friar Lands Estate and included therein is Lot 933 situated in Lahug, Cebu City. The expropriation case was titled Commonwealth of the Philippines v. Borromeo, et. al., docketed as Civil Case No. 781 before then Court of First Instance, Cebu City, 8th Judicial District, Branch II (CFI).[10]

On May 14, 1940, the CFI rendered a Decision condemning the subject parcels of land in favor of the Commonwealth. The CFI Decision became final and executory and an entry of judgment was made on April 5, 1948.[11] Despite the CFI Decision, however, the original registered owners sold Lot 933 to another person/s and subsequently, sold and resold, and thereafter, new certificates of title/s were issued. Among these new certificates of title is TCT 150040 issued in the names of Spouses Yu covering the 252-sqm. portion of Lot 933, known as Lot 1, Psd-07-00133 (being a portion of the consolidation-­subdivision of Lot Nos. 933-C-1, 933-C-2, 933-C-3, and 933-C-4 LRC PSD-138296 Record No. 5988). Petitioner averred that since it already acquired Lot 933 through expropriation, TCT 150040 issued in Spouses Yu's name is null and void.[12]

For their part,[13] the Spouses Yu claimed that they validly purchased the 252-sqm. portion of Lot 933, which they have been in peaceful possession of and for which they have been paying taxes[14] thereon since their acquisition from the previous owner. Additionally, they averred that before they constructed their residential house on the subject lot, they first secured the necessary clearances and permits[15] from the Office of the Building Official, Cebu City, and no opposition whatsoever was interposed by the AFP Visayas Command, Camp Lapu-Lapu. It was only after they began the construction of the fence and residential house on the premises that personnel of Camp Lapu­-Lapu, under the command of one Lt. Col. Francisco G. Ventus, and upon his orders, threatened the workers at the construction site and confiscated their tools and other implements.[16]

In this regard, Spouses Yu asserted that Lot 933 has never been part of Camp Lapu-Lapu; and that the construction of their residential house thereon cannot in any way constitute a security hazard to the operations of the Camp or cause irreparable damage and injury to the government. Additionally, they argued that assuming Lot 933 was included in the expropriation in favor of the government, there was no showing that the owners of the property had been paid their just compensation. Finally, assuming that payment was made, the execution of the judgment for expropriation has already prescribed.[17]

In support of their claim of ownership over the subject portion, Spouses Yu submitted in evidence, among others: (i) copy of the various titles covering Lot 933 beginning with the title issued in the original registered owners' names up to their title over the subject portion;[18] and (ii) the Tax Declaration and Realty Tax Payment Receipt.[19]","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court filed by the Republic of the Philippines, represented by Major General Dionisio R. Santiago, Commanding General of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (petitioner), assailing the Decision[2] dated July 19, 2017 and the Resolution[3] dated May 24, 2018 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 03770. The assailed CA rulings reversed and set aside the Decision[4] dated October 6, 2005 of Branch 5, Regional Trial Court of Cebu City (RTC) in Civil Case No. CEB-26924, and accordingly, dismissed petitioner's Complaint against respondents Spouses Johnny and Chona Yu (Spouses Yu).","The Petition is without merit.

Injunction is defined as ""judicial writ, process or proceeding whereby a party is ordered to do or refrain from doing a certain act.""[52] Injunctive relief is only available when there is a pressing necessity to avoid injurious consequences which cannot be remedied under any standard of compensation.[53] It must be proven that the violation sought to be prevented would result in an irremediable injustice.[54]

Accordingly, case law settles that injunction is a preservative remedy aimed at protecting substantive rights and interests. The very foundation of the jurisdiction to issue a writ of injunction rests on the existence of a cause of action and on the probability of irreparable injury, inadequacy of pecuniary compensation, and the prevention of multiplicity of suits. Where facts are not shown to bring the case within these conditions, the relief of injunction should be refused. Thus, to be entitled to injunctive relief, the party seeking the same must establish the following requisites: (1) the right of complainant is clear and unmistakable; and (2) the invasion of a right sought to be protected is material and substantial.[55]

In this case, in asserting its right to the issuance of an injunctive relief against Spouses Yu over the subject portion of Lot 933, petitioner heavily relies on (i) the Court's ruling in Valdehueza which upheld the validity of the expropriation of the lots comprising the Banilad Friar Lands Estate in Civil Case No. 781, and (ii) the alleged presence of government or military structures on Lot 933 which, it claimed, should have put Spouses Yu on notice that the subject portion is owned by the government.

A judicious review of the records and circumstances surrounding the case convinces the Court that no reversible error attended the rulings of the CA in dismissing petitioner's Complaint. As the succeeding discussions will show, petitioner failed to (i) establish a clear and unmistakable right to the portion of Lot 933 subject of its Complaint and (ii) show that the invasion of a right sought to be protected is material and substantial.

Firstly, petitioner failed to prove that it had paid the full amount of the just compensation for the lots expropriated by virtue of the CFI Decision in Civil Case No. 781. Moreover, notwithstanding the CFI Decision in Civil Case No. 781 and despite the lapse of 61 long years from the issuance thereof, petitioner never had the title over Lot 933 transferred in its name, or at the very least, had the CFI Decision annotated on the title covering Lot 933.

Notably, the issue of ownership and possession of the lots comprising the Banilad Friar Lands Estate, which includes Lot 933, that were subject of the expropriation proceedings in Civil Case No. 781 had been in fact the subject of earlier proceedings which the Court had the occasion to rule upon and settle.

Primarily, after Valdehueza, the Court, in Republic v. Lim,[56] held that petitioner's ownership over the Banilad Friar Lands Estate, which were expropriated pursuant to the CFI Decision in Civil Case No. 781, is conditioned upon full payment of just compensation within a reasonable time. Since petitioner failed to prove that it had paid the full amount of the just compensation due for the expropriated lots, there was no transfer of title from the landowner to the expropriator, herein petitioner, and precluded the perfection of its title over the expropriated properties. Indeed, as the Court observed therein, despite the opportunities accorded to petitioner upon the issuance of the CFI Decision in Civil Case No. 781 and 57 years thereafter, it still failed to pay the just compensation due to the original registered owners, thus:
It bears stressing that the Republic was ordered to pay just compensation twice, the first was in the expropriation proceedings and the second, in Valdehueza. Fifty-seven (57) years have passed since then. We cannot but construe the Republic's failure to pay just compensation as a deliberate refusal on its part. Under such circumstance, recovery of possession is in order.[57] (Emphasis supplied)
On this score, it bears highlighting that despite the CFI Decision in Civil Case No. 781, the lapse of more than 61 years since then up to the filing of the injunctive Complaint subject of the present Petition in 2001, and the ruling in Lim, there still appears to have been no payment made by petitioner of the just compensation due to the original registered owners. Verily, the exceptional circumstances that attended the Court's ruling in Lim are likewise present in this case that squarely makes Lim applicable.

More recently in San Roque Realty and Development, the Court settled that there was no valid and complete expropriation of the said lots comprising the Banilad Friar Lands Estate for failure of petitioner to prove payment of the just compensation due, and that, as regards Lot 933, the CFI Decision in Civil Case No. 781 had not become final and executory as to be binding on the original registered owners thereof, including its subsequent transferees. The Court held:
At the outset, we note that issues of ownership and possession of several lots included in the 18 parcels of land covering the Banilad Friar Lands Estate had been the subject of earlier controversies which we already had occasion to rule upon. Lot Nos. 932 and 939 were the subject of Valdehueza v. Republic which is ubiquitously invoked by the Republic in this case. Republic v. Lim dealt with the special circumstances surrounding the incomplete and ineffectual expropriation of Lot No. 932. On the other hand, Federated Realty Corporation v. Court of Appeals preliminarily determined the state of ownership and possession of a portion of Lot No. 933, particularly Lot 3, covered by TCT No. 119929.

In Valdehueza, we held that the registered lot owners were not entitled to recover possession of the expropriated lots considering that the titles contained annotations of the right of the National Airports Corporation (now CAA) to pay for and acquire said lots.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED.

Acting on the PDs, the Philippine Army's Bids, Negotiations and Acceptance Committee (BNAC) convened and instructed the ASCOM to conduct a canvass on the CCIE items sought to be procured. The BNAC was composed of Colonel Cesar Santos (COL Santos), as BNAC Chairman; Captain Ferdinand Fevidal (CAPT Fedival), L/C Cabreros, and L/C Zumel, as BAC Members; and L/C Dosado, as BNAC Secretariat. Since the events were drawing near, the BNAC issued a resolution to procure the CCIE items through ""shopping"" due to its supposed urgency.[7]

Acting on the resolution, L/C Dosado, as BNAC Secretary, issued the Certificates of Purchase through Shopping containing the names of three suppliers and manufacturers, as well as the price quotations for the items. Out of three interested suppliers, the BNAC selected Dantes Executive Menswear since it purportedly offered the ""lowest, fairest, and best-complying offer."" Thereafter, COL Santos, L/C Zumel, and L/C Cabreros issued and signed the Abstract of Canvass and Recommendation of Award, Certificate of Reasonableness of Price dated February 25, 2003, and Notice to Proceed dated June 18, 2003.[8]

Subsequently, six separate Purchase Orders (POs) in favor of Dantes Executive Menswear were prepared and signed by Lieutenant General Gregorio Camiling, Jr. (LTG Camiling, Jr.), Commanding General of the Philippine Army; Colonel Custodio Salosagcol, Acting Commanding Officer of ASCOM; and Rolando Minel, Chief Accountant of the Philippine Army, who all certified that funds were available for the purpose.[9]

On June 19, 2003, the POs were forwarded to and received by Conrad Cuenca of Dantes Executive Menswear.[10]

On June 30, 2003, Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) on the POs were issued and signed by Brigadier General Severino P. Estrello (BG Estrello), Commanding General of the ASCOM. He certified that the expenses were necessary, lawful, and incurred under his supervision. It was LTG Camiling, Jr., who approved the payment while Atty. Editha Santos, Head of the Accounting Unit of the AFP, certified that the supporting documents were complete and proper.[11]

On October 7, 2003, the Memorandum dated August 20, 2003 of State Auditor Manuel Baes was referred to the Office of the Ombudsman for fact­-finding investigation in light of the following alleged irregularities in the procurement of the CCIE items, viz.: (1) the items procured were issued directly to the end-users without first recording them on the stock ledger card, hence, the physical existence of the delivery could not be ascertained; (2) the procurement was through shopping; and (3) the POs were prepared on the same date for the purchase of similar items, indicating that there was splitting of contracts which violated COA Circular No. 76-41 dated July 30, 1976.[12]

The Office of the Ombudsman nonetheless endorsed the case back to the COA on February 27, 2004 for fraud audit.[13]","These consolidated Petitions for Certiorari[1] under Rule 64 in relation to Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, assail the following dispositions of respondent Commission on Audit (COA), viz.:

The Petition before the COA Proper was filed out of time but the Court relaxes the rule on immutability of judgment in the higher interest of substantial justice

The procedure for filing an appeal before the COA is governed by the 2009 RRPC, thus:
RULE V
PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE DIRECTOR
. . . .

Section 4. When Appeal Taken. — An Appeal must be filed within six (6) months after receipt of the decision appealed from.

Section 5. Interruption of Time to Appeal. — The receipt by the Director of the Appeal Memorandum shall stop the running of the period to appeal which shall resume to run upon receipt by the appellant of the Director's decision.

. . . .

RULE VII
PETITION FOR REVIEW TO THE COMMISSION PROPER

. . . .

Section 3. Period of Appeal. — The appeal shall be taken within the time remaining of the six (6) months period under Section 4, Rule V, taking into account the suspension of the running thereof under Section 5 of the same Rule in case of appeals from the Director's decision, . . .

. . . .

Section 5. Contents of Petition. — The petition for review shall contain a concise statement of the facts and issues involved and the grounds relied upon for the review, and shall be accompanied by a certified true copy of the decision appealed from, together with certified true copies of such relevant portions of the record as are referred to therein and other supporting papers. The petition shall state the specific dates to show that it was filed within the reglementary period.
As ordained, an appeal to the COA Regional Director must be filed within six months or 180 days after receipt of the ND, and the appeal before the COA Proper shall be taken within the remaining period of six months under the proceedings before the Director.[49]

Here, L/C Cabreros et al. filed their Appeal Memorandum with the COA Regional Director–NGS Cluster B only on April 11, 2011 or after the lapse of 163 days from their receipt of the ND No. 10-001-101-(03) on October 29, 2010. Thus, since the appeal to the COA Proper should be filed within 180 days from October 29, 2010, they only had 17 days left. Records show, however, that they filed their appeal before the COA Proper only on October 4, 2013, or after 583 days reckoned from February 29, 2012 when they received the February 6, 2012 Decision of the COA Regional Director­–NGS Cluster B.

Thus, as correctly ruled by the COA Proper, L/C Cabreros et al.'s appeal before it was filed out of time. It therefore rendered the February 6, 2012 Decision of the COA–NGS final and immutable.

True, the Court emphasized in many cases that procedural rules should be treated with utmost respect and due regard since they are designed precisely to facilitate the adjudication of cases to remedy the worsening problem of delay in the resolution of rival claims and in the administration of justice.[50] Nonetheless, the principle of immutability of judgment admits of several exceptions,[51] such as:
(1) the correction of clerical errors;
(2) the so-called nunc pro tunc entries which cause no prejudice to any party;
(3) void judgments; and
(4) whenever circumstances transpire after the finality of the decision rendering its execution unjust and inequitable.[52]
The Court has further allowed the relaxation of the rule on finality of judgments in order to serve substantial justice,[53] taking into account:
(1) matters of life, liberty, honor, or property;
(2) the existence of special or compelling circumstances;
(3) the merits of the case;
(4) a cause not entirely attributable to the fault or negligence of the party favored by the suspension of the rules;
(5) a lack of any showing that the review sought is merely frivolous and dilatory; and
(6) the other party will not be unjustly prejudiced thereby.[54]
In De Castro v. Commission on Audit,[55] the Court resolved the case on the merits despite the fact that the petition before the Supreme Court was filed 10 days late since it involved disallowances amounting to more than PHP 30,000,000.00.

In Razalan v. Commission on Audit,[56] the Court also took cognizance of the petition and resolved it on the merits despite its late filing by eight days considering the hefty amount involved, and the fact that the municipality of Mayantoc, Tarlac and its constituents have actually benefited and continuously benefit from the construction of the Mayantoc Memorial Park Project.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petitions are GRANTED IN PART. The Resolutions dated August 18, 2017 in Decision No. 2017-243 and January 24, 2022 in Decision No. 2022-382 of the Commission on Audit are AFFIRMED WITH MODIFICATION. Petitioners Lieutenant Colonel George P. Cabreros, Lieutenant Colonel Barmel B. Zumel, and Lieutenant Colonel Jessie Mario B. Dosado are EXCUSED from returning the disallowed amount of PHP 5,103,000.00.

NATIONAL COMMISSION ON INDIGENOUS PEOPLES, REGISTER OF DEEDS – BAGUIO CITY, LAND REGISTRATION AUTHORITY, HEIRS OF LAURO CARANTES, DIMSON MANILA, INC., JOAN L. GORIO, AND CERTAIN JANE DOES AND JOHN DOES, RESPONDENTS.","In the July 11, 2023 Decision,[6] this Court held that Baguio City is exempted from the coverage of the IPRA as Section 78 of the law provides that Baguio City is governed by its own charter.[7] Consequently, the claim of the heirs of Carantes over properties within Baguio City may not be recognized under IPRA.[8] However, the Court also held that ""the law does not overturn the doctrine laid down in Cariño v. Insular Government which recognizes the ownership of land occupied and possessed since time immemorial.""[9]

The dispositive portion of the Decision reads:
ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review is GRANTED. The Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals dated January 30, 2013 and September 10, 2013 respectively in CA-G.R. SP No. 118259 are SET ASIDE.

SO ORDERED.[10] (Emphasis in the original)
Respondents National Commission on Indigenous Peoples[11], Heirs of Lauro Carantes and Joan L. Gorio,[12] and Other Heirs of Lauro Carantes[13] have since filed their respective Motions for Reconsideration which raised substantially the same arguments.","Baguio City is exempted from the coverage of the Indigenous Peoples' Rights Act[1] (IPRA) except for native title to land, that is, ownership since time immemorial where the indigenous peoples are still in actual possession of the land.

This resolves the Motions for Reconsideration[2] of this Court's July 11, 2023 Decision[3] granting the Petition for Review on Certiorari and setting aside the Decision[4] and Resolution[5] of the Court of Appeals. In granting the petition, this Court ruled that Certificates of Ancestral Land Titles cannot be issued in favor of the heirs of Lauro Carantes (heirs of Carantes).","The Court finds no compelling reason to overturn its July 11, 2023 Decision. The issues raised by respondents have already been duly considered and passed upon by the Court in its assailed Decision.

Nevertheless, it bears stressing that Baguio City is exempted from the coverage of IPRA except for native title, that is, ownership since time immemorial where the indigenous peoples are in open, continuous, and actual possession of the land up to the present.

Native title as defined in IPRA refers to ""pre-conquest rights to lands and domains which, as far back as memory reaches, have been held under a claim of private ownership by [indigenous cultural communities/indigenous peoples], have never been public lands[,] and are thus indisputably presumed to have been held that way since before the Spanish Conquest.""[18]

In Federation of Coron, Busuanga, Palawan Farmer's Association, Inc. v. Secretary of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources,[19] this Court clarified that the concept of native title is an exception to the Regalian Doctrine:
Pursuant to the Regalian Doctrine (Jura Regalia), a legal concept first introduced into the country from the West by Spain through the Laws of the Indies and the Royal Cedulas, all lands of the public domain belong to the State. This means that the State is the source of any asserted right to ownership of land, and is charged with the conservation of such patrimony. All lands not appearing to be clearly under private ownership are presumed to belong to the State. Also, public lands remain part of the inalienable land of the public domain unless the Stale is shown to have reclassified or alienated them to private persons.
","ACCORDINGLY, the Motions for Reconsideration are DENIED with FINALITY. The Decision of the Court dated July 11, 2023 is AFFIRMED.

" A.M. No. 23-04-05-SC, July 30, 2024 ",RE: ILLEGAL CAMPAIGN AND ACTIVITIES IN INTEGRATED BAR OF THE PHILIPPINES – CENTRAL LUZON ALLEGEDLY PERPETRATED BY ATTY. NILO DIVINA,"According to the Anonymous Letter, it is allegedly an open secret that Atty. Divina wants to become IBP-Central Luzon Governor as a stepping stone to become the IBP National President. Atty. Divina has allegedly spent hundreds of thousands, if not millions of pesos, in prohibited campaign activities. In particular, the Anonymous Letter highlights the following instances wherein Atty. Divina allegedly foot the bill on behalf of the IBP-Central Luzon Officers:[2]

1.
During the Summer of 2022, Atty. Divina brought the IBP-Central Luzon Officers to the Balesin Island Club in Polilio, Quezon;
 	 
2.
On December 2022, Atty. Divina gave out cash and gift checks worth hundreds of thousands of pesos to IBP-Central Luzon Officers; and
 	 
3.
On February 2023, Atty. Divina brought the IBP-Central Luzon Officers to Bali, Indonesia[3]
The Anonymous Letter further enumerates the following IBP-Central Luzon Officers who were identified from several Facebook publications to be present in Bali, Indonesia, together with Atty. Divina, namely: ""Winston Ginez,"" ""Buko dela Cruz,"" ""Peng dela Rama,"" and ""Jade Molo.""[4]

The Anonymous Letter likewise attached a copy of a Letter titled ""My Story,"" allegedly written by Atty. Jocelyn Z. Martinez-Clemente (Atty. Clemente), wherein, among others, it detailed a meeting she had with Atty. Adenn Sigua (Atty. Sigua), Atty. Peter Paul S. Maglalang (Atty. Maglalang), Atty. Myla Matic,[5] and Atty. Divina, at the latter's office in Makati. During the said meeting, Atty. Clemente was allegedly asked what position she would want if Atty. Divina became IBP-Central Luzon Governor. Thereafter, they were allegedly given Sodexo gift certificates in the amount of PHP 50,000.00.[6]

In Our Resolution[7] dated April 11, 2023, We directed the following individuals identified in the Anonymous Letter to file their respective Comments thereto: ""(1) Atty. Nilo Divina; (2) Winston Ginez; (3) Peng dela Rama; (4) Buko dela Cruz; (5) Jade Molo; (6) Atty. Jo Clemente; and (7) Atty. Peter Paul S. Maglalang.""[8] Moreover, this Court likewise directed the IBP National Officers and IBP-Central Luzon Officers to inform the Court of the identities of every person appearing in the photos attached to the Anonymous Letter.[9]","The instant case arose from an Anonymous Letter[1] dated March 24, 2023 (Anonymous Letter) filed against Atty. Nilo T. Divina (Atty. Divina) for alleged illegal campaigning activities relative to the election of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP)-Central Luzon Region.","This Court cannot sustain its ruling merely on inferences and unconfirmed theories alone.

Second, the acts adverted to in the Anonymous Letter committed by Atty. Divina was done during the Summer of 2022, December of 2022 and last February 2023, months prior to the scheduled May 5, 2023 IBP-Central Luzon elections. During this time, the members of the House of Delegates – who may nominate and elect the Governor for each Region, have yet to be elected by the local chapters.

Under Section 39 of the Revised IBP By-Laws, the Delegates from each Region shall elect the Governor for their Region. Relatedly, Section 31 states that the membership of the House of Delegates shall consist of all the Chapter Presidents, and in the case of Chapters entitled to more than one Delegate each, the Vice-Presidents of the Chapters and such additional Delegates as the Chapters are entitled to.

Hence with respect to the members of the House of Delegates who may nominate and elect Atty. Divina as Governor for the term 2023-2025, they have yet to be elected during the time that Atty. Divina performed the acts complained of.

Third, the Court finds it tenuous to draw parallelisms with the 1989 IBP National Elections and the present controversy.

In Re: 1989 Elections of the IBP, the candidates for IBP President had announced their candidacies when they perpetrated the prohibited activities. On the other hand, there is no indication that Atty. Divina has or had intention to run for Governor of IBP-Central Luzon when he sponsored the trips of the Regional officers. In fact, the lack of intention to run for the said position was re-affirmed in his Compliance filed before the Court.

Moreover, in Re: 1989 Elections of the IBP, the acts committed by the candidates were found to clearly influence the members of the House of Delegates relative to the election of IBP President. In the present case, according to the participants of the trips sponsored by Atty. Divina, they were team-building activities designed to strengthen the IBP-Central Luzon office.

This was even echoed by Atty. Clemente, that the trip to Balesin Island Club was a ""regional team-building activity"" and that ""to say now that such trip was meant to build patronage for Dean Divina is to undermine the team-building purpose of the activity.""

Given the foregoing, We find that the acts complained of against Atty. Divina in sponsoring the trips of the IBP-Central Luzon officers do not amount to a violation of Section 14 of the Revised IBP By-Laws.

Nevertheless, We find Atty. Divina Guilty of Simple Misconduct in Violation of Canon II, Sections 1 and 2 of the CPRA
Although We find that Atty. Divina did not commit any prohibited acts and practices relative to elections in the IBP, We nevertheless find him guilty of violating Canon II, Sections 1 and 2 of the CPRA.","ACCORDINGLY, the Court finds Atty. Nilo T. Divina GUILTY of Simple Misconduct in violation of Canon II, Section 1 and Section 2 of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability and is hereby FINED PHP 100,000.00 with a STERN WARNING that a repetition of the same or similar offense will be dealt with more severely.

The Court likewise finds Attys. Peter Paul S. Maglalang, Winston M. Ginez, Jocelyn ""Jo"" M. Clemente, Jade Paulo T. Molo, Enrique V. Dela Cruz, Jr., and Jose I. Dela Rama, Jr., GUILTY of simple misconduct in violation of Canon II, Section 1 and Section 2 of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability and are hereby FINED PHP 100,000.00 each with a STERN WARNING that a repetition of the same or similar offense will be dealt with more severely.

A perusal of the instant document shows that, although it was signed by several persons from different barangays and municipalities of the Province of Pangasinan, it did not specifically state the position involved and other details required for an election protest. Please be reminded that if you are contesting the elections or returns of an elective regional, provincial or city official, the petition should be filed directly with the Commission, through the Electoral Contests and Adjudication Department (ECAD), by any candidate who was voted for in the same office and who received the second or third highest number of votes, among others, as reflected in the Statement of Votes.
. . . .
On the other hand, if the instant election contest involves municipal officials, the verified petition should be directly filed before the proper Regional Trial Court also by a candidate who was voted for the same office and who received the second or third highest number of votes. In which case, the procedure provided in A.M. No. 10-4-1-SC shall be observed.","Before this Court is a Petition for Certiorari and Mandamus[1] filed as a class suit in representation of all voters of the Province of Pangasinan who were allegedly denied their rights of suffrage, to petition the government for redress of grievances, and to have access to information on matters of public concern. Petitioners Clarylyn A. Legaspi et al. (Legaspi et al.) assert that said rights of theirs were affected by the supposed inaction of respondent vis-à-vis their requests for a manual recount (at their expense) of the provincial results for all positions contested in the May 9, 2022 National and Local Elections, and said inaction is argued to have effectively amounted to grave abuse of discretion and denial of due process on the part of respondent Commission on Elections (COMELEC).","The instant petition must be dismissed.

In dealing with the six identified issues in seriatim, the Court now first discusses the sufficiency (or lack thereof) of the verifications made by Legaspi, et al.

Verification under the extant 2019 Rules of Court is defined under Rule 7, Section 4, viz.:
Section 4. Verification. Except when otherwise specifically required by law or rule, pleadings need not be under oath or verified.

A pleading is verified by an affidavit of an affiant duly authorized to sign said verification. The authorization of the affiant to act on behalf of a party, whether in the form of a secretary's certificate or a special power of attorney, should be attached to the pleading, and shall allege the following attestations:

(a) The allegations in the pleading are true and correct based on [their] personal knowledge, or based on authentic documents;

(b) The pleading is not filed to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation; and

(c) The factual allegations therein have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likewise have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for discovery.

The signature of the affiant shall further serve as a certification of the truthfulness of the allegations in the pleading.
A pleading required to be verified that contains a verification based on ""information and belief,"" or upon ""knowledge, information and belief,"" or lacks a proper verification, shall be treated as an unsigned pleading.
Indeed, petitions for certiorari and mandamus are required to be properly verified under Rule 65, Sections 1[24] and 3.[25] Poring over the verifications done and accomplished by Legaspi, et al., they all indeed contain phrases basically stating under oath that they individually attest that the instant petition contains true and correct statements based on their personal knowledge and existing authentic documents. However, the Court is at pains to determine how they were able to have personal knowledge of the following facts:
1) The alleged unusual speed of the transmission of the electoral results from the VCMs to COMELEC's transparency server on May 9, 2022, since they evidently were not present during the VCMs' transmission and had only monitored the election results on social media, on television, and on COMELEC's website (i.e., they were not present nearby any VCM or at respondent's headquarters housing the transparency server during the said transmission of results);

2) The observations of technical experts and international observers vis-à-vis the May 9, 2022 National and Local Elections, which they only came to know of via social media or sources online that are unauthenticated for evidentiary purposes; and

3) Their actual participation in the signing of the APELA, since again, the signature pages were not submitted as part of the records of the instant petition.
Florenz D. Regalado (Regalado), an eminent commentator and former member of the Court, wrote the following with regard to the rule on verification (i.e., Rule 7, Section 4):
The second paragraph of this section has been further amended so that the pleader's affirmation of the truth and correctness of the allegations in his pleading shall be based not only on his ""knowledge and belief' but specifically on his ""personal knowledge or based on authentic records."" In the 1964 Rules of Court, Sec. 6 of Rule 7 required personal knowledge of the facts averred, which was considered too strict since a person can reasonably affirm a fact based on his belief in its truth when there is or has been no other fact or reason contrary thereto.

However, that liberalized version is better regulated by the present amended provisions that facts should be attested to on the basis of one's personal knowledge or, especially with regard to old or vintage facts or events, by the recitals thereof in authentic records. Verification is intended to forestall allegations which are perjured or hearsay, and this purpose is reasonably subserved by the requirement for authentic documents such as official records which are exceptions to the hearsay evidence rule. For the same reason, a verification cannot be made on facts obtaining or arising in whole or in part from mere information and belief.[26] (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)
Regalado also emphasized that ""[v]erification may be made by the party, his representative, lawyer or any person who personally knows the truth of the facts alleged in the pleading.""[27] The crux of the instant petition's first issue, however, is if Legaspi, et al. did in fact have personal knowledge sufficient to establish their capacity to verify the instant petition in the first place, or failing that, if the instant petition is based on authenticated documents in conformity with Rule 7, Section 4. Put differently, the Court must resolve the question of what happens to a seemingly valid and compliant verification portion that is based on a pleading containing no reasonable indication that the party pleading his or her case has any personal knowledge of the facts, or has attached any authentic documents in support of the said pleading.

In this regard, the Court finds that Legaspi, et al. did not have sufficient personal knowledge that capacitated them to verify the instant petition. The third guideline on verification and certification against non-forum shopping, as laid down by the Court in Altres v. Empleo,[28] is instructive:
3) Verification is deemed substantially complied with when one who has ample knowledge to swear to the truth of the allegations in the complaint or petition signs the verification, and when matters alleged in the petition have been made in good faith or are true and correct.[29]
The Court cited its reasoning in Rombe Eximtrade (Phils.), Inc. v. Asiatrust Dev't., Bank[30] for the aforementioned guideline, viz.:
On the matter of verification, the purpose of the verification requirement is to assure that the allegations in a petition were made in good faith or are true and correct, not merely speculative. The verification requirement is deemed substantially complied with when one who has ample knowledge to swear to the truth of the allegations in the petition signed the verification attached to it, and when matters alleged in the petition have been made in good faith or are true and correct. In this case, we find that the position, knowledge, and experience of Ferrer as Manager and head of the Acquired Assets Unit of Asiatrust, and his good faith, are sufficient compliance with the verification and certification requirements. This is in line with our ruling in Iglesia ni Cristo v. Ponferrada, where we said that it is deemed substantial compliance when one with sufficient knowledge swears to the truth of the allegations in the complaint.[31] (Citations omitted)
Here, Legaspi, et al. clearly do not have personal knowledge of the circumstances that prompted their fears and speculations regarding the results on the May 9, 2022 National and Local Elections. There is no indication that any of them were intimately connected or concerned with the actual transmission of the tallies of the VCMs in their respective polling precincts all the way to COMELEC's servers, and it is clear from the records that their knowledge comes from mere information and belief based on news, social media, and opinionated sources found on the Internet that are unauthenticated in accordance with the Revised Rules on Evidence. Jurisprudence and the rules commonly state that mere information and belief as basis of a pleader's knowledge is clearly insufficient for purposes of verification. Thus, even if the verification portion of a pleading, just like Legaspi, et al. here, is compliant word-for-word with the requirements of Rule 7, Section 4, said compliance will not save the fact that a pleader's personal knowledge is actually not based on personal knowledge or even on any authenticated documents.","ACCORDINGLY, the instant Petition for Certiorari and Mandamus is hereby DISMISSED."
"A.M. No. P-15-3342 (Formerly OCA IPI No. 09-3074-P), July 30, 2024 ","JUDGE TOMAS D. LASAM, COMPLAINANT, VS. RONALD L. MAMAUAG, CLERK OF COURT II, MUNICIPAL TRIAL COURT, RIZAL, CAGAYAN, RESPONDENT.","This administrative case stemmed from Mamauag's failure to submit his daily time records (DTRs) for the months of February to October 2008, which resulted to his salaries and other benefits for the said months being withheld. To remedy the situation, Mamauag submitted to the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) his DTRs for the months of February to October 2008, albeit without the required certification by complainant Judge Tomas D. Lasam (Judge Lasam), then Presiding Judge of the MTC. Subsequently, in a 1st Indorsement dated November 11, 2008, then Deputy Court Administrator Reuben P. Dela Cruz (DCA Dela Cruz) referred the said DTRs to Judge Lasam for signature.[1]

In a letter[2] dated December 11, 2008, Judge Lasam informed DCA Dela Cruz that he will not certify the DTRs based on the following observations:
Several entries in the log book on ""time in"" and ""time out"" do not tally with the entries in the subject Daily Time Records. Particular entries on February 5, 6, 13, 15, 19, 20, 22, 26, 27 and 28, 2008; March 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 24, 25 and 26, 2008; April 1, 3, 9, 10, 15, 16, 21, 22, 25 and 29, 2008; May 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 16, 19, 22, 23, 27, 28 and 29, 2008 show the apparent discrepancy.

There are entries in the log book which are not reflected in the Daily Time Records and vice-versa. Reference is made on March 31, 2008; May 9, 2008; June 3, 2008; July 9, 15 and 16, 2008; and September 5, 2008.

In his Daily Time Record for July 2, 2008, he indicated that it was a holiday but in the log book, he reported for work.

. . . .

The entries in the log book for the months of February 2008 to October 2008 do not appear to have been filled up in the handwriting and signature of Ronald Mamauag. The initials ""RLM"" is not the initial or the usual signature of said Ronald Mamauag. A random sampling of the handwriting, initial and signature as appearing in the entries in the log book on March 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11, 2006 ... clearly shows that the handwriting, initials and signature in the log book entries are entirely different from the handwriting, initial and signature as appearing in the log book entries from February 2008 to October 2008.
Further examination of the handwriting of Ronald Mamauag in the official documents on file in your office would show that entries in the attached copies of the log book are not of Ronald Mamauag's handwriting or signature. There is therefore a very strong probability that somebody other than Ronald Mamauag filled up the log book.[3]
The OCA then treated Judge Lasam's letter as a complaint and ordered Mamauag to file his Comment.[4]

In his Comment,[5] Mamauag denied the allegations and explained that it was never his intention to falsify the logbook, which became the subject of the present matter. He claimed that he honestly believed that as Clerk of Court, he should only submit a Certificate of Service instead of a DTR under the 2002 Revised Manual for Clerks of Court. He asserted that he has been punctual in attending to his duties as Clerk of Court and was even recognized in Resolution No. 53[6] of the Sangguniang Bayan of the Municipality of Rizal, Province of Cagayan entitled A Resolution Attesting the Punctuality of Mr. Ronald L. Mamauag as a Public Servant Who Is Presently the Municipal Clerk of Court in the Municipality of Rizal, Province of Cagayan passed by the Sangguniang Members of Rizal, Cagayan.[7] He averred that he used to have many strokes in writing and inadvertently deviated from his usual or customary handwriting that was on file.[8] Mamauag asked the OCA for mercy and compassion, to look upon the situation as purely human miscalculation, and promised not to repeat the same mistake again.[9] In support of his claims, he submitted a copy of Resolution No. 53, and affidavits of Marygrace Guzman, Municipal Assessor of Rizal, Cagayan, and Margarita Datul, an employee of the Municipality of Rizal attesting to the honesty and competence of Mamauag.[10]

Judge Lasam submitted a Reply[11] stating that Mamauag failed to refute the specific charges and that the latter's irregularities, if admitted as purely human miscalculation, would set a dangerous precedent in disposing cases against an erring judicial employee as such defense would easily enable an employee to escape the serious effects of their wrongdoing.[12]

In a Resolution[13] dated August 12, 2009, the Court resolved to refer the administrative case to the Executive Judge of the Regional Trial Court of Tuao, Cagayan for investigation, report, and recommendation.[14] The case records were then forwarded to Judge Rolando R. Velasco (Judge Velasco), who proceeded with the investigation. In a letter[15] dated April 4, 2011, Judge Velasco informed the Court that he retired from the service and requested that the investigation be transferred to the Honorable Judge Edmar P. Castillo, Sr. Thus, in a Resolution[16] dated October 12, 2011, the Court resolved to direct Judge Edmar P. Castillo, Sr. (the Investigating Judge), to continue with the investigation of the instant administrative matter and to submit his report and recommendation within 60 days.

During the investigation, the MTC's Interpreter Jesus Mamba (Mamba) and Court Stenographer Priscilla Mangiduyos corroborated Judge Lasam. They both testified that they are familiar with Mamauag's handwriting and signature as the latter was the signatory of their DTRs. They attested that upon scrutiny of the logbook, the entries for February to October 2008 were not made under the usual signature and penmanship of Mamauag. In particular, Mamba stated that it was his first time to see the time in and time out of Mamauag written as ""RL Mamauag"" and initialed with ""RLM,"" which appeared during the questioned period.[17] He added that for the questioned period, he did not see Mamauag make any entry in the logbook.[18]
","Before the Court is an administrative case filed against respondent Ronald L. Mamauag (Mamauag), Clerk of Court II of the Municipal Trial Court of Rizal, Cagayan (MTC) charging him with serious dishonesty and falsification of official documents.","The Court adopts the findings and recommendation of the JIB Proper, which essentially upholds the findings of the J1B-OED and the Investigating Judge.

At the outset, it is important to note that on February 22,2022, the Court En Banc unanimously approved A.M. No. 21-08-09-SC, entitled Further Amendments to Rule 140 of the Rules of Court, which was published on April 3, 2022. Hence, Rule 140, as further amended (the Rules), is already effective. In this relation, Section 24 of the Rules explicitly provides that it will apply to all pending and future administrative disciplinary cases involving Members, officials, employees, and personnel of the Judiciary, to wit:
SECTION 24. Retroactive Effect. — All the foregoing provisions shall be applied to all pending and future administrative cases involving the discipline of Members, officials, employees, and personnel of the Judiciary, without prejudice to the internal rules of the Committee on Ethics and Ethical Standards of the Supreme Court insofar as complaints against Members of the Supreme Court are concerned.
In view of the foregoing, the Court shall resolve this case under the framework of the Rules.

The Court's own annotations to the Rules state that ""[d]ishonesty has been defined as the concealment or distortion of truth, which shows lack of integrity or a disposition to defraud, cheat, deceive, or betray and an intent to violate the truth.""[33] ""To be punishable by dismissal, the dishonesty must be serious as determined by the Court under the circumstances of the case.""[34] In Re: Alleged Dishonesty and Grave Misconduct Committed by Bulaong,[35] the Court En Banc reiterated:
Jurisprudence has defined dishonesty as ""'intentionally making a false statement in any material fact, or practicing or attempting to practice any deception or fraud in securing his examination, registration, appointment or promotion.'"" It implies a ""disposition to lie, cheat, deceive, or defraud; unworthiness; lack of integrity; lack of honesty, probity or integrity in principle; lack of fairness and straightforwardness; disposition to defraud, deceive or betray.""

Hence, ""like bad faith, [dishonesty] is not simply bad judgment or negligence... [it] is a question of intention. In ascertaining the intention of a person accused of dishonesty, consideration must be taken not only of the facts and circumstances which gave rise to the act committed by the respondent, but also of his state of mind at the time the offense was committed, the time he might have had at his disposal for the purpose of meditating on the consequences of his act, and the degree of reasoning he could have had at that moment."" In other words, dishonesty is a willful and voluntary act which cannot be justified under the guise of negligence or ignorance.[36]
Here, Mamauag is accused of falsifying the entries in the logbook relative to his attendance for the period of February to October 2008. To recall, Judge Lasam refused to certify Mamauag's DTRs for the questioned period because of the discrepancies in the details indicated in the logbook as against the submitted DTRs. In addition, the entries in the logbook supporting the DTRs for the questioned period appear to be not written by Mamauag. In his defense, Mamauag claimed that he used many strokes in writing and thus inadvertently deviated from his customary handwriting on file.

The Investigating Judge, the JIB-OED, and the JIB Proper uniformly found that the entries in the logbook in the questioned period were not written by Mamauag. The Court agrees.

A perusal of the records easily confirms that the entries in the logbook before and after the questioned period and Mamauag's signatures in his DTRs for the questioned period (Exhibits E to E-10) were evidently written in his usual penmanship, signatures, and initials. On the other hand, Mamauag's names and signatures appearing on the questioned period were clearly differently written. For comparison, some of the entries in the logbook are reproduced below:

August 1, 2006

(Image supposed to be here)

June 1, 2007

(Image supposed to be here)

February 2, 2009

(Image supposed to be here)

The three entries in logbook as shown above are in his usual handwriting and signature. While in his DTRs for the months of February,[37] March,[38] and April 2008,[39] he has these as his signatures:

(Image supposed to be here)

While some of Mamauag's entries for the questioned period are below:

April 11, 2008

(Image supposed to be here)

June 2, 2008

(Image supposed to be here)

October 2, 2008

(Image supposed to be here)

Noticeably, Mamauag's signatures in his DTRs were similar to the strokes written in the logbook on August 1, 2006, June 1, 2007, and February 2, 2009, and he consistently used a cursive short signature in the logbook. While on the questioned period, the signatures are only with capital letters ""RLM."" Moreover, the letter proportions as written in the questioned periods appear to be extended as against Mamauag's normal handwriting.","ACCORDINGLY, respondent Ronald L. Mamauag, Clerk of Court II of the Municipal Trial Court of Rizal, Cagayan, is found GUILTY of serious dishonesty and falsification of public documents. He is hereby DISMISSED from the service, with FORFEITURE of all the retirement and other benefits due him, except accrued leave credits, and DISQUALIFICATION from reinstatement or appointment to any public office, including government-owned or -controlled corporations.

"G.R. No. 258449, July 30, 2024","JUAN JUAN OLILA OLLESCA, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, RESPONDENT.","For this Court's resolution is a Petition for Certiorari[2] (with Extremely Urgent Application for Temporary Restraining Order and/or Preliminary Injunction) under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court filed by Juan Juan Olila Ollesca (Ollesca), assailing the December 13, 2021 Resolution[3] and January 3, 2022 Order[4] issued by the Commission on Elections (COMELEC). The Resolution ruled on the COMELEC Law Department's petition to cancel and/or deny due course of Ollesca's Certificate of Candidacy on the ground that Ollesca is a nuisance candidate, whereas the Order denied Ollesca's Motion for Reconsideration of the said Resolution.

On October 7, 2021, Ollesca filed his Certificate of Candidacy with the COMELEC for the position of president of the Philippines in the May 9, 2022 National and Local Elections.[5] In his Certificate of Candidacy, Ollesca stated that he is running as an independent candidate and indicated that he is an entrepreneur.[6]

On October 21, 2021, the COMELEC Law Department filed, on its own initiative, a Petition[7] to declare Ollesca as a nuisance candidate and asked that the COMELEC deny due course to or cancel Ollesca's Certificate of Candidacy. It asserted that considering that Ollesca filed his Certificate of Candidacy to run for president, he should be publicly known by numerous voters.[8] However, he is running as an independent candidate and is ""virtually unknown except possibly in the locality where he resides.""[9] As such, he has no capability to launch a nationwide campaign to enable him to be known nationally within the campaign period and to persuade a substantial number of voters from different parts of the country.[10] Viewed in this light, he does not appear to have any bona fide intention to run and ""put[s] the election process in mockery or disrepute.""[11]

On October 21, 2021, Ollesca was directed by the COMELEC Second Division to file an answer to the Petition.[12] Thus, on November 2, 2021, Ollesca complied and filed his Answer cum Memorandum.[13]

Ollesca asserted that the COMELEC Law Department's allegations are baseless conclusions of law,[14] being mere speculations[15] that lack factual basis to demonstrate Ollesca's lack of bona fide intent to run or any other circumstance or act intended to cause confusion among the voters.[16] He argued that the COMELEC's petition was based on his alleged lack of financial capacity to wage a nationwide campaign, which effectively imposed a property qualification that is inconsistent with the Constitution[17] and lacked legal basis.[18]

In its December 13, 2021 Resolution,[19] the COMELEC Second Division granted the nuisance petition against Ollesca. It found that Ollesca, who was an independent with no political party, was unknown outside of the community he belonged to and failed to show that he had the financial capacity to ""sustain a decent and viable nationwide campaign on his own.""[20] Thus, Ollesca allegedly filed his Certificate of Candidacy ""to put the election process in mockery or disrepute and, by the said act or circumstance, he has no bona fide intention to run for President.""[21] The dispositive portion of the Second Division's Resolution reads:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Petition is hereby GRANTED.

Respondent JUAN JUAN OLILA OLLESCA is DECLARED a NUISANCE CANDIDATE.

Accordingly, his Certificate of Candidacy for President in the 09 May 2022 National and Local Elections is hereby DENIED DUE COURSE and/or CANCELLED.
","Financial capacity to sustain the rigors of waging a nationwide campaign, membership in a political party, being known nationwide, and the probability of success do not by themselves determine the existence of a bona fide intention to run for public office under Section 69 of the Omnibus Election Code, the lack of which may characterize an electoral candidate as a nuisance candidate.[1]","This Court granted Marquez's petition and found that the COMELEC ""committed grave abuse of discretion when it declared Marquez a nuisance candidate on the ground of lack of proof of his financial capacity to wage a nationwide campaign. By so doing, the COMELEC has effectively imposed a 'property qualifications are inconsistent with the nature and essence of the Republican system ordained in our Constitution and the principle of social justice underlying the same.'""[73] We stated:
The COMELEC cannot conflate the bona fide intention to run with a financial capacity requirement.

A candidate's financial capacity to sustain the rigors of waging a nationwide campaign does not necessarily equate to a bona fide intention to run for public office. The COMELEC's burden is thus to show a reasonable correlation between proof of a bona fide intention to run, on the one hand, and proof of financial capacity to wage a nationwide campaign on the other.[74]
Similarly, in De Alban v. COMELEC,[75] Angelo Castro De Alban (De Alban) filed his Certificate of Candidacy for senator in the 2019 National Elections as an independent candidate and indicated that he was a lawyer and teacher by profession. The COMELEC Law Department motu proprio filed a petition to declare De Alban a nuisance candidate, arguing that he had no bona fide intent to run for public office and that he will not be able to sustain the financial rigors of waging a nationwide campaign without clear proof of financial capacity. The COMELEC First Division declared him a nuisance candidate for the same reasons as it declared Marquez a nuisance candidate. Thereafter, De Alban filed a Petition for Certiorari before this Court, ascribing grave abuse of discretion on the COMELEC in declaring him a nuisance candidate.

In De Alban, this Court stated that it was incumbent upon the COMELEC Law Department to identify the factual bases that would clearly show De Alban's lack of bona fide intention to run for senator.[76] The COMELEC Law Department failed to adduce any evidence and heavily relied on a general allegation and conclusion—""anchored on flawed inferences""—that De Alban has no clear proof of financial capability to sustain the financial rigors of waging a nationwide campaign.[77] It further stated that ""financial capacity to sustain the financial rigors of waging a nationwide campaign,"" ""non-membership in a political party"" or ""being unknown nationwide,"" and ""the low probability of success"" do not by themselves equate to the absence of bona fide intention to run for public office under Section 69 of the Omnibus Election Code.[78]

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in Marquez v. COMELEC (2022),[79] when Marquez ran as an independent candidate in the 2022 senatorial elections, the COMELEC Law Department again filed a petition to declare Marquez a nuisance candidate. It argued that Marquez, who was not nominated by a political party, was ""virtually unknown"" and ""[did] not appear to have a genuine intention to run for public office"" as he ""does not have a nationwide network or organization of supporters to assist him during the campaign so that he may be known nationally within the short campaign period.""[80] Ruling on the petition, the COMELEC First Division declared Marguez a nuisance candidate and cancelled his Certificate of Candidacy. Thus, Marguez filed a petition for certiorari before this Court and argued that the COMELEC acted with grave abuse of discretion for declaring him a nuisance candidate.[81]
","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Certiorari is GRANTED. The December 13, 2021 Resolution of the Commission on Elections Second Division and January 3, 2022 Order of the Commission on Elections En Banc in SPA No. 21-140 (DC)(MP) are ANNULLED and SET ASIDE.

Accordingly, the Petition to Deny Due Course to or Cancel Certificate of Candidacy dated October 11, 2021, filed by the Commission on Elections Law Department against petitioner Juan Juan Olila Ollesca, docketed as SPA No. 21-140 (DC)(MP), is DISMISSED."
"A.M. No. P-24-150 (Formerly OCA IPI No. 13-4030-P), July 30, 2024","FROILAN E. IGNACIO, COMPLAINANT, VS. PAUL CHRISTOPHER T. BALADING, SHERIFF III, BRANCH 33, METROPOLITAN TRIAL COURT, QUEZON CITY, RESPONDENT.","This Court resolves the administrative Complaint[1] for grave abuse of authority filed by Froilan E. Ignacio (Ignacio) against former Deputy Sheriff Paul Christopher Balading (Balading) of Branch 33, Metropolitan Trial Court, Quezon City.

In 2011, the Metropolitan Trial Court decided People v. Reyes, a Bouncing Checks Law[2] case.[3] In the case, accused Carolina Reyes (Reyes) was acquitted of the charge but was nevertheless adjudged civilly liable to the private complainant, Romeo Aznar (Aznar), in the amount of PHP 128,500.00.[4] The Writ of Execution was issued on October 25, 2012.[5]

On January 4, 2013, to implement the Writ of Execution, Balading, then trial court sheriff, went to Megabuilt Enterprises, a hardware store located in Batasan, Quezon City.[6] He was accompanied by Aznar,[7] and some unidentified men he called ""hatak boys.""[8] Balading levied hardware materials, which he carted off and loaded into a van.[9]

On January 10, 2013, Ignacio filed the administrative Complaint[10] against Sheriff Balading. Ignacio alleged that he is the registered owner of Megabuilt Enterprises. Ignacio claimed that on the day Balading went to Megabuilt, the latter was armed and did not properly identify himself as a sheriff to Megabuilt's employees. Balading and his companions allegedly just barged their way into the hardware store despite physical resistance from Ignacio's four employees. According to Ignacio, Balading carted off hardware materials in the total value of not less than PHP 500,000.00.[11]

As evidence of the abusive manner Balading had used in implementing the writ, Ignacio appended sworn statements from his employees, as well as screenshots of CCTV footage of the incident. He also mentioned that he had filed a criminal complaint against Balading.[12]

After three directives[13] for him to respond to the Complaint, Balading finally filed his Comment[14] on June 2, 2016. Balading essentially admitted that before going to Megabuilt, he first went to Reyes's house, where he offered money to her helpers for them to surrender the keys to the vehicles parked in the house. When he failed to secure the keys, Balading then went to Kingplus Construction and Hardware Supply to levy the rights, interests, and participation of Reyes. However, when Atty. Alfredo Tan, Reyes's counsel, arrived, Balading ""backed off""[15] and returned to the trial court.[16]

Balading then conducted surveillance to determine Reyes's whereabouts. Finally, on January 4, 2013, he went to Megabuilt Enterprises to implement the Writ of Execution against Reyes. According to Balading, Ignacio was the husband of Reyes, and the latter was hiding in Megabuilt to evade her civil liability.[17]

Balading denied that a robbery took place, emphasizing that there was a police station near Megabuilt where Ignacio could have easily sought assistance. Balading admitted that he eventually sold the items he had levied at a public auction, the proceeds of which answered for Reyes's civil liability. He claimed that there were items listed in the Complaint that he did not levy.[18]

Lastly, Balading apologized for the belated filing of the Comment. He said that he had no intention of delaying the proceedings and thought that his non-filing would simply be considered a waiver of his right to file a comment considering that the allegations against him, in and of themselves, ""will not substantially stand.""[19]

In a July 11, 2016 Resolution,[20] this Court referred the Complaint and the Comment to the Office of the Court Administrator for evaluation, report, and recommendation.","Sheriffs play a pivotal role as agents of the law. They are entrusted with the execution of court orders and writs and must adhere to stringent ethical and procedural standards. While expeditious enforcement of judgments is essential, due process and fairness must not be compromised.","For this reason, this Court instead forfeits all of respondent's benefits, which shall in no case include his accrued leave credits. Given the gravity of respondent's offense, we add the penalty of fine in the amount of PHP 200,000.00,[41] to be paid within 30 days from the finality of this Resolution. The fine shall be paid within the period given regardless of the filing of a Motion for Reconsideration.[42] If the fine remains unpaid within the given period, contempt proceedings shall be commenced against respondent for disobeying a lawful order of this Court.[43]

It is true that, under Rule 140, Section 22 of the Rules of Court, a fine, if unpaid within a period of not exceeding three months from the time the decision or resolution is promulgated, may be deducted from accrued leave credits. Section 22 explains that the deduction of unpaid fines from accrued leave credits is a form of compensation, thus:
SECTION 22. Payment of Fines. – When the penalty imposed is a fine, the respondent shall pay it within a period not exceeding three (3) months from the time the decision or resolution is promulgated. If unpaid, such amount may be deducted from the salaries and benefits, including accrued leave credits, due to the respondent. The deduction of unpaid fines from accrued leave credits, which is considered as a form of compensation, is not tantamount to the imposition of the accessory penalty of forfeiture covered under the provisions of this Rule. (Emphasis supplied)
However, under the Civil Code, a true compensation takes place ""when two persons, in their own right, are creditors and debtors of each other.""[44] This is not the case here, as respondent is not a debtor of this Court. Rather, respondent was a court personnel over whom this Court is constitutionally mandated to exercise administrative supervision,[45] and the fine was imposed as an administrative penalty, not a civil obligation.

More importantly, receiving the value of leave credits, when earned during the period of employment, is a vested right of an employee. Therefore, ""[a]s a matter of fairness and law, [employees] may not be deprived of such remuneration, which they have already earned prior to their dismissal.""[46]

Thus, the fine, if unpaid, cannot be deducted from accrued leave credits. Rule 140, Section 22 of the Rules of Court should therefore be amended in this wise:
SECTION 22. Payment of Fines. – When the penalty imposed is a fine, the respondent shall pay it within 30 days from the finality of the decision or resolution imposing the fine. Decisions and resolutions in administrative cases which are immediately executory shall be considered final, for purposes of the payment of fines, upon receipt of the decision and resolution, and the fine shall be paid within the period given regardless of the filing of a Motion for Reconsideration.

If unpaid within the period given, indirect contempt proceedings shall be commenced against the respondent pursuant to Rule 71, Section 3 of the Rules of Court.
ACCORDINGLY, respondent Paul Christopher T. Balading, former Sheriff III of Branch 33, Metropolitan Trial Court, Quezon City, is found GUILTY of grave abuse of authority. His offense merits the imposition of the penalty of dismissal from service. However, since he has been previously dropped from the rolls, dismissal from service may no longer be imposed.","ACCORDINGLY, respondent Paul Christopher T.

In lieu of dismissal, respondent is meted the penalty of FORFEITURE of all his benefits, except his accrued leave credits, and is ordered to pay a FINE of PHP 200,000.00, to be paid within 30 days from the finality of this Resolution. If unpaid, contempt proceedings shall be commenced against him pursuant to Rule 71, Section 3 of the Rules of Court for disobeying a lawful order of this Court.

Furthermore, he is DISQUALIFIED from reinstatement or appointment to any public office, including government-owned or government-controlled corporations.

"A.M. No. P-24-140 (Formerly JIB FPI No. 22-110-P), July 30, 2024","ANTOLYN D. GONZALES, COMPLAINANT, VS. DWIGHT ALDWIN S. GERONIMO, SHERIFF IV, BRANCH 121, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, IMUS, CAVITE, RESPONDENT.","In the Sinumpaang Salaysay, Gonzales averred that on April 22, 2022, he received a letter from the Tanza Post Office, Tanza, Cavite, with the Republic of the Philippines, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Fourth Judicial Region, Branch 121, Imus, Cavite, as the sender. The following words also appear on the upper right corner of the envelope, ""Private or Unauthorized Use on Non-Payment of Postage is Penalized by Fine or Imprisonment or Both.""[3]

Gonzales, thinking that the letter was an official communication from the RTC, opened the envelope. As it turned out, however, the envelope contains Geronimo's Verified Comment on the administrative complaint previously filed by him against Geronimo, which was docketed as JIB FPI No. 21-071-P.[4]

Gonzales, thereafter, realized that Geronimo used the franking privilege, i.e., sending mail without paying postage stamps, reserved for the official transactions of Branch 121, RTC, Imus City, Cavite. Gonzales then went to the local post office to verify Geronimo's action. The local post office confirmed that it granted Geronimo franking privilege after the latter guaranteed that the letter contained an official transaction from the RTC.[5]

Gonzales, thus, averred that Geronimo committed a violation of Canon I (Fidelity to Duty), Section 1[6] of the CCCP. He explained that Geronimo used his official position to obtain unwarranted benefits and privileges for himself.[7]

On May 18, 2022, Atty. James D.V. Navarette (Atty. Navarette), Deputy Clerk of Court at-Large, Office of the Court Administrator and Acting Executive Director of the JIB issued an Indorsement[8] requiring Geronimo to file a Verified Comment to the Sinumpaang Salaysay which charged him with gross misconduct constituting violations of the CCCP.

On July 4, 2022, Geronimo complied therewith and filed his Verified Comment.[9] In his Verified Comment, Geronimo claimed that he filed his Comment in JIB FPI No. 21-071-P pursuant to the directive of the JIB, contained in the Indorsement dated December 11, 2021; and in the said indorsement, there is nothing that prohibits him from using the franking privilege. Geronimo also alleged that the administrative complaint pertained to his official function, and he submitted his Comment as a public servant, not as a private individual. Therefore, the filing of the Verified Comment can be considered as an official transaction.[10]

Finally, Geronimo argued that Gonzales was wasting the Court's time and resources by filing a baseless complaint. He claimed that the filing of the complaint was a mere fishing expedition and Gonzales was trying to play the victim's card to pin him.[11]","For the Court's consideration is a Sinumpaang Salaysay ng Paghahabla (Sinumpaang Salaysay)[1] dated April 25, 2022, filed before the Judicial Integrity Board (JIB) by complainant Antolyn D. Gonzales (Gonzales) against respondent Dwight Aldwin S. Geronimo (Geronimo) for an alleged violation of Canon I, Section 1 of Administrative Matter No. 03-06-13-SC, also known as the Code of Conduct for Court Personnel (CCCP).[2]","The Court agrees with the recommendation of the JIB that Geronimo's liability should only be confined to simple misconduct, and not for violation of Presidential Decree No. 26.

It is settled that administrative cases are independent from criminal actions for the same act or omission.[24] They are separate and distinct from each other. In Paredes v. Court of Appeals,[25] the Court had the opportunity to exhaustively distinguish these two cases, thus:
First, the quantum of evidence required in an administrative case is less than that required in a criminal case. Criminal and administrative proceedings may involve similar operative facts; but each requires a different quantum of evidence. Administrative cases require only substantial evidence, or such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. In contrast, in Criminal Case Nos. 99-525 to 99-531, respondents are required to proffer proof beyond reasonable doubt to secure petitioner's conviction. Rule 133 of the Revised Rules on Evidence provides:

. . . .

Thus, considering the difference in the quantum of evidence, as well as the procedure followed and the sanctions imposed in criminal and administrative proceedings, the findings and conclusions in one should not necessarily be binding on the other. Notably, the evidence presented in the administrative case may not necessarily be the same evidence to be presented in the criminal cases. The prosecution is certainly not precluded from adducing additional evidence to discharge the burden of proof required in the criminal cases. Significantly, the prosecution had manifested that it would present testimonial evidence which was not presented in the administrative case.

Second, it is well settled that a single act may offend against two or more distinct and related provisions of law, or that the same act may give rise to criminal as well as administrative liability. As such, they may be prosecuted simultaneously or one after another, so long as they do not place the accused in double jeopardy of being punished for the same offense.[26]
Accordingly, an administrative and a criminal case arising from a single act must be disposed of separately, either simultaneously or one after the other. They must be disposed of according to the facts and laws respectively applicable to them.[27]

In the instant case, the act committed by Geronimo constitutes simple misconduct and a violation of the Franking Privilege Law. The latter, however, is penal in nature. But what exactly is penal law? In the case of Inmates of the New Bilibid Prison v. De Lima,[28] the Court clarified that:
A penal provision defines a crime or provides a punishment for one.

Penal laws and laws which, while not penal in nature, have provisions defining offenses and prescribing penalties for their violation.
","ACCORDINGLY, the Court finds respondent Dwight Aldwin S. Geronimo, Sheriff IV, Branch 121, Regional Trial Court, Imus, Cavite, GUILTY of simple misconduct for which he is FINED PHP 18,000.00, with a stern warning that a repetition of the same offense will be dealt with more severely."
"A.M. No. P-24-121 (Formerly OCA IPI No. 18-4890-P), July 30, 2024","RICKY HAO MONION, COMPLAINANT, VS. VICENTE S. SICAT, JR., SHERIFF IV, OFFICE OF THE CLERK OF COURT, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, ANGELES CITY, PAMPANGA, RESPONDENT.","Before this Court is an administrative case filed by Ricky Hao Monion (Monion) against Vicente S. Sicat, Jr. (Sicat), Sheriff IV stationed at the Office of the Clerk of Court, Regional Trial Court, Angeles City, Pampanga for abuse of authority and violation of Republic Act No. 3019.[1]

Monion is the private complainant in Criminal Case Nos. 15-241 and 15-244 against Bernadette Mullet Potts (Potts) for violation of Batas Pambansa Blg. 22 pending before the Municipal Circuit Trial Court of Mabalacat-Magalang, Pampanga.[2]

The Municipal Circuit Trial Court rendered a Decision based on a Compromise Agreement, which prompted the issuance of a Writ of Execution dated May 5, 2016.[3]

The Writ of Execution was addressed to the Sheriff and/or Deputy Sheriff of the Office of the Clerk of Court of the Regional Trial Court of Angeles City, Pampanga, ordering the latter to cause the execution of the judgment to levy the goods and chattels of Potts, and to make their sale in accordance with the procedure laid down in Rule 39 of the Rules of Court.[4]

Monion filed his Complaint Affidavit before the Office of the Court Administrator. He alleged that on January 4, 2018, Sicat willfully and purposely submitted to the Register of Deeds of Angeles City, Pampanga a Notice to Lift the Levy on the property of Potts without the necessary court order.[5] The property consists of a parcel of land covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 045-2015007354.

Monion claimed that Sicat deceived the Registry of Deeds when the latter provided misleading statements in the Notice stating that ""Bernadette Potts has made several payments to Mr. Ricky Monion that would extinguish the levy of the property.""[6]

The Notice sent by Sicat to the Registry of Deeds caused the cancellation of the levy and enabled the buyer, Glenn Facuri Garcia (Garcia), to transfer the said parcel of land to his name. Because of this, Transfer Certificate of Title No. 045-2015007354 was cancelled, and a new Transfer Certificate of Title No. 045-2018002601 under Garcia's name was issued.[7]

Monion also alleged that Sicat was always hesitant to act on his follow-ups regarding the levy of Potts's other personal properties, and that he was only given alibis about the status of the execution.[8]

Finally, Monion believed that Sicat solicited an undisclosed significant amount of money to enable Potts to release her property from levy and transfer it to Garcia's name.[9]

In Sicat's Comment/Explanation, he stated that he has been in the Judiciary for almost 40 years, or since April 1980, carrying and upholding the vision of a good and dedicated public servant. He also stated that he would be retiring by 2020.[10]

Sicat vehemently denied the imputations against him for being supposedly false, malicious, and baseless. He claimed that his actions were purely based on procedural law, customs, and practice in effecting execution.[11]

Regarding the Notice of Lifting of Levy on Execution without court order, Sicat explained that Potts went to his office and informed him that he deviated from the established procedure in the execution of judgments when he levied, on a second lien, her real property to satisfy the ruling in favor of Monion. After finding basis in Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, which provides that personal property of the judgment debtor must first be exhausted before going after real property, Sicat made the necessary release of the levy on execution.[12]

Sicat also explained that every time Monion visited him to check on the execution, he would constantly go to the subject premises. Unfortunately, no person or resident was present every time he went since the property was always padlocked.[13]

Further, Sicat insisted that he was not aware of any subsequent sale and that he did not receive any amount in relation to or in consideration of his actions.[14]

Sicat also stated that Monion has filed several dubious complaints against other co-sheriffs and court employees allegedly without any point of satisfaction, always complaining and insisting why it cannot be done his way.[15]

On September 18, 2020, the Office of the Court Administrator submitted its report with the following recommendations:
this administrative complaint be RE-DOCKETED as a regular administrative matter;

respondent Vicente S. Sicat, Jr., Sheriff IV, Office of the Clerk of Court, RTC, Angeles City, Pampanga, be found GUILTY of simple neglect of duty; and

considering that respondent Vicente S. Sicat, Jr. has been previously found guilty of simple neglect of duty and suspended for six (6) months with a stern warning that a repetition of the same shall be dealt with more severely and considering further that he has been adjudged guilty of various offenses, that he be DISMISSED from the service with forfeiture of all benefits and privileges, except accrued leave credits, with prejudice to re-employment in any branch or instrumentality of the government, including government-owned or controlled corporations.[16]
The Office of the Court Administrator found that Sicat cannot be held administratively liable for abuse of authority and violation of Republic Act No. 3019 due to Monion's failure to provide any substantial proof.[17]
","Court employees, as public servants, are bound to live up to the strictest standards in the performance of their duties. A recurring conduct of a court employee marked by numerous administrative violations, deserves nothing but the gravest penalty of dismissal from service.","This Court has previously held that a sheriff's deviation from the procedure laid down by the Rules warrants disciplinary action.[30] Thus, the Court finds respondent guilty of simple neglect of duty.

Time and again, the Court has emphasized that sheriffs play an important role in the administration of justice. As agents of the law, high standards are expected of them. Sheriffs must discharge their duties with utmost care and diligence because in serving the court's writs and processes and in implementing its orders, they cannot afford to make a mistake without affecting the administration of justice.[31]

At this juncture, it is timely to discuss respondent's 40-year service in the Judiciary as summarized by the Office of the Court Administrator:
On October 16, 1998, respondent was fined in the amount of PHP 1,000.00 for neglect of duty and incompetence in the performance of his official duties.[32]

On September 19, 2002, respondent was fined in the amount of PHP 10,000.00 for abuse of authority, gross ignorance of the law, and manifest partiality, with a stern warning that a repetition of a similar infraction will be dealt with more severely.[33]

On March 6, 2003, respondent was found guilty of simple misconduct and inefficiency and incompetence in the performance of official duties, which was meted with a penalty of suspension from the service for one month, without pay and other fringe benefits including leave credits. He was also fined in the amount of PHP 10,000.00, with a stern warning that a repetition of the same offense shall be dealt with more severely.[34]

On November 14, 2007, respondent was again found guilty of simple misconduct, which was meted with a penalty of suspension from the service for six months, without pay and other fringe benefits including leave credits, with a severe warning that a repetition of the same offense shall be dealt with more severely.[35]

On January 17, 2011, respondent was found liable for simple neglect of duty, which was meted with a penalty of suspension from the service for six months, without pay, with a stern warning that a repetition of the same act shall be dealt with more severely.[36]

On July 27, 2016, respondent was meted with a penalty of reprimand, with stern warning for his habitual tardiness.[37]
In sum, respondent has been liable for six administrative complaints prior to this present Complaint.

The Office of the Court Administrator, in its report, turned to the 2017 Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service as basis for the imposition of the penalty of dismissal. We disagree.","ACCORDINGLY, this Court finds respondent Vicente S. Sicat, Jr., Sheriff IV of the Regional Trial Court, Office of the Clerk of Court, Angeles City, Pampanga, GUILTY of simple neglect of duty and is hereby DISMISSED FROM SERVICE, with forfeiture of all retirement benefits, except accrued leave credits, and perpetual disqualification from employment in any branch of the government or any of its agencies or instrumentalities, including government-owned and -controlled corporations."

DIMALANTA, THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND SENATE OF THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES AS COMPONENT HOUSES OF THE CONGRESS OF THE PHILIPPINES, AND THE MORE ELECTRIC AND POWER CORPORATION, RESPONDENTS.","Petitioners Iloilo I Electric Cooperative, Inc. (ILECO I), Iloilo II Electric Cooperative, Inc. (ILECO II), and Iloilo III Electric Cooperative, Inc. (ILECO III) are grantees of separate certificates of franchise to operate electric light and power services in various municipalities in the province of Iloilo and the city of Passi. ILECO I, ILECO II, and ILECO III's certificate of franchise will expire on August 22, 2053, December 12, 2029, and August 10, 2039, respectively.[3]

On March 9, 2019, Republic Act No. 11212 took effect, which granted MORE Electric and Power Corporation (MORE) a franchise to establish, operate, and maintain an electric power distribution system in Iloilo City. However, on August 30, 2022, Republic Act No. 11918 amended and expanded MORE's franchise area to include 15 municipalities and one city that were previously within the exclusive franchise area of petitioners. This prompted petitioners to challenge Section 1 of Republic Act No. 11918, which reads:
SEC. 1. Nature and Scope of Franchise. — Subject to the provisions of the Constitution and applicable laws, rules, and regulations, there is hereby granted to MORE Electric and Power Corporation, hereunder referred to as the Grantee, its successors or assignees, a franchise to establish, operate, and maintain for commercial purposes and in the public interest, a distribution system for the conveyance of electric power to end users in the cities of Iloilo and Passi and the municipalities of Alimodian, Leganes, Leon, New Lucena, Pavia, San Miguel, Santa Barbara, Zarraga, Anilao, Banate, Barotac Nuevo, Dingle, Dueñas, Dumangas, and San Enrique, in the Province of Iloilo.

As used in thus Act, distribution system refers to the system of the wires and associated facilities including subtransmission lines belonging to or used by a franchised distribution utility extending between the delivery point on the national transmission system or generating facility and the metering point or facility of the end-user.[4]
Petitioners assert that MORE's expanded areas overlapped with their franchise areas. Specifically, for ILECO I, the overlapping areas are the municipalities of Alimodian, Leganes, Leon, Pavia, San Miguel, and Santa Barbara; for ILECO II, these are the city of Passi and municipalities of Barotac Nuevo, Dingle, Dueñas, Dumangas, New Lucena, San Enrique, and Zarraga; and for ILECO III, these are the municipalities of Anilao and Banate.[5]","Under the Constitution, the crucial role of determining the existence of common good that would warrant the amendment, alteration, or repeal of a franchise lies with the legislature. Pursuant to this mandate, our legislature breathed flesh and blood through the enactment of a law that would promote competition in the electricity sector. Thus, the Court must tread with deliberate care in striking down this law since any misstep may unravel the people's will through their elected representatives. In the same vein, to undo an act of legislature, there needs to be a compelling reason, which is lacking in this case.

The Case

This is a Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition with Prayer for the Issuance of Temporary Restraining Order and Writ of Preliminary Injunction[1] under Rule 65 that seeks to assail the constitutionality of Section 1 of Republic Act No. 11918[2] for violation of exclusive franchises, non-impairment of contracts, due process, and equal protection.","The petition is DISMISSED and PHILRECA's motion to intervene is DENIED.

Preliminarily, it bears pointing out that the instant petition falls under the exceptions to the doctrine of hierarchy of courts. Under this doctrine, a direct invocation of the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction to issue extraordinary writs should be allowed only when there are special and important reasons therefor, clearly and specifically set out in the petition. This is an established policy that is necessary to prevent inordinate demands upon the Court's time and attention which are better devoted to those matters within its exclusive jurisdiction, and to prevent further over-crowding of the Court's docket.[21]

Here, petitioners deemed the following exceptions as applicable to their case, namely: (a) when there are genuine issues of constitutionality that must be addressed at the most immediate time, such as assailing the constitutionality of actions of both legislative and executive branches of the government; (b) when the issues involved are of transcendental importance; (c) cases of first impression; (d) the constitutional issues raised are better decided by this Court; (e) the time element; and (f) the petition includes questions that are dictated by public welfare and the advancement of public policy, or demanded by the broader interest of justice.[22]

We agree with petitioners that this Court may take cognizance of the case at the first instance, considering that the foregoing reasons were clearly laid down in the petition, as well as the presence of genuine issues of constitutionality and involvement of questions on public welfare, advancement of public policy, and broader interest of justice. Nonetheless, as will be discussed at length below, the petition must be dismissed.

I.
Petitioners do not enjoy any Constitutional right to exclusive franchise over its coverage areas


We deem it necessary to state at the outset that exclusive franchises are not sanctioned by the Constitution. Moreover, franchises are subject to amendment, alteration, or repeal by the Congress when the common good so requires. Section 11, Article XII of the 1987 Constitution provides:
Section 11. No franchise, certificate, or any other form of authorization for the operation of a public utility shall be granted except to citizens of the Philippines or to corporations or associations organized under the laws of the Philippines, at least sixty per centum of whose capital is owned by such citizens; nor shall such franchise, certificate, or authorization be exclusive in character or for a longer period than fifty years. Neither shall any such franchise or right be granted except under the condition that it shall be subject to amendment, alteration, or repeal by the Congress when the common good so requires. The State shall encourage equity participation in public utilities by the general public. The participation of foreign investors in the governing body of any public utility enterprise shall be limited to their proportionate share in its capital, and all the executive and managing officers of such corporation or association must be citizens of the Philippines.
The language of the Constitution is clear. Franchises granted by the government cannot be exclusive in character. In the Court's En Banc ruling in Tawang Multi-Purpose Cooperative v. La Trinidad Water District,[23] We had occasion to exhaustively explain said provision of the Constitution. The 1935, 1973 and 1987 Constitutions all expressly prohibit exclusivity of franchise, viz:
The President, Congress and the Court cannot create directly franchises for the operation of a public utility that are exclusive in character. The 1935, 1973 and 1987 Constitutions expressly and clearly prohibit the creation of franchises that are exclusive in character. Section 8, Article XIII of the 1935 Constitution states that:

No franchise, certificate, or any other form of authorization for the operation of a public utility shall be granted except to citizens of the Philippines or to corporations or other entities organized under the laws of the Philippines, sixty per centum of the capital of which is owned by citizens of the Philippines, nor shall such franchise, certificate or authorization be exclusive in character or for a longer period than fifty years. (Emphasis supplied)
Section 5, Article XIV of the 1973 Constitution states that:
No franchise, certificate, or any other form of authorization for the operation of a public utility shall be granted except to citizens of the Philippines or to corporations or associations organized under the laws of the Philippines at least sixty per centum of the capital of which is owned by such citizens, nor shall such franchise, certificate or authorization be exclusive in character or for a longer period than fifty years. (Emphasis supplied)
Section 11, Article XII of the 1987 Constitution states that:
No franchise, certificate, or any other form of authorization for the operation of a public utility shall be granted except to citizens of the Philippines or to corporations or associations organized under the laws of the Philippines, at least sixty per centum of whose capital is owned by such citizens, nor shall such franchise, certificate or authorization be exclusive in character or for a longer period than fifty years. (Emphasis supplied)

Plain words do not require explanation. The 1935, 1973 and 1987 Constitutions are clear — franchises for the operation of a public utility cannot be exclusive in character. The 1935, 1973 and 1987 Constitutions expressly and clearly state that, ""nor shall such franchise[. . .] be exclusive in character."" There is no exception.

When the law is clear, there is nothing for the courts to do but to apply it. The duty of the Court is to apply the law the way it is worded. In Security Bank and Trust Company v. Regional Trial Court of Makati, Branch 61, the Court held that:","ACCORDINGLY, in view of the foregoing, the instant Petition is hereby DISMISSED."
"G.R. No. 266636, July 29, 2024 ","PHILHARBOR FERRIES AND PORT SERVICES, INC., PETITIONER, VS. FRANCIS C. CARLOS, RESPONDENT.","Philharbor is a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the Republic of the Philippines.[5] It is engaged in the business of commercial shipping, shipping management, and other maritime activities.[6]

In its Complaint,[7] Philharbor alleged that on December 1, 2002, Carlos was appointed as chief operating officer of its Port and Ferry Operations, which appointment was renewable annually by its Board of Directors. The scope of his responsibility included, among others, ""maintain[ing] the ship in class and in efficient and seaworthy condition with manager's power to negotiate and approve repair and maintenance contracts.""[8] In an Appointment Letter,[9] Carlos, as the chief operating officer of the Archipelago Group—a group of subsidiary corporations, including Philharbor—was charged with the following responsibilities:
Shall plan, organize, and control all the day-to-day activities of the Company;
Shall collaborate with the President/ Chief Executive Officer in the overall administration of the Company;
Shall be responsible for the management of the Company's activities to ensure maximum profits commensurate with the best interest of shareholders, customers, employees and the public;
Shall develop and implement space-planning strategies to accommodate current and future organizational needs;
Shall provide a high level of customer relations and service, and shall ensure compliance with Company policies and procedure;
Shall assist in attaining established Company's operational and financial goals;
Shall perform management review/ operations review of all business units and support units;
Shall initiate fiscal policies to strengthen financial monitoring and management among companies within the group; [and]
Shall act as Designated Person Ashore of the Company and is responsible for the implementation of the Safety Management System for owned, operated, shipmanaged[,] and chartered vessels[.][10]
In line with his responsibilities, Carlos was authorized to approve the capital expenditure for the repair and maintenance of the vessels owned and operated by Philharbor. Before any disbursement for such purpose, an application of authority for capital projects expenditure must first be approved by Carlos.[11]

Philharbor further alleged that its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Christopher Pastrana (Christopher), even appointed Carlos as trustee for his Philharbor shares of stock because of his apparent probity.[12]

After Carlos's departure from the corporation on August 10, 2009,[13] a routine audit was conducted by the Accounting Department of Philharbor. It was discovered that Carlos, during his tenure as chief operating officer, acted fraudulently and negligently in approving authorities for capital projects expenditure to the damage and prejudice of Philharbor.[14]

The audit found that in the mandatory dry docking of M/V Maharlika Dos, the approved authority for capital projects expenditure was PHP 2,995,283.50.[15] However, the total actual expenditure was PHP 15,599,593.64. As a result, Philharbor incurred losses in the amount of PHP 12,604,310.14.[16]

In a similar manner, in the mandatory dry docking of M/V Maharlika Siete, the approved authority for capital projects expenditure was PHP 10,753,730.50.[17] The total actual expenditure was PHP 15,284,697.66, resulting to a financial loss in the amount of PHP 4,530,967.16.[18]

Thus, on August 17, 2009, the Archipelago Group, which includes Philharbor, through counsel, sent a Demand Letter[19] to Carlos, demanding the payment of PHP 30,000,000.00 as loss incurred.[20]","This Court resolves a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] assailing the Decision[2] and Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA), which affirmed with modification the Decision[4] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) that dismissed the Amended Complaint for damages filed by Philharbor Ferries and Port Services, Inc. (Philharbor) against its former Chief Operating Officer Francis C. Carlos (Carlos) and ordered the payment of moral damages, exemplary damages, and attorney's fees in favor of Carlos.","The Petition is devoid of merit.

To begin, it bears underscoring that this Court's jurisdiction in a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court is limited to the review of questions of law.[67] To invoke the discretionary power of review of this Court, procedural standards require, among others, that ""the questions raised in it are of such substance as to warrant consideration.""[68] We explained thus:
[Q]uestions raised in a Rule 45 Petition must be of such substance as to warrant consideration is to say that judicial review shall proceed ""only when there are special and important reasons."" The use of the conjunctive ""and"" vis-à-vis the adjectives ""special"" and ""important"" means that the reasons invoked for review must be of distinctly significant consequence and value. Rule 45, Section 6 (a) and (b) illustrate the gravity of reasons which would move this Court to act:
 
(a)

When the issue raised pertains to the truth or falsity of the alleged facts, requiring a re-evaluation and recalibration of the evidence on record,[70] it is a question of fact beyond the ambit of a Rule 45 Petition. In such case, this Court has the discretionary authority under Rule 45, Section 5 to deny outright or in due course the petition.[71]

However, in exceptional instances, this Court reviews factual issues:
(1) When the conclusion is a finding grounded entirely on speculation, surmises or conjectures; (2) When the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible; (3) Where there is a grave abuse of discretion; (4) When the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts; (5) When the findings of fact are conflicting; (6) When the Court of Appeals, in making its findings, went beyond the issues of the case and the same is contrary to the admissions of both appellant and appellee; (7) The findings of the Court of Appeals are contrary to those of the trial court; (8) When the findings of fact are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based; (9) When the facts set forth in the petition as well as in the petitioner's main and reply briefs are not disputed by the respondents; and (10) The finding of fact of the Court of Appeals is premised on the supposed absence of evidence and is contradicted by the evidence on record.[72] (Citations omitted)
In this case, Philharbor asks this Court to review anew its allegations of gross negligence and bad faith against Carlos in failing to monitor and manage the dry-docking expenses that resulted in serious losses to the corporation.

It is settled that the existence of bad faith and the entitlement to damages[73] are factual in nature and would necessarily entail a review of the evidence presented during the trial. Contrary to Philharbor's allegations,[74] none of the well-recognized exceptions exist in the instant case.

We underscore that this Court is not a trier of facts.[75] It will not entertain questions of facts as the factual findings of the appellate courts are final, binding, and conclusive on the parties and upon this Court when supported by substantial evidence on record. It is not duty-bound to analyze, review, and weigh the evidence all over again in the absence of any showing of any arbitrariness, capriciousness, or palpable error.[76]

Even if this Court would proceed to discuss the issues raised, the Petition still fails.

We now delve into the issue on whether the CA erred in not declaring that Carlos was negligent or in bad faith in the performance of his duties as chief operating officer.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DENIED. The December 19, 2022 Decision and March 30, 2023 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 112692 are AFFIRMED.

Petitioner Philharbor Ferries and Port Services, Inc. is ORDERED to pay the respondent Francis C. Carlos the following amounts: PHP 300,000.00 as moral damages; PHP 200,000.00 as exemplary damages; and PHP 100,000.00 as attorney's fees.

"G.R. No. 265123, July 29, 2024","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PETITIONER, VS. RONNEL BUENAFE BERCADEZ, RESPONDENT.","On or about 18th day of March 2019, in the City of Makati, the Philippines, accused, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously carry outside of his residence, a bladed weapon (knife) not being used as a necessary tool or implement to earn a livelihood, nor used in connection therewith.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[8]

Bercadez moved to quash[9] the Information and raised the following arguments: (1) the Information against him failed to allege that his alleged crime was in furtherance of, or to abet, or in connection with subversion, rebellion, insurrection, lawless violation, criminality, chaos, or public disorder; and (2) Presidential Decree No. 9 (P.D. No. 9), as amended by B.P. Blg. 6, already ceased to have any legal force given that the spirit behind the said laws—that is, to strengthen and give teeth to the declaration of martial law by former President Ferdinand E. Marcos—has also ceased.[10]

In its April 25, 2019 Resolution,[11] the MeTC emphasized that B.P. Blg. 6 is meant to be read in conjunction with P.D. No. 9, the law it amends. Since B.P. Blg. 6 merely amended the penalty and provided for exceptions to the offense of possession of weapons, the information for violation of the said law must still allege two essential elements as provided in P.D. No. 9. These elements are: (1) that the carrying outside of one's residence of any bladed, blunt, or pointed weapon is not used as a necessary tool or implement for a livelihood or in pursuit of a lawful activity; and (2) that the act of carrying the weapon was either in furtherance of, or to abet, or in connection with subversion, rebellion, insurrection, lawless violence, criminality, chaos, or public disorder. Since the Information failed to allege that the possession of the knife was being used in furtherance of, or to abet, or in connection with subversion, rebellion, insurrection, lawless violence, criminality, chaos, or public disorder, the second element is lacking. Thus, the MeTC disposed the case as follows:","This Court resolves the Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] assailing the Decision[2] and the Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA), which reversed the Decision[4] and Order[5] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC). The RTC set aside the April 25, 2019 and May 2, 2019 Resolutions[6] of the Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC), which granted Ronnel Buenafe Bercadez's (Bercadez) Motion to Quash the Information filed against him on the ground that the facts charged do not constitute an offense. As such, the assailed CA rulings found that the MeTC correctly quashed the information filed against Bercadez and consequently reinstated the MeTC Resolutions.
Before the MeTC, the arresting officers testified that they arrested Bercadez after they were approached by some people who informed them of an alleged attempted robbery by Bercadez. During the arrest, one of the officers felt and then saw a knife tucked in Bercadez's waist. Bercadez was eventually charged of violation of Batas Pambansa Blg. 6 (B.P. Blg. 6) in an Information,[7] the accusatory portion of which reads:","The Petition is bereft of merit.

To reiterate, the Information against petitioner charged him with ""unlawfully and feloniously carry[ing] outside of his residence, a bladed weapon (knife) not being used as a necessary tool or implement to earn a livelihood, nor used in connection therewith.""[35] This allegation constitutes the crime of violation of Section 1 of B.P. Blg. 6, which reads:

SECTION 1. Paragraph three of Presidential Decree Numbered Nine is hereby amended to read as follows:

3. It is unlawful to carry outside of one's residence any bladed, pointed or blunt weapon such as 'knife', 'spear', 'pana', 'dagger', 'bolo', 'barong', 'kris', or 'chako', except where such articles are being used as necessary tools or implements to earn a livelihood or in pursuit of a lawful activity. Any person found guilty thereof shall suffer the penalty of imprisonment of not less than one month nor more than one year or a fine of not less than Two Hundred Pesos nor more than Two Thousand Pesos, or both such imprisonment and fine as the Court may direct.

A review of Section 1 of B.P. Blg. 6 shows that the same is merely an amendatory provision to Paragraph 3 of P.D. No. 9. Prior to the amendment, the relevant portions of P.D. No. 9 read:

WHEREAS, pursuant to Proclamation No. 1081 dated September 21, 1972, the Philippines has been placed under a state of martial law;

"A.C. No. 10985, July 29, 2024","ATTY. RANDY SERRANO, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. ROSE BEATRIX CRUZ-ANGELES AND ATTY. GEORGE AHMED G. PAGLINAWAN, RESPONDENTS.","In his Complaint-Affidavit[1] dated November 5, 2015, Atty. Randy Serrano (complainant) essentially averred:

When Felix Nathaniel ""Angel"" Manalo and Lolita ""Lottie"" M. Hemedez were expelled from the membership of the Iglesia ni Cristo (INC), Isaias ""Jun"" T. Samson, Jr. (Samson), a suspended minister of the INC, held a press conference and accused several church officials of detaining him. As a result, the INC expelled Samson from its church and initiated a libel suit against him.[2]

On August 10, 2015, Atty. Cruz-Angeles posted on her Facebook page that she and Atty. Paglinawan were representing Samson. The said post likewise narrated Samson's version of events in relation to his detention:[3]
I am pleased to announce that I, together with Atty. G. Ahmed G. Paglinawan are [sic] representing Mr. Isaias Samson.

Mr. Samson has recently gained attention as one of the ministers illegally detained by persons identified with the Iglesia ni Cristo (INC's) Sanggunian. He was detained for questioning the suspicion [sic] transactions of several members of the said body and recently had made these questions public. As a result of this, he and his family were detained and later expelled from the Church

He escaped from the clutches of his captors on 23 July 2015, after being detained for over a week.

Our representation covers the handling of his cases both as respondent and as complainant. His statements will be released through the undersigned.
On August 25, 2015, Samson filed a complaint with the Department of Justice against INC church officials (Criminal Case). Atty. Cruz-Angeles assisted Samson and brought reporters from ABS-CBN to cover the event.[4]

A few days later, Atty. Paglinawan posted the following regarding the Criminal Case on a Facebook account:[5]
It is now but inevitable. [F]or the unusually weird-minded members of INC's Sanggunian to seriously plan their exits out of the country[.]
Do we allow them to leave the Philippines just like that?
My answer is;

HELL NO!

Let us gather round the fire, people.
Or their houses, for that matter?
Atty. Cruz-Angeles posted again on August 31, 2015 an open letter addressed to former President Benigno Aquino III and former Senator Mar Roxas regarding the Criminal Case, viz.:[6]
There are two things you need to do, sirs, speaking as part of the body you call your bosses. First is to be transparent with your agreement, [t]ell us whether or not you've sold our client down the river or tell us if you haven't. But you need to disclose this to us. A criminal case is not a political pawn. The law provides that it cannot be compromised. The president can grant pardons and issue clemency and amnesty. But you do NOT have the power to refuse prosecution.

Second, you must guarantee our client a fair hearing at preliminary investigation. The fear now is that given the so-called agreement finding of ""no probable cause"" to make this nightmare go away for the INC's Sanggunian is a very real possibility, [a]nd your silence is not helping. . . .
Thereafter, on various dates, multiple other post were made on the Facebook account of Atty. Cruz-Angeles.[7]

On October 20, 2015, Atty. Cruz-Angeles filed a petition for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus and amparo before this Court against Bro. Eduardo V. Manalo and other top officials of the INC for the release of Lowell R. Manorca II. Allegedly, this was done to paint an evil picture of the church officials of the INC despite the contradictions in the petition. This Court issued a writ of amparo on October 23, 2015.[8]","The Court resolves the Administrative Complaint for violations of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability against respondents Atty. Rose Beatrix Cruz-Angeles (Atty. Cruz-Angeles), and Atty. George Ahmed G. Paglinawan (Atty. Paglinawan; collectively referred to as respondents).","The Court resolves to adopt and approve in full the Resolution dated April 14, 2023 of the IBP Board of Governors.

In its Extended Resolution[11] dated April 14, 2023, the IBP Board of Governors ruled that the complaint and its submissions are bereft of any evidence on the ownership of respondents of the Facebook accounts where the subject statements were posted. Thus, complainant failed to fulfill his burden of proof to establish his allegations against respondents by substantial evidence. Nonetheless, even assuming that the ownership of the subject accounts was proven, the statements made therein were within the sphere of the constitutional protection of freedom of expression.

We agree.

First off, it is true that complainant was unable to prove, by substantial evidence, that the subject statements were made from the Facebook accounts owned by respondents.

As ordained in Tan v. Alvarico[12] an attorney enjoys the legal presumption that he or she is innocent of the charges against him or her until the contrary is proved. As a result, the burden of proof is on the complainant to establish the allegations of his or her complaint, viz.:
An attorney enjoys the legal presumption that he [or she] is innocent of the charges against him until the contrary is proved, and that as an officer of the Court, he [or she] is presumed to have performed his [or her] duties in accordance with his [or her] oath. In disbarment proceedings, the quantum of proof is substantial evidence and the burden of proof is on the complainant to establish the allegations in his [or her] complaint.
Here, the charges against respondents principally rest on the publication of the subject Facebook posts by certain accounts which were ostensibly associated with respondents. More, the complaint alleged that respondents leaked an unsigned copy of the Complaint-Affidavit of their client, Samson. To penalize respondents, therefore, the case must initially dwell on the ownership and participation of respondents vis-à-vis the accounts and the posts in question.

In Philcomsat Holdings Corp. v. Lokin, Jr.,[13] the Court decreed that the authenticity and due execution of documentary evidence, which is the primary basis of the subject complaint therein, must first be proven as a condition sine qua non to further proving the participation of the respondent in the execution of documentary evidence thus:
In essence, resolving the issue of whether Atty. Lokin should be meted with the proper disciplinary sanctions as a member of the legal profession boils down to an inquiry into the authenticity and due execution of the contentious Secretary's Certificate, the basis of the administrative charge herein. Otherwise stated, all evidence submitted to prove the existence of the loan contracted by Araneta from the Bank on September 1, 2005 or any damage caused to PHC and its shareholders as a result of the alleged improper assignment of corporate funds become inutile should Atty. Lokin's participation in the matter (i.e., the authenticity of the Secretary's Certificate) not be proven.

It is well-settled in our jurisdiction that the act of notarization by a notary public converts a private document into a public document, making it admissible in evidence without further proof of its authenticity. By law, a notarial document is entitled to full faith and credit upon its face. As such, ""[i]t enjoys the presumption of regularity and is a prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein — which may only be overcome by evidence that is clear, convincing and more than merely preponderant."" Similarly, forgery cannot be presumed and must be proved, as well, by clear, positive, and convincing evidence.

Notwithstanding the above, we are not unmindful of the principle that disciplinary proceedings against lawyers are sui generis, in that they are neither civil or criminal actions but rather investigations by the Court into the conduct of its officers. ""[A]lthough these proceedings are not, in the strict sense, ordinary actions where trials are held and the rules of procedure apply, the rules of Court on evidence cannot be shunted aside considering that the exercise of one's profession is at stake."" This principle finds particular importance in cases where the motive of the complainant in instituting the charges is not beyond suspicion. Considering the amount of administrative cases filed against Lokin by numerous persons affiliated with PHC in whatever capacity — particularly those associated with the group of Bildner and Jose Ma. Ozamiz, who represents PHC in the present Petition for Review — this Court simply cannot set aside Atty. Lokin's allegation that the complaint was instituted as a form of harassment. (Emphasis supplied)
In Fortun v. Quinsayas,[14] the Court ruled that before sanctions may be imposed on a lawyer, there must be proof of his or her participation in any alleged posting or publication subject of the complaint, thus:
Respondents De Jesus, Hulog, Batario, Mangahas, and Atty. Quinsayas alleged that petitioner was not able to establish the posting and publication of the articles about the disbarment complaint, and that assuming the posting and publication had been established, petitioner failed to support his allegation that they actively dissemin8:ted the details of the disbarment complaint. They further alleged that they did not cause the publication of the news articles and thus, they did not violate the rule on privacy and confidentiality of disbarment proceedings:
","ACCORDINGLY, the Administrative Complaint against respondents ATTY. ROSE BEATRIX CRUZ-ANGELES, and ATTY. GEORGE AHMED G. PAGLINAWAN is DISMISSED for lack of merit.

Respondents ATTY. ROSE BEATRIX CRUZ-ANGELES and ATTY. GEORGE AHMED G.

"G.R. No. 268527, July 29, 2024","ERIKA KARIZZA T. POLINTAN,* AS SOLE PROPRIETOR OF KARIZ POLINTAN ATELIER, PETITIONER, VS. ARLENE C. MALABANAN, RESPONDENT.","Polintan is the sole proprietor of a business engaged in the production of custom-made wedding gowns operating under the name Kariz Polintan Atelier. On November 14, 2019, Polintan hired Malabanan to work as a ""bead worker"" or ""beader"" in her shop. When the pandemic hit, Kariz Polintan Atelier ceased operations on March 15, 2020 due to government-imposed lockdowns. On June 1, 2020, the government eased health quarantine protocols, which enabled Kariz Polintan Atelier to partly reopen its business. Subsequently, Polintan recalled her employees back to work, except for Malabanan.[4]

Dejected, Malabanan filed a complaint for constructive dismissal, money claims and damages against Polintan as sole proprietor of Kariz Polintan Atelier. Malabanan claimed that she was a regular employee, and she was terminated without due process. During her employment, she received a daily wage of PHP 500.00, which was below the prevailing minimum wage of PHP 537.00, during the material period.[5]

For her part, Polintan asserted that Malabanan was a part-time employee, and not a regular employee since her services were engaged only when a gown would require bead work. More, she had less than 10 employees, thus, her business was exempted from paying minimum wage. She also added that she had to downsize due to the health quarantine protocols imposed by the government during the pandemic.[6]

After due proceedings, the labor arbiter rendered a Decision,[7] which dismissed Malabanan's complaint. The labor arbiter held that Malabanan failed to prove the fact of her dismissal. Bare allegations of dismissal, unsubstantiated by any evidence on record, cannot be given credence.[8] Be that as it may, the labor arbiter granted Malabanan' s claim for salary differentials from November 14, 2019 to March 15, 2020,[9] since Polintan never presented proof that she complied with the payment of minimum wage of PHP 537.00 set by the National Wages and Productivity Commission—National Capital Region (NWPC-NCR).[10] The labor arbiter underscored that Polintan failed to substantiate her allegation that she had less than 10 employees for her to be exempted from the payment of minimum wage.[11] The labor arbiter also awarded Malabanan a pro-rated 13th month pay as she worked from November 14, 2019 to March 15, 2020, and attorney's fees representing 10% of the total award since Malabanan was compelled to litigate to protect her rights and interests.[12]

The dispositive portion of the labor arbiter's Decision reads:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, the complaint for constructive dismissal filed by Arlene C. Malabanan against respondent Kariz Polintan Atelier and Erika Karizza T. Polintan is DISMISSED for lack of merit.

However, Respondent Kariz Polintan Atelier and Erika Karizza T. Polintan is DIRECTED AND ORDERED to pay complainant in the total salary differentials, 13[th] month pay and attorney's fees equivalent to 10% of the monetary award, the copy of exact computation for the monetary award is hereto attached forming part of this Decision.

Claim for moral and exemplary damages and all other claims are DISMISSED for lack of merit.","This Court resolves the Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] filed by Erika Karizza T. Polintan (Polintan), as sole proprietor of Kariz Polintan Atelier, assailing the Decision[2] and Resolution[3] of the Court Appeals (CA), which held that Polintan illegally terminated Arlene C. Malabanan (Malabanan) from employment.","The Petition lacks merit.

At the outset, this Court underscores that ""[t]he regular employment status of a person is defined and prescribed by law and not by what the parties say it should be.""[37] In other words, ""what determines regular employment is not the employment contract, written or otherwise, but the nature of the job.""[38]

Article 295 (formerly Article 280) of the Labor Code defines regular employment in this manner:
Article 295. Regular and Casual employment. — The provisions of written agreement to the contrary notwithstanding and regardless of the oral agreement of the parties, an employment shall be deemed to be regular where the employee has been engaged to perform activities which are usually necessary or desirable in the usual business or trade of the employer, except where the employment has been fixed for a specific project or undertaking the completion or termination of which has been determined at the time of the engagement of the employee or where the work or service to be performed is seasonal in nature and the employment is for the duration of the season.
 
An employment shall be deemed to be casual if it is not covered by the preceding paragraph: Provided, That any employee who has rendered at least one year of service, whether such service is continuous or broken, shall be considered a regular employee with respect to the activity in which he is employed and his employment shall continue while such activity exists.
Article 295 of the Labor Code enumerates two types of regular employees. They are ""(a) those who are engaged to perform activities which are usually necessary or desirable in the usual business or trade of the employer; and (b) those who have rendered at least one year of service, whether continuous or broken, with respect to the activity in which they are employed.""[39]

Here, Malabanan served as a bead worker at Kariz Polintan Atelier for four months before the business ceased its operations due to health quarantine protocols implemented by the government.[40] To determine whether she was hired as a regular employee, ""the standard supplied by the law itself is whether the work undertaken is necessary or desirable in the usual business or trade of the employer.""[41] This can be assessed by looking into the nature of the services rendered by the employer and the particular activity performed by the employee in relation to the usual business of the employer.[42]

Undoubtedly, Kariz Polintan Atelier is a business engaged in the production of custom-made wedding gowns. Malabanan, as a bead worker, sews embellishments on these bridal wears, which enhance the over-all aesthetic design of these gowns.[43] While not all gowns require decorative elements, it suffices that Malabanan's work has a reasonable connection or impact on Polintan's core business, since the law uses the term necessary or desirable to the business of the employer. In this case, Malabanan incorporates decorative elements on the bridal wear, which completes the look of the product and certainly adds to its market value. Therefore, Malabanan, as a bead worker, is engaged in work that is necessary or desirable in the usual trade or business of Polintan, which makes her a regular employee of Kariz Polintan Atelier.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DENIED. The February 9, 2023 Decision and August 2, 2023 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 175641 are AFFIRMED.

Respondent Arlene C. Malabanan is a regular employee of petitioner Erika Karizza T. Polintan, as sole proprietor of Kariz Polintan Atelier. Petitioner Erika Karizza T.

"G.R. No. 270580, July 29, 2024","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. JOSE ROEL BRAGAIS Y SISON AND ALFREDO TACUYO Y EVANGELISTA, ACCUSED-APPELLANTS.","This Court resolves an appeal from the April 19, 2023 Decision[3] of the Court of Appeals affirming with modification the Regional Trial Court's conviction[4] of Jose Roel Bragais y Sison (Bragais) and Alfredo Tacuyo y Evangelista (Tacuyo) for murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code.

In a July 19, 2011 Information, Bragais and Tacuyo were charged with the murder of Paula Apilado y Viray (Paula):
That on or about the 14th day of July, 2011, in Caloocan City, Metro Manila and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring, confederating[,] and mutually helping one another, with intent to kill, without any justifiable cause, by means of treachery, with evident premeditation and abuse of superior strength, did then and there willfully, unlawfully[,] and feloniously, attack, assault and use personal violence upon the person of PAULA APILADO y VIRAY, 12 years old, by stabbing her on the different parts of her body, thereby inflicting upon the latter mortal wounds which were the direct and efficient cause of her death.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[5]
Upon arraignment, Bragais and Tacuyo both pleaded not guilty.[6]

The pre-trial conference took place, where both parties stipulated on: Bragais and Tacuyo's job as caretakers of the La Loma Cemetery; their respective identities as the accused; Paula's minority; the autopsy report; and Paula's death certificate.[7]

Trial on the merits followed.[8]

The prosecution presented its witnesses: Alta Dela Cruz Delima (Alta); Mambo Dela Cruz Delima (Mambo); Lourdes Viray Bautista (Lourdes); August Raquel Bautista (August); and Dr. Robert Rey Sandiego (Dr. Sandiego) of the National Bureau of Investigation's Medico-Legal Division.[9]

In preparation for presenting Mambo as an eyewitness to the killing of Paula,[10] the prosecution first presented his mother, Alta.[11] Alta, describing Mambo as ""a special child"" with ""a speech impediment"" and ""some mental deficiency,"" stated that ""based on the examination conducted at the mental hospital,"" he is 28 years old but had a ""mental age [of] five or six years.""[12] For that reason, in July 2011, he was still living with her[13] and receiving special education.[14]

On the date of the incident, Mambo came home to Alta at around 5:00 p.m., saying, ""Ma [']eron aka kita [']dun e, gahasa siya, kita ko e, banta pa nga nila [']ko papatayin nila [']ko, e.""[15] He told her that Paula was the one getting assaulted.[16] Continuing, he said, ""Ma, punta tayo sa headquarters[,] may itatanong saken [']yung pulis, sumama ka.""[17] Alta thus went with him to the police station. She stayed with him while the investigator took his statement, which they signed together.[18]

In moving on to Mambo's testimony, the prosecution manifested that he is deemed to have a mental disability.[19] On that basis, they sought the court's permission to ask him leading questions.[20] The defense objected and asked the Regional Trial Court to require documentary evidence of Mambo's mental age.[21]

The Regional Trial Court allowed the prosecution to propound leading questions to Mambo, subject to their submission of documentary evidence on his mental age.[22] They subsequently produced a Psychiatric Report[23] which the National Center for Mental Health submitted to the court.[24] It stated that Mambo has an intellectual disability in the form of ""moderate mental retardation which is permanent and irreversible.""[25] It concluded that ""while [his] mental age was from three (3) to seven (7) years old, he was competent to testify as a witness in trial.""[26]

Coming to Mambo's testimony, he stated that he knew Paula from his special education class.[27] He identified her in three pictures: One of her on her school ID, one of her inside a coffin, and one from when her body was found in a mausoleum.[28]
","A person with intellectual disability[1] ""is not, by reason of such handicap alone. . . disqualified from testifying in court. [Intellectual disability] per se does not affect credibility. A [person with intellectual disability] may be a credible witness. The acceptance of [their] testimony depends on the quality of [their] perceptions and the manner [they] can make them known to the court. If the testimony of a [person with intellectual disability] is coherent, the same is admissible in court.""[2]","The Court similarly upholds the Court of Appeals' award of PHP 50,000.00 in temperate damages.[155] ""The award of. . . temperate damages in homicide or murder cases is proper when no evidence of burial and funeral expenses is presented in the trial court. . . as it cannot be denied that the heirs of the victims suffered pecuniary loss although the exact amount was not proved.""[156]

In closing, the Court reiterates its movement away from using the term ""mental retardate"" and its other similarly outdated, derogatory derivatives, in favor of employing people-first language.

In discussing the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities[157] which the Philippines ratified on April 15, 2008, the United Nations expounded on the Convention's objective of improving the way persons with disabilities are referred to:
In most parts of the world there are deep and persistent negative stereotypes and prejudices against persons with certain conditions and differences. These attitudes themselves also shape who is considered to be a person with a disability in each society as well as have contributed to a negative image of persons with disabilities. The language used to refer to persons with disabilities has played a significant role in the persistence of negative stereotypes. Clearly, terms such as ""crippled"" or ""mentally retarded"" are derogative. Other terms such as ""wheelchair-bound"" or ""disabled persons"" emphasize the disability before the person.

The drafters of this Convention were clear that disability should be seen as the result of the interaction between a person and his or her environment. Disability is not something that resides in the individual as the result of some impairment. This convention recognizes that disability is an evolving concept and that legislation may adapt to reflect positive changes within society.[158]
In relation, the United Nations produced its Disability-Inclusive Language Guidelines,[159] centered on the concept of a people-first language:
People-first language is the most widely accepted language for referring to persons with disabilities. It is also the language used in the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. People-first language emphasizes the person, not the disability, by placing a reference to the person or group before the reference to the disability. For example, we can use expressions such as ""children with albinism"", ""students with dyslexia"", ""women with intellectual disabilities"" and, of course, ""persons with disabilities"".[160]
Hence, citing the 2013 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,[161] in People v. Quintos,[162] the Court stated that ""the term 'intellectual disability' has replaced 'mental retardation' among the lay public, and the medical, educational, professional, and advocacy groups.""[163] Proceeding from that, in People v. Tayaban,[164] the Court used ""intellectual disability"" as a descriptor for ""moderate mental retardation,"" the latter having been utilized as a medical term.[165] Similarly, in Versoza v. People,[166] the Court clarified that ""mental retardate"" is a ""legitimate medical term"" but ""is no longer preferred due to its derogatory implications.""[167] Citing Quintos,[168] Versoza also underscored the shift to using terms such as cognitive disability or intellectual disability.[169] Most recently, in People v. Gabatbat,[170] also citing Quintos,[171] the Court re-emphasized that terms like ""person with intellectual disability"" and ""intellectual disability"" have taken the place of ""mental retardation.""[172]","ACCORDINGLY, the appeal is DISMISSED. The April 19, 2023 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR HC No. 15626 is hereby AFFIRMED.

"G.R. No. 251502, July 29, 2024","PEDRO C. LLEVARES, JR., PROVINCIAL TREASURER (RET.), MA. LUCINA LAROA CALAPRE, OFFICER-IN-CHARGE-PROVINCIAL ACCOUNTANT (RET.), JOSEPH ALTIVEROS DUARTE, PROVINCIAL BUDGET OFFICER, AND CATALINO OPINA OLAYVAR, PROVINCIAL GENERAL SERVICES OFFICER, PETITIONERS, VS. OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSMAN, AND FIELD INVESTIGATION OFFICE 1, OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSMAN, RESPONDENTS.","This case arose from a Complaint[6] dated December 19, 2012 filed by Field Investigation Office 1 (FIO 1) of the OMB on June 21, 2013[7] against officials of the provincial local government unit (PLGU) of Southern Leyte, including petitioners and several others[8] (Llevares et al.), in their capacities as Provincial Treasurer, OIC-Provincial Accountant, Provincial Budget Officer, and Provincial General Services Officer, respectively, and members of the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC), charging them with grave misconduct and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service under Rule XIV, Section 22 (f), (a), and (c) of Executive Order No. 292, as amended by Civil Service Commission (CSC) Memorandum Circular No. 19, series of 1999.[9]

FIO 1 alleged that on April 22, 2004, the Department of Agriculture (DA)-Regional Field Unit VIII (RFU VIII) and the PLGU of Southern Leyte entered into a Memorandum of Agreement[10] (MOA) for the transfer from the former to the latter of the amount of PHP 5 million for the implementation of the DA's ""Farm Inputs and Farm Implements Program,"" in accordance with existing government accounting and auditing procedures.[11]

On April 29, 2004, the PLGU of Southern Leyte received the amount of PHP 3,250,000.00, representing the first tranche of the fund. It entered into a contract with Philippine Phosphate Fertilizer Corporation (PHILPHOS) for the purchase of 4,394 bags of various grade fertilizers in the amount of PHP 3,217,381.20 by direct contracting or single source procurement, instead of conducting a public bidding in accordance with Section 10[12] of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of Republic Act No. (RA) 9184,[13] on the basis of its justification that PHILPHOS is the exclusive manufacturer of the various fertilizers.[14]

Subsequently, the Commission on Audit (COA) conducted an audit investigation on the funds released by the DA-RFU VIII, where it discovered multiple violations of the MOA, among others: (a) separate books were not maintained for the funds covered by the ""Farm Inputs and Farm Implements Program;"" (b) no copy of the project proposal stating that PHILPHOS shall be the supplier of fertilizers was submitted to DA-RFU VIII; (c) there was no submission of audited reports covering the procurement of the fertilizers; and (d) there was dubious distribution of fertilizers. Based on the records of the Fertilizer and Pesticide Authority (FPA), it has accredited two other suppliers of fertilizer in Southern Leyte.[15]

Thus, FIO 1 claimed that the concerned public officials knowingly, purposedly, and willfully signed the documents which facilitated the release of funds to PHILPHOS despite knowing full well the existence of other eligible manufacturers or distributors of fertilizers, and should thus be administratively held liable.[16]

Llevares failed to file his counter-affidavit or position paper despite due notice of the OMB's directives.[17]

Duarte and Calapre jointly filed their Counter-Affidavit[18] dated September 14, 2013[19] and Position Paper[20] dated March 23, 2014, essentially claiming that they could not be held administratively liable for procuring the fertilizers from PHILPHOS because it is the exclusive manufacturer of fertilizers within the region, adding that the Office of the Provincial Agriculturist certified that there was no suitable substitute of the same quality of fertilizers available at a price most advantageous to the government. Calapre further maintained that she could not be faulted for having certified the availability of funds because at the time of the transaction, there was sufficient fund for the questioned procurement.[21]
 
On the other hand, Olayvar in his Counter-Affidavit[22] dated August 27, 2013 and Position Paper[23] dated March 26, 2015 claimed that he did not commit any wrong or violate any rule of law or standard of behavior when the PLGU of Southern Leyte procured and purchased from PHILPHOS despite the lack of public bidding. He maintained that PHILPHOS is the exclusive manufacturer of fertilizers within the region, as certified by the Office of the Provincial Agriculturist, and the procurement was approved by then Provincial Governor Rosette Y. Lerias (Lerias), the Head of the Procuring Entity.[24]","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assailing the Decision[2] dated April 16, 2019 and the Resolution[3] dated January 16, 2020 of the Court of Appeals (CA), which affirmed the Decision[4] dated June 14, 2017 and the Order[5] dated April 30, 2018 of the Office of the Ombudsman (OMB). The assailed rulings found petitioners Pedro C. Llevares, Jr. (Llevares), Ma. Lucina Laroa Calapre (Calapre), Joseph Altiveros Duarte (Duarte), and Catalino Opina Olayvar (Olayvar; collectively, petitioners) administratively liable for grave misconduct, serious dishonesty, and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service and imposed on them the penalty of dismissal from service with all the accessory penalties.","The Petition is impressed with merit.

Article III, Section 16 of the Constitution guarantees every person's right to the speedy disposition of his/her case, to wit:
Section 16. All persons shall have the right to a speedy disposition of their cases before all judicial, quasi-judicial, or administrative bodies.
""This constitutional right is not limited to the accused in criminal proceedings but extends to all parties in all cases, be it civil or administrative in nature, as well as in all proceedings, either judicial or quasi-judicial. In this accord, any party to a case may demand expeditious action of all officials who are tasked with the administration of justice.""[48]

Specifically, Article XI, Section 12 of the Constitution requires the OMB to act promptly on all complaints filed before it, thus:
Section 12. The Ombudsman and his Deputies, as protectors of the people, shall act promptly on complaints filed in any form or manner against public officials or employees of the Government, or any subdivision, agency, or instrumentality thereof, including government-owned or controlled corporations, and shall, in appropriate cases, notify the complainants of the action taken and the result thereof. (Emphasis supplied)
Further echoing the OMB's constitutional duty is Section 13 of RA 6770, otherwise known as ""The Ombudsman Act of 1989,"" which reads:
SECTION 13. Mandate. — The Ombudsman and his Deputies, as protectors of the people, shall act promptly on complaints filed in any form or manner against officers or employees of the Government, or of any subdivision, agency, or instrumentality thereof, including government­-owned or controlled corporations, and enforce their administrative, civil and criminal liability in every case where the evidence warrants in order to promote efficient service by the Government to the people.
Thus, in assessing whether the right to speedy disposition of cases has been violated, the following factors should be considered in determining if there was delay in the disposition of cases: (1) length of the delay, (2) reasons for the delay, (3) assertion of right by the accused, and (4) prejudice to the respondent.[49]

In the landmark case of Cagang v. Sandiganbayan,[50] the Court set comprehensive guidelines for resolving alleged violations of the right to speedy trial or disposition of cases, viz.:
First, the right to speedy disposition of cases is different from the right to speedy trial. While the rationale for both rights is the same, the right to speedy trial may only be invoked in criminal prosecutions against courts of law. The right to speedy disposition of cases, however, may be invoked before any tribunal, whether judicial or quasi-judicial. What is important is that the accused may already be prejudiced by the proceeding for the right to speedy disposition of cases to be invoked.

Second, a case is deemed initiated upon the filing of a formal complaint prior to a conduct of a preliminary investigation. This Court acknowledges, however, that the Ombudsman should set reasonable periods for preliminary investigation, with due regard to the complexities and nuances of each case. Delays beyond this period will be taken against the prosecution. The period taken for fact-finding investigations prior to the filing of the formal complaint shall not be included in the determination of whether there has been inordinate delay.

Third, courts must first determine which party carries the burden of proof. If the right is invoked within the given time periods contained in current Supreme Court resolutions and circulars, and the time periods that will be promulgated by the Office of the Ombudsman, the defense has the burden of proving that the right was justifiably invoked. If the delay occurs beyond the given time period and the right is invoked, the prosecution has the burden of justifying the delay.

If the defense has the burden of proof, it must prove first, whether the case is motivated by malice or clearly only politically motivated and is attended by utter lack of evidence, and second, that the defense did not contribute to the delay.

Once the burden of proof shifts to the prosecution, the prosecution must prove first, that it followed the prescribed procedure in the conduct of preliminary investigation and in the prosecution of the case; second, that the complexity of the issues and the volume of evidence made the delay inevitable; and third, that no prejudice was suffered by the accused as a result of the delay.

Fourth, determination of the length of delay is never mechanical. Courts must consider the entire context of the case, from the amount of evidence to be weighed to the simplicity or complexity of the issues raised.

An exception to this rule is if there is an allegation that the prosecution of the case was solely motivated by malice, such as when the case is politically motivated or when there is continued prosecution despite utter lack of evidence. Malicious intent may be gauged from the behavior of the prosecution throughout the proceedings. If malicious prosecution is properly alleged and substantially proven, the case would automatically be dismissed without need of further analysis of the delay.

Another exception would be the waiver of the accused to the right to speedy disposition of cases or the right to speedy trial. If it can be proven that the accused acquiesced to the delay, the constitutional right can no longer be invoked. In all cases of dismissals due to inordinate delay, the causes of the delays must be properly laid out and discussed by the relevant court.

Fifth, the right to speedy disposition of cases or the right to speedy trial must be timely raised. The respondent or the accused must file the appropriate motion upon the lapse of the statutory or procedural periods. Otherwise, they are deemed to have waived their right to speedy disposition of cases.[51] (Emphasis supplied)
Based on the aforementioned standards, this Court finds that the OMB violated petitioners' right to speedy disposition of the administrative case against them.

"G.R. No. 271081 [Formerly UDK-17851], July 29, 2024","DEXTER BARGADO Y MORGADO, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","Bargado was charged in an Information that reads as follows:
That on October [1], 2017, in the City of Tuguegarao, Province of Cagayan, and within the Jurisdiction of the Honorable Court, the accused­-appellant Bargado, without any authority of law or without the necessary documents from the [COMELEC], did then and there, willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously, possess and carry along with him a Caliber .45 firearm which is described as ROCK ISLAND ARMORY, a small arm with Serial No. RIA 1867480 with inserted magazine loaded with seven (7) live ammunition that while members of the [Philippine National Police (PNP)] assigned at Tuguegarao City Police Station were conducting mobile patrol along the vicinity of this city, they received an information that a commotion was in progress along Aguinaldo Street, Centro 02, this city prompting them to proceed at the preferred place; that upon arrival thereat, they saw [Bargado] along the street holding his aforesaid firearm; that the police officers immediately approached [Bargado] and confronted him regarding his firearm; that [Bargado] carried and possessed the firearm outside his residence at a time covered by October 2017 election firearm ban; that the incident also resulted to the confiscation of the firearm with inserted magazine and loaded with seven (7) live ammunition from the possession, control, and custody of [Bargado] by the authorities of the law.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[4]
Bargado filed a Motion to Quash the Information. In the Motion, Bargado argued that: (1) the facts charged do not constitute an offense on the basis that supervening events, namely the lifting of the election gun ban, rendered the incident a non-offense; (2) the criminal action or liability has been extinguished on the basis that the election gun ban was repealed by Republic Act No. 10952, which postponed the 2017 barangay elections, as well as the related COMELEC and Philippine National Police (PNP) issuance; and (3) the officer who filed the Information had no authority to do so, the COMELEC having the exclusive power to prosecute election offenses.[5]

Notably, Republic Act No. 10952, or ""An Act Postponing the October 2017 Barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan Elections, Amending for the Purpose Republic Act No. 9164, as amended by Republic Act No. 9340, Republic Act No. 10632, Republic Act No. 10656, and Republic Act No. 10923, and for Other Purposes,""[6] was enacted on October 2, 2017, or a day after Bargado's arrest. It states:
Section 1. Date of Election. – There shall be synchronized barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan elections, which shall be held on July 15, 2002. Subsequent synchronized barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan elections shall be held on the last Monday of October 2007 and every three (3) years thereafter: Provided, That the barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan elections on October 23, 2017 shall be postponed to the second Monday of May 2018. Subsequent synchronized barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan elections shall be held on the second Monday of May 2020 and every three (3) years thereafter.","This Court resolves a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] filed by petitioner Dexter Bargado y Morgado (Bargado) assailing the Decision[2] and Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA) finding him guilty of violating Section 261, paragraph (q) in relation to Section 264 of the Omnibus Election Code, as amended, in further relation to Section 32 of Republic Act No. 7166 and Commission on Elections (COMELEC) Resolution No. 10198, for carrying a firearm in violation of the COMELEC gun ban for the October 2017 barangay elections.","The Petition is impressed with merit.

The question raised pertaining to the relevance of an election postponement to a conviction for an election offense is a purely legal one as it does not require further examination or review of the evidence on record.[30] Thus, the issue presented involves a question of law, necessitating this Court's review.

The prohibition on carrying of firearms is provided in Batas Pambansa Blg. 881, otherwise known as the Omnibus Election Code, worded as follows:
Section 261. Prohibited Acts. - The following shall be guilty of an election offense:

....

(q) Carrying firearms outside residence or place of business. - Any person who, although possessing a permit to carry firearms, carries any firearms outside his residence or place of business during the election period, unless authorized in writing by the Commission: Provided, That a motor vehicle, water or air craft shall not be considered a residence or place of business or extension hereof.

This prohibition shall not apply to cashiers and disbursing officers while in the performance of their duties or to persons who by nature of their official duties, profession, business or occupation habitually carry large sums of money or valuables.
Republic Act No. 7166 later amended Batas Pambansa Blg. 881, and clarified who may bear arms:
Section 32. Who May Bear Firearms. - During the election period, no person shall bear, carry or transport firearms or other deadly weapons in public places, including any building, street, park, private vehicle or public conveyance, even if licensed to possess or carry the same, unless authorized in writing by the Commission. The issuance of firearms licenses shall be suspended during the election period.

Only regular members or officers of the Philippine National Police, the Armed Forces of the Philippines and other enforcement agencies of the Government who are duly deputized in writing by the Commission for election duty may be authorized to carry and possess firearms during the election period: Provided, That, when in the possession of firearms, the deputized law enforcement officer must be: (a) in full uniform showing clearly and legibly his name, rank and serial number which shall remain visible at all times; and (b) in the actual performance of his election duty in the specific area designated by the Commission.
Based on these provisions, the prosecution must prove the following elements to secure a conviction: (a) the person is bearing, carrying, or transporting firearms or other deadly weapons; (b) such possession occurs during the election period; and (c) the weapon is carried in a public place.[31]

In this case, petitioner does not dispute the first and third elements. He explicitly admitted during trial that he possessed a firearm at the time of the incident, which he brought out in defense against the persons attacking him:

"G.R. No. 262944, July 29, 2024","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. GIANNE CARLA THANARAJ Y GLORIA, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","The instant case stemmed from an Information[5] filed against Gianne, the accusatory portion of which reads:
That on or about the 5th day of April 2017 in Caloocan City, Metro Manila, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, without any justifiable cause, with deliberate intent to kill, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously stab her husband MERVIN ROY RICHARD THANARAJ y MANANSALA, on the neck, thereby inflicting upon the said victim serious physical injuries, which injuries caused the accused's husband's death.","This Court resolves an Appeal[1] assailing the Decision[2] and Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA), which affirmed with modification the Judgment[4] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) finding accused-appellant Gianne Carla Thanaraj y Gloria (Gianne) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of parricide under Article 246 of the Revised Penal Code against her husband, Mervin Roy Richard Thanaraj y Manansala (Mervin).","We acquit.

In cases of parricide, Article 246 of the Revised Penal Code provides:
Article 246. Parricide. — Any person who shall kill his father, mother, or child, whether legitimate or illegitimate, or any of his ascendants, or descendants, or his spouse, shall be guilty of parricide and shall be punished by the penalty of reclusion perpetua to death.
Parricide is committed when: (1) a person is killed; (2) the accused is the killer; and (3) the deceased is either the legitimate spouse of the accused, or any legitimate or illegitimate parent, child, ascendant or descendant of the accused. Notably, the relationship of the offender to the victim is an essential element to the crime.[60]

Here, the fact of Mervin's death remains undisputed and was proven through the presentation of his Death Certificate.[61] Further, the marriage between the parties was established through the presentation of their Report of Marriage which, likewise, formed part of the stipulations[62] during pre-trial, having been admitted by accused-appellant herself.

After a review of the records, this Court is inclined to rule in favor of accused-appellant as the prosecution was unable to prove her guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

One of the primary considerations of the CA in upholding accused-appellant's conviction was the extent, nature, and trajectory of the wound sustained by Mervin through the findings of Dr. Aguda.","ACCORDINGLY, the Appeal is GRANTED. The October 12, 2020 Decision and May 26, 2022 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 11732 are REVERSED. Gianne Carla Thanaraj y Gloria is ACQUITTED of parricide under Article 246 of the Revised Penal Code. She is ORDERED to be IMMEDIATELY RELEASED from detention unless she is being held for some other valid or lawful cause.

COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, KOMUNIDAD NG PAMILYA, PASYENTE AT PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES [P3PWD] PARTY-LIST AND ITS NOMINEES LED BY ROWENA AMELIA V. GUANZON, RESPONDENTS.","The factual antecedents as gathered from the respective memoranda of the Duterte Youth Party-List,[7] respondents P3PWD and Guanzon,[8] and the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) on behalf of respondent COMELEC[9] are as follows:

In 2012, the COMELEC issued Resolution No. 9366,[10] which laid down the rules on withdrawal and substitution of party-list nominees, among others.

In 2015, Guanzon was appointed as Commissioner of the COMELEC to serve a term of seven years, or until February 2, 2022.[11]

On January 27, 2021, the COMELEC promulgated Resolution No. 10690[12] which amended Resolution No. 9366 by setting new deadlines for the withdrawal and substitution of nominations, and requiring party-list groups, organizations, and coalitions to publish, at their own expense, their new list of substitute nominees, within five days from the submission of said list for purposes of the 2022 National and Local Elections (NLE).

On March 23, 2021, P3PWD filed its Petition for Registration and Accreditation as a regional sectoral organization under the party-list system.[13]

On August 18, 2021, the COMELEC issued Resolution No. 10717[14] which recapped the different deadlines concerning political parties and groups or organizations participating under the party-list system for the 2022 NLE.

By the last day set by COMELEC under its Resolution No. 10695, 270 party-list groups—including Duterte Youth and P3PWD—had expressed their intent to participate in the 2022 NLE.[15]

On October 6, 2021, P3PWD submitted the following list of nominees to the COMELEC Law Department:

Grace S. Yeneza

Michelle R. Ofalla

Guillermo R. Eugenio[16]
On November 5, 2021, P3PWD filed the withdrawal with substitution of its second to fifth nominees and published its new set of nominees in two newspapers of general circulation on November 6, 2021 pursuant to Resolution No. 10717. Thus, the new nominees of P3PWD were:

5th
Lily Grace A. Tiangco
Substitute nominee[17]
In Minute Resolution No. 21-13275 dated November 24, 2021, the COMELEC En Banc approved the withdrawal with substitution of nominees of several registered party-lists, including those of P3PWD.[18]

On December 29, 2021, the COMELEC published online the Final List of Party-List Candidates for the 2022 NLE, which included P3PWD.[19]

On February 2, 2022, Chairperson Sheriff Abas, Commissioners Antonio Kho, Jr., and Guanzon retired from their respective COMELEC posts,[20] leaving the body with a total of four Commissioners.

On election day, May 9, 2022, P3PWD garnered 391,174 votes or 1.0629% of the total votes cast for party-list organizations, thus, entitling it to one seat in the House of Representatives (HOR).[21]

On May 26, 2022, the COMELEC En Banc sitting as the National Board of Canvassers (NBOC) proclaimed P3PWD entitled to one seat in the HOR. On the same day, it proclaimed first nominee, Grace S. Yeneza, entitled to sit as representative in the HOR. On May 30, 2022, Yeneza took her oath before Presiding Judge Augusto Jose Y. Arreza of the Regional Trial Court of Makati, Branch 233. On even date, copies of her Certificate of Proclamation and Oath of Office were furnished to the HOR.[22]

On June 7, 2022, second nominee Pozon resigned as a trustee, nominee, and member of P3PWD for personal reasons. Two days later, third to fifth nominees Fullon, David, and Tiangco likewise resigned. Fullon did not state her reason while David resigned due to personal reasons. Tiangco reasoned that she needed to assist her husband in their businesses. A day later, first nominee Yeneza tendered her resignation in order to personally care for her daughter who was diagnosed with stage 3 cancer in December 2021. She acknowledged that while she already took her oath of office, it would not be fair to her party constituents to carry on as their representative in Congress if she cannot give her full attention to the job.[23] Their resignation en masse was reported by various news organizations on June 14, 2022.[24]

On June 14, 2022, P3PWD filed the following before the COMELEC Law Department: (1) Letter from P3PWD Secretary-General Donnabel C. Tenorio regarding the submission of the Board of Resolution of Resignation of Party-List Nominees and Acceptance of Nominees; (2) Affidavit of Filing; (3) Board Resolution No. 2022-02 accepting the resignations of all nominees and substituting its new nominees; (4) notarized resignation letters of nominees; (5) Affidavit of Tenorio and Yeneza stating that the substitute nominees have all the qualifications and none of the disqualifications provided by law; and (6) Certificate of Nomination (CON) and Certificates of Acceptance of Nomination (CAN) of the following substitute nominees:

On June 15, 2022, the COMELEC En Banc, voting three to one, promulgated Minute Resolution No. 22-0774,[26] which granted the withdrawal of the nominations of the previous nominees and gave due course to the above new list of nominees, subject to compliance with the publication requirement under Resolutions Nos. 10690 and 10717. The dispositive portion reads:","In order to safeguard the electorate's will as cast in the ballots, rules and regulations limiting the substitution of party-list nominees do not lose their mandatory character even after elections.

However, it is a long standing principle in jurisprudence that rules and regulations for the conduct of elections are mandatory before the election, but when they are sought to be enforced after the election they are held to be directory only, if that is possible, especially where, if they are held to be mandatory, innocent voters will be deprived of their votes without any fault on their part. Over time, we have qualified this doctrine to refer only to matters of form and cannot be applied to the substantial qualifications of candidates. This was discussed at length in Mitra v. Commission on Elections, thus:

... [I]t is an established rule of interpretation as regards election laws, that mandatory provisions, requiring certain steps before elections, will be construed as directory after the elections, to give effect to the will of the people.

Quite recently, however, we warned against a blanket and unqualified reading and application of this ruling, as it may carry dangerous significance to the rule of law and the integrity of our elections. For one, such blanket/unqualified reading may provide a way around the law that effectively negates election requirements aimed at providing the electorate with the basic information for an informed choice about a candidate's eligibility and fitness for office. Short of adopting a clear-cut standard, we thus made the following clarification:

... In a choice between provisions on material qualifications of elected officials, on the one hand, and the will of the electorate in any given locality, on the other, we believe and so hold that we cannot choose the electorate will.[105] (Emphasis supplied)","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition in G.R. No. 261123 is GRANTED. COMELEC Minute Resolution No. 22-0774, dated June 15, 2022 is declared NULL and VOID for having been issued with grave abuse of discretion insofar as it approved the substitution of the nominees of respondent P3PWD Party-List. The Court's Temporary Restraining Order dated June 29, 2022 is made PERMANENT.

Respondent P3PWD Party-List is DIRECTED to submit additional nominees pursuant to Section 16 of Republic Act No. 7941 but is STRICTLY ENJOINED from renominating for the duration of the Nineteenth Congress the nominees whose substitutions were declared null and void by this Decision, namely Ma. Rowena Amelia V. Guanzon, Rosalie J. Garcia, Cherrie B. Belmonte-Lim, Donnabel C. Tenorio, and Rodolfo B. Villar, Jr.

The Petition in G.R. No. 261876 is DISMISSED for lack of merit.

Respondent Ma. Rowena Amelia V. Guanzon's countercharge for indirect contempt is likewise DISMISSED for being procedurally defective.

This Decision is immediately executory."
"G.R. No. 254976, August 20, 2024","MARCELINO DELA CRUZ LINGGANAY, PETITIONER, VS. DEL MONTE LAND TRANSPORT BUS COMPANY, INC. AND NARCISO MORALES, RESPONDENTS.","The case stemmed from the amended complaint for illegal dismissal which Lingganay filed against respondents on July 13, 2017. In the amended complaint, Lingganay alleged that respondents illegally terminated his employment and claimed for payment of moral and exemplary damages and attorney's fees.[8]

On August 17, 2017, Lingganay filed his Position Paper With Urgent Motion to Amend[9] his amended complaint (motion to further amend), wherein he prayed for the following additional awards: separation pay, holiday premium, rest day pay, and underpaid wages.

Lingganay alleged that (1) respondents initially hired him as a bus driver with a daily salary of PHP 337.00; (2) on October 21, 2013, while driving the company bus along Maharlika Highway in Barangay Concepcion, Plaridel, Province of Quezon, he figured in an accident involving one Isidro Alvarez; (3) eventually, respondents settled the matter with Isidro Alvarez; (4) on December 7, 2013, his employment contract with respondents ended, but he continued to work as a ""yardman"" with a daily wage of PHP 300.00; (5) on December 10, 2013, respondents rehired him as a bus driver; (6) sometime in 2014, respondents assigned him at the motor pool division of the company in Cubao, Quezon City; (7) subsequently, on July 15, 2015, respondents transferred him to the Lucena Line of DLTB Co.;[10] (8) on November 5, 2015, respondents suspended him for five days for failure to ""take time schedule"" on October 8, 2015; (9) on January 21, 2017, respondents again suspended him for 10 days for being involved in an accident with a motorcycle on December 30, 2016; (10) he resumed his duties on January 31, 2017, but ""with warning"" from respondents; (11) on May 1, 2017, while driving the company bus along the San Juanico Bridge, Samar, he again figured in an accident as he crashed into the rear portion of a Toyota Wigo; (12) consequently, respondents issued a Memorandum[11] dated May 5, 2017, giving him five days to explain his side and placing him under preventive suspension; (13) on May 22, 2017, he submitted a handwritten Salaysay and attended the administrative hearing/investigation of the case.[12]

In the Decision[13] dated May 29, 2017, respondents terminated Lingganay from employment for transgressing the company rules and regulations on health and safety, i.e., ""Violation 8.1.4 — Any form of laxity, reckless driving and gross negligence resulting to damages to property, injuries, death[,] and other casualties.""[14] This prompted Lingganay to file a complaint for illegal dismissal with money claims against respondents. In his complaint, Lingganay argued as follows:
It was not his fault that a van suddenly overtook the Toyota Wigo which was in front of the bus he was then driving. Regardless of the driving distance between the two vehicles, the descending condition of the road made it difficult for the bus driven by the Complainant not to hit the Toyota Wigo which made a sudden and unexpected stop to avoid hitting the van that overtook it.

At any rate, the negligence – even if true – must be gross and habitual ... These [characteristics were] wanting in the present case.

....

[W]hile the Complainant had been involved in other accidents before, these accidents were only minor ones. There was also no finding by the Respondent Company that the Complainant was negligent and/or that he was the cause of these accidents. Notably, the Respondents even allowed the Complainant to report back to work after these accidents.[15]
For their part, respondents averred that they hired Lingganay as a bus driver on December 10, 2013, but they dismissed him on May 29, 2017, for habitually transgressing the company rules and regulations on health and safety. They recounted that on December 30, 2016, the bus driven by Lingganay bumped a motorcycle at Barangay Tabason, Tagkawayan, Quezon, causing physical injuries to the motorcycle driver and his back rider. Likewise, respondents narrated that on May 1, 2017, Lingganay, while driving the company bus along the San Juanico Bridge, Samar, figured in another accident when he crashed into the rear portion of a Toyota Wigo.[16] According to respondents, the recklessness of Lingganay caused damage to the company bus amounting to PHP 6,500.00 and to the Toyota Wigo in the amount of PHP 99,000.00;[17] and to avoid any legal suit against the company, they were compelled to settle the full amount of PHP 99,000.00 with the car owner.[18] Respondents argued that as Lingganay habitually drove the company bus recklessly, his dismissal from work was justified for violating the company rules and regulations on health and safety.","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assailing the Decision[2] and the Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 155756. The CA affirmed the Decision[4] and the Resolution[5] of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) in NLRC LAC No. 11-003517-17 (NLRC NCR-06-09385-17) which agreed with the Labor Arbiter (LA) that Del Monte Land Transport Bus Company, Inc. (DLTB Co.) and Narciso Morales (collectively, respondents) validly dismissed Marcelino Dela Cruz Lingganay (Lingganay) from employment. Moreover, the CA agreed with the LA in denying his motion to further amend[6] his Amended Complaint.[7]","""It is an established rule that only questions of law may be raised in a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45. The basic principle is set forth in the rule itself.""[39] The question as to whether Lingganay violated Rule V, Sections 11 and 12 of the 2011 NLRC Rules in incorporating his motion to amend and his second amended complaint in his position paper is a question of law; thus, it is a proper subject of the instant Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.

Equally important is the rule that in a Rule 45 review in labor cases, the Court examines the CA's Decision from the prism of whether [in a petition for certiorari,] the latter had correctly determined the presence or absence of grave abuse of discretion in the NLRC's Decision, i.e., in affirming the LA's denial of Lingganay's motion to further amend his amended complaint.[40]

In San Fernando Coca-Cola Rank-and-File Union (SACORU) v. Coca­Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc. (CCBPI),[41] the Court explained the concept of grave abuse of discretion as applied in NLRC decisions brought to the CA under Rule 65:
""[G]rave abuse of discretion may arise when a lower court or tribunal violates or contravenes the Constitution, the law or existing jurisprudence."" The Court further held in Banal III v. Panganiban that:
By grave abuse of discretion is meant, such capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction. The abuse of discretion must be grave as where the power is exercised in an arbitrary or despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility and must be so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined by or to act at all in contemplation of law.
The reason for this limited review is anchored on the fact that the petition before the CA was a certiorari petition under Rule 65; thus, even the CA did not have to assess and weigh the sufficiency of evidence on which the NLRC based its decision. The CA only had to determine the existence of grave abuse of discretion. As the Court held in Soriano, Jr. v. National Labor Relations Commission:
As a general rule, in certiorari proceedings under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, the appellate court does not assess and weigh the sufficiency of evidence upon which the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC based their conclusion. The query in this proceeding is limited to the determination of whether or not the NLRC acted without or in excess of its jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion in rendering its decision.[42]
To recall, the case stemmed from the original complaint for illegal dismissal which Lingganay amended on July 13, 2017. In his first amended complaint, Lingganay alleged that respondents illegally terminated him from employment and claimed for payment of moral and exemplary damages, and attorney's fees.[43] On August 17, 2017, Lingganay filed his position paper with motion to further amend his amended complaint,[44] wherein he added as a prayer his alleged entitlement to separation pay, holiday premium, and underpaid wages.[45] For being in violation of Rule V, Section 11 of the 2011 NLRC Rules, as amended, the LA did not allow Lingganay to further amend his complaint. On appeal although the NLRC did not discuss the issue of whether Lingganay violated the 2011 NLRC Rules, as amended, in incorporating his motion to amend and his second amended complaint in his position paper, it nonetheless affirmed altogether the ruling of the LA which not only held that respondents validly dismissed Lingganay from work, but likewise denied Lingganay's motion to further amend his amended complaint.[46] In his Rule 65 and Rule 45 petitions, Lingganay justified the incorporation of his motion to amend and his second amended complaint in his position paper, citing as basis the Court's ruling in the case of Our Haus Realty Development Corporation.

The case of Our Haus Realty Development Corporation involved the complaint of Alexander Parian et al. (Parian et al.) for underpayment of wages with claims for payment of holiday pay, 13th month pay, and overtime pay, which the LA dismissed in favor of Our Haus Realty Development Corporation. Upon appeal, the NLRC partially reversed the ruling of the LA and found that Parian et al. were actually underpaid. The NLRC also ruled that the employees were entitled to their respective proportionate 13th month pay and service incentive leave (SIL) pay. Our Haus Realty Development Corporation filed a petition for certiorari under Rule 65, but the CA affirmed the ruling of the NLRC. In its Rule 45 petition, Our Haus Realty Development Corporation argued, among others, that the CA erred in agreeing with the ruling of the NLRC that Parian, et al. were entitled to SIL pay, pointing out that such claim was not included in their pro forma complaint before the LA. Citing the case of Samar-Med Distribution v. NLRC,[47] the Court allowed the grant of SIL to Parian et al. holding that ""[a] claim not raised in the pro forma complaint may still be raised in the position paper.""[48] 
 
The ruling in Our Haus Realty Development Corporation was based on the Court's pronouncement in the case of Samar-Med Distribution
 ","WHEREFORE, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED. The July 6, 2020 Decision and December 9, 2020 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 155756 are hereby AFFIRMED."
"G.R. No. 271741, August 20, 2024","DATU SAJID S. SINSUAT, EBRAHIM P. DIOCOLANO, AND FEBY A. ACOSTA, PETITIONERS, VS. HON. AHOD BALAWAG EBRAHIM, IN HIS CAPACITY AS INTERIM CHIEF MINISTER OF THE BANGSAMORO GOVERNMENT, AND BANGSAMORO TRANSITION AUTHORITY (BTA), RESPONDENTS.","On July 21, 2018, the Bangsamoro Organic Law was approved. Its purpose is to establish a political entity and provide for its basic structure of government in recognition of the justness and legitimacy of the cause of the Bangsamoro people and the aspirations of Muslim Filipinos and all indigenous cultural communities in the BARMM to secure their identity and posterity, allowing for meaningful self-governance within the framework of the Constitution and the national sovereignty as well as territorial integrity of the Republic of the Philippines.[3]

Subsequently, on May 27, 2021, Republic Act No. 11550, or the Charter of the Provinces of Maguindanao del Norte and Maguindanao del Sur, was enacted into law. The Municipality of Datu Odin Sinsuat was designated as the capital town and seat of government of Maguindanao del Norte.[4]

On September 28, 2023, after its approval in the plenary on the third and final reading, Chief Minister Ebrahim and Bangsamoro Parliament Speaker Atty. Pangalian Balindong signed into law BAA 49, or the Bangsamoro Local Governance Code of 2023 (Bangsamoro LGC). It provided for the manner of division and merger of existing local government units and mandated the conduct of a plebiscite for divided and merged local government units, among others.

On December 20, 2023, the BTA, assembled in Parliament, and passed the bills creating three new towns in Maguindanao del Norte. Chief Minister Ebrahim signed BAAs 53, 54, and 55 on December 26, 2023.

First. BAA 53 created the Municipality of Nuling. Section 2 of BAA 53 identified the barangays to be separated from the Municipality of Sultan Kudarat, Maguindanao del Norte, thus:
Sec. 2. Creation of the Municipality. – The Barangays of Matengen, Ladia, Pigcalagan, Alamada, Raguisi, Pinaring, Damaniog, Ibotegen, Banatin, Nara, Kakar, Katidtuan, Maidapa, Kapimpilan, Bulibod, Kabuntalan, Nalinan, Panatan, and Katamlangan are hereby separated from the Municipality of Sultan Kudarat, Maguindanao del Norte and constituted into a distinct and independent municipality to be known as Municipality of Nuling, which is hereby created in the province of Maguindanao del Norte.
Second. BAA 54 created the Municipality of Datu Sinsuat Balabaran. Section 2 of BAA 54 identified the barangays to be separated from the Municipality of Datu Odin Sinsuat, the capital town of Maguindanao del Norte, thus:
Sec. 2. Creation of the Municipality. – The Barangays of Tapian, Linek, Dinaig Proper, Tamontaka, Tanuel, Kusiong, Mompong, Semba, Capiton, Tambak, Badak, Awang and Dulangan are hereby separated from the Municipality of Datu Odin Sinsuat, Maguindanao del Norte and constituted into a distinct and independent municipality to be known as Municipality of Datu Sinsuat Balabaran, which is hereby created in the Province of Maguindanao del Norte.
Third. BAA 55 created the Municipality of Sheik Abas Hamza. Section 2 of BAA 55 identified the barangays to be separated also from the Municipality of Datu Odin Sinsuat, thus:
Sec. 2. Creation of the Municipality. – The Barangays of Labungan, Taviran, Baka, Sapalan, Sifaran, Bugawas, Bitu, Kurintem, Margues, and Makir are hereby separated from the Municipality of Datu Odin Sinsuat, Maguindanao Del Norte and constituted into a distinct and independent municipality to be known as Municipality of Sheik Abas Hamza, which is hereby created in the Province of Maguindanao del Norte.
The petition in G.R. No. 271741 assailing BAAs 54 and 55 was filed on February 15, 2024, while the petition in G.R. No. 271972 challenging BAA 53 was filed on February 29, 2024.

The Court received the COMELEC's Comment[5] dated March 15, 2024 in G.R. No. 271741 on May 6, 2024. For G.R. No. 271972, the Court received the COMELEC's Comment[6] dated March 20, 2024 on March 25, 2024, and the BTA and Chief Minister Ebrahim's Comment[7] dated March 25, 2024 on April 3, 2024 and Supplemental Comment[8] dated June 3, 2024 on June 13, 2024. In the meantime, this Court ordered the consolidation of G.R. Nos. 271741 and 271972 in a Resolution[9] dated April 3, 2024.","The recognition of the cause of the Bangsamoro people and the aspirations of Muslim Filipinos and all indigenous cultural communities in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) sits at the core of the Bangsamoro Organic Law. It fulfills the promise of meaningful self-governance within the framework of the Constitution and national sovereignty. Since its enactment and implementation, the Court has protected the enshrined purpose of Republic Act No. 11054 or the Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (Bangsamoro Organic Law).

This case underscores the significance of ensuring that the Bangsamoro Government's actions are in consonance with our country's revered legal precepts. As new municipalities are created in the region, the Bangsamoro Government should ensure that the constituents who will be affected thereby are recognized and heard through an appropriate plebiscite. Failing to do so betrays the very spirit of the cause they have long fought for.","The Court declares that the plebiscite provisions of the BAAs 53, 54, and 55 violate the 1987 Constitution and the Bangsamoro Organic Law. As a consequence thereof, the COMELEC is enjoined from implementing COMELEC Resolutions Nos. 11011 and 11012 pursuant to BAAs 53, 54, and 55 effective immediately.

A final injunction is proper only after the court has a definite pronouncement respecting an applicant's right and of the act violative of such right.[59] In Consular Area Residents Association, Inc. v. Casanova,[60] We explained that a writ of injunction would issue only upon the satisfaction of three requisites, namely: (1) a right in esse or a clear and unmistakable right to be protected; (2) a violation of that right; and (3) that there is an urgent and permanent act and urgent necessity for the writ to prevent serious damage.

In this case, it is clear that the foregoing requisites are present.

First, the right to participate in the scheduled plebiscites of all qualified voters in the Municipalities of Sultan Kudarat and Datu Odin Sinsuat which are not part of the new municipalities of Nuling, Datu Sinsuat Balabaran, and Sheik Abas Hamza is enshrined in no less than Article X, Section 10 of the 1987 Constitution, Article VI, Section 10 of the Bangsamoro Organic Law, and settled jurisprudence.

Second, the uniform text in Section 5 of BAAs 53, 54, and 55 denied the affected voters their right to participate in the scheduled plebiscites. This unequivocal denial was issued in direct contravention of the Constitution and the Bangsamoro Organic Law.

Third, there is an urgent need to promptly enjoin the implementation of BAAs 53, 54, and 55 as the COMELEC has already promulgated the necessary resolutions implementing the plebiscites of the assailed BAAs.

There is no question that petitioners have established the existence of a clear and actual right that ought to be protected that warrants the protection of injunctive relief from this Court. Thus, We permanently enjoin the COMELEC from implementing COMELEC Resolution Nos. 11011 and 11012 pursuant to BAAs 53, 54, and 55.

X.  
Final Word

 
""With great power comes great responsibility.""[61] As a final note, in line with the principle of self-governance, the Bangsamoro Government is granted specific powers, which include the authority to create municipalities. The exercise of this power entails observance of the requirements under the 1987 Constitution, the Bangsamoro Organic Law, and other relevant laws. The conduct of a plebiscite in the political units directly affected by the proposed action is imperative. This democratic prerequisite recognizes that the entire constituency affected should always have the final say on the matter. To disenfranchise qualified voters makes a mockery of the entire exercise.","FOR THESE REASONS, the petitions in G.R. Nos. 271741 and 271972 are PARTIALLY GRANTED. The phrase ""qualified voters in a plebiscite to be conducted in the barangays comprising the municipality pursuant to Section 2 hereof"" in the uniform text of Section 5 in Bangsamoro Autonomy Act Nos. 53, 54, and 55 is declared UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

The prayer for injunctive relief is likewise GRANTED. Accordingly, a FINAL PROHIBITORY INJUNCTION is hereby ISSUED, EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY. Respondent Commission on Elections is ENJOINED to DESIST from holding plebiscites on September 7 and 21, 2024 pursuant to Resolution Nos. 11011 and 11012, as well as from performing any and all acts related to the ratification of Bangsamoro Autonomy Act Nos. 53, 54, and 55."
"A.M. No. RTJ-23-039 (Formerly JIB FPI No. 21-075-RTJ), August 20, 2024 ","ROLLY C. CASTILLO, COMPLAINANT, VS. HON. MIGUEL S. ASUNCION, PRESIDING JUDGE, BRANCH 99, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, ANTIPOLO CITY, RIZAL, RESPONDENT.","Castillo and the other stall holders at the New Cubao Central Market in Cainta, Rizal (plaintiffs) filed a Complaint for Damages with Prayer for the Issuance of a Writ of Preliminary Injunction against Princeville Construction and Development Corporation and Engineer Alfred Figueras (defendants) before the RTC for forcibly driving them out of the market and taking possession and control over it. The case, docketed as Civil Case No. 15-10803, was raffled to the RTC presided by Judge Asuncion.[2]

On April 1, 2016, Judge Asuncion conducted a hearing on the plaintiffs' prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction. He ordered the parties to file their respective memoranda within 15 days from receipt of the ruling of the court on the formal offer of evidence, after which, the matter shall be deemed submitted for resolution.[3] Judge Asuncion issued separate Orders,[4] dated February 12, 2016, and April 27, 2016, respectively admitting the exhibits formally offered by the plaintiffs and the defendants in relation to the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction. The plaintiffs submitted their Memorandum[5] on July 14, 2016, while the defendants did not.[6]

On July 20, 2017, the plaintiffs filed a Motion to Re-Open Hearing on Plaintiffs' Prayer for Issuance of a Writ of Preliminary Mandatory Injunction[7] (motion to re-open) praying for the reopening of the hearing on the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction in view of the plaintiffs' newly discovered evidence. Judge Asuncion then required the parties to submit their pleadings. Despite compliance with this Order, the plaintiffs' motion was not resolved[8] so they filed an Ex-Parte Motion to Resolve Prayer for Writ of Preliminary Injunction[9] dated June 5, 2017, a Second Ex-Parte Motion to Resolve[10] dated November 2, 2017, an Ex Parte Motion to Resolve[11] dated April 23, 2018, and an Ex Parte Motion for Resolution of Prayer for Writ of Injunction[12] dated December 7, 2018.

Thereafter, the plaintiffs filed a Motion to Transfer Case to Another Sala[13] (motion to transfer) dated February 19, 2020, and a Motion for Inhibition[14] dated August 20, 2020.

Due to Judge Asuncion's continued failure to resolve their prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction, Castillo filed the present Complaint against him. He argued that Judge Asuncion is guilty of Gross Inefficiency for his failure to resolve their prayer for issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction, and Dishonesty for certifying, in relation to receiving his salary, that he has no pending matters to resolve.[15]

In its 1st Indorsement[16] dated November 16, 2021, the Judicial Integrity Board (JIB), through the Office of its Acting Executive Director (OED), required Judge Asuncion to file a verified comment to the verified Complaint within 10 days from his receipt of the Indorsement. The JIB issued another Indorsement[17] dated February 2, 2023, reiterating that Judge Asuncion should file his verified comment, as well as to show cause why he should not be disciplined as a member of the Bar for violation of Canon 12, Rule 12.04[18] of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR).

Judge Asuncion finally filed his Motion to Admit[19] with Comment[20] on April 17, 2023. He averred that he had to attend to an influx of equally important and pressing matters that demanded his immediate attention: (1) his designation as Executive Judge for the RTC Antipolo City from October 16, 2020, to November 3, 2022, or during the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) the conduct of hearings for applications of search warrants during said period; (3) pending applications for bail; (4) various meetings with local government offices; (5) his assignment as Assisting Judge[21] in January 2021; (6) his additional designation as Special Commercial Court and Cybercrime Court; and (7) the issuance of various circulars directing judges to give preference to criminal cases. Judge Asuncion explained that the foregoing contributed to the lapse of time that it took to resolve Civil Case No. 15-10803.[22]

In addition, Judge Asuncion averred that Castillo filed several motions that prayed for different reliefs. In any event, Judge Asuncion issued an Order[23] dated April 11, 2023, denying the plaintiffs' prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction. Judge Asuncion pointed out that the present Complaint is not the proper remedy to assail his ruling in the civil case. Finally, he stated that he was adopting his Comment as to why he should not be penalized as a member of the Bar.[24]","Before the Court is a Complaint[1] filed by Rolly C. Castillo (Castillo) against Hon. Miguel S. Asuncion (Judge Asuncion), Presiding Judge of Branch 99, Regional Trial Court of Antipolo City, Rizal (RTC) for Dishonesty and Gross Inefficiency.","The Court agrees with the findings of the JIB but modifies the penalty imposed.

Preliminarily, the Court clarifies that the subject of the Complaint is the alleged delay of Judge Asuncion in resolving the plaintiffs' prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction. Castillo does not assail the denial of their prayer in his Complaint before the Court. Accordingly, the principle that judicial remedies must first be exhausted before resorting to an administrative complaint,[38] does not apply here.

The timely resolution of pending matters before the court is required by no less than Article VIII, Section 15 of the Constitution:
SECTION 15. (1) All cases or matters filed after the effectivity of this Constitution must be decided or resolved within twenty-four months from date of submission for the Supreme Court, and, unless reduced by the Supreme Court, twelve months for all lower collegiate courts, and three months for all other lower courts.

(2) A case or matter shall be deemed submitted for decision or resolution upon the filing of the last pending, brief, or memorandum required by the Rules of Court or by the court itself.

(3) Upon the expiration of the corresponding period, a certification to this effect signed by the Chief Justice or the presiding judge shall forthwith be issued and a copy thereof attached to the record of the case or matter, and served upon the parties. The certification shall state why a decision or resolution has not been rendered or issued within said period.

(4) Despite the expiration of the applicable mandatory period, the court, without prejudice to such responsibility as may have been incurred in consequence thereof, shall decide or resolve the case or matter submitted thereto for determination, without further delay.
Thus, Canon 6, Section 5 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct enjoins judges to promptly rule on cases pending before the court:
SECTION 5. Judges shall perform all judicial duties, including the delivery of reserved decisions, efficiently, fairly, and with reasonable promptness.
In relation thereto, OCA Circular No. 243-2022 reminded judges to observe the following guidelines:
1. To strictly observe the reglementary or prescribed periods to decide pending cases and/or resolve incidents, and if in the mind of the Judge he or she could not comply with the aforementioned prescribed period/s, he or she may ask the Court, through the Office of the Court Administrator, for an extension of time to do so. Appended herein for your guidance is a list of reglementary periods to decide cases and/or resolve incidents (see Annex ""A"");

2. Except in certain situations under the Rules of Expedited Procedure in the First Level Courts in which memoranda are prohibited, cases are deemed submitted for decision upon admission of the evidence, unless the court directs the parties to argue or to submit their respective memoranda or any further pleadings; and

3. The ""[f]ailure to decide cases within the reglementary period constitutes a ground for administrative liability except when there are valid reasons for the delay.""
The plaintiffs in Civil Case No. 15-10803 filed their Complaint for Damages with Prayer for the Issuance of a Writ of Preliminary Injunction on November 11, 2015. Judge Asuncion issued an Order dated April 1, 2016, which required the parties to file their memoranda within 15 days from receipt of the ruling of the court on the formal offer of evidence, and declared the matter deemed submitted for resolution upon the lapse of such period. Judge Asuncion issued an Order dated February 12, 2016, and April 27, 2016, respectively, admitting the pieces of evidence of the plaintiffs and the defendants. Only the plaintiffs filed their memorandum on July 14, 2016. Nonetheless, Judge Asuncion only ruled on the plaintiffs' prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction on April 11, 2023, or almost seven years after it was submitted for resolution.

Judge Asuncion avers that the plaintiffs filed several motions which contributed to the delay in the resolution of their prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction. However, the plaintiffs cannot be blamed for such delay as it was already existent even before they filed their various motions a year after they submitted their memorandum, or on July 20, 2017. Further, the motions filed by the plaintiffs were consistent with their previous prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction. The various ex parte motions merely urged Judge Asuncion to finally rule on the matter, while the motion to reopen allegedly presented new evidence in support of their prayer. The motion to transfer and motion for inhibition were likewise filed for the purpose of securing the preliminary injunction, albeit through another court. Furthermore, Judge Asuncion still incurred delay even if the period is counted from the plaintiffs' motion to reopen, as it was filed in 2017, but he issued an order only in 2023.

Judge Asuncion also tries to excuse the delay on the ground that he had other pressing matters to deal with during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. But as duly observed by the JIB, the plaintiffs' prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction was submitted for resolution long before the COVID-19 pandemic began. While the COVID-19 pandemic was surely a challenging time for all members of the Judiciary, it cannot be used as a justification for wrongful acts or omissions that took place prior to or during this period.

Undue delay in rendering an order is now subsumed under neglect of duty in Rule 140 of the Rules of Court, as further amended. On the one hand, it is considered Gross Neglect of Duty when it is ""characterized by the want of even slight care, or by acting or omitting to act in a situation where there is a duty to act, not inadvertently but [willfully] and intentionally, with a conscious indifference to the consequences, insofar as other persons may be affected.""[39] On the other hand, it is Simple Neglect of Duty when there is failure to give proper attention to a required task or a disregard of duty due to carelessness or indifference.[40]

Judge Asuncion's seven-year delay is inexcusable considering that the prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction, by its nature, implies that it must be addressed urgently. Castillo explained in the pleadings that their very livelihood was at stake.[41] Judge Asuncion did not offer any sufficient justification for his delay, such as the complexity of the case or the filing of dilatory motions by the parties. Taking these circumstances into consideration, Judge Asuncion is guilty of gross neglect of duty.

Gross Neglect of Duty in the Performance or Non-performance of Official Functions is a serious charge under Rule 140, Section 14(d) of the Rules of Court, as further amended, that is punishable by first, dismissal from the service together with its accessory penalties; second, suspension from office without salary and other benefits for more than six months but not exceeding one year; or third, a fine of more than PHP 100,000.00 but not exceeding PHP 200,000.00.","ACCORDINGLY, the Court FINDS respondent Hon. Miguel S. Asuncion, Presiding Judge, Branch 99, Regional Trial Court, Antipolo, Rizal, GUILTY of Gross Neglect of Duty in the Performance or Non-Performance of Official Functions under Rule 140, Section 14(d) of the Rules of Court, as further amended by A.M. No. 21-08-09-SC, and hereby ORDERS him to pay a FINE of PHP 201,000.00. Respondent Hon. Miguel S.

"A.M. No. 24-04-09-SC, August 20, 2024",RE: DRAFT IMPLEMENTING RULES AND REGULATIONS OF REPUBLIC ACT NO. 11691 OR THE JUDICIARY MARSHALS ACT,"In 2019, Judge Reymar Lacaya (Judge Lacaya) of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) in Zamboanga Del Norte, was shot and killed outside a courthouse.[1] He was at the parking area when a lone gunman approached and shot him in broad daylight.[2]

In the same year, Judge Mario Anacleto Bañez (Judge Bañez) of the RTC in Ilocos Sur, was gunned down by men on a motorcycle as he was driving home to San Fernando City, La Union.[3] He was found with a bullet wound in the head and died while being taken to the hospital.[4] His killing came only four days after a former Judge, Exequil Dagala (Judge Dagala), was shot dead inside his house in Surigao del Norte.[5]

The year after, in 2020, Judge Ma. Theresa Abadilla (Judge Abadilla) of the RTC Manila was shot in the head inside her chamber at Manila City Hall.[6] The killing was reported to have been done by Judge Abadilla's Clerk of Court, who purportedly shot her after their conversation about his work performance.[7] Unfortunately, Judge Abadilla was declared dead on arrival at the hospital.[8]

Reports reveal that the deaths of Judges Lacaya, Bañez, Dagala, and Abadilla represent just a fraction of the increasing incidents involving violent crimes committed against members of the Judiciary. There have been over 33­34 judges killed while in service.[9] Less than 10% of these cases have been resolved, and there are several wherein the instigator remains to be unidentified.[10]

In every case involving the killing of members of the Judiciary, the Court, together with the legal community, has strongly condemned such violent acts. The Court has expressed admiration for judges and their display of courage in the administration of justice. At the same time, it has exerted efforts to look into potential institutional changes, in order to enhance protection for members of the Judiciary.

Institutionalizing protection of the members of the Judiciary: Creation of the Office of the Judiciary Marshals


The Supreme Court called for a legislative act that will create a battalion-size independent armed unit patterned after the United States (U.S.) Marshal Service to secure the judiciary and assist in the administration of justice.[11] In response, Senator Richard Gordon (Senator Gordon) introduced Senate Bill No. 1947 entitled, ""An Act Creating the Office of the Judiciary Marshals, Defining its Functions and Powers, Appropriating Funds Therefor, and for Other Purposes."" In his sponsorship speech, he discussed the alarming problem of killing of judges, with deaths already reaching 34 since 1999, including the following notable cases:
In 2004, Judge Voltaire Rosales was ambushed in Batangas Road. The killer, an inmate and a drug lord in Muntinlupa, was traced through the help of Gen. Edgardo Aglipay.

In 2007, Judge Nathaniel Pattugalan was shot dead while on board a passenger jeepney in Quezon City. The first attempt to kill him was while he was driving to work in Cagayan where a gunshot wound in the head paralyzed him.

In 2015, Judge Erwin Alaba was mercilessly shot dead in the chest while he was driving in Baler, Aurora. His spouse was wounded in the incident.

In the same year, Judge Wilfredo T. Nieves died after incurring multiple gunshot wounds in the head and right upper extremities. Raymond Dominguez, one of the notorious Dominguez Brothers who have been involved in carnapping since 2010, was identified as the mastermind in the killing.

Judge Edmundo Pinlac was shot dead by motorcycle-riding gunmen while on his way to Ozamis City.
Meanwhile, in the co-sponsorship speech of Senator Ronald Dela Rosa, he highlighted the recent case of Atty. Baby Maria Concepcion Landero-Ole, who was gunned down by unidentified men while driving her pick-up truck along the Danao City Highway in Cebu.[12]

The Senators pointed out that since 2016, at least 54 judges, prosecutors, and lawyers have already been killed. Further, as of January 2021, only 23 cases had been filed in court, 15 of which were on trial, with only two convictions and six acquittals. The Philippine National Police further reported that 47 suspects were still at large, six suspects were already released, 26 suspects were detained, while seven were killed.[13]

With these reports, Senator Gordon remarked that there seemed to be a pandemic that has been causing the gruesome deaths of judges in the country. Nothing was being done except to leave the responsibility for protecting judges and resolving their cases with the police and other authorities. The government was simply letting the judges walk around as if they were expected to always remain strong and undeterred in handling cases assigned to them amid threats to their lives because of their profession.[14]","The Judiciary bears the crucial task of upholding the rule of law and preserving the rights and guarantees granted by the Constitution. To ensure the fulfillment of such duty, the members of the Judiciary must be free from any threat that may prevent them from exercising their functions. It is to this end that the Supreme Court sought, and the Congress provided, for the creation of a body primarily tasked to protect, defend, safeguard, watch over, provide security, and ensure the safety of the members of the Judiciary and court personnel as well as the halls where they sit.","The Supreme Court called for a legislative act that will create a battalion-size independent armed unit patterned after the United States (U.S.) Marshal Service to secure the judiciary and assist in the administration of justice.[11] In response, Senator Richard Gordon (Senator Gordon) introduced Senate Bill No. 1947 entitled, ""An Act Creating the Office of the Judiciary Marshals, Defining its Functions and Powers, Appropriating Funds Therefor, and for Other Purposes.""

The Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act No. 11691 or the Judiciary Marshals Act shall take effect after fifteen (15) days from its publication in the Official Gazette or two (2) newspapers of general circulation."
"G.R. No. 273136, August 20, 2024","ELISEO MIJARES RIO, JR., AUGUSTO CADELIÑA LAGMAN, AND FRANKLIN FAYLOGA YSAAC, PETITIONERS, VS. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS EN BANC, RESPONDENT.","Before the Court is a Petition for Mandamus[1] under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court filed by petitioners Eliseo Mijares Rio, Jr., Augusto Cadeliña Lagman, and Franklin Fayloga Ysaac (Rio, Jr. et al.) praying that the Court issue a writ of mandamus to compel respondent COMELEC to implement its November 29, 2023 Resolution[2] which stated that it will ""recount the ballots to settle once and for all the substantive issues raised by petitioners, as prayed for in petitioners' Motion dated January 19, 2024 and Reiterative Motion dated February 12, 2024 in EM Case No. [2]3-003.""[3]

The present controversy stemmed from the same factual background as Smartmatic TIM Corporation and Smartmatic Philippines, Inc. v. Commission on Elections En Banc.[4] In 2023, Rio, Jr. et al. and Leonardo Olivera Odoño filed a Petition,[5] Supplemental Petition,[6] and Second Supplemental Petition[7] before the COMELEC En Banc. Among other reliefs, Rio, Jr. et al. prayed that ""[t]he qualifications of [Smartmatic Philippines, Inc. (Smartmatic)] be reviewed by the [Bids and Awards Committee (BAC)] in view of the serious and material irregularities in the transmission and reception of election results in the system which Smartmatic developed and provided for the [May 9, 2022] Elections,""[8] and that the COMELEC En Banc order the BAC to ""disqualify or declare ineligible Smartmatic from participating in the procurement for the 2025 Automated Election System"" if the ""serious and grave irregularities"" are not satisfactorily explained.[9]

On August 10, 2023, the COMELEC En Banc directed its law department to review and submit a recommendation on the petitions filed by Rio, Jr. et al.[10] On August 31, 2023, the COMELEC Law Department submitted its Compliance, opining that there is no legal basis to prohibit Smartmatic from participating in the bidding process.[11]

On October 5, 2023, the COMELEC En Banc set the case for hearing on October 17, 2023.[12] It also required Smartmatic to comment on the Petitions.[13]

On November 29, 2023, the COMELEC En Banc ruled in favor of Rio, Jr. et al. The dispositive portion of its Resolution reads:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Commission (En Banc) hereby RESOLVED to GRANT the Petition. SMARTMATIC PHILIPPINES, INC. is DISQUALIFIED AND DISALLOWED from participating in any public bidding process for elections, in the exercise of its administrative power to decide all matters affecting election [sic] and in pursuit of its constitutional mandate.

FURTHER, the Commission (En Banc) hereby RESOLVES that in the exercise of its administrative power, it may, upon Petitioner's instance, order the conduct of the recount of ballots in areas in every region in the country, the procedure and extent of which to be determined, and at no cost to Petitioner.","The Commission on Elections (COMELEC) may not be compelled by mandamus to exercise its discretion in a certain way, i.e., to grant or deny the opening and recounting of ballot boxes. However, it has a clear legal duty to expeditiously resolve motions pending before it, following its own rules of procedure.","We first resolve the Petition for Mandamus.

A writ of mandamus has the following requisites: (1) the plaintiff has a clear legal right to the act demanded; (2) it must be the duty of the defendant to perform the act because it is mandated by law; (3) the defendant unlawfully neglects the performance of the duty enjoined by law; (4) the act to be performed is ministerial, not discretionary; and (5) there is no appeal or any other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.[31]

In National Press Club of the Philippines v. Commission on Elections,[32] the Court described mandamus and defined ""ministerial duty"" as follows:
Mandamus is an extraordinary writ commanding a person, tribunal, corporation, board, or officer to do an act required to be done, as when they/it unlawfully neglects the performance of an act which the law specifically enjoins as a duty, and there is no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. The duty is ministerial only when its discharge requires neither the exercise of official discretion nor judgment. Mandamus can be awarded only when the petitioner's legal right to the performance of the particular act, which is sought to be compelled, is clear and complete.[33] (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)
In Subrabas v. Abas,[34] the Court explained the distinction between ministerial and discretionary acts, thus:
An act is considered ministerial if ""an officer or tribunal performs in the context of a given set of facts, in a prescribed manner and without regard for the exercise of his or its own judgment, upon the propriety or impropriety of the act done."" In contrast, an act is considered discretionary ""[i]f the law imposes a duty upon a public officer, and gives him [or her] the right to decide how or when the duty shall be performed."" The writ will lie if the tribunal, corporation, board, officer[,] or person unlawfully neglects the performance of an act which the law enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust[,] or station. The writ of mandamus, however, will not issue to compel an official to do anything which is not his [or her] duty to do, or to give to the applicant anything to which he [or she] is not entitled by law.[35] (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)
The Court has also held that only specific legal rights are enforceable by mandamus, which requires that the right sought to be enforced must be certain and clear, and the writ will not issue in cases where the right is doubtful.[36]

In the case at bar, Rio, Jr. et al. simply generalize that ""[a]ll the requisites for the issuance of a writ of mandamus are present in the instant case""[37] yet they fail to identify, much less substantiate, these requisites. Rio, Jr. et al. do not point to any law specifically requiring the conduct of a recount of the physical ballots in the 2022 National and Local Elections, much less prescribing the manner of the recount such that no discretion is left to the COMELEC. Moreover, the dispositive portion of the COMELEC's November 29, 2023 Resolution expressly states that the COMELEC ""may, upon Petitioner's instance, order the conduct of the recount of ballots in areas in every region in the country,""[38] the ""procedure and extent of which [are] to be determined[.]""[39] Thus, contrary to Rio, Jr. et al.'s protestations, the present controversy does not involve a ministerial act on the part of the COMELEC as the recount of physical ballots prayed for by Rio, Jr. et al. requires the exercise of the COMELEC's discretion and judgment.

Rio, Jr. et al. having failed to establish any ministerial duty on the part of the COMELEC and any clear, complete, and specific legal right to a recount as prayed for in their Motion and Reiterative Motion before the COMELEC, their prayer for a writ of mandamus lacks merit.

It bears stressing that the COMELEC En Banc already acted on the Motion and Reiterative Motion on July 3, 2024. Nonetheless, the Court shares the view of Associate Justice Amy C. Lazaro-Javier that the COMELEC was guilty of official inaction when it decided the said Motions way beyond the period prescribed by its own rule that ""any case or matter submitted to or heard by the Commission en banc shall be decided within [30] days from the date it is deemed submitted for decision or resolution.""[40] From the filing of the Motion and Reiterative Motion on January 19, 2024, and February 12, 2024, it took the COMELEC 166 and 142 days, respectively, to resolve the Motions.

Even the COMELEC itself recognized in its Order[41] dated July 3, 2024 that its own rules prescribe a period within which to resolve pending motions before it:
As defined in Section 1, Rule [11] of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure, a motion is an application for an order not included in a decision of the Commission or a Division. Thus, as applications, motions are addressed to sound discretion of the Commission, which discretion will not be interfered with unless it has been abused.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Mandamus is DISMISSED. The Motion for Leave to File and Admit Attached Supplemental Petition dated July 12, 2024 is DENIED, and the attached Supplemental Petition also dated July 12, 2024 is NOTED WITHOUT ACTION."
"G.R. No. 246379, August 19, 2024","COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, PETITIONER, VS. DOHLE SHIPMANAGEMENT PHILIPPINES CORPORATION, RESPONDENT.","On March 31, 2014, Dohle filed an application for refund or issuance of tax credit certificate (TCC) of its unutilized input VAT covering the four quarters of calendar year 2012.[6]

On July 28, 2014, Dohle submitted additional documents in support of its application for refund or issuance of TCC.[7]

There being no action taken by the CIR on Dohle's administrative claim for refund or issuance of TCC, Dohle filed a Petition for Review before the CTA Second Division on December 23, 2014. The case was docketed as CTA Case No. 8960.[8]

In a Decision dated December 16, 2016, the CTA Second Division, partially granted Dohle's petition and ordered the CIR to refund or issue a TCC in favor of Dohle in the amount of PHP 7,196,472.58, representing unutilized excess input VAT attributable to Dohle's zero-rated sales/receipts for the four quarters of calendar year 2012.[9]

The CTA Second Division found that Dohle's judicial claim for refund was timely filed within the 120+30-day periods under Section 112(C) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended (1997 Tax Code). According to the CTA Second Division, the 120-day period begins to run from the date of submission of complete documents supporting the administrative claim.[10]

However, the CTA Second Division found that Dohle fell short of proving its entitlement to the entire amount of its refund claim.[11]

Aggrieved, the CIR moved for reconsideration assailing mainly the probative value of some of the documentary exhibits submitted by Dohle. The CIR insisted that Dohle failed to substantially prove its entitlement to the refund claim.[12]

In its Resolution[13] dated May 22, 2017, the CTA Special Second Division denied the CIR's motion.

The CIR elevated the case to the CTA EB and mainly argued that (1) Dohle's invoices and official receipts failed to comply with the mandatory requirements under the law, and (2) the documentary exhibits presented by Dohle were all hearsay and have no probative value.[14]","Before the Court is the Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] (Petition) filed by petitioner Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR), assailing the Decision[2] dated July 26, 2018 and Resolution[3] dated April 1, 2019 of the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc (CTA EB) in CTA EB No. 1665. The CTA EB affirmed the Decision[4] dated December 16, 2016 of the CTA Second Division in CTA Case No. 8960, which partially granted respondent Dohle Shipmanagement Philippines Corporation's (Dohle) claim for refund in the amount of PHP 7,196,472.58, representing unutilized excess input Value-Added Tax (VAT) attributable to its zero-rated sales for the four quarters of calendar year 2012.[5]","The crux of the controversy in this case is the interpretation of Section 112 of the 1997 Tax Code in the case of Pilipinas Total Gas. For the CIR, Pilipinas Total Gas implies that the 120-day period for the CIR to act on the claim should be counted from the submission of the supporting documents or the lapse of the 30-day period under RMC 49-2003, whichever comes first. On the other hand, for Dohle, from the plain language of Section 112(C) of the 1997 Tax Code the 120-day period for the CIR to act on the administrative claim commences to run only upon submission by the taxpayer of the supporting documents. Thus, a review of the facts and ruling of the Court in Pilipinas Total Gas is imperative in the resolution of the present case.

Interpretation of Section 112 of the 1997 Tax Code in the case of Pilipinas Total Gas
Section 112 of the 1997 Tax Code, as amended, provides:

SEC. 112. Refunds or Tax Credits of Input Tax. —

(A) Zero-Rated or Effectively Zero-Rated Sales. — Any VAT-registered person, whose sales are zero-rated or effectively zero-rated may, within two (2) years after the close of the taxable quarter when the sales were made, apply for the issuance of a tax credit certificate or refund of creditable input tax due or paid attributable to such sales, except transitional input tax, to the extent that such input tax has not been applied against output tax: Provided, however, That in the case of zero-rated sales under Section 106(A)(2)(a)(1), (2) and (b) and Section 108(B)(1) and (2), the acceptable foreign currency exchange proceeds thereof had been duly accounted for in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP): Provided, further, That where the taxpayer is engaged in zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sale and also in taxable or exempt sale of goods or properties or services, and the amount of creditable input tax due or paid cannot be directly and entirely attributed to any one of the transactions, it shall be allocated proportionately on the basis of the volume of sales: Provided, finally, That for a person making sales that are zero-rated under Section 108(B)(6), the input taxes shall be allocated ratably between his zero-rated and non-zero-rated sales.

. . . .

(C) Period within which Refund or Tax Credit of Input Taxes shall be Made. — In proper cases, the Commissioner shall grant a refund or issue the tax credit certificate for creditable input taxes within one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of submission of complete documents in support of the application filed in accordance with Subsection (A) hereof.

In case of full or partial denial of the claim for tax refund or tax credit, or the failure on the part of the Commissioner to act on the application within the period prescribed above, the taxpayer affected may, within thirty (30) days from the receipt of the decision denying the claim or after the expiration of the one hundred twenty day-period, appeal the decision or the unacted claim with the Court of Tax Appeals. (Emphasis supplied)

The law categorically provides that the 120-day period for the CIR to decide the administrative claim for VAT refund runs from the date the taxpayer submits ""complete documents"" in support of its application for refund.

In relation to the foregoing, in Pilipinas Total Gas, the Court was confronted with the issue of ""when should the submission of documents be deemed 'completed' for purposes of determining the running of the 120-day period.""[34]

Pertinent portions of the Court En Banc's ruling in Pilipinas Total Gas are quoted below:","The Judiciary bears the crucial task of upholding the rule of law and preserving the rights and guarantees granted by the Constitution. To ensure the fulfillment of such duty, the members of the Judiciary must be free from any threat that may prevent them from exercising their functions. It is to this end that the Supreme Court sought, and the Congress provided, for the creation of a body primarily tasked to protect, defend, safeguard, watch over, provide security, and ensure the safety of the members of the Judiciary and court personnel as well as the halls where they sit."
"G.R. No. 263887, August 19, 2024","PHILIPPINE PRIMARK PROPERTIES, INC., PETITIONER, VS. CHINA BANKING CORPORATION TRUST AND ASSETS MANAGEMENT GROUP, RESPONDENT.","On May 11, 2018, Primark entered into an Omnibus Notes Facility and Security Agreement (ONFSA) with China Banking Corporation (CBC) and China Bank Savings, Inc. (CBSI) (collectively, the Banks), where the Banks granted Primark a Notes Facility in the maximum aggregate amount of PHP 7 billion. Under the ONFSA, to secure Primark's obligations, the latter assigned all its present and future rights and interests over its receivables arising from its contracts of lease and/or similar contracts with its tenants in favor of CBC-TAMG as its assignee/security trustee. Both Primark and CBC-TAMG informed the tenants about the arrangement.[6]

Aside from the assignment of receivables, the ONFSA also required Primark to provide a Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA). The DSRA must meet a certain maintaining balance (DSRA Maintaining Balance). In the event that Primark is unable to timely pay its loan obligations, CBC-TAMG was authorized to debit from the DSRA such amounts as may be necessary to pay the debt due to the Banks. In turn, within a certain period, Primark must replenish the debited funds to meet the DSRA Maintaining Balance.[7]

Primark was able to make 10 drawdowns under the ONFSA in the total amount of PHP 3,947,000,000.00. Thereafter, it requested CBC and CBSI to waive certain conditions precedent so that Primark may obtain additional borrowings under the ONFSA. It also proposed several amendments to the terms and conditions of the ONFSA. However, the Banks first required Primark to comply with the conditions precedent before the release of additional funds and before any discussion on the ONFSA amendments.[8]

In a Letter[9] dated August 13, 2019, Primark gave notice to CBC that it is abrogating the ONFSA on the ground that it is void ab initio for being a mere credit accommodation by CBC and CBSI to their directors, officers, stockholders, and related interests (DOSRI), in violation of Section 36[10] of the Republic Act No. 8791 or the General Banking Law. Primark also informed CBC-TAMG of the abrogation in a Letter[11] dated September 2, 2019.

Thereafter, on September 4, 2019, Primark failed to pay the interest due on its borrowings amounting to PHP 76,868,808.74. Pursuant to the ONFSA, CBC-TAMG debited the said amount from the DSRA, which then fell below the debt service reserve requirement. Primark likewise failed to cover the shortfall in the DSRA and was unable to meet the DSRA Maintaining Balance required under the ONFSA. Thus, it was declared in default on December 5, 2019.[12]

Meanwhile, on various dates from March 14, 2017, until August 3, 2018, Primark entered into Contracts of Lease[13] with BDO over its properties situated in several locations for the establishment of BDO's branches. On May 22, 2018,[14] August 3, 2018,[15] February 11, 2019,[16] and April 23, 2019,[17] Primark sent notices of Assignment of Receivables to BDO, informing the latter that it entered into a Security Assignment with CBC-TAMG, wherein Primark assigned to CBC-TAMG, as security, all of its receivables arising from the contracts of lease with BDO. Further, Primark stated in the notices that it was authorizing BDO, upon the instruction of CBC-TAMG, to pay and deliver the receivables to the bank account that may be designated by the latter.

BDO religiously paid and delivered the rental payments to Primark on their due dates. However, on February 4, 2020, BDO received a notice from CBC-TAMG denominated as Security Assignment[18] stating, among others:

In accordance with the provisions of the Security Assignment and the Receivable Assignment Notice, we hereby give notice to you that an Acceleration Event has occurred and that the Receivables have been assigned by the Assignor to the Security Trustee for the benefit of the Secured Parties. Thus, you are hereby instructed by the Security Trustee effective immediately upon your receipt of this notice (i) to cease complying with the instructions or demands in respect of the Receivables from the Assignor or any other party other than the Security Trustee; and (ii) not to recognize any attempt by the Assignor to claim or receive the Receivables, or to distribute or deliver to the Assignor or any other party any sum, security or other Property forming part of or arising from the Receivables, other than upon written instruction of the Security Trustee.[19]

On even date, CBC-TAMG also sent Instructions[20] to BDO to: (a) pay or deliver the receivables directly to it when they fall due under the lease agreements; (b) not recognize any attempt by Primark to claim or receive the receivables; (c) cease compliance with instructions from Primark or any party other than CBC-TAMG; and (d) comply with all the instructions of CBC-TAMG in respect of the receivables.[21]

On the next day, February 5, 2020, Primark sent a letter[22] to BDO telling the latter to ignore CBC-TAMG's notices because the Security Assignment was void ab initio. Thus, BDO should still deliver its rental payments to Primark. BDO, in its letter reply to CBC-TAMG dated February 17, 2020,[23] informed the latter that it cannot honor CBC-TAMG's instructions because of the letter that it received from Primark challenging the legality of the assignment.

With the conflicting claims of Primark and CBC-TAMG, BDO wrote a letter to Primark dated April 7, 2020,[24] stating that it will issue checks payable to Primark or CBC-TAMG for its rentals starting in March 2020.

In a letter[25] to BDO dated June 26, 2020, CBC-TAMG reiterated its earlier instruction to deliver the payment of rentals directly to it. For its part, Primark sent demand letters[26] to all the lessee BDO branches, all dated June 30, 2020, demanding the payment of rent and informing the latter that Primark will not recognize any payment made to unauthorized persons.

The foregoing antecedents prompted BDO to institute a Complaint for Interpleader with Prayer for Consignation[27] against Primark and CBC-TAMG before the RTC-57 (the first interpleader case). It prayed that Primark and CBC-TAMG be required to interplead and settle between themselves their rights over the rental payments, and that it be discharged from all its liabilities therefrom. In the meantime, BDO also prayed that it be allowed to consign to the RTC-57 the total amounts of the checks until Primark and CBC-TAMG have determined which between them is the rightful recipient of the rental payments.[28]","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] filed by the petitioner Philippine Primark Properties, Inc. (Primark) assailing the Decision[2] dated April 12, 2022, and Resolution[3] dated October 13, 2022, of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 116479. The CA reversed and set aside the Order[4] dated November 16, 2020, of Branch 57, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Makati City (RTC-57) in Civil Case No. R-MKT-20-01679-SC which: (1) dismissed the Complaint for Interpleader filed by BDO Unibank, Inc. (BDO) against Primark and respondent China Banking Corporation Trust and Assets Management Group (CBC-TAMG); and (2) dismissed CBC-TAMG's cross-claims against Primark and the parties' respective counterclaims.[5]","The Court grants the Petition.

Preliminarily, CBC-TAMG points out that the Petition must be dismissed outright for being non-compliant with Rule 45, Section 4(d) of the Rules of Court. The said provision states:

SECTION 4. Contents of petition. — The petition shall be filed in eighteen (18) copies, with the original copy intended for the court being indicated as such by the petitioner and shall (a) state the full name of the appealing party as the petitioner and the adverse party as respondent, without impleading the lower courts or judges thereof either as petitioners or respondents; (b) indicate the material dates showing when notice of the judgment or final order or resolution subject thereof was received, when a motion for new trial or reconsideration, if any, was filed and when notice of the denial thereof was received; (c) set forth concisely a statement of the matters involved, and the reasons or arguments relied on for the allowance of the petition; (d) be accompanied by a clearly legible duplicate original, or a certified true copy of the judgment or final order or resolution certified by the clerk of court of the court a quo and the requisite number of plain copies thereof, and such material portions of the record as would support the petition; and (e) contain a sworn certification against forum shopping as provided in the last paragraph of section 2, Rule 42. (Emphasis supplied)

In compliance with the Resolution of the Court dated January 11, 2023, Primark submitted certified true copies of the assailed CA Decision and Resolution.[57] Likewise, in its Petition, Primark attached copies of its Motion for Reconsideration filed before the CA and BDO's Motion To Withdraw Complaint filed before the RTC-57. The Court finds these attachments as substantial compliance with Rule 45, Section 4(d) of the Rules of Court that would support the arguments in the Petition.

At any rate, in Cancio v. Performance Foreign Exchange Corp.,[58] the Court held that failure to attach material portions of the record will not necessarily cause the outright dismissal of a petition for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court:

The failure to attach material portions of the record will not necessarily cause the outright dismissal of the petition. While Rule 45, Section 4 of the Rules of Court requires that the petition ""be accompanied by ... such material portions of the record as would support the petition,"" this Court may still give due course if there is substantial compliance with the Rules.[59]

Considering as well that CBC-TAMG, in its Comment to the Petition, also attached copies of the relevant portions of the record, it will serve the higher interest of justice that the case be decided on the merits rather than be dismissed on mere technicality.","WHEREFORE, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is GRANTED. The Decision dated April 12, 2022, and Resolution dated October 13, 2022, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 116479 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The counterclaim and cross-claim of China Banking Corporation-Trust and Asset Management Group in Civil Case No. R-MKT-20-01679-SC are DISMISSED for lack of capacity to sue."
"A.C. No. 11001 (Formerly CBD Case No. 21-6449), August 19, 2024","GRAND PILLAR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT, INC., REPRESENTED BY ITS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, JOSEPHINE F. CHUA, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. NINI D. CRUZ, RESPONDENT.","Sometime in 2008, a complaint for consignation, specific performance, and damages was filed before Branch 74, Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Olongapo City, docketed as Civil Case No. 119-0-2008. The plaintiff in the said case, Josephine Lim (Lim), was represented by Atty. Cruz. Meanwhile, Grand Pillar was one of the defendants.

Upon appeal to the Court of Appeals (CA), the parties eventually executed a compromise agreement. Ensuingly, the CA rendered a Decision (Based on Compromise Agreement),[2] approving and adopting the Compromise Agreement, and declaring the case closed and terminated. Accordingly, an Entry of Judgment[3] was issued.

Among the salient provisions of the Compromise Agreement is that, upon its approval, Lim shall turn over the official receipts evidencing the full amount consigned in the RTC — totaling PHP 8,037,523.00 — to Grand Pillar and authorize the latter to withdraw the said amount. Grand Pillar, on the other hand, shall convey to Lim 10 deeds of conveyance covering the 10 properties which are the subject matter of Civil Case No. 119-0-2008.[4]

Thereupon, Grand Pillar successfully obtained PHP 6,042,753.50, representing the amount actually consigned by Lim to the RTC. In turn, Grand Pillar released four deeds of conveyance representing four properties out of the 10 properties. Thus, there remained a balance of PHP 1,994,769.50, which Lim had to pay Grand Pillar.

For Lim's failure to pay her outstanding obligation despite repeated demands, Grand Pillar was constrained to file a Motion for Execution[5] to implement the provisions of the Compromise Agreement, particularly the payment of the remaining balance Grand Pillar undertook to release the six remaining deeds of conveyance representing six properties, upon receipt of the balance of PHP 1,994,769.50.

In its Order[6] dated June 2, 2014, the RTC merely noted the Motion for Execution filed by Grand Pillar, since a writ of execution was already issued on September 5, 2013. The RTC, nonetheless, directed Lim to pay the remaining balance of PHP 1,994,769.50, and Grand Pillar to release the six deeds of conveyance covering the subject properties.

As it happened, at around 3:00 p.m. of September 11, 2015, a meeting ensued among Grand Pillar's CEO, Josephine F. Chua (CEO Chua); Grand Pillar's counsel, Atty. Ericson Chang Aguila (Atty. Aguila), Atty. Cruz, and Sheriff Cristopher T. Perez (Sheriff Perez), at the RTC's staff room. During the meeting, Atty. Cruz, representing herself as counsel of Lim, tendered to Sheriff Perez Union Bank of the Philippines Manager's Check No. 0000300714 dated September 8, 2014 with a face value of PHP2,000,000.00 and payable to the order of the RTC of Olongapo City, in full settlement of Lim's outstanding obligation PHP1,994,769.50 to Grand Pillar.[7]

When Atty. Aguila asked Atty. Cruz why her client, Lim, issued the manager's check payable to the order of the RTC of Olongapo City, Atty. Cruz replied that it was the way her client wanted the check to be issued.[8]

Considering that the manager's check was issued to the order of the RTC of Olongapo City, Sheriff Perez delivered the same to the concerned RTC for safekeeping. The check was eventually deposited to the RTC's Fiduciary Trust Fund.[9]

Grand Pillar, through its counsel, immediately filed with the RTC an Urgent Motion for Release of Payment[10] praying that an order be issued authorizing Grand Pillar to withdraw the amount of PHP 2 million representing the value of the subject manager's check. Thus, on September 15, 2014, the RTC issued an Order[11] directing the Clerk of Court of the RTC of Olongapo City to release the amount of PHP 2 million to the duly-authorized representative of Grand Pillar.

On September 18, 2014, CEO Chua, along with two other employees of Grand Pillar, and Atty. Aguila, met Atty. Cruz and Sheriff Perez at the RTC to personally deliver to Atty. Cruz the remaining six deeds of conveyance. CEO Chua, Atty. Aguila, the two employees of Grand Pillar, and Beth Rubio, the cashier of the RTC of Olongapo City, then proceeded to the Land Bank of the Philippines, Olongapo City Branch located at Rizal Avenue, East Bajac-Bajac, Olongapo City, to obtain the cash value of the consigned manager's check. CEO Chua successfully obtained the cash value of the manager's check, making her believe that this was the end of Grand Pillar's legal dispute with Lim.[12]

However, to CEO Chua's great surprise and dismay, she received a letter from a certain Gracita Domingo-Agaton (Domingo-Agaton), who averred that Grand Pillar used her Union Bank of the Philippines Manager's Check No. 0000300714 dated September 8, 2014 with a face value of PHP 2 million, purportedly to settle Grand Pillar's obligation to a certain Josephine Lim in relation to Civil Case No. 119-0-2008. Claiming that she was the drawer of the manager's check, Domingo-Agaton demanded Grand Pillar to return the said amount to her; otherwise, she would be constrained to institute the necessary legal action against Grand Pillar and Atty. Cruz.[13]

In her letter[14] dated October 9, 2015, CEO Chua, through Atty. Aguila, claimed good faith in receiving the subject manager's check as settlement for the obligation of Lim, who was represented by Atty. Cruz in Civil Case No. 119-0-2008.

Inevitably, Grand Pillar filed the disbarment complaint against Atty. Cruz, asseverating that had it not been for the assurances and representation of Atty. Cruz that the subject manager's check was Lim's payment for her outstanding obligation to Grand Pillar, the latter would not have obtained the amount covered by the check. It further asserted that after entering into a compromise agreement with Lim, Grand Pillar only envisioned to finally end Civil Case No. 119-0-2008. However, with the receipt of Domingo-Agaton's demand letter, its humble aspiration was blown to smithereens with the looming litigation that it stands to face against Domingo-Agaton, to which Grand Pillar has neither contractual nor extra-contractual dealings in the past. In light of Atty. Cruz's manifest deceitful act of tendering in payment a manager's check which belongs to somebody who is not part of Civil Case No. 119-0-2008, and without said drawer's knowledge or conformity, she violated the Lawyer's Oath and must be meted the ultimate penalty of disbarment.[15]

On February 3, 2016, the Court issued a Resolution requiring Atty. Cruz to file her comment on the complaint.[16] Atty. Cruz, however, failed to comply with the Court's directive. This prompted the Court to issue another Resolution,[17] requiring Atty. Cruz to show cause why she should not be disciplinary dealt with or held in contempt for failure to comply with the February 3, 2016 Resolution and reiterating the order to submit the required comment, both within 10 days from notice.

For Atty. Cruz's repeated failure to comply with the Court's directives, the Court issued anew a Resolution on November 20, 2017, imposing upon her the fine of PHP 1,000.00 payable within 10 days from notice or a penalty of imprisonment for five days if such fine is not paid within the prescribed period. Again, Atty. Cruz was required to submit her comment on the instant complaint.[18]

On June 26, 2019, the Court required Atty. Cruz to comply with the February 3, 2016 Resolution by submitting the required comment.[19] Once more, Atty. Cruz failed to heed the Court's directive.[20]

In the Resolution[21] dated November 11, 2020, this Court dispensed with the comment of Atty. Cruz and referred to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines the subject complaint for investigation, report and recommendation. The case was docketed as CBD No. 21-6449 (Admin Case No. 11001) before the Integrated Bar of the Philippines-Commission on Bar Discipline (IBP-CBD).

The mandatory conference of the case was terminated on account of both parties' failure to appear despite the IBP-CBD's directive. As a consequence, they were directed to submit their respective position papers within a non-extendible period of 10 days, with warning that failure to file their position papers shall be deemed a waiver of their right to submit the same.[22]

For her repeated failure to comply with the processes of the IBP-CBD despite due notice, the IBP-CBD considered Atty. Cruz ""as in default"" and to have waived her right to further participate in the proceedings before the Commission.[23]

In the interregnum, in A.C. No. 11023, Domingo-Agaton v. Cruz,[24] the Court meted the ultimate penalty of disbarment upon Atty. Cruz for her dishonest, deceitful and fraudulent conduct. The Court held among other things, that Atty. Cruz defrauded Domingo-Agaton by misappropriating her Union Bank of the Philippines Manager's Check No. 0000300714 and using it as settlement for the obligation of another client in another case. The Court further ruled that in doing so, she likewise deceived the RTC into believing that Domingo-Agaton's manager's check was issued for Civil Case No. 119-0-2008, to which she was not a party.

Afterwards, Commissioner Donna Ann T. Balboa (Commissioner Balboa) the investigating Commissioner of the IBP-CBD, issued her Report and Recommendation,[25] noting that Atty. Cruz had already been disbarred for her malicious and deceitful means of tendering a manager's check owned by another client, Domingo-Agaton, to use as settlement for the obligation of her client, Lim, in Civil Case No. 119-0-2008. The instant case stemmed from Atty. Cruz's act of securing a manager's check from Domingo-Agaton, when she knew for a fact that Civil Case No. 86-0-2013 which involved Domingo-Agaton had already been dismissed. Instead of returning the check to Domingo-Agaton, Atty. Cruz unlawfully and dishonestly used the subject manager's check to settle Lim's obligation in Civil Case No. 119-0-2008, to the damage, prejudice, and injury of both clients. Accordingly, the IBP-CBD recommended that Atty. Cruz be disbarred.[26]

In the Resolution[27] of the IBP Board of Governors, the recommendation of Commissioner Balboa was modified, thus—","Before the Court is an administrative complaint[1] for disbarment filed by Grand Pillar International Development, Inc. (Grand Pillar), represented by its Chief Executive Officer, Josephine F. Chua (Chua), against respondent Atty. Nini D. Cruz (Atty. Cruz) for malpractice and deceit.
The precursor facts are synthesized as follows:","The Court dismisses the instant disbarment complaint on the ground of res judicata.

Res judicata literally means ""a matter adjudged; a thing judicially acted upon or decided; a thing or matter settled by judgment."" It also refers to the rule that a final judgment or decree on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction is conclusive of the rights of the parties or their privies in all later suits on points and matters determined in the former suit. It rests on the principle that parties should not to be permitted to litigate the same issue more than once; that, when a right or fact has been judicially tried and determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, or an opportunity for such trial has been given, the judgment of the court, so long as it remains unreversed, should be conclusive upon the parties and those in privity with them in law or estate.[28]

Res judicata, as an absolute bar to a subsequent action, requires the following: (1) the judgment sought to bar the new action must be final; (2) the decision must have been rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties; (3) the disposition of the case must be a judgment on the merits; and (4) there must be, as between the first and second action, identity of parties, subject matter, and causes of action. When there is no identity of causes of action, but only an identity of issues, res judicata in the concept of conclusiveness of judgment still applies.[29]

To encapsulate, the present disbarment complaint charges Atty. Cruz with malpractice and deceit for misappropriating the manager's check issued by a former client in Domingo-Agaton, in order to settle the obligation of another client to herein complainant Grand Pillar in a different case.

The Court rules and so holds that res judicata in the concept of ""bar by prior judgment"" applies because all of its elements are present in the case at bench.

There is no dispute that this Court, in the case of Domingo-Agaton, had jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties. Likewise, the decision rendered in the said case was one on the merits and had long become final.

Moreover, the parties, subject matter and causes of action in Domingo-Agaton and the instant case are identical.

First, there is, as between Domingo-Agaton and the present case, identity of parties. The principle of res judicata does not require absolute identity of parties, but requires, at the very least, substantial identity of parties. There is substantial identity of parties when there exists a ""community of interest between a party in the first case and a party in the second case even if the latter was not impleaded in the first case.""[30] The respondent in both cases is Atty. Cruz. In the first case, complainant is Domingo-Agaton, who filed a complaint for grave misconduct against Atty. Cruz on the ground that she misappropriated the manager's check issued by the former to use as settlement for the obligation of another client, Lim, in Civil Case No. 119-0-2008, a case where Domingo-Agaton is a not a party. On the other hand, the complainant in the subject case is Grand Pillar, to whom the same manager's check was presented as payment for the outstanding obligation of her client, Lim, in Civil Case No. 119-0-2008. Clearly, there is community of interests between both complainants in the two cases in order to seek redress for Atty. Cruz's deceitful conduct.

Second, it is undisputed that the same Union Bank of the Philippines Manager's Check No. 0000300714 dated September 8, 2014 was the subject matter in the two cases.

Third, the causes of action in both cases are undoubtedly identical in that they seek the disbarment of Atty. Cruz based on the same set of facts and circumstances which occurred in Domingo-Agaton. To reiterate, the Court already acknowledged the same deplorable act committed by Atty. Cruz in the Domingo-Agaton case.[31] In meting upon her the supreme penalty of disbarment, the Court held—

Respondent was dishonest when she concealed from complainant that Civil Case No. 86-0-2013 had already been dismissed by the RTC on July 31, 2014. She even went to the extent of instructing complainant to purchase the subject manager's check purportedly as bond for the consignation of the subject property. Indeed, respondent deceived complainant when she impressed upon the latter the need for such bond, despite the prior dismissal of Civil Case No. 86-0-2013. Consistent with her dishonest acts, respondent got hold of complainant's manager's check through deceitful assurances. Respondent, then, defrauded complainant by misappropriating the latter's manager's check as settlement or the obligation of another client in another case. In doing so, she likewise deceived the RTC into believing that complainants manager's check was issued for Civil Case No. 119-0-2008, to which complainant was not a party.","ACCORDINGLY, the disbarment complaint against respondent Atty. Nini D. Cruz for malpractice and deceit is DISMISSED on the ground of res judicata.

However, for her repeated defiance of the orders of this Court and the Integrated Bar of the Philippines, which is classified as a less serious offense under Canon VI, Section 34 of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability, she is meted out a FINE in the amount of PHP 50,000.00.

Let a copy of this Decision be furnished to the Office of the Bar Confidant to be appended to the personal record of Atty. Nini D. Cruz as a member of the Bar. Likewise, let copies of the same be served on the Integrated Bar of the Philippines and the Office of the Court Administrator."
"G.R. No. 271209, August 19, 2024","PHILIPPINE HEALTH INSURANCE CORPORATION (PHILHEALTH), PHILHEALTH PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, AND PHILHEALTH REGIONAL OFFICE-NATIONAL CAPITAL REGION, THROUGH ITS VICE PRESIDENT, PETITIONERS, VS. DR. JOSE MARI DEL VALLE GALAURAN, RESPONDENT.","On the basis of various anomalous claims for patients, PhilHealth issued Corporate Personnel Order No. 2018-1802[11] dated August 17, 2018, which authorized certain personnel of the Fact-Finding Investigation and Enforcement Department (FFIED) to conduct hospital spot inspection and claims validation through domiciliary visits within Regions IV-A, NCR, and Rizal from October 1 to 31, 2018, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays.[12]

For this purpose, WellMed Dialysis and Laboratory Center Corporation (WellMed) was among the medical centers subjected to a spot inspection and claims validation.[13] According to a report from the FFIED, WellMed filed anomalous claims for patients who were already dead, and still received out-of-pocket payments from dialysis patients or members without issuing the corresponding receipts for their treatments.[14]

FFIED reported that on November 3, 2016, WellMed filed benefit claims for the out-patient hospitalization and dialysis sessions of PhilHealth member and patient, Bebian Morte Albante[15] (Albante), amounting to PHP 49,400.00 for hemodialysis procedures covering several dates in August and September 2016.[16] However, the records establish that Albante died on July 16, 2016, and was already dead when WellMed filed and processed the benefit claims.[17]

It was alleged that Dr. Galauran certified, in behalf of WellMed, that Albante underwent dialysis sessions after July 16, 2016.[18] For this reason, a Complaint-Affidavit[19] was filed against Dr. Galauran and WellMed.[20] Thus, the FFIED charged Dr. Galauran for the following offenses of HCPs under the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations[21] (RIRR) of NHIA: (1) misrepresentation by false or incorrect information under Section 162; and (2) breach of the warranties of accreditation/performance commitment under Sec. 163.[22]

On July 12, 2019, PhilHealth ordered Dr. Galauran to file a Verified Answer.[23]

In compliance, Dr. Galauran filed his Verified Answer[24] dated August 27, 2019, and denied all the accusations against him.[25] Dr. Galauran argued that: (1) he cannot be held administratively liable because Albante was not his patient; (2) he was not a resident physician nor a consultant at WellMed; (3) on the other hand, he worked as an Associate Medical Doctor at Eaglerock Dialysis and Wellness Center, a direct competitor of WellMed; and (4) he had no participation in the alleged fraudulent claims as he did not sign any document for benefit claims to PhilHealth.[26]

Notwithstanding, PhilHealth sent a Letter[27] dated August 7, 2020 (first assailed Order) informing Dr. Galauran that his accreditation was withdrawn effective from date of notice.[28] The first assailed Order stated that after investigation and on the basis of the administrative cases filed before the Arbitration Office, PhilHealth found sufficient grounds to withdraw Dr. Galauran's accreditation.[29] The charges were summarized in the first assailed","This Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] challenges the Decision[2] dated September 13, 2023, and the Resolution[3] dated December 13, 2023, of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 169097.
Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) is a government-owned or controlled corporation (GOCC) created by virtue of Republic Act No. 7875,[4] as amended by Republic Act No. 9241[5] and Republic Act No. 10606,[6] or the National Health Insurance Act (NHIA).[7]

The PhilHealth President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), and the Vice President of the Regional Office of the National Capital Region (NCR) (Vice President) are officers of PhilHealth, whose decisions were assailed by Dr. Jose Mari Del Valle Galauran[8] (Dr. Galauran) before the appellate court.[9]

On the other hand, Dr. Galauran was a PhilHealth-accredited health care professional (HCP),[10] with a specialization in nephrology.","We affirm.

The Court rules that PhilHealth arbitrarily and unlawfully revoked the accreditation of Dr. Galauran, and did not afford him due process. Consequently, the CA did not gravely abuse its discretion in setting aside the assailed Orders of PhilHealth.

Foremost, We establish the legal framework for the accreditation of a HCP, and its withdrawal and/or revocation by the PhilHealth Board.

PhilHealth is mandated by its institutional law, as amended, to determine the requirements, and issue guidelines for the accreditation of health care providers
We held in jurisprudence that the NHIA, as amended, seeks to prioritize and accelerate the provision of health services to all Filipinos, especially that segment of the population who cannot afford healthcare.[73] In so doing, We emphasized the utmost importance of PhilHealth to public health programs.[74]

PhilHealth's institutional law mandates it to administer the National Health Insurance Program (Program).[75] In pursuit of its mandate, PhilHealth is likewise required to determine the requirements and issue guidelines for the accreditation of health care providers.[76]

Under the NHIA, as amended, a health care provider, who may be an HCP, is defined as any doctor of medicine, nurse, midwife, dentist, or other health care professional or practitioner duly licensed to practice in the Philippines and accredited by PhilHealth.[77]

In its RIRR, PhilHealth defined the term ""accreditation"" as a process to verify the qualifications and capabilities of health care providers for the purpose of conferring upon them the privilege of participating in the Program and assuring the quality of their health care services. Thus, Sec. 3 states:

SECTION 3. Definition of Terms. – For the purposes of this Rules, the terms below shall be defined as follows:

a.
. . . .


b.
Accreditation of Health Care Providers – a process whereby the qualifications and capabilities of health care providers are verified in accordance with the guidelines, standards and procedures set by the Corporation for the purpose of conferring upon them the privilege of participating in the Program and assuring that health care services rendered by them are of the desired and expected quality. Accreditation encompasses licensing or certification, or pre-accreditation survey, as applicable, and their participation in the Program.[78] (Emphasis supplied)
For an HCP or any licensed doctor of medicine, nurse, midwife, dentist, or other health care professional or practitioner to be accredited with PhilHealth, he or she must meet the following requirements:

SECTION 61. Accreditation Requirements for Physicians, Dentists, Nurses, Midwives, Pharmacists and Other Licensed Health Care Professionals. – Physicians dentists; nurses, midwives, pharmacists and other licensed health care professionals shall comply with the following requirements to be accredited:

a.
They must be duly licensed to practice in the Philippines by the PRC;
 	 
b.
They must be members of the Program with qualifying premium contributions;
 	 
c.
They must comply with the provisions set forth in the performance commitment for professionals; and
 	 
d.
They must comply with all other requirements that may be determined by the Corporation.
No accreditation fees shall be imposed by the Corporation for health care professionals and shall not require a certificate of good standing or such other analogous certification for them to be accredited.

Findings on ethical issues by disciplinary bodies of accredited professional organizations of the Professional Regulation Commission (PRC) or specialty societies recognized by the Philippine Medical Association (PMA) in the case of medical specialists, shall be considered in assessing the performance of health care professionals. Suspension of membership in such professional organizations shall be given due consideration in assessing the continued accreditation of such professionals.[79]

Based on the above, Sec. 61 mandates HCPs to be licensed by the Professional Regulation Commission, members of the PhilHealth Program, comply with the performance commitment for professionals and other requirements determined by PhilHealth.

Further, the RIRR enumerates the types of accreditation that a health care provider may undergo. This includes initial accreditation, continuous accreditation, re-accreditation, and reinstatement of accreditation.[80]

Among the types of accreditation, We emphasize the definition of continuous accreditation, and maintain that health care providers enjoy uninterrupted participation until such time that their accreditation is withdrawn by PhilHealth.[81] Thus, Sec. 53 provides:","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED. The Decision dated September 13, 2023, and the Resolution dated December 13, 2023, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 169097 are AFFIRMED."
"G.R. No. 185110, August 19, 2024","PREMIERE DEVELOPMENT BANK,• PETITIONER, VS. SPOUSES ENGRACIO T. CASTAÑEDA•• AND LOURDES E. CASTAÑEDA,••• RESPONDENTS.","The facts are not disputed.

The respondents, Spouses Engracio T. Castañeda (Engracio) and Lourdes E. Castañeda (Lourdes) (collectively, Spouses Castañeda), had an outstanding loan obligation with PDB in the amount of PHP 2.6 million under Promissory Note No. (PN) 717-X[6] (Subject Loan). The maturity date of the Subject Loan was on September 10, 2000. As collateral, Engracio assigned and pledged to PDB a proprietary share in Manila Polo Club (MPC) identified as Proprietary Membership Certificate No. 170 (MPC Certificate No. 170) which was registered under the name of his brother, Constancio T. Castañeda, Jr.[7] (Constancio).

Engracio and Constancio were officers of two corporations. Engracio was the president of Casent Realty and Development Corporation (Casent Realty) and vice-president of Central Surety and Insurance Company, Inc., (Central Surety). Constancio was the president of Central Surety.

These corporations had separate loans with PDB. Casent Realty had a loan of PHP 40 million under PN 235-Z[8] while Central Surety had two loans of PHP 40,898,000 under PN 376-X[9] and PHP 6 million under PN 714-Y.[10] These loans were also secured by separate pledge and real estate mortgage contracts (REM).[11]

Prior to the maturity of the Subject Loan, the parties started renegotiating for its renewal. However, the parties could not agree on the amount of partial payment that Spouses Castañeda should pay on the principal amount;[12] thus, the Subject Loan became due on September 10, 2000. On September 20, 2000, Spouses Castañeda delivered to PDB a Bank of Commerce (BC) check[13] worth PHP 2.6 million in payment of the Subject Loan.

Meanwhile, Central Surety's loan of PHP 6 million under PN 714-Y had become due on August 14, 2000. PDB sent Central Surety a demand letter for payment of the same. Thus, on September 20, 2000, Central Surety also sent to PDB a BC check worth PHP 6 million in full payment of its loan under PN 714-Y.

Initially, PDB refused to accept the check payment of Spouses Castañeda for their personal loan and returned the same to them. On September 29, 2000, Spouses Castañeda, through counsel, sent a letter[14] to PDB, tendering the check with warning that PDB's continued refusal to accept the same would result in consignation of the check with the court.

In a letter[15] dated October 13, 2000, PDB replied to Spouses Castañeda's counsel saying that it could not accept the check as full payment of the Subject Loan as it was insufficient and instead made an application of payments. The letter stated:","This is a case of first impression on the issue of application of payment involving a person who is both a principal debtor of a personal loan and a surety of corporate loans of the same creditor.
Before the Court is a petition for review on certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the Court of Appeals (CA) Decision[2] dated June 25, 2008 in CA-G.R. CV No. 84578, which affirmed with modification the Decision[3] dated January 31, 2005 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 149, Makati City (RTC) in Civil Case No. 01-029, and Resolution[4] promulgated on October 20, 2008 which denied petitioner Premiere Development Bank's (PDB) Motion for Reconsideration[5] dated July 14, 2008 (MR).","He who has various debts of the same kind in favor of one and the same creditor, may declare at the time of making the payment, to which of them the same must be applied. Unless the parties so stipulate, or when the application of payment is made by the party for whose benefit the term has been constituted, application shall not be made as to debts which are not yet due.

If the debtor accepts from the creditor a receipt in which an application of the payment is made, the former cannot complain of the same, unless there is a cause for invalidating the contract. (1172a)

However, the Court finds that Article 1252 does not apply in this case since the PNs executed in favor of PDB have different debtors.

In Magdalena Estates, Inc. v. Rodriquez,[32] the Court held that the rules contained in Article 1252 of the Civil Code apply to a person owing several debts of the same kind to a single creditor.[33] In order for the provision to apply, there must be a single debtor with several debts due to a single creditor.[34]

Here, PDB would want to treat Spouses Castañeda, Central Surety, and Casent Realty as one person as regards their separate loans. In fact, not only did PDB apply the PHP 2.6 million check payment of Spouses Castañeda to the corporate loans of Central Surety and Casent Realty; PDB co-mingled the payments for the PHP 2.6 million personal debt and PHP 6 million corporate debt and distributed the total PHP 8.6 million payment among the four separate debts. In effect, an aliquot portion of Central Surety's payment of PHP 6 million was also applied to Spouses Castañeda's personal loan of PHP 2.6 million. However, this cannot be done because the terms of the PNs clearly indicate whether the debts are personal to Spouses Castañeda or are owed by the corporations. In this regard, it should be added that, contrary to what PDB has asserted, the PNs do not show that Engracio had bound himself solidarily as co-borrower and obligor of the corporations' loans.

As correctly held by the CA, the obligations of the corporations Casent Realty and Central Surety are not the obligations of Spouses Castañeda. It is indeed a basic doctrine in corporation law that corporations have separate and distinct personality from their officers and stockholders. Thus, the payment made by Spouses Castañeda for their personal loan cannot be applied to the corporate loans of Central Surety and Casent Realty. This also applies in the reverse situation to the loan obligations of Central Surety and Casent Realty in that the payment of their corporate loans cannot be applied to the personal debts of Spouses Castañeda.

Simply put, there could be no valid application of payment in this case as Casent Realty and Central Surety have separate and distinct personalities from Engracio and the Spouses Castañeda; hence, each cannot be held liable for the other's obligations.

As previously held in the case of Francisco v. Mallen, Jr.,[35] citing Santos v. NLRC:[36]

""A corporation is a juridical entity with legal personality separate and distinct from those acting for and in its behalf and, in general, from the people comprising it. The rule is that obligations incurred by the corporation, acting through its directors, officers and employees, are its sole liabilities.""[37]

It is settled that a corporation is clothed with a personality separate and distinct from that of the persons composing it. It may not generally be held liable for the personal indebtedness of its stockholders or those of the entities connected with it. Conversely, an officer or stockholder cannot be made to answer for corporate obligations even if he or she should be its president.[38]

Furthermore, even if the Court were to understand PDB's position as an attempt to pierce the veil of corporate fiction, this position is still unwarranted.

For reasons of public policy and in the interest of justice, the corporate veil will justifiably be impaired only when it was used as a shield for fraud, illegality or inequity committed against third persons.[39] Here, there was no showing of any fraud or illegality of any kind. There was no inequity as PDB could have simply applied the PHP 6 million to the corporate loans of Central Surety and accepted the PHP 2.6 million of Spouses Castañeda as full payment for their separate personal loan.

On the other hand, with respect to the waiver executed by Spouses Castañeda in the Subject Loan, the Court finds that PDB's invocation of the same to be misplaced.

At the outset, the Court clarifies that the exception in Article 1252 of the New Civil Code, specifically, the phrase, ""[u]nless the parties so stipulate,"" refers to the application of payments to debts which are not yet due. It does not refer to the debtor's right to specify to which debt should his or her payment be applied, which PDB herein invokes to justify its application of the stipulation on the promissory note.

Nonetheless, the Court recognizes the right of the parties to contract and to agree to stipulations in relation to the application of payment. Thus, contrary to PDB's allegations, the waiver is not rendered inutile and a useless decorative provision on the promissory note as it is considered a contract between the parties.

At any rate, the waiver cannot be applied to the Subject Loan. To recall, the waiver provision states:

In case, I/We have several obligations with the Bank, I/We hereby empower the Bank to apply without [notice] and in any manner it sees fit, any or all of my/our deposits and payments to any of my/our obligations whether due or not. Any such application of deposits or payments shall be conclusive and binding upon me/us.[40] (Emphasis supplied)

Clearly, the obligations being referred to in said proviso refers to the obligations of the borrower and of no one else. It refers to several obligations of the same borrower. As such, payments can be validly applied only to obligations of the same debtor but not to obligations of other persons or entities. Consequently, the waiver does not apply to obligations that properly are for the account of the corporations and not for Spouses Castañeda. Stated simply, this provision only authorizes application of payment if Spouses Castañeda had other outstanding obligations with PDB obtained in their personal capacity.

Even assuming that it may validly invoke the provisions of the waiver, PDB is mandated to exercise its rights under the same in good faith.
Even assuming arguendo that the waiver executed by Spouses Castañeda is applicable to the corporate loans or to any other obligation of either Engracio or Lourdes with PDB in whatever capacity, PDB is still bound to act in good faith in applying the payments of Spouses Castañeda.

Article 1159 of the New Civil Code provides that: ""[o]bligations arising from contracts have the force of law between the contracting parties and should be complied with in good faith."" Article 1315 of the New Civil Code is likewise clear:

Contracts are perfected by mere consent, and from that moment the parties are bound not only to the fulfillment of what has been expressly stipulated but also to all the consequences which, according to their nature, may be in keeping with good faith, usage and law. (1258)

Thus, the application of the provisions of the waiver, as mandated by these articles, should be in keeping with not only the law, but also good faith. PDB should not apply the waiver in a way that would prejudice the rights of Spouses Castañeda; otherwise, the exercise of PDB's right under the waiver would be tantamount to bad faith.

Corollary thereto, while PDB may exercise its right to apply payment to the other obligations of Spouses Castañeda, the same must be done in good faith and only if it would not disadvantage Spouses Castañeda, especially if the debtor has multiple loans with the bank and not all of these loans are due and demandable as of the time of payment.

To illustrate, at the time of Spouses Castañeda's payment on September 20, 2000, Central Surety's loan of PHP 40,898,000.00, covered by PN 376-X was not yet due for another year or until October 10, 2001. Casent Realty's loan of PHP 40 million covered by PN 235-Z was not due until December 28, 2009 or a total of nine years. On the other hand, the personal loan of PHP 2.6 million, covered by the Subject Loan, was already due and demandable.

""Keeping in good faith"" therefore required PDB to apply the payment of Spouses Castañeda to the Subject Loan to result in its full satisfaction, instead of distributing it to other loans that are not yet due and demandable. ""Keeping in good faith"" would also be PDB applying the payment of Spouses Castañeda to the Subject Loan to result in its full satisfaction and applying any excess of the payment to their other obligations.

And the contrary—that is, insisting on applying the payment to loans that are not yet due and demandable, while allowing the Subject Loan to remain delinquent and continue to accumulate interest and other charges, even if the payment is sufficient to fully satisfy the latter—is NOT ""keeping in good faith.""

To rule otherwise would create the absurd and unfair situation where Spouses Castañeda's PHP 2.6 million loan would remain delinquent until all the debts of the Central Surety and Casent Realty would be fully paid. In effect, the personal loan of Spouses Castañeda would be held hostage until such time that the corporate loans of Central Surety and Casent Realty would be extinguished as PDB would have full discretion to apply Spouses Castañeda's loan payments to the corporate loans rather than to their personal loan. Interest payments and charges for the PHP 2.6 million personal loan would continue to accumulate, to the disadvantage and prejudice of Spouses Castañeda. Effectively, the period of Spouses Castenada's loan, which was already due and payable on September 10, 2000, would be extended until the extinguishment of Casent Realty's loan, which had the longest period. The Court cannot countenance such an inequitable situation.","ACCORDINGLY, in view of the foregoing, the Petition is DENIED for lack of merit.

LAZADA E-SERVICES PHIL., INC./ALLAN DAVID ANCHETA, RESPONDENTS.","In April 2016, Lazada hired petitioners as motorcycle riders under similarly worded Independent Contractor Agreements (Agreement), which provided that no employer-employee relationship would exist between them and that the Agreement shall be effective only for a term of one year.[6]

On the one hand, the Agreements of Rogelio, Rey, Jeremiah, and Michael, expired on April 1, 2017, while that of Julius lapsed on April 6, 2017. On the other hand, June's Agreement was discontinued a few days before the end of its one-year term. Likewise, Romeo's Agreement prematurely ended due to his alleged act of reproducing and using independent contractor identification cards in violation of Clause 6 of the Agreement.[7]

Aggrieved by the termination of their contracts, petitioners filed on November 6, 2017, a Complaint[8] for illegal dismissal, money claims, damages, and attorney's fees, against Lazada before the LA docketed as NLRC NCR Case No. 11-16366-17. They asserted that they were regular employees of Lazada, not independent contractors. As such, Lazada unjustly dismissed them without just cause and due process of law; thus, they are entitled to reinstatement and backwages.[9]

For its part, Lazada averred that the terms of its respective Agreements with petitioners negated the existence of an employer-employee relationship. It explained that the Agreements were in the nature of contracts for services governed by the Civil Code of the Philippines. Hence, the regular courts, not the labor tribunals, have jurisdiction over the case.[10]","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assailing the Decision[2] dated March 25, 2021, and the Resolution[3] dated July 30, 2021, of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R.

Serna,[25] citing Montoya v. Transmed,[26] the Court explained the parameters in reviewing a Rule 45 petition involving a labor case, viz.:

As a rule, only questions of law may be raised in a Rule 45 petition. In one case, we discussed the particular parameters of a Rule 45 appeal from the CA's Rule 65 decision on a labor case, as follows:

In a Rule 45 review, we consider the correctness of the assailed CA decision, in contrast with the review for jurisdictional error that we undertake under Rule 65. Furthermore, Rule 45 limits us to the review of questions of law raised against the assailed CA decision. In ruling for legal correctness, we have to view the CA decision in the same context that the petition for certiorari it ruled upon was presented to it; we have to examine the CA decision from the prism of whether it correctly determined the presence or absence of grave abuse of discretion in the NLRC decision before it, not on the basis of whether the NLRC decision on the merits of the case was correct. In other words, we have to be keenly aware that the CA undertook a Rule 65 review, not a review on appeal, of the NLRC decision challenged before it.[27]

The issues of whether: (1) petitioners were independent contractors; (2) their tasks as riders were necessary or desirable in the usual trade or business of Lazada; (3) petitioners were able to satisfy the four-fold test of employment; and (4) they were economically dependent on their work as riders of Lazada, are questions of fact which the Court may not generally dwell on in a Rule 45 petition. Nonetheless, the Court may reevaluate the sufficiency of evidence adduced before the labor tribunals when the judgment of the CA is premised on a misapprehension of facts,[28] such as at bar.

A review of the instant Petition shows that the findings of the labor tribunals and the CA were premised on a misapprehension of facts and are contradicted by the evidence on record and applicable case law. Thus, the Court proceeds to resolve the issues at hand and reexamine the findings of the tribunals a quo.

Regardless of the nomenclature which the parties assign to their agreement, employment contracts are prescribed by law as they are imbued with public interest.[29] Article 1700 of the Civil Code provides:

ARTICLE 1700. The relations between capital and labor are not merely contractual. They are so impressed with public interest that labor contracts must yield to the common good. Therefore, such contracts are subject to the special laws on labor unions, collective bargaining, strikes and lockouts, closed shop, wages, working conditions, hours of labor and similar subjects.

The Court held in Ditiangkin v. Lazada E-Services Philippines, Inc.:[30]

The applicable provisions of the law are deemed incorporated into the contract and the parties cannot exempt themselves from the coverage of labor laws simply by entering into contracts. Thus, regardless of the nomenclature and stipulations of the contract, the employment contract must be read consistent with the social policy of providing protection to labor.[31] (Citations omitted)

Article 295 of the Labor Code provides for the classifications of employment:

ARTICLE 295 [280]. Regular and Casual Employment. — The provisions of written agreement to the contrary notwithstanding and regardless of the oral agreement of the parties, an employment shall be deemed to be regular where the employee has been engaged to perform activities which are usually necessary or desirable in the usual business or trade of the employer, except where the employment has been fixed for a specific project or undertaking the completion or termination of which has been determined at the time of the engagement of the employee or where the work or service to be performed is seasonal in nature and the employment is for the duration of the season.

An employment shall be deemed to be casual if it is not covered by the preceding paragraph: Provided, That any employee who has rendered at least one year of service, whether such service is continuous or broken, shall be considered a regular employee with respect to the activity in which he is employed and his employment shall continue while such activity exists.

Employees who perform activities which are necessary or desirable in the usual business of the employer may be regular, project, or seasonal employees.[32] The case of Ditiangkin is instructive on the matter:

Of the three, project and seasonal employees are generally engaged to perform tasks which only lasts for a specific period and duration. Meanwhile, casual employees are those who perform work which are not usually necessary or desirable for the employer's business.

Activities which are considered usually necessary or desirable in the employer's business generally depends on the industry. There must be a reasonable connection between the work performed by the employee and the usual trade or business of the employer.[33] (Citations omitted)

To determine whether an employer-employee relationship exists, the Court applies the two-tiered test: the four-fold test and the economic dependence test. Under the four-fold test, the following factors must be established: (a) the employer's selection and engagement of the employee; (b) the payment of wages; (c) the power to dismiss; and (d) the power to control the employee's conduct, which extends over the means and methods by which the employee must accomplish the work. The power of control is the most essential factor in the four-fold test and it need not be actually exercised by the employer. It suffices that the employer has the right to wield the power. ""However, not all rules imposed upon a worker indicates the exercise of control by the employer. When rules are intended to serve as general guidelines to accomplish the work, it is not an indicator of control.""[34] Thus, ""[w]hen the control test is insufficient, the economic realities of the employment are considered to get a comprehensive assessment of the true classification of the worker.""[35]

In the case of Francisco v. National Labor Relations Commission,[36] the Court explained the essence of the economic dependence test:

The proper standard of economic dependence is whether the worker is dependent on the alleged employer for his continued employment in that line of business. In the United States, the touchstone of economic reality in analyzing possible employment relationships for purposes of the Federal Labor Standards Act is dependency. By analogy, the benchmark of economic reality in analyzing possible employment relationships for purposes of the Labor Code ought to be the economic dependence of the worker on his employer.[37]

Lazada avers that as petitioners were independent contractors, the four-fold test and the economic dependence test do not apply in the case at bar.

An independent contractor is ""one who carries on a distinct and independent business and undertakes to perform the job . . . on its own account and under one's own responsibility . . . free from the control and direction of the principal in all matters connected with the performance of the work except as to the results thereof.""[38]

Moreover, independent contractors are individuals who possess unique skills and talents which distinguish them from ordinary employees and whose means and methods of work are free from the control of the principal. ""Examples can include a columnist who was hired because of her talent, skill, experience, and feminist standpoint, a basketball referee who has special skills and independent judgment, and a masiador or sentenciador who had expertise in cockfight gambling.""[39]

Moreover, no employer-employee relationship exists between the independent contractor and the principal, and their agreement is governed by the Civil Code. When the status of their relationship is questioned, the employer or principal bears the burden to prove that the worker is an independent contractor rather than an employee.[40]","WHEREFORE, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is GRANTED.

FERNANDEZ, RESPONDENT.","In her Complaint for unlawful detainer[4] against Enrique, Dulce, through her attorneys-in-fact, her other children Roberto C. Fernandez (Roberto), Jaime C. Fernandez (Jaime), and Ma. Elena C. Fernandez (Ma. Elena) essentially alleged that the subject property is located at 1381 Palm Avenue, Dasmariñas Village, Makati City and covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. (TCT No.) 217361. She and her late husband Jose B. Fernandez (Jose) used to own the property, albeit during his lifetime, Jose executed a Deed of Absolute Sale[5] dated May 28, 1993, conveying his 50% share to his children Enrique, Roberto, Jaime, and Ma. Elena.[6]

After the death of Jose in 1994, Enrique sought Dulce's permission to stay in the property together with his family[7] and for her to assist him in raising them. She acceded.[8]

On October 14, 1999, the siblings[9] executed a Contract of Usufruct[10] in Dulce's favor, viz.:","This Petition for Review on Certiorari assails the following dispositions of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 169784:
1.
Decision[1] dated September 15, 2022 reversing the grant of the complaint for unlawful detainer filed by petitioner Ma. Dulce C. Fernandez (Dulce), through her attorneys-in-fact,[2] against one of her children, herein respondent Enrique C. Fernandez (Enrique); and


2.
Resolution[3] dated March 3, 2023 denying Dulce's Motion for Reconsideration.","We reverse.

Unlawful detainer is an action to recover possession of real property from one who unlawfully withholds its possession after the termination of his or her right of possession under any contract, express or implied. The defendant's possession in unlawful detainer was originally legal but became illegal due to termination of the right to possess.[107] This action may be filed by one who is not an owner of the property in dispute.[108]

A complaint sufficiently alleges a cause of action for unlawful detainer if it indicates the following:

1. initially, possession of property by the defendant was by contract with or by tolerance of the plaintiff;

2. eventually, such possession became illegal upon notice by the plaintiff to the defendant of the termination of the right of possession;

3. thereafter, the defendant remained in possession of the property and deprived the plaintiff of the enjoyment thereof and

4. within one year from the last demand on the defendant to vacate the property, the plaintiff instituted the complaint for ejectment.[109]

These jurisdictional facts must be alleged in the complaint itself for unlawful detainer. Failure to do so divests the first level court of jurisdiction over the case.[110]

Here, the complaint sufficiently alleged the essential requisites for unlawful detainer, viz.:

. . . .
 	 
2.3
After the death of Jose B. Fernandez in 1994, Enrique sought the permission of Ma. Dulce to allow him and his children, Erika, Amanda, and Enriquito, to stay in the Dasmariñas Village property and asked for her help in the raising of his children. Consequently, Ma. Dulce allowed them to sojourn with her in the said property.
 	 
2.4
Subsequently, the siblings Enrique, Roberto, Jaime and[,] Ma. Elena have agreed to grant their mother, Ma. Dulce the lifetime benefit, unlimited use and access, and exclusive control and possession of the Dasmariñas Village property by virtue of a Contract of Usufruct dated 14 October 1999.
 	 
2.5
With the execution of the Contract of Usufruct, all the rights, save for disposition, were transferred to Ma. Dulce.
 	 
2.6
On 18 September 2000, the fifty percent (50%) share of Ma. Dulce was transferred equally to the siblings Enrique, Roberto, Jaime[,] and Ma. Elena by virtue of a Deed of Absolute Sale dated 18 September 2000, making each sibling's share equal to twenty five percent (25%) of the property in issue.
 	 
2.7
To supplement and further bolster the usufructuary rights of Ma. Dulce[,] the parties herein executed a Memorandum of Agreement dated 18 December 2000, where it was agreed that plaintiff shall have the full control and possession of the Dasmariñas Village property during her lifetime.
 	 
2.8
Despite the transfer of the rights over the beneficial use of the Dasmariñas Village property, including the exclusive right to possess the property, plaintiff Ma. Dulce tolerated defendant's continued stay therein.
 
. . . .
 	 
2.24
Thus, on 12 April 2018, Ma. Dulce executed an irrevocable special power of attorney in favor of Roberto, Jaime[,] and Ma. Elena for the general administration of the Dasmariñas Village property, including the power and authority to file appropriate cases to protect her interest and usufructuary rights.
 
. . . .
 	 
2.26
Concomitant thereto, the said attorneys-in-fact through counsel, wrote a Demand Letter dated 21 May 201812 to defendant enforcing Ma. Dulce's usufructuary rights and requesting him to vacate the Dasmariñas Village property so that their mother can peacefully possess the same.
 	 
2.27
Additionally, Ma. Dulce wrote a letter to all her children, including herein defendant. In the said letter, she categorically declared that she wishes to be the sole resident and occupant of the Dasmariñas Village property, and that defendant and his family should immediately leave and establish their own home elsewhere.


2.28
However, despite receipt and knowledge of the demand letter and Ma. Dulce's letter, defendant refused and continues to refuse to vacate the aforesaid property.[111]
Preliminarily, it is undisputed that the siblings Enrique, Jaime, Roberto, and Ma. Elena (Dulce's children) are the co-owners of the subject property by virtue of: one, the Deed of Absolute Sale dated May 28, 1993 where Jose transferred his 50% share in the subject property to the siblings; and two, the Deed of Absolute Sale dated September 18, 2000 whereby Dulce herself transferred her own 50% share in the subject property to the siblings—making each sibling's share equal to 25% of the property. The complaint thus alleged:

2.2 In 1993, the fifty percent (50%) share of Jose B. Fernandez was transferred equally to the siblings Enrique C. Fernandez, Roberto C. Fernandez (Robert), Jaime C. Fernandez (Jaime) and Ma. Elena C. Fernandez (Ma. Elena) through a Deed of Absolute Sale dated 28 May 1993, with the following proportion:

. . . .

2.6 On 18 September 2000, the fifty percent (50%) share of Ma. Dulce was transferred equally to the siblings Enrique, Roberto, Jaime[,] and Ma. Elena by virtue of a Deed of Absolute Sale dated 18 September 2000, making each sibling's share equal to twenty five percent (25%) of the property in issue.[112]

But as things stand, the co-owners themselves conveyed in favor of their mother (Dulce) full right of possession and use of, as well as access to, the property via the Contract of Usufruct dated October 14, 1999, as supplemented by the Memorandum of Agreement dated December 18, 2000.

Usufruct gives the usufructuary the right to enjoy the property of another with the obligation of preserving its form and substance, unless the title constituting it or the law otherwise provides.[113] As a co-owner, Enrique parted with his right to possess and enjoy the property in favor of Dulce as usufructuary to last during her lifetime. In so doing he only retains the jus disponendi or the power to alienate the same insofar as his undivided share is concerned.[114] As for the memorandum of agreement, the siblings including Enrique himself further authorized Dulce to exercise full control and possession of the property effective and to last during her lifetime.

What then was the effect, if any, of the continuous stay of Enrique and his family on the property to the rights of Dulce as usufructuary thereof? The answer is plain and simple. It did not diminish the rights of Dulce as such and the continuous stay of Enrique and his children on the property was deemed to be by mere tolerance of Dulce. And when Dulce, through her attorneys-in­ fact, demanded for them to vacate the property on May 21, 2018, that tolerance was deemed terminated. From then on, their possession of the property became illegal such that when Dulce filed the complaint for illegal detainer against Enrique on October 22, 2018 well within the one-year period, she did so pursuant to her exclusive right of possession as usufructuary of the property.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is GRANTED.

"G.R. No. 254283, August 19, 2024","ORLANDO RODRIGUEZ AND DARYL RAMA, PETITIONERS, VS. SAN ROQUE METALS, INC. [SRMI], RESPONDENT.","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[2] dated December 19, 2020 filed by Rodriguez and Rama, assailing the Decision[3] and Resolution[4] of the Court of Appeals (CA). The assailed Decision granted the Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 with Prayer for Preliminary Injunction and Temporary Restraining Order filed by SRMI and reversed and set aside the Resolutions[5] of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC). The NLRC had earlier denied the Petition for Extraordinary Remedies[6] filed by SRMI, affirmed the June 30, 2017 Order[7] of Executive Labor Arbiter (ELA) Exequiel M. Dayot III (Dayot), and denied reconsideration.

SRMI filed its Comment on the Petition for Review on Certiorari[8] on October 14, 2021.

Rodriguez and Rama, together with three other complainants, filed a complaint for illegal dismissal against SRMI on March 30, 2011.[9] In a Decision[10] dated January 24, 2012, ELA Henry F. Te dismissed the complaint for illegal dismissal but ordered SRMI to pay Rodriguez, Rama, and Jeffrey Adiong certain sums corresponding to their 13th month pay and service incentive leave.[11]

Rama then executed a Quitclaim and Release with Motion to Dismiss[12] (Quitclaim) dated March 12, 2012. In consideration of the amount of PHP 20,000.00, Rama waived any claim or right of action against SRMI.[13] The other complainants executed similar documents.[14]

On March 27, 2012, SRMI filed a Memorandum of Partial Appeal with the NLRC.[15] Rodriguez and Rama, with the other complainants, also filed a Memorandum of Appeal.[16]

In a Resolution[17] dated December 28, 2012, the NLRC dismissed SRMI's partial appeal and partly granted the appeal of Adiong, Rodriguez, and Rama, declaring them regular employees of SRMI and ordering SRMI to pay them backwages plus allowances and other benefits.[18] This award was without prejudice to the crediting of the sum of PHP 20,000.00 that Rama had received from SRMI pursuant to the Quitclaim, which the NLRC declared invalid.[19] The NLRC denied SRMI's motion for reconsideration in its Resolution[20] dated March 27, 2013.[21]

SRMI filed a petition for certiorari[22] with the CA, seeking the nullification of the NLRC's Resolutions.[23] This petition was docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 05614-MIN.

After SRMI filed its petition for certiorari in CA-G.R. SP No. 05614-MIN, it entered into separate Compromise Agreements with Rodriguez and Rama dated February 3, 2015[24] and April 22, 2015,[25] respectively.[26] These Agreements were also acknowledged by ELA Dayot.[27]

The CA dismissed the petition in its June 24, 2015 Decision.[28] On June 30, 2015, SRMI filed a Manifestation (With Prayer for Dismissal) informing the CA that it had entered into a Compromise Agreement with Rodriguez.[29] On August 20, 2015, SRMI filed a motion for reconsideration, which the CA denied.[30]

On September 9, 2016, SRMI filed a petition for review on certiorari[31] with the Court, arguing, among others, that the CA erred in disregarding the Quitclaim executed by Rama and the Compromise Agreement signed by Rodriguez.[32] This petition was docketed as G.R. No. 226574.

In a Resolution[33] dated October 19, 2016, the Court denied SRMI's petition for review on certiorari for having been filed beyond the reglementary period of 15 days under Rule 45, Section 2, in relation to Rule 56, Section 5(a) of the Rules of Court.[34]

SRMI filed a Manifestation (With Prayer for Dismissal of Claims of Respondents by Reason of Execution of Valid Compromise Agreements)[35] dated February 24, 2017, praying for the dismissal of Rodriguez and Rama's complaints with finality in view of the Compromise Agreements.[36]

SRMI then filed a motion for reconsideration[37] dated March 27, 2017, arguing that its petition for review was filed within the extended period prayed for in its two motions for extension of time to file a petition for review.

In a Resolution[38] dated June 28, 2017, the Court noted and granted SRMI's Manifestation and the withdrawal of appearance of SRMI's previous counsel. The Court also ordered Rodriguez and Rama to comment on SRMI's motion for reconsideration of its October 19, 2016 Resolution.

In compliance with the Court's Resolution, Rodriguez and Rama filed Respondents' Partial Motion for Reconsideration with Comment/Opposition to the Petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration.[39]

SRMI then filed a Comment (To the Respondents' Partial Motion for Reconsideration with Comment/Opposition to the Petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration),[40] again arguing that its liability to Rodriguez and Rama was fully settled with the execution of the Compromise Agreements.[41] In response, Rodriguez and Rama filed a Reply to the Petitioner's Comment.[42]

The Court denied SRMI's motion for reconsideration in its Resolution[43] dated June 3, 2019. It also noted without action SRMI's Manifestation (with Prayer for Dismissal of Claims of Respondents by Reason of Execution of Valid Compromise Agreements) dated February 24, 2017, explaining as follows:

The respondents submit that the amounts received by Rama and Rodriguez served only as partial payments and should not be deemed as full satisfaction for their monetary claims. The Court finds these issues were the subject matter of the Labor Arbiter's order dated June 30, 2017 and the NLRC's resolution dated March 9, 2018. Both the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC deemed the amounts paid under the compromise agreements as advance or partial payments of respondents' total monetary claims.

Considering the foregoing, and given the denial of the instant petition for review on certiorari, no relief can be granted to the petitioner in relation to said compromise agreements.[44] (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)

In the meantime, Rodriguez and Rama, with three other complainants, filed a Motion for the Issuance of Writ of Execution with Prayer for Recomputation of the Judgment Award from the Time the Complainants were Illegally Dismissed from Employment up to the Payment of their Backwages and Separation Pay with the NLRC-RAB XIII, Butuan City.[45] Rodriguez and Rama sought the execution of the NLRC's judgment awards, as affirmed by the CA in CA-G.R. SP No. 05614-MIN.[46]

On June 30, 2017, the NLRC-RAB XIII, through ELA Dayot, issued an Order[47] disposing of Rodriguez and Rama's motion as follows:

WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, respondent SR METALS INC. is hereby ORDERED to pay the complainants their monetary awards as computed, to wit:

1.	JEFFREY ADIONG	
[PHP] 390,214.15
2.	ORLANDO RODRIGUEZ	
235,046.02
3.	DARYL RAMA	
398,786.31
 	 	
[PHP] 1,024,046.48
 	 	
==============
In addition, since complainants are minimum wage earner[s], their monetary awards are not subject to 5% withholding tax pursuant to [Republic Act No.] 9504, BIR Revenue Regulation No. 10-2008 dated July 8, 2008 as restated in NLRC Memorandum Circular No. 90-02, Series of 2013 ([September] 18, 2013).

Accordingly, let a writ of execution be issued for the enforcement and partial satisfaction of [complainants'] backwages, separation pay, and other monetary awards in the amount aforestated.","This controversy should have been long settled with the Court's final and executory ruling in SR Metals, Inc. v. Adiong[1] (docketed as G.R. No. 226574). In that case, the Court expressly stated that no relief could be granted to respondent San Roque Metals, Inc. (SRMI) in relation to certain compromise agreements SRMI had executed with petitioners Orlando Rodriguez (Rodriguez) and Daryl Rama (Rama). Unbeknownst to the Court, however, while G.R. No. 226574 was pending, SRMI also raised the existence of these agreements before the labor tribunals and Court of Appeals during the ongoing execution proceedings, committing willful and deliberate forum shopping that resulted in conflicting rulings and unjustly delayed satisfaction of the judicially approved claims of Rodriguez and Rama. The Court will not countenance such tactics. With this Decision, the Court settles the dispute with finality, leaving only the matter of the forum shopping committed by SRMI and its counsel to be settled.","In this case, this Court fails to see any grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC when it issued the 2012 NLRC Resolution, to justify the reversal or modification of the same. The 2012 NLRC Resolution, which, fortunately, was attached by the Union in its comment to the petition, shows that the NLRC judiciously reviewed all the records and documents presented by the parties, and based its ruling, particularly the amounts yet to be paid by LASURECO, on substantial evidence presented by the parties.[84] (Emphasis supplied; citations omitted)

Here, ELA Dayot stated that Rodriguez and Rama were informed that the amounts they were to receive under the Compromise Agreements were only advance payments, subject to the final disposition of their complaints against SRMI. The ELA held:

Proceeding to the Compromise Settlement dated [March 12, 2012] of complainant-RAMA with the consideration in the amount of [PHP] 20,000.00, this Office finds that the amount shall be treated as partial or an advance payment of his total monetary awards, similarly the amount of [PHP] 30,000.00 received by him in the Compromise Agreement he entered with the respondent on [February 3, 2015], shall also be treated as advance payment. Apparently, complainant-RAMA received a total amount of [PHP] 50,000.00 treated as advance payment.

While that of complainant-RODRIGUEZ, the amount of [PHP] 70,000.00 received by him per Compromise Agreement dated [April 22, 2015] shall likewise be treated as partial payment, as these were made known to the parties during the pre-execution conference that the amount received by the individual complainants shall be without prejudice to the final disposition of the case pending with the Supreme Court.[85] (Emphasis supplied)

It bears emphasis that it was also ELA Dayot who acknowledged the execution of the Compromise Agreements.[86] Accordingly, the ELA's findings as to the true nature of the Compromise Agreements and the parties' intent in signing the Agreements should not be lightly set aside.

In resolving SRMI's Petition for Extraordinary Remedies, the NLRC cited the above findings of the ELA:

As to the compromise agreements, as stated earlier, Executive Labor Arbiter Dayot considered the amount received by the respondents as partial or advance payments of their total monetary awards, as it was made known to the parties during the pre-execution conference that the amounts received by the individual respondents was without prejudice to the final disposition of the case pending with the Supreme Court.[87] (Emphasis supplied)

The NLRC also found that the monetary considerations given to Rodriguez and Rama were unreasonable and declared the Compromise Agreements invalid:

However, the Court has given effect to quitclaims in certain cases, if the employer is able to prove the following requisites: (1) the employee executes a deed of quitclaim voluntarily; (2) there is no fraud or deceit on the part of any of the parties; (3) the consideration of the quitclaim is credible and reasonable; and (4) the contract is not contrary to law, public order, public policy, morals or good customs, or prejudicial to a third person with a right recognized by law.","ACCORDINGLY, the instant Petition is GRANTED. The assailed Decision dated April 30, 2019 and Resolution dated August 25, 2020 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 08711-MIN are REVERSED.

In view of the unjust delay in the resolution of this dispute caused by San Roque Metals, Inc., the case is REMANDED to the Labor Arbiter, who is DIRECTED to RECOMPUTE with dispatch the total monetary awards due to petitioners Orlando Rodriguez and Daryl Rama as provided in the Executive Labor Arbiter's June 30, 2017 Order, incorporating legal interest of 6% per annum from June 30, 2017 until full payment.[98]

San Roque Metals, Inc. and its counsel Atty. Francis U. Ku and Atty. Alyanna R. Chang are directed to SHOW CAUSE, within 10 days from receipt of this Decision, why they should not be held in direct contempt for willful and deliberate forum shopping."
"G.R. No. 263920, August 14, 2024","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. BENJAMIN OLIDAN Y ERLANDEZ, CRISPIN ARANETA Y PELAEZ, LYNFER BICODO Y BAYLON, ROGELIO CALORING,** ANNABELLE OLIDAN Y ARANETA, GODOFREDO NAVANES Y LORENZO,*** PO1 JOSE LONMAR ZAPATOS Y FIEL, AND PO1 ANTONIO CASTILLO Y DOMINGO, AND REY ALADA [AT LARGE], ACCUSED;","The instant case stemmed from an Amended Information[6] charging accused-appellant and his co-accused with Kidnapping for Ransom. The accusatory portion of the Amended Information states:
That on or about August 30, 2005, in xxxxxxxxxxx and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused Crispin Araneta y Pelaez, Annabelle Oledan y Araneta, Benjamin Olidan y Erlandez, Godofredo Navanes y Lorenzo, Lynfer Bicodo y Baylon, Rogelio Caloring, Rey Alada, PO1 Jose Lonmar Zapatos y Fiel, an active member of the Philippine National Police-Special Action Force (PNP-SAF), PO1 Antonio Castillo y Domingo, likewise an active member of the Philippine National Police-Aviation Security Group (PNP-ASG), and a certain alias ""Henry"" conspiring, confederating and mutually helping one another, with the use of firearms, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously kidnapped AAA[7] (11 years old), BBB (11 years old), CCC (9 years old) and Eulalia Cuevas y Madara and thereafter demanded ransom money in exchange for the release of the four kidnapped victims to the damage and prejudice of the victims who were rescued and the parents of the three children.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[8]
On November 9, 2005, accused Araneta, Godofredo Navanes y Lorenzo (Navanes), Bicodo, and Caloring entered their respective pleas of ""Not Guilty"" to the crime charged.[9]

Likewise, on December 1, 2005, accused-appellant and his wife, accused Annabelle, entered their pleas of ""Not Guilty."" Accused PO1 Zapatos and PO1 Castillo similarly entered their pleas of ""Not Guilty"" to the crime charged.[10]

Accused Alada was never arrested and remains at-large up to the present date.

During the pre-trial on March 9, 2006, the defense admitted the identities of all the accused, the territorial jurisdiction of the RTC, and the minority of three of the private complainants, namely: AAA, BBB, and CCC (collectively, the ABC children). The parties also stipulated that AAA and BBB were only 11 years old, and CCC was only 9 years old at the time of the incident.[11]

Accused PO1 Zapatos and PO1 Castillo confirmed that they were active members of the Philippine National Police (PNP) at the time of the incident.[12]

Trial ensued.","Before the Court is an appeal[1] assailing the Decision[2] dated June 7, 2019 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 06209 which affirmed the Decision[3] dated March 26, 2013, of Branch 225, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Quezon City in Criminal Case No. Q-05-136632 that found Benjamin Olidan y Erlandez (accused-appellant) and his co-accused Crispin Araneta y Pelaez (Araneta), Annabelle Olidan[4] y Araneta (Annabelle), Lynfer Bicodo y Baylon (Bicodo), Rogelio Caloring (Caloring), Rey Alada (Alada), Police Officer I (PO1) Jose Lonmar Zapatos y Fiel (PO1 Zapatos), and PO1 Antonio Castillo y Domingo (PO1 Castillo), guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Kidnapping for Ransom defined under Article 267[5] of the Revised Penal Code.","The appeal is unmeritorious.

At the outset, it must be emphasized that the Court gives high respect to the trial court's evaluation of the testimony of a witness because it has the best opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witness to determine if there is indeed truth to his or her testimony in the witness stand.[64] Considering that the trial judge is in the best position to determine the truthfulness of witnesses, the judge's evaluation of the witnesses' testimonies is given the highest respect.[65]

After a judicious scrutiny of the records, the Court finds no reason to deviate from the uniform factual findings of the RTC and the CA as there is no indication that they overlooked, misunderstood, or misapplied the surrounding facts and circumstances regarding the kidnapping incident. It is settled that findings of the RTC which are factual in nature, and which involve the credibility of witnesses are accorded with respect, if not finality, by the appellate court when no glaring errors, gross misapprehension of facts, and speculative, arbitrary, and unsupported conclusions can be gathered from such findings.[66]

However, the Court modifies the following ruling of the CA: (1) that accused-appellant is liable for only one count of Kidnapping for Ransom; and (2) that Spouses ABC are also entitled to damages.

Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, defines, and prescribes the penalty for the crime of Kidnapping for Ransom, thus:
ARTICLE 267. Kidnapping and serious illegal detention. — Any private individual who shall kidnap or detain another, or in any other manner deprive him of his liberty, shall suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua to death:

1. If the kidnapping or detention shall have lasted more than three days.

2. If it shall have been committed simulating public authority.

3. If any serious physical injuries shall have been inflicted upon the person kidnapped or detained, or if threats to kill him shall have been made.

4. If the person kidnapped or detained shall be a minor, except when the accused is any of the parents, female, or a public officer.

The penalty shall be death where the kidnapping or detention was committed for the purpose of extorting ransom from the victim or any other person, even if none of the circumstances above-mentioned were present in the commission of the offense.

When the victim is killed or dies as a consequence of the detention or is raped, or is subjected to torture or dehumanizing acts, the maximum penalty shall be imposed. (Emphasis supplied)
In prosecuting a case of Kidnapping for Ransom, the following elements must be established: (1) the accused was a private person; (2) he or she kidnapped or detained, or in any manner deprived another of his or her liberty; (3) the kidnapping or detention was illegal; and (4) the victim was kidnapped or detained for ransom.[67]

In People v. Jatulan,[68] the Court discussed the definition of ransom as an element of the crime of Kidnapping for Ransom, thus:
[R]ansom means money, price or consideration paid or demanded for the redemption of a captured person that would release him from captivity. No specific form of ransom is required to consummate the felony of kidnapping for ransom as long as the ransom was intended as a bargaining chip in exchange for the victim's freedom. Whether or not the ransom is actually paid to or received by the perpetrator is of no moment.[69]
The essence of illegal detention is the deprivation of the victim's liberty such that the prosecution must prove actual confinement or restriction of the victim, and that such deprivation was the appellant's intention.[70] Also, if the victim is kidnapped and illegally detained to extort ransom, the duration of his detention is immaterial.[71] It is settled that the curtailment of the victim's liberty need not involve any physical restraint upon the latter's person and it is not necessary that the offender kept the victim in an enclosure or treated him harshly.[72]

In the case, the prosecution established beyond reasonable doubt the existence of all elements of Kidnapping for Ransom. Accused­-appellant and his co-accused are private persons. Even if PO1 Zapatos and PO1 Castillo were members of the PNP during the incident, they were acting in their private capacities when they kidnapped the victims.

The ABC children as well as Eulalia, categorically narrated how they were kidnapped and deprived of their liberty from the time the men boarded the Ford Escape until they were transferred to a Nissan Urvan van and eventually ended up in a safe house which was later discovered to be a water refilling station. Moreover, the victims identified all the persons involved in the kidnapping and the caretakers of the safehouse.

The victims' testimonies were consistent with each other and were corroborated by the statements of Raymund and DDD. Raymund, the family driver, testified as to the circumstances where the armed kidnappers flagged down their car and forcibly boarded it. DDD, on the other hand, testified as to the fact that the kidnappers informed her that her children, including their nanny, were with them and immediately demanded ransom money in the amount of PHP 50,000,000.00, in exchange for her children's freedom. The kidnappers threatened her that if she could not give the money within two days, they would kill her children. Later, she informed them that she only managed to come up with PHP 1,015,000.00. The kidnappers got furious and gave her three hours to produce the amount; otherwise, they would send her the heads of her children. Fortunately for the ABC family, the agents of PNP-PACER successfully rescued the victims from the hands of the kidnappers before the three-hour period expired and eventually arrested all the kidnappers except accused Alada.

At this point, the Court discards accused-appellant's argument that there is no evidence regarding his participation in the kidnapping case. Records disclose that the victims identified accused-appellant as one of the caretakers of the safe house. Simply stated, his participation was necessary for the successful execution of the Kidnapping for Ransom.

Moreover, the prosecution was able to establish beyond reasonable doubt the conspiracy between accused-appellant and his co-accused. The Revised Penal Code provides that conspiracy exists when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it.[73]

In People v. Lababo,[74] the Court reiterated the principles in determining whether a conspiracy exists, thus:
There is conspiracy when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it. Conspiracy is not presumed. Like the physical acts constituting the crime itself, the elements of conspiracy must be proven beyond reasonable doubt. While conspiracy need not be established by direct evidence, for it may be inferred from the conduct of the accused before, during and after the commission of the crime, all taken together, however, the evidence must be strong enough to show the community of criminal design. For conspiracy to exist, it is essential that there must be a conscious design to commit an offense. Conspiracy is the product of intentionality on the part of the cohorts.

It is necessary that a conspirator should have performed some overt act as a direct or indirect contribution to the execution of the crime committed. The overt act may consist of active participation in the actual commission of the crime itself, or it may consist of moral assistance to his [co-conspirators] by being present at the commission of the crime or by exerting moral ascendancy over the other [co-conspirators].[75] (Emphasis supplied)
Conspiracy may be proven by evidence of a chain of circumstances. It may be inferred from the acts of the accused before, during, and after the commission of the crime which indubitably points to and is indicative of a joint purpose, concert of action, and community of interest.[76]","WHEREFORE, the appeal is DISMISSED. The Decision dated June 7, 2019, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 06209 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATIONS.

Accused-appellant BENJAMIN OLIDAN y ERLANDEZ is hereby found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of four counts of Kidnapping for Ransom defined and penalized under Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code in Criminal Case No. Q-05-136632 filed before Branch 225, Regional Trial Court, Quezon City. He is hereby SENTENCED to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua, without eligibility for parole, for each count.

He is likewise ORDERED to PAY, solidarily with his co-accused, Crispin Araneta y Pelaez, Annabelle Olidan y Araneta, Lynfer Bicodo y Baylon, and PO1 Jose Lonmar Zapatos y Fiel the amounts of PHP 100,000.00 as civil indemnity, PHP 100,000.00 as moral damages, and PHP 100,000.00 as exemplary damages to EACH of the private complainants, namely: AAA, BBB, CCC, and Eulalia Cuevas y Madara.

The total monetary awards shall bear legal interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of the finality of this Decision until full payment.

The award of damages to Spouses ABC is hereby DELETED."
"G.R. No. 261612, August 14, 2024","ARSENIO MANAGUELOD Y TANDAYU, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","By Information dated May 30, 2019, Managuelod was charged with violation of Batas Pambansa Blg. 6,[4] in relation to Republic Act No. 7166,[5] the Omnibus Election Code, as amended,[6] and COMELEC Resolution No. 10446, viz.:
That on March 18, 2019, in the City of Tuguegarao, Province of Cagayan, and within the [j]urisdiction of this Honorable Court, the accused ARSENIO MANAGUELOD y TANDAYU, without any authority of law, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously possess a knife, a deadly bladed weapon which is not used by him as necessary tool or instrument for legitimate activity or for his livelihood; that the accused entered the vicinity of the Bed Spacers Hometel Inn located at Leonarda, this city by climbing on the concrete fence of the said hotel and then he again climb[ed] on the railings at the upper portion of the hotel and stood on the railings prompting the manager of the hotel to seek for police assistance, and this resulted [in] his arrest by members of the PNP assigned at the Tuguegarao City Police Station; that as a consequence of his lawful arrest, the police officers conducted search on the sling bag of the accused, and the deadly bladed weapon with holster was recovered from his direct possession, control, and custody; that the accused carried the deadly weapon outside his residence at a time covered by the May 2019 election period without any validly issued COMELEC Exemption to carry and possess the same; that the incident resulted [in] the confiscation of the deadly weapon by the authorities of the law.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[7]
On arraignment, Managuelod pleaded ""not guilty"" to the offense charged.[8]

During trial, the prosecution presented the testimonies of Police Officer I Patrocinio Lappay (PO1 Lappay) and Police Staff Sergeant Edwin Pagulayan (PSSg Pagulayan),[9] while the defense presented Managuelod as its lone witness.[10]","This Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assails the following dispositions of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 44810:
1)
Decision[2] dated December 27, 2021 affirming the conviction of petitioner Arsenio Managuelod y Tandayu (Managuelod) for violation of Batas Pambansa Blg. 6, in relation to Republic Act No. 7166, the Omnibus Election Code, as amended, and Commission on Elections Resolution No. 10446 (COMELEC Resolution No. 10446); and


2)
Resolution[3] dated May 24, 2022 denying Managuelod's Motion for Reconsideration.","Foremost, we emphasize that the Court is not a trier of facts. The issue for resolution here – whether Managuelod illegally possessed a deadly weapon during the election period – is ultimately a question of fact. As a rule, only questions of law may be raised in a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45. One exception, however, is when the lower court had ignored, overlooked, or misconstrued relevant facts, which if taken into consideration will change the outcome of the case,[22] as in this case. 
 
Managuelod was properly charged under Republic Act No. 7166, in relation to the Omnibus Election Code, and COMELEC Resolution No. 10446
 

By Information dated May 30, 2019, Managuelod was charged with violation of Batas Pambansa Blg. 6, in relation to Section 32 of Republic Act No. 7166, the Omnibus Election Code, and COMELEC Resolution No. 10446.

Batas Pambansa Blg. 6 is titled ""An Act Reducing the Penalty for Illegal Possession of Bladed, Pointed or Blunt Weapons, and for Other Purposes, Amending for the Purpose Presidential Decree Numbered Nine.""

Section 1 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 6[23] states:
It is unlawful to carry outside of one's residence any bladed, pointed or blunt weapon such as ""knife"", ""spear"", ""pana"", ""dagger"", ""bolo"", ""barong"", ""kris"", or ""chako"", except where such articles are being used as necessary tools or implements to earn a livelihood or in pursuit of a lawful activity. Any person found guilty thereof shall suffer the penalty of imprisonment of not less than one month nor more than one year or a fine of not less than Two Hundred Pesos nor more than Two Thousand Pesos, or both such imprisonment and fine as the Court may direct.
On the other hand, Presidential Decree No. 9, the law amended by Batas Pambansa Blg. 6, was enacted for the purpose of curtailing ""subversion, rebellion, insurrection, lawless violence, criminally, chaos and public disorder"" by reason of Proclamation No. 1081, the law which proclaimed a state of martial law in the Philippines on September 21, 1972.[24] Batas Pambansa Blg. 6, therefore, is no longer applicable since the rationale for its enactment, i.e., curtailment of public disorder during martial law, has already ceased. Cessante ratione legis cessat ipsa lex. When the reason for the law ceases, the law itself ceases.[25]

Too, in People v. Purisima,[26] taking into consideration the intent and spirit of Presidential Decree No. 9, the Court held that such law is limited to acts of carrying a blunt or bladed weapon with a motivation connected with or related to the afore-quoted desired result of Proclamation No. 1081.

The prosecution, thus, erroneously charged Managuelod with a ""dead law.""

This notwithstanding, Managuelod was charged not only with violation of Batas Pambansa Blg. 6, but also of Section 32 of Republic Act No. 7166, in relation to the Omnibus Election Code.

Section 32 of Republic Act No. 7166, which amended Section 261 of the Omnibus Election Code, provides:
Who May Bear Firearms. - During the election period, no person shall bear, carry or transport firearms or other deadly weapons in public places, including any building, street, park, private vehicle or public conveyance, even if licensed to possess or carry the same, unless authorized in writing by the Commission. The issuance of firearms licenses shall be suspended during the election period.

Only regular members or officers of the Philippine National Police, the Armed Forces of the Philippines and other enforcement agencies of the Government who are duly deputized in writing by the Commission for election duty may be authorized to carry and possess firearms during the election period: Provided, That, when in the possession of firearms, the deputized law enforcement officer must be: (a) in full uniform showing clearly and legibly his name, rank and serial number which shall remain visible at all times; and (b) in the actual performance of his election duty in the specific area designated by the Commission. (Emphasis supplied)
Republic Act No. 7166 does not define the term ""other deadly weapons."" To arrive at its proper meaning, we apply the principles of statutory construction. From the plain, ordinary, and common usage of the root phrase ""deadly weapon,"" the common denominator between firearms and other deadly weapons as used in Section 32 is their ability to cause fatal consequences. Elsewhere, the phrase ""deadly weapon"" is understood as:
A deadly weapon is defined as ""any firearm, or other weapon, device, instrument, material or substance, whether animate or inanimate, which in the manner it is used or is intended to be used is known to be capable of producing death or serious bodily injury.[27] (Emphasis supplied)
Bladed instruments have such common denominator and are included in the phrase ""other deadly weapons"" because they are deadly weapons that are other than firearms.

Notably, the Legislature has long considered bladed instruments as deadly weapons. Act No. 1780, enacted as early as October 12, 1907, provides:
Section 26. It shall be unlawful for any person to carry concealed about his person any bowie knife, dirk, dagger, kris, or other deadly weapon: PROVIDED, That this prohibition shall not apply to firearms in the possession of persons who have secured a license therefor or who are entitled to carry [the] same under the provisions of this Act. (Emphasis supplied)
Generally, when a statute is clear, there is no room for interpretation.[28] In this case, however, it is necessary to clarify what constitutes ""other deadly weapons."" Hence, resort to statutes in pari materia is warranted. The Court explained in Yaphockun, et al. v. Professional Regulation Commission, et al.:[29]
Statutes are in pari materia when they relate to the same person or thing or to the same class of persons or things, or object, or cover the same specific or particular subject matter.

It is axiomatic in statutory construction that a statute must be interpreted, not only to be consistent with itself, but also to harmonize with other laws on the same subject matter, as to form a complete, coherent and intelligible system. The rule is expressed in the maxim, ""interpretare et concordare legibus est optimus interpretandi,"" or every statute must be so construed and harmonized with other statutes as to form a uniform system of jurisprudence.[30]
It is thus beyond cavil that bladed instruments, such as the one allegedly found in Managuelod's possession, are included in the term ""other deadly weapons"" within the purview of Section 32 of Republic Act No. 7166.

Too, Managuelod was charged under COMELEC Resolution No. 10446. The COMELEC, through its quasi-legislative powers, issued such resolution to implement Section 261 of the Omnibus Election Code, as amended by Section 32 of Republic Act No. 7166, during the conduct of the 2019 National and Local Elections. It specified therein that the term ""deadly weapon"" includes bladed instruments, to wit:
1. Deadly Weapon includes bladed instruments, hand grenades or other explosives, except pyrotechnics. Provided, that a bladed instrument is not covered by the prohibition when possession of the bladed instrument is necessary to the occupation of the possessor or when it is used as a tool for legitimate activity.[31] (Emphasis supplied)
In sum, despite the prosecution's mistake in charging Managuelod under Batas Pambansa Blg. 6, he was appropriately charged with violation of Section 32 of Republic Act No. 7166, in relation to the Omnibus Election Code, and COMELEC Resolution No. 10446. ","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is GRANTED. The assailed Decision dated December 27, 2021 and Resolution dated May 24, 2022 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 44810 are REVERSED. Petitioner Arsenio Managuelod y Tandayu is ACQUITTED of violation of Batas Pambansa Blg. 6, in relation to Republic Act No. 7166, the Omnibus Election Code, as amended.

Under Peña's subsequent Motion for Reconsideration,[2] he implores the Court to modify his penalty from imprisonment to community service.","The motion is granted.

Under Republic Act No. 11362 also known as the Community Service Act, the court may, in its discretion, and lieu of service in jail, require that the penalties of arresto menor and arresto mayor be served by the defendant by rendering community service in the place where the crime was committed, and under such terms as the court shall determine, taking into consideration the gravity of the offense and the circumstances of the case.

Section 3 of Republic Act No. 11362 provides:

SECTION 3. Community Service. — Article 88a of Act No. 3815 is hereby inserted to read as follows:

ARTICLE 88a. Community Service — The court in its discretion may, in lieu of service in jail, require that the penalties of arresto menor and arresto mayor be served by the defendant by rendering community service in the place where the crime was committed, under such terms as the court shall determine, taking into consideration the gravity of the offense and the circumstances of the case, which shall be under the supervision of a probation officer: Provided, That the court will prepare an order imposing the community service, specifying the number of hours to be worked and the period within which to complete the service. The order is then referred to the assigned probation officer who shall have responsibility of the defendant. x x x

Community service shall consist of any actual physical activity which inculcates civic consciousness, and is intended towards the improvement of a public work or promotion of a public service.

If the defendant violates the terms of the community service, the court shall order his/her re-arrest and the defendant shall serve the full term of the penalty, as the case may be, in jail, or in the house of the defendant as provided under Article 88. However, if the defendant has fully complied with the terms of the community service, the court shall order the release of the defendant unless detained for some other offense.

The privilege of rendering community service in lieu of service in jail shall be availed of only once.

Here, the trial court's decision was promulgated on June 29, 2016 while Republic Act No. 11362 took effect on August 8, 2019 after due publication. On the other hand, the Guidelines for the Community Service Act under A.M. No. 20-06-14-SC took effect on November 2, 2020.

While generally, laws are prospective in application,[3] penal laws which are favorable to the person guilty of the felony who is not a habitual criminal, as in this case, are given retroactive effect following Article 22 of the Revised Penal Code. It goes without saying, therefore, that the benefits granted under Republic Act No. 11362, being more favorable to Peña, and despite having been enacted three years after the promulgation of judgment in his case, can still be availed by him.

In this regard, A.M. No. 20-06-14-SC or the Guidelines in the Imposition of Community Service as a Penalty in Lieu of Imprisonment, decrees:

Thus, all judges concerned shall observe these guidelines in allowing rendition of community service in lieu of imprisonment in the service of penalty for arresto menor or arresto mayor:

1. After promulgation of judgment or order where the imposable penalty for the crime or offense committed by the accused is arresto menor or arresto mayor, it shall be the court's duty to inform the accused of and announce in open court his/her options within 15 calendar days from date of promulgation, to wit: (a) file an appeal; (2) apply for probation as provided by law; or (3) apply that the penalty be served by rendering community service in the place where the crime was committed. It shall further be explained to the accused that if he/she chooses to appeal the conviction, such resort thereto bars any application for community service or probation.

Due to the unavailability of the foregoing options to Peña before the trial court, the Regional Trial Court, and the Court of Appeals, he may, at the first instance before this Court, validly apply for the conversion of his sentence from imprisonment to community service.

It must be emphasized, however, that the imposition of the penalty of community service is still within the discretion of the court and should not be taken as an unbridled license to commit minor offenses. It is merely a privilege since the offender cannot choose it over imprisonment as a matter of right. Further, in requiring community service, the court shall consider the welfare of the society and the reasonable probability that the person sentenced shall not violate the law while rendering the service. With the enactment of Republic Act No. 11362, apart from the law's objective to improve public work participation and promote public service, it is expected that the State's policy to promote restorative justice and to decongest jails will be achieved.[4]","ACCORDINGLY, the motion is GRANTED. The Court's Resolution dated February 8, 2023 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION.

"G.R. No. 260013 [Formerly UDK 17349], August 13, 2024","E.L. SANIEL CONSTRUCTION, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON AUDIT AND PNOC SHIPPING AND TRANSPORT CORPORATION (PSTC), RESPONDENTS.","PSTC is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Philippine National Oil Company (PNOC) engaged in the business of marine transport of petroleum products.

E.L. Saniel was awarded the project for the rehabilitation of PSTC Limay Office (Rehabilitation Project) for the bid price of PHP 4,980,000.00 on January 5, 2010.[5] Thereafter, the project for the design and construction of slope protection/riprap at PSTC's Limay Office (Riprap Project) was also awarded to E.L. Saniel for the bid price of PHP 1,350,000.00 on September 22, 2010.[6] Both projects have been fully paid by PSTC.

According to E.L. Saniel, it discovered during the construction of the projects that the terrain where the Limay Office was situated posed a particular condition requiring additional constructions. Thus, E.L. Saniel performed additional works resulting in the following additional billings:
Particulars
Amount
Riprap Project
Riprap and additional works[7]


  PHP 2,412,736.42
Rehabilitation Project
Construction of sewer and drain canal[8]
69,608.97
Revise trusses and roofing[9]
257,829.00
Backfilling and compaction[10]
222,768.00
Total	
PHP 2,962,942.39
E.L. Saniels' billings for the additional works have remained unpaid by PSTC.

On February 7, 2013, the PNOC Board of Directors issued Resolution No. 2111, Series of 2013,[11] which shortened the corporate life of PSTC until March 15, 2013, due to the continuous deterioration of its financial condition. The dissolution, which was approved by the President of the Philippines in a Memorandum dated July 5, 2013, resulted in the cessation of PSTC's business operations.[12]

Accordingly, the PNOC Board created the PSTC Disposal Committee to handle the disposition of PSTC's assets. However, in a letter dated May 19, 2014, Atty. Joseph John M. Literal, Chairman of the PSTC Disposal Committee, directed all suppliers and contractors to file their respective petitions for money claim with the COA for settlement pursuant to Rule VIII, Section 2 of the 2009 COA Revised Rules of Procedure.[13]

On June 23, 2014, PSTC issued a Certification of Non-Payment[14] in the total gross invoice amount of PHP 26,928.88, certifying that only the aforementioned amount is reflected as the outstanding liability in the records and books of PSTC.

Consequently, E.L. Saniel filed a Petition to be Paid Money Claims[15] on November 5, 2014, to demand for the payment of the unpaid principal amount of PHP 2,962,942.39, plus PHP 1,066,659.26 in terms of accrued interest, and attorney's fees of PHP 500,000.00.","Before the Court is a Petition for Certiorari[1] under Rule 64 in relation to Rule 65 of the Rules of Court filed by petitioner E.L. Saniel Construction (E.L. Saniel) assailing Decision No. 2016-397[2] dated December 27, 2016, Resolution No. 2020-294[3] dated January 31, 2020, and the Notice of Finality of Decision No. 2021-072[4] dated May 19, 2021, all issued by the Commission on Audit (COA). The COA denied E.L. Saniel's money claim in the amount of PHP 4,529,601.65 representing failed accountabilities of respondent PNOC Shipping and Transport Corporation (PSTC) for the additional construction works rendered by E.L. Saniel.","The Court resolves to deny the Petition.

Timeliness of the Petition

Respondent COA contends that the assailed COA Resolution No. 2020-294 was received by E.L. Saniel on September 8, 2020, as evidenced by a Philippine Postal Corporation Registry Return Receipt;[39] thus, the filing of the present Petition for Certiorari on September 20, 2021, was made beyond the 30-day reglementary period under the Revised Rules of Court.

On the other hand, E.L. Saniel claims that it received a copy of the assailed COA Decision denying its money claim on May 9, 2017.[40] Thus, it had 30 days or until June 8, 2017, to file the petition for certiorari, unless a motion for reconsideration is filed which shall interrupt the prescriptive period. On May 11, 2017, E.L. Saniel filed a Motion for Reconsideration.

In its Comment dated June 23, 2022,[41] E.L. Saniel admits that while the assailed COA Resolution denying its Motion for Reconsideration may have been sent to its counsel on September 8, 2020, it learned of its issuance and obtained a copy thereof only on September 2, 2021.[42] Accordingly, petitioner avers that it had 28 remaining days, or until September 30, 2021, within which to file the instant Petition for Certiorari; hence, it timely filed the present Petition on September 20, 2021.

The Court finds for respondents.

Under Rule 64, Section 3 of the Rules of Court, a party may file a petition for certiorari within 30 days from notice of the COA's judgment. The filing of a motion for reconsideration or new trial shall interrupt the period. However, when the motion is denied, the aggrieved party may file the petition within the remaining period, which shall not be less than five days in any event, reckoned from the notice of denial. Accordingly, the petition must show when the notice of the assailed judgment or order or resolution was received, when the motion for reconsideration was filed, and when the notice of its denial was received. The rationale for requiring a complete statement of material dates is to determine whether the petition is timely filed.[43]

The Court notes that E.L. Saniel was served a copy of COA Decision No. 2016-397 on January 30, 2017, as shown in the Commission Secretariat Certificate of Service No. 397-16 dated December 27, 2016.[44] What is more, E.L. Saniel failed to state the material date showing when it received the Decision No. 2016-397 in its Motion for Reconsideration.

On this score alone, the COA could have denied E.L. Saniel's Motion for Reconsideration for being filed out of time. Nonetheless, the COA ruled on the merits of E.L. Saniel's money claims in the interest of substantial justice.

Be that as it may, E.L. Saniel had five days from the notice of denial of the motion for reconsideration to file the petition for certiorari.

Case law instructs that when a litigant is represented by counsel, notice to counsel serves as notice to the litigant. In the absence of a notice of withdrawal or substitution of counsel, the court will rightly assume that the counsel of record continues to represent their client. This is so because notice to counsel is an effective notice to the client, while notice to the client and not their counsel is not notice in law. Receipt of notice by the counsel of record is the reckoning point of the reglementary period.[45]

From the preceding discussion, it is clear that E.L. Saniel's period to file the present Petition commenced to run upon receipt by its counsel of record, Atty. Ernesto P. Tabao (Atty. Tabao), of COA Resolution No. 2020-294.[46]

While it is true that the administration of justice and access to legal remedies were severely disrupted by the lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Court finds no compelling reason to justify relaxation of the rules in the present case. The Philippine Postal Corporation Registry Return Receipt shows that Atty. Tabao indeed received the assailed Resolution on September 8, 2020.[47] With only five days remaining to file pursuant to Rule 64, Section 3 of the Rules of Court, the Petition for Certiorari was belatedly filed on September 20, 2021, and thus, the assailed COA issuances had already attained finality.

Verily, E.L. Saniel overlooked procedural rules more than once. The procedural lapses alone warrant the outright dismissal of the instant Petition.

The Court has always tried to maintain a healthy balance between the strict enforcement of procedural laws and the guarantee that every litigant be given the full opportunity for the just and proper disposition of his cause.[48] It must be stressed, however, that ""invocation of substantial justice is not a magical incantation that will automatically compel this Court to suspend procedural rules.""[49]

In view of the foregoing, it is well to point out that with E.L. Saniel's delayed filing of the Petition for Certiorari, the challenged COA Decision has already attained finality and may no longer be reviewed by this Court. When a decision becomes final and executory, the court loses jurisdiction over the case and not even an appellate court will have the power to review the said judgment.[50]

Payment on the basis of quantum meruit

The dismissal of the Petition is likewise warranted for lack of merit.","WHEREFORE, the Petition is DISMISSED. Decision No. 2016-397 dated December 27, 2016, Resolution No. 2020-294 dated January 31, 2020, and the Notice of Finality of Decision dated May 19, 2021, of the Commission on Audit are AFFIRMED."
"G.R. No. 264071, August 13, 2024","BEN D. LADILAD, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS AND MARY GRACE BANDOY, RESPONDENTS.","On June 27, 2013, Mary Grace Bandoy (Bandoy), a graft researcher, filed a Complaint[4] against Ben Ladilad (Ladilad) and Luciana M. Villanueva (Villanueva) for violation of the Omnibus Election Code (OEC), in particular, Section 261, paragraphs (g)[5] and (h),[6] in relation to COMELEC Resolution No. 9581,[7] before the COMELEC, for acts allegedly committed during the election period of the 2013 national, local, and Administrative Region of Muslim Mindanao elections.

Ladilad was the President of Benguet State University (BSU). Villanueva, on the other hand, was the Vice President for Research and Extension (OVPRE), also of BSU.

In such capacities, Ladilad and Villanueva were accused to have caused the illegal detail and transfer within BSU offices of Gretchen Gaye Ablaza (Ablaza) and Frances Noelle[*] Escalera (Escalera), both BSU employees. Ablaza was transferred from the Graduate School Office (GSO) to the OVPRE on March 25, 2013, through a letter dated March 8, 2013, penned by Villanueva, and approved by Ladilad:[8]
March 8, 2013","This is a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 64, in relation to Rule 65, with a prayer for Temporary Restraining Order, Status Quo Ante Order, and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction,[1] assailing the Resolution[2] of the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) En Banc, and the Resolution[3] of the Office of the Regional Election Director-Cordillera Administrative Region (ORED-CAR), in E.O. Case No. 13-261.","The petition is granted.

Ladilad asserts that there was no transfer effected on Escalera and Ablaza,[27] and alleges that the COMELEC incurred inordinate delay in resolving the case.[28]

On the latter issue, Ladilad claims that his right to the speedy disposition of the case was violated when it took the COMELEC almost eight years, or until September 27, 2022, to resolve his and Villanueva's Motion for Reconsideration[29] of the Resolution dated November 4, 2014. Ladilad decries that he was disadvantaged by the uncertainties of the potential criminal case that may be filed against him; that he was forced to live under a cloud of anxiety and suspicion; that his reputation as a former BSU President was besmirched; and that the delay in the resolution of his Motion for Reconsideration impaired his defense in the event of a full-blown trial.[30]

Pursuant to the guidelines laid out in Cagang v. Sandiganbayan (Cagang)[31] in the assessment of the existence of inordinate delays, particularly on how the right against such delays is invoked, We declare that the resolution of this case before the COMELEC was inordinately delayed.

We focus on the third and fifth guidelines as laid out in Cagang:
Third, courts must first determine which party carries the burden of proof. If the right is invoked within the given time periods contained in current Supreme Court resolutions and circulars, and the time periods that will be promulgated by the Office of the Ombudsman, the defense has the burden of proving that the right was justifiably invoked. If the delay occurs beyond the given time period and the right is invoked, the prosecution has the burden of justifying the delay.

If the defense has the burden of proof, it must prove[,] first, whether the case is motivated by malice or clearly only politically motivated and is attended by utter lack of evidence, and second, that the defense did not contribute to the delay.

Once the burden of proof shifts to the prosecution, the prosecution must prove first, that it followed the prescribed procedure in the conduct of preliminary investigation and in the prosecution of the case; second, that the complexity of the issues and the volume of evidence made the delay inevitable; and third, that no prejudice was suffered by the accused as a result of the delay.","ACCORDINGLY, the instant Petition is GRANTED. The Resolutions of the Commission on Elections En Banc dated November 4, 2014 and September 27, 2022, and the Resolution of the Office of the Regional Election Director-Cordillera Administrative Region in E.O.

ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION AND NATIONAL RENEWABLE ENERGY BOARD, RESPONDENTS.","On July 6, 2011, the Energy Regulatory Commission received Department of Energy resolutions approving the final installation targets for each renewable energy technology: 250 megawatts (MW) for biomass, 10 MW for ocean, 250 MW for run-of-river hydropower, 50 MW for solar, and 200 MW for wind.[50] Subsequently, the Energy Regulatory Commission issued the FIT Rules and FIT Guidelines, and provisionally approved the initial FITs.

On April 30, 2014, the Department of Energy issued a certification increasing the installation target for solar renewable energy from 50 MW to 500 MW.[51] When the National Renewable Energy Board received the certification, it endorsed it to the Energy Regulatory Commission.[52] Subsequently, the Energy Regulatory Commission issued Resolution No. 6, Series of 2015, approving a decrease in the solar renewable energy FIT from the 2012 rate of PHP 9.68/kWh to PHP 8.69/kWh.[53]

On Apri1 7, 2015, the Department of Energy issued another certification, this time increasing the installation target for wind renewable energy from 200 MW to 400 MW. The increase was meant to boost power supply.[54] The National Renewable Energy Board again referred the matter to the Energy Regulatory Commission,[55] and the Energy Regulatory Commission issued a Decision that adjusted the wind renewable energy FIT rate from PHP 8.53/kWh to PHP 7.40/kWh.[56] This was also approved in the Energy Regulatory Commission's Resolution No. 14, Series of 2015.[57]

The National Transmission Corporation then subsequently filed applications to collect the FIT Allowance for 2016 to 2018.[58] On December 22, 2015, it filed an application to increase the 2016 FIT Allowance rate to PHP 0.1025/kWh.[59] In its Order dated February 16, 2016, the Energy Regulatory Commission provisionally approved a FIT Allowance rate of PHP 0.1240/kWh.[60]

On December 1, 2016, the National Transmission Corporation requested for provisional authority to collect PHP 0.2291/kWh as the 2017 FIT Allowance rate. The Energy Regulatory Commission approved a FIT Allowance rate of PHP 0.1830/kWh.[61] The following year, on August 30, 2017, the National Transmission Corporation requested for provisional authority to collect PHP 0.2932/kWh as the 2018 FIT Allowance rate.[62]

It involves an application of doctrines relating to judicial review, police power, delegation of legislative power, and substantive and procedural due process of law.","This Court notes that this alleged right and its alleged violation constitute one of the main issues being contested in the main case and is one of the matters for this Court's resolution.

"G.R. No. 256856, August 12, 2024","TOMMY CARIÑO A.K.A. ""TOMMY ECHAVEZ"" PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","In three separate Informations, Cariño and his co-accused, Junefer Mahilum (Mahilum), were charged with three counts of murder for the deaths of Marlon Joshua Layno Young (Young), Solidad Ypanto (Ypanto), and Virginia Lim Sesbreño (Sesbreño).[5] The Informations, which were similarly worded except for the names of the deceased, read:

CBU-9587[5]

That on or about the 1st day of February 2012 at about 3:25 [p.m.], more or less, at Cansojong, Talisay City, Cebu, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused, conniving and confederating together and mutually helping each other, armed with a firearm of unknown caliber, with deliberate intent; with intent to kill and with treachery and evident premeditation, did then and there attack, assault and shot one Virginia Lim Sesbreño, with the said firearm, thereby inflicting upon him gunshot wounds, which directly caused his instantaneous death.[6]
Cariño pleaded not guilty to all the charges, while Mahilum remained at large.[7] Trial on the merits then ensued.[8]

The prosecution presented the following witnesses: (1) Rafael Chan, Jr. (Chan), Barangay Councilor of Barangay San Roque, Talisay City;[9] (2) Atty. Raul H. Sesbreño, one of the victim's husband; and (3) Senior Police Officer I Mikie Espina (SPO1 Espina), Philippine National Police (PNP) member assigned at Talisay City Police Office.[10] It also offered the following documentary evidence: (1) Chan's Joint Affidavit;[11] (2) Sesbreno's Complaint Affidavit; (3) death certificates of the victims; (4) SPO1 Espina's Joint Affidavit; (5) Physical Identification Report (trajectory report); (6) pictures of the Isuzu DMAX, the accused, and the five witnesses; and (7) Firearm Identification Report.[12]

The testimonies of Chan and SPO1 Espina narrate the following version of events:

At around 3:25 p.m. on February 1, 2012, Chan and barangay tanods Crisanto Labajo (Labajo), Mario Constantino (Constantino), and Glicerio Icot (Icot)[13] were travelling along SRP Road in Talisay City onboard the barangay multicab driven by Bartolome Teo (Teo). Chan was seated with Labajo on the left side behind the driver, near the multicab's step board; Constantino and Icot were seated on the right side.[14]

At the corner of SRP Road and Rabaya Street, while the multicab temporarily stopped at the rightmost lane beside the sidewalk due to a red light traffic signal, Chan, Labajo, Constantino, Icot, and Teo heard around eight successive gunshots from behind.[15]

Chan turned to his right side and saw two men riding in tandem without helmets on a motorcycle without a plate number.[16] The motorcycle was coming towards their direction. Chan also saw a white Isuzu DMAX pick-up truck about 20 feet away behind them.[17]

Afterwards, the motorcycle stopped behind the barangay multicab, swerved to the sidewalk, and sped off. Chan saw the backrider change the magazine of his gun as their eyes met.[18]

Chan, Labajo, Constantino, Icot, and Teo tried to chase the motorcycle but they retracted upon reaching Evergreen Memorial Park, past Barangay Laray, when the backrider pointed the gun at them. The motorcycle was heading towards Cebu City.[19]

Subsequently, Chan, Labajo, Constantino, Icot, and Teo went back to the junction of SRP Road and Rabaya Street where they found the victims onboard the Isuzu DMAX pick-up.[20] The victims were identified as Ypanto, Sesbreno, and Young (the driver).[21]

Recovered from the crime scene were six empty shells of caliber .45, one deformed slug, one caliber .40 pistol, two magazines, and a cellular phone. The police officers then turned over the six empty shells and slug to the crime laboratory for examination.[22] The ballistic examination revealed that these were from the same firearm.[23]

On February 2, 2012, SPO1 Espina invited Chan and his co-passengers to the police station.[24] Icot gave a description of the backrider for cartographic sketching because Chan arrived late.[25] Then, SPO1 Espina and PO2 Stephen Sefuesca showed the cartographic sketch, together with more than a hundred pictures of arrested persons from the police station's rogue gallery, to Chan and his co-passengers.[26] They pointed to Cariño (Picture No. 11) as the backrider and Mahilum (Picture No. 26) as the driver of the motorcycle.[27]

Chan identified Cariño as the backrider who was only about a meter away from the back of their multicab when he saw him.[28] Cariño was wearing a hat and a pair of Ray Ban sun glasses at that time.[29] Chan said he could not forget Cariño's face because he was a shooter and member of Aqua City Gun Club, same with the victim Young. The next time he saw Cariño was when he was arrested on February 26, 2012 in a separate case for illegal possession of firearm. Cariño was confined then at the hospital for treatment and it was hard to identify him because his face was bloated.[30]

For his part, Cariño denied being involved in the shooting incident that happened in the afternoon of February 1, 2012. He said he did not know who shot the victims and testified that in the early morning of the said date, he was in his house attending to his children. When his mother arrived in the afternoon, Cariño went out to buy cigarette and loitered along the street in Barangay Lagtang, Talisay City. After, he met Mark Ferdinand Bas (Bas), barangay captain of Barangay Lagtang, Talisay City, who just passed by and invited him for a drinking session at 6:00 p.m. Cariño then went to the house of Bas where they had a drinking spree until evening. Cariño said he just learned that he has a case for multiple murder when he was already imprisoned. He also claimed that he does not know Chan and the barangay tanods.[31]

Meanwhile, Bas testified that he was the barangay captain of Barangay Lagtang, Talisay City. He said Cariño is his childhood friend and third degree cousin of his mother. In the afternoon of February 1, 2012, Bas was in his house in corner Krishanta and Lagtang roads, Talisay City when he saw Cariño sitting and smoking in the store at the lower ground of their house at 1:00 p.m. An hour later, Bas and his group started their drinking session; Cariño joined them until past 7:00 p.m.[32]

In a Joint Decision[33] dated November 17, 2017, the Branch 17, Regional Trial Court of Cebu City found Cariño guilty only of homicide instead of murder. It gave credence to the testimony of Chan who identified Cariño as the assailant[34] and disbelieved his denial and alibi for his failure to show the physical impossibility of being at the crime scene.[35] However, it held that the qualifying circumstances of treachery and evident premeditation were not sufficiently proven by the prosecution.[36] The dispositive portion reads:
IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, the Court finds the accused Tommy Cariño a.k.a. Tommy Echavez, GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of three (3) counts of homicide as defined and penalized under Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code and hereby sentences to suffer the indeterminate sentence of EIGHT (8) YEARS of prision mayor as minimum up to FIFTEEN (15) YEARS of reclusion temporal as maximum for each case. He is also ordered to pay the respective heirs of the late Malon Joshua Young, the late Solidad Ypanto and the late Virginia Sesbreño the amounts of FIFTY THOUSAND PESOS (P[HP] 50,000.00) as civil indemnity, another FIFTY THOUSAND PESOS (P[HP] 50,000.00) as moral damages and TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PESOS (P[HP] 25,000.00) as temperate damages for each count.

As regards co-accused Junefer Mahilum who is still at large, these cases are ordered archived.

SO ORDERED.[37] (Emphasis in the original)
Cariño appealed, arguing that the trial court gravely erred in relying on Chan's testimony and in convicting him based on circumstantial evidence.[38] He averred that Chan's testimony was riddled with material inconsistencies[39] and his identification is highly dubious.[40]","An out-of-court identification made through a cartographic sketch based on the description of another person is unreliable, uncertain, impaired with suggestiveness, and insufficient to rebut the presumption of the innocence of the accused.

This Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] seeks to reverse and set aside the: Court of Appeals' (1) Decision,[2] which affirmed with modification the Joint Decision[3] of Branch 17, Regional Trial Court, Cebu City convicting petitioner Tommy Cariño (Cariño) of three counts of homicide; and (2) Resolution[4] denying Cariño's motion for reconsideration.","The Court noted the susceptibility of the human memory to various forms of influence in Nuñez:
The frailty of human memory is a scientific fact. The danger of inordinate reliance on human memory in criminal proceedings, where conviction results in the possible deprivation of liberty, property, and even life, is equally established.
Human memory does not record events like a video recorder. In the first place, human memory is more selective than a video camera. The sensory environment contains a vast amount of information, but the memory process perceives and accurately records only a very small percentage of that information. Second, because the act of remembering is reconstructive, akin to putting puzzle pieces together, human memory can change in dramatic and unexpected ways because of the passage of time or subsequent events, such as exposure to ""postevent"" information like conversations with other witnesses or media reports. Third, memory can also be altered through the reconstruction process. Questioning a witness about what he or she perceived and requiring the witness to reconstruct the experience can cause the witness' memory to change by unconsciously blending the actual fragments of memory of the event with information provided during the memory retrieval process.[85]
The danger of Chan's susceptibility to suggestion is compounded when we consider the swiftness of the incident, which could have provided him a limited opportunity to observe the backrider's facial appearance sufficient to retain it in memory. Chan testified that the backrider was holding a firearm with one hand and changing the magazine with the other; the replaced magazine fell on the backrider's lap and eventually to the ground. His attention on the firearm and the magazine inevitably reduced his ability to pay attention to peripheral details such as the facial features of the backrider. Considering the very brief time when the motorcycle was right behind the multicab as the motorcycle driver was in a haste to escape, Chan's opportunity to observe the face of the backrider was certainly diminished when his attention was centered on the firearm and the magazine.

In Nuñez, the Court discussed the relevance of the presence or absence of a weapon to a witness' attention and consequently to identification accuracy:
A focal point of psychological studies has been the effect of the presence of a weapon on a witness' attentiveness. Since the 1970s, it has been hypothesized that the presence of a weapon captures a witness' attention, thereby reducing his or her attentiveness to other details such as the perpetrator's facial and other identifying features. Research on this has involved an enactment model involving two (2) groups: first, an enactment with a gun; and second, an enactment of the same incident using an implement like a pencil or a syringe as substitute for an actual gun. Both groups are then asked to identify the culprit in a lineup. Results reveal a statistically significant difference in the accuracy of eyewitness identification between the two (2) groups:
[T]he influence of [a weapon focus] variable on an eyewitness's performance can only be estimated post hoc. Yet the data here do offer a rather strong statement: To not consider a weapon's effect on eyewitness performance is to ignore relevant information. The weapon effect does reliably occur, particularly in crimes of short duration in which a threatening weapon is visible. Identification accuracy and feature accuracy of eyewitnesses are likely to be affected, although, as previous research has noted. . . there is not necessarily a concordance between the two.[86]
The foregoing circumstances weaken the reliability of the in-court identification made by Chan, especially when we consider that Chan briefly saw the petitioner at the time of the incident. Two weeks later, Chan saw petitioner again, but he allegedly could not recognize him because his face was bloated. The third time that Chan saw petitioner was during the trial. As held by this Court:
[W]here a photograph has been identified as that of the guilty party, any subsequent corporeal identification of that person may be based not upon the witness's recollection of the features of the guilty party, but upon his recollection of the photograph. Thus, although a witness who is asked to attempt a corporeal identification of a person whose photograph he previously identified may say, ""That's the man that did it,"" what he may actually mean is, ""That's the man whose photograph I identified.""

....

A recognition of this psychological phenomenon leads logically to the conclusion that where a witness has made a photographic identification of a person, his subsequent corporeal identification of that same person is somewhat impaired in value, and its accuracy must be evaluated in light of the fact that he first saw a photograph.[87] (Emphasis in the original)
The Court is unconvinced that the perpetrator's identity was established beyond reasonable doubt. We cannot say that Chan identified the perpetrator based on his own observation and not upon suggestive influences. We are not convinced beyond reasonable doubt that he accurately acquired and retained sufficient information to have properly identified the assailant.

Inasmuch as Chan's identification is tainted with unreliability, corroborative evidence should have been adduced by the prosecution. Curiously, it did not present barangay tanod Icot, who supposedly provided the description for the cartographer. The prosecution rather presented SPO1 Espina, whose testimony was shorn of details and significantly differed with Chan on whether the motorcycle driver was indeed identified in the mug shots. With this unexplained glaring inconsistency, which could have been clarified with the testimony of the other companions of Chan, the Court is not persuaded that the prosecution presented the required quantum of proof.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is GRANTED. The Court of Appeals' January 31, 2020 Decision and January 26, 2021 Resolution in CA-G.R. CR No. 03133 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Petitioner Tommy Cariño a.k.a.

"G.R. No. 270257, August 12, 2024","XXX270257,* PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES AND AAA, RESPONDENTS.","The instant case stemmed from an Information[6] for violation of Section 5(i) of Republic Act No. 9262 filed against XXX270257. The accusatory portion of the Information reads:
That on the 1st day of January 2017, and on the days prior and subsequent thereto, at xxxxxxxxxxx, Municipality of xxxxxxxxxxx, Province of Benguet, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, without any justifiable cause or reason whatsoever, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and knowingly subject his wife [AAA] and their children to mental and emotional anguish, public ridicule or humiliation by abandoning them and living with another woman thereby denying them marital love and affection, and financial support to their children despite being financially capable, to the damage and prejudice of said [AAA] and their children.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[7]
Upon arraignment, XXX270257 entered a plea of ""Not Guilty"" to the charge.

Trial on the merits ensued.","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] filed by petitioner XXX270257 assailing the Decision[2] dated February 8, 2023, and the Resolution[3] dated September 6, 2023, of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-­G.R. CR No. 45361. The CA affirmed the Judgment[4] dated July 3, 2020, of xxxxxxxxxxx, Regional Trial Court (RTC), xxxxxxxxxxx, Benguet in Criminal Case No. 18-CR-12464 that found XXX270257 guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Psychological Violence defined and penalized under Section 5(i)[5] of Republic Act No. 9262, otherwise known as the Anti-Violence against Women and their Children Act.","The Court resolves to deny the petition for failure to sufficiently show that the CA committed reversible error in rendering its assailed dispositions as to warrant the exercise of the Court's discretionary appellate jurisdiction.

The Court adopts the finding of the CA that all the elements of Psychological Violence under Section 5(i) or Republic Act No. 9262 are present. In Dinamling v. People,[28] the Court held:
From the aforequoted Section 5(i), in relation to other sections of RA No. 9262, the elements of the crime are derived as follows:

(1) The offended party is a woman and/or her child or children;

(2) The woman is either the wife or former wife of the offender, or is a woman with whom the offender has or had a sexual or dating relationship, or is a woman with whom such offender has a common child. As for the woman's child or children, they may be legitimate or illegitimate, or living within or without the family abode;

(3) The offender causes on the woman and/or child mental or emotional anguish; and

(4) The anguish is caused through acts of public ridicule or humiliation, repeated verbal and emotional abuse, denial of financial support or custody of minor children or access to the children or similar such acts or omissions.[29] (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)
It is undisputed that AAA is a woman married to XXX270257. Thus, what the Court must resolve now is the presence of the third and fourth elements, i.e., the offender causing on the woman and/or child mental or emotional anguish through acts of public ridicule or humiliation, repeated verbal and emotional abuse, denial of financial support or custody of minor children, or access to the children, or similar such acts or omissions.

Regarding the third element, XXX270257 argues that the element of psychological violence was not proven. He contends that the prosecution failed to effectively adduce a psychological report when it did not stipulate, during the trial, on its presentation as evidence and the psychologist as a witness; the RTC nonetheless favorably considered both.[30]

The argument utterly lacks merit.

In Labrador v. People,[31] the Court categorically held that a psychological evaluation is not indispensable in proving the infliction of psychological violence under Republic Act No. 9262. Thus:
Moreover, petitioner harps on the absence of a psychological evaluation from an expert witness which would show that CCC had indeed suffered mentally and emotionally as a result of his actions. Ineluctably, the absence of such evaluation is inconsequential since it is not an element of the crime of Violation of Section 5 (h) of R.A. No. 9262. Nowhere in the law can such a requirement be inferred. In any event, the law does not actually require proof that the victim became psychologically ill due to the psychological violence done by her abuser.[32] (Citation omitted)
Further, the Court has also categorically held that the victim's testimony in court suffices to prove the element of emotional anguish. In Araza v. People,[33] the Court declared that therein petitioner committed psychological violence upon his wife by committing marital infidelity, which caused the latter emotional anguish and mental suffering. The Court elucidated in this wise:
Psychological violence is an indispensable element of violation of Section 5(i) of R.A. No. 9262. Equally essential is the element of emotional anguish and mental suffering, which are personal to the complainant. Psychological violence is the means employed by the perpetrator, while emotional anguish or mental suffering are the effects caused to or the damage sustained by the offended party. The law does not require proof that the victim became psychologically ill due to the psychological violence done by her abuser. Rather, the law only requires emotional anguish and mental suffering to be proven. To establish emotional anguish or mental suffering, jurisprudence only requires that the testimony of the victim to be presented in court, as such experiences are personal to this party.[34] (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)
Here, the testimony of AAA detailing her emotional ordeal suffices to prove the element of emotional anguish. XXX270257's insistence that a psychological report is indispensable to the prosecution of the violation of Section 5(i) of Republic Act No. 9262 has no basis in law and jurisprudence. As such, it cannot serve to acquit him.

Anent the fourth element of psychological violence, it must be noted that XXX270257 merely denied committing the acts charged. Specifically, he denied cohabiting and having an affair with CCC, who, according to him was a mere acquaintance. He also alleged that he did not have a child with CCC and that he only stood as the father of her child because he wanted a son.[35]

The Court is not persuaded.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is hereby DENIED. The Decision dated February 8, 2023, and Resolution dated September 6, 2023, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 45361 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION:

He is also ORDERED to PAY the victim, AAA, moral damages in the amount of PHP 75,000.00; and

"G.R. No. 268143, August 12, 2024","GOLDLAND TOWER CONDOMINIUM CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. EDWARD L. LIM AND HSIEH HSIU-PING, RESPONDENTS.","Respondent Hsieh Hsiu-Ping (Hsieh) was the registered owner of Unit 8-B in Goldland Tower Condominium covered by Condominium Certificate of Title (CCT) No. 4007-R. However, Hsieh became delinquent in the payment of the association dues amounting to PHP 4,362,208.14. Thus, on August 10, 2011, Goldland caused the annotation of its lien on CCT No. 4007-R.[4]

Meanwhile, due to Hsieh's nonpayment of real estate taxes, the City Treasurer of San Juan City levied the condominium unit. The property was then sold in a public auction to the highest bidder, respondent Edward Lim (Lim), as per Certificate of Sale dated February 9, 2012. There being no redemption made by Hsieh within the one year period provided under the Local Government Code, the City of San Juan issued a deed of conveyance in favor of Lim.[5]

Later, on February 14, 2012, Goldland filed a complaint for foreclosure against Lim and Hsieh with Branch 160, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Pasig City (San Juan City Station).[6] Goldland demanded for payment of the principal sum of PHP 4,362,208.14, representing the unpaid association dues, and in case of default, for foreclosure of the encumbrance over the condominium unit in accordance with Rule 68 of the Rules of Court.[7]

In his Answer, Lim countered that Goldland had no cause of action to judicially foreclose on his newly acquired property because the tax lien, which was already foreclosed by the City of San Juan, was superior to any other encumbrance, including Goldland's supposed lien for the association dues. If at all, the right of Goldland was limited to redeeming the property, which it failed to do. Hence, the issuance of the absolute deed of conveyance in favor of Lim. For this reason, Lim insisted that he bought the condominium unit free from any encumbrance or third party claim. In any case, Goldland cannot recover the assessed amount as it failed to send him an extrajudicial demand, making the filing of the action premature.[8]

During pre-trial, the parties agreed that there was no factual issue to be tried. The only issue for resolution, and for which the parties filed their respective memoranda,[9] was the legal effect of the City Treasurer's public auction on Goldland's lien.

On January 28, 2020, the RTC issued a Decision[10] in favor of Goldland and declared that Hsieh's unpaid association dues are considered a prior lien on the property. This lien annotated on CCT No. 4007-R, attaches to the property itself regardless of the change in ownership. Consequently, Lim is deemed to have assumed the obligation to pay the unpaid assessment when he bought the unit during the tax delinquency sale. The trial court ordered Lim to pay Goldland the assessed amount of PHP 4,362,208.14 plus 6% interests per annum and ""[in] case of failure to pay the aforesaid amount within the time prescribed, let the subject property be sold through public auction and for the disposition of the proceeds thereof in accordance with law.""[11] Because the parties had previously agreed to limit the issue of the case to the effect of the tax sale on Goldland's lien, the RTC no longer ruled on whether demand had duly been made on Lim.[12]

The RTC denied Lim's motion for reconsideration.[13]

In his appeal before the CA, Lim argued that: (1) the foreclosure sale had the effect of extinguishing Goldland's lien on the property, it being ""subordinate"" to the local government's real property tax lien; and (2) Goldland's action was premature for lack of prior demand.[14]

The CA initially affirmed the RTC's Decision. In its Decision dated September 21, 2022,[15] the CA ruled that the unpaid association dues constitute a valid lien on the condominium unit in Goldland's favor. As such, Lim was obligated to settle the unpaid amount after he acquired the property. The CA further declared that the public sale conducted by the local government unit (LGU) only discharged the delinquent taxes, interests, and sale expenses, but Goldland's registered lien remains. Finally, the CA held that the parties can no longer raise the issue of demand as this was not one of the issues contained in the Pre-trial Order which could be considered for resolution.[16]

Acting on Lim's motion for reconsideration, the CA issued the assailed Amended Decision[17] dated March 1, 2023, setting aside its initial Decision.","The line between related legal principles is a fine one, often blurred by every nuanced interpretation it has assumed over time. In this case, the Court sees it fit to untangle the concepts of demand and notice as we probe into the main issue on whether an action for judicial foreclosure can prosper despite the absence of an extrajudicial demand.

Before this Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] filed by petitioner Goldland Tower Condominium Corporation (Goldland), assailing the Amended Decision[2] and the Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA), which dismissed Goldland's action for judicial foreclosure due to the absence of a demand.","The Petition has merit.
 
Demand and notice are two distinct concepts in law
 

In contractual obligations, the determination of whether demand has been made is one of fact.[25] On the other hand, the question of whether a demand is necessary prior to the filing of petitioner's action for judicial foreclosure remains a legal one, considering Goldland's main contention that the assessment annotated as a lien on CCT No. 4007-R is in the nature of a constructive notice which serves as sufficient demand upon respondent Lim.

Petitioner's argument failed to distinguish between the two legal concepts of demand and notice.

Notice, whether actual or constructive, play into a party's allegations of knowledge and good faith. In this jurisdiction, the law affords protection to a party who is acting in good faith.[26] For instance, persons who possess personal property in good faith, i.e., without actual knowledge of a flaw in title or mode of acquisition,[27] hold the equivalent of title over such property until it is legally recovered by the true owner.[28] They may even become the legitimate owners of the personal property after an uninterrupted possession of four years, if they maintain the same lack of knowledge during the entire period.[29]

When constructive, notice creates a legal presumption of knowledge,[30] and thus becomes a matter wholly dictated by law and against which no person can continue to plead ignorance.[31] In such instances, the purpose of the notice is to afford special protection to certain legal systems, or to maintain the feasibility and integrity of specific legal fictions, like the Torrens system of land registration,[32] or the publication of laws in lieu of giving personal notice to every citizen.[33]

On the other hand, demand is always a question of fact[34] because the creditor must prove its due service to and receipt by the debtor for it to have legal effect.[35] Although the law may require the demand to be in a certain form or contain specific matters before it produces the desired legal consequences,[36] there is no such thing as a constructive demand, unlike in notice. Demand, being dependent on its service and receipt, may thus only bind the person who actually receives it. Simply put, notice determines the presence or absence of knowledge and good faith, while demand decides on whether a party has defaulted on a demandable obligation.[37]

Applying these principles, the Court finds it inaccurate for petitioner to insist that the demand on the original owner respondent Hsieh was also a demand on respondent Lim.[38] Petitioner's erroneous view about demand is hinged on Lim's constructive notice, which is an entirely distinct legal concept, as explained above. The constructive notice on the part of Lim is merely a consequence of the annotation of the lien on CCT No. 4007-R, resulting to his assumption of respondent Hsieh's obligation to settle the unpaid dues. This is ordained by Section 59 of Presidential Decree No. 1529 or The Property Registration Decree,[39] which states:
Sec. 59. Carry Over of Encumbrances. — If, at the time of any transfer, subsisting encumbrances or annotations appear in the registration book, they shall be carried over and stated in the new certificate or certificates, except so far as they may be simultaneously released or discharged.
However, we must again stress that the matter on constructive notice has nothing to do and should not be confused with petitioner's demand upon respondent Lim or the lack thereof, for the payment of the assessed amount before respondent Lim is considered in default.

In any case, there can be no question as to the validity and preference of petitioner's lien since it was annotated on CCT No. 4007-R earlier than the tax lien. Precisely, in BIR v. TICO Insurance Co., Inc.,[40] the Court ruled that the prior annotation of a lien creates a preference given that the registration is the operative act that binds the real property. When respondent Lim purchased the condominium unit during the tax sale, it is understood that any lien previously annotated on the CCT subsists. The prior lien is deemed incorporated into and must be carried over to the new title because it is a right in rem that directly subjects the property itself to the fulfillment of the obligation. Truly, petitioner's right cannot be impaired because its lien is inseparable from the property upon which it is imposed, and it subsists notwithstanding a change in ownership of the unit.[41]

Notably, even in its Amended Decision, the CA affirmed the RTC's finding that: (1) petitioner's unpaid assessments against respondent Hsieh, which was duly annotated on CCT No. 4007-R in accordance with the Condominium Act[42] and petitioner's master deed and declaration of restrictions,[43] is a valid lien on the property such that it was deemed assumed by respondent Lim when he acquired it during the public auction;[44] and that (2) Goldland's prior lien survived the LGU's tax sale to cover the delinquent real property taxes.[45]

The only issue on which the CA changed its ruling was on the aspect of demand. In the Amended Decision, the CA ruled that petitioner's complaint failed to allege prior demand on respondent Lim. It then concluded that demand was necessary for a valid foreclosure of the encumbrance on respondent Lim's condominium unit, which then renders petitioner's action for judicial foreclosure dismissible for being premature.[46] The Court rules otherwise.
 
Petitioner's suit against respondent Lim constituted sufficient demand contemplated by law
 

While we agree that petitioner had to demand payment of the unpaid assessments from Lim, we reject the CA's finding that demand was not made, and that petitioner's filing of a complaint was premature.

To recall, petitioner's complaint for judicial foreclosure prayed for the following alternative reliefs: (1) that respondent Lim be ordered to pay the principal sum of PHP 4,362,208.14, and (2) should respondent Lim fail to pay, that the condominium unit be sold at public auction and the proceeds be applied in accordance with Rule 68 of the Rules of Court.[47]","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is GRANTED. The Amended Decision dated March 1, 2023 and the Resolution dated June 21, 2023 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 117711 are REVERSED.

The Court of Appeals' Decision dated September 21, 2022, affirming the Decision dated January 28, 2020 of Branch 160, Regional Trial Court, Pasig City in SCA Case No. 4118 is REINSTATED."
"G.R. No. 266538, August 12, 2024","SPS. ROGELIO D. MINA AND SOTERA S. MINA, PETITIONERS, VS. HENRY B. AQUENDE, RESPONDENT.","In their Complaint,[4] Spouses Mina alleged that they were the registered owners of a house and lot (subject property) located at Lot 11, Pearl Heights, Victoria Homes Subdivision, Tunasan, Muntinlupa City and covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 182759.[5] The declared assessed value of the subject property was PHP 34,430.00.[6]

On November 8, 2017, Muntinlupa City Treasurer Anastacio L. Miñoza (Miñoza) sold the subject property at public auction allegedly for nonpayment of real property taxes. Henry B. Aquende (Aquende) won the auction for a bid price of PHP 58,000.00.

Consequently, Miñoza issued a Certificate of Sale in favor of Aquende. This was subsequently annotated on TCT No. 182759. Likewise, an undated Final Deed of Sale/Conveyance got executed in his favor.[7]

On January 10, 2022, Spouses Mina filed with the Metropolitan Trial Court, Muntinlupa City a complaint for Annulment of Tax Sale titled Sps. Rogelio D. Mina and Sotera S. Mina v. Henry B. Aquende and docketed as Civil Case No. MeTC-7454. The case got raffled to Branch 114.[8]

Spouses Mina then claimed that the tax auction sale was invalid for failure to comply with the legal requirements under Local Government Code, Sections 254, 258, and 260 specifically: (1) the Notice of Tax Delinquency[9] dated August 14, 2017 and Warrant of Levy[10] dated September 7, 2017 were served by registered mail to No. 6 Diwani Street, San Francisco Del Monte, Quezon City, a boarding house where Rogelio resided way back in 1992. The mailed copies of these notices were returned to the City Treasurer with notation: RTS-Moved Out; (2) these notices should have been mailed and served by the City Treasurer to the occupant of the subject property if the delinquent owner could not be located; (3) the twin notices[11] both dated February 28, 2018 of the auction sale and the one-year redemption period of the subject property were also mailed and served at the same address; (4) the notice was not published as required by law nor was the tax delinquency annotated on the subject property's tax declaration; (5) the subject property valued at PHP 900,000.00 was merely auctioned off at PHP 58,000.00, equivalent only to 6% of the zonal value of the subject property; (6) the auction sale was simply unconscionable and amounted to taking of subject property without due process; (7) Aquende never took ownership of the subject property despite the lapse of the alleged redemption period; and (8) as they were forced to litigate to vindicate their rights, they are entitled to attorney's fees of PHP 150,000.00.[12]

In his Answer[13] dated June 29, 2020, Aquende riposted that he did not have any personal knowledge about the allegations in the complaint but maintained that the auction sale was above board. He also alleged that on November 6, 2019, there was a Petition for Application of a New Certificate of Title Upon Expiration of Redemption Period under Property Decree, Section 75 pending between the same parties before the Regional Trial Court, Muntinlupa City. That case involved the same parties and the same issue pertaining to the validity of the tax auction sale. Further, Spouses Mina failed to make an actual deposit with the court of the amount for which the real property was sold, together with interest of 2% per month from the date of sale to the time of the institution of the action. At any rate, he bought the subject property in good faith and for value. Finally, he was also forced to litigate, hence, was entitled to damages, attorney's fees, and cost of suit.

Under Reply[14] dated July 15, 2022, Spouses Mina averred that there was no litis pendentia as they were not aware of any petition filed by Aquende. In any event, the remedies sought in the two cases were different. More, the deposit required under Section 267 of the Local Government Code need not be paid at the same time the complaint is filed. By experience, payment of any deposit required for the filing of the complaint should be contained in a duly issued order of the court. Even then, they were willing to make the deposit once ordered by the trial court. In fact, the Office of the Clerk of Court of the Metropolitan Trial Court, Muntinlupa City advised them that it was better to wait for the order of the Branch 114 to deposit the amount required.","This Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] seeks to reverse the twin dispositions of Branch 207, Regional Trial Court, Muntinlupa City in Civil Case No. 22-091, thus:

1)
Decision[2] dated March 20, 2023 affirming the dismissal by Branch 114, Metropolitan Trial Court, Muntinlupa City of Spouses Rogelio D. Mina (Rogelio) and Sotera S. Mina's (Sotera; collectively referred to as Spouses Mina) Complaint for Annulment of Tax Sale for failure to deposit the amount required under Section 267 of Republic Act No. 7160 (Local Government Code) at the same time the complaint was filed; and


2)
Order[3] dated April 4, 2023 denying Spouses Minas Motion for Reconsideration.","We reverse.

To begin with, the Court takes cognizance of the present Petition for Review on Certiorari directed against the rulings of the Regional Trial Court on a pure question of law as heretofore stated. The resolution of this question rests solely on what the law or the rules provide on the given set of circumstances. To put it in another perspective, the Court ought to look only into whether the trial court correctly applied the law or rules in the case. It does not require the examination of evidence. As held in Daswani v. Banco De Oro,[23] when only questions of law remain to be addressed, a direct recourse to the Court under this remedy is the proper mode of appeal.

The deposit required under Local Government Code, Section 267 is mandatory and jurisdictional but need not be simultaneously paid with the filing of the action
Section 267 of the Local Government Code explicitly ordains that no court shall entertain any action assailing the validity of any auction sale without the taxpayer satisfying the deposit requirement, viz.:

Section 267. Action Assailing Validity of Tax Sale. - No court shall entertain any action assailing the validity of any sale at public auction of real property or rights therein under this Title until the taxpayer shall have deposited with the court the amount for which the real property was sold, together with interest of two percent (2%) per month from the date of sale to the time of the institution of the action. The amount so deposited shall be paid to the purchaser at the auction sale if the deed is declared invalid but it shall be returned to the depositor if the action fails.

Neither shall any court declare a sale at public auction invalid by reason of irregularities or informalities in the proceedings unless the substantive rights of the delinquent owner of the real property or the person having legal interest therein have been impaired. (Emphasis supplied)

In Province of Bataan v. Hon. Remigio M. Escalada, Jr.,[24] the Court decreed that the deposit requirement under Section 267 of the Local Government Code is mandatory and jurisdictional. It nonetheless clarified that the failure to deposit does not necessarily result in the dismissal of the case, albeit for a different reason:

In National Housing Authority v. Iloilo City,[25] We explained that the requirement for a deposit is jurisdictional[26] and is an ""ingenious legal device to guarantee the satisfaction of the tax delinquency, with the local government unit keeping the payment on the bid price no matter the final outcome of the suit to nullify the tax sale.""[27] But the requirement only applies to initiatory actions[28] and does not apply to the government or any of its agencies, especially when it is acknowledged to be tax-exempt.[29] And in the case of Beaumont Holdings Corp. v. Reyes,[30] We clarified that the requirement for a deposit is jurisdictional . . .[31]

The taxpayer in Section 267 refers to the '""declarant of the property in a real property tax declaration, who is generally its owner, and his declared property is realty tax delinquent.""[32] The taxpayer in this case is undoubtedly Sunrise whose properties were levied because of its failure to pay the real property taxes due to the Province. Sunrise filed a petition for injunction against petitioners to declare the auction sale void on the ground that it was not duly notified of it.[33] Sunrise did not refute having any outstanding liability for real property taxes. It is also not part of the government or a tax- exempt entity. That being the case, Sunrise should have made a deposit pursuant to Section 267. Sunrise, however, stated in no uncertain terms that it was unable to deposit the amount required under Section 267 in its June 29, 2005 Notice of Dismissal. It even declared that the RTC did not have jurisdiction over the case.[34]

Nonetheless, Sunrise's failure to pay the deposit required under Section 267 shall not result in the dismissal of the case before Us. The RTC refused to require the payment of the deposit from Sunrise. The dismissal of the case will certainly prejudice Gawtee and Cameron...","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated March 20, 2023 and Order dated April 4, 2023 of Branch 207, Regional Trial Court, Muntinlupa City, in Civil Case No. 22-091, as well as the Order dated August 1, 2022 and Resolution dated September 12, 2022 of Branch 114, Metropolitan Trial Court, Muntinlupa City in Civil Case No. MeTC-7454 are all REVERSED.

"G.R. No. 248974, August 07, 2024","HEIRS OF TEODORO TULAUAN, REPRESENTED BY TITO TULAUAN, PETITIONERS, VS. MANUEL MATEO;* MAGDALENA MATEO LORENZO, ASSISTED BY HER HUSBAND, JAIME LORENZO; CAMELIA** HOMES, OWNED AND OPERATED BY COMMUNITIES ISABELA, INC.; AND REGISTER OF DEEDS OF ILAGAN AND SANTIAGO, RESPONDENTS.","The present case stemmed from a Complaint[9] for Annulment of Documents, Reconveyance, and Damages, filed by the petitioners Heirs of Teodoro Tulauan (Heirs of Tulauan) against respondents Manuel Mateo (Manuel), Magdalena, Camella Homes, and the Registry of Deeds of Santiago City (collectively, respondents) before the RTC.

The Complaint alleged that Teodoro Tulauan (Teodoro) was the absolute and registered owner of a parcel of land covered by Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. P-1080 and situated in Santiago, Isabel a (now Santiago City) (subject property). Sometime in the early 1950s, Teodoro left Santiago City and resided in Tuguegarao, Cagayan, for security reasons after receiving death threats from armed men. Nonetheless, he continued to visit his property from time to time and still paid the real estate taxes due thereon.[10]

On May 4, 1953, the Registry of Deeds of Isabela (Registry of Deeds) issued Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-4232 covering the subject property in the name of Manuel. The subject property was thereafter divided into four lots — Lot Nos. 938-A-1 to 938-A-4. Thereafter, Lot No. 938-A-4 was further subdivided into four more lots — Lot Nos. 938-A-4-A to 938-A-4-D. Manuel then sold Lot Nos. 938-A-1, 938-A-2, 938-A-3, 938-A-4-B, and 938-A-4-C to different buyers.[11]

On May 30, 1979, the Registry of Deeds issued TCT No. 118858 covering Lot No. 938-A-4-D in the name of Magdalena.[12]

Later on, one of Teodoro's children discovered that the subject property was being developed by a real estate developer. The Heirs of Tulauan inquired with the Registry of Deeds and they discovered that the title to the subject property under the name of Teodoro was cancelled by virtue of a deed of conveyance, the copy of which was burned when the Registry of Deeds was gutted by fire. Upon verification with the Bureau of Lands, the Heirs further found out that sometime in 1981, a certain Lope H. Soriano presented a deed of conveyance transferring the title to the subject property under his name.[13]

The foregoing antecedents prompted the Heirs of Tulauan, represented by Tito Tulauan, to file the Complaint before the RTC averring that the titles under the names of Manuel and Magdalena were fraudulently issued because the transfers of the ownership of the subject property were based on inexistent documents.[14] They prayed, among others, that Magdalena and Mateo's titles and tax declarations covering the subject property be annulled for being fraudulently issued; that the deed of conveyance allegedly executed on May 4, 1953, be declared null and void; that the Heirs of Tulauan be declared as the true owners of the subject property; and that the corresponding title and tax declaration thereto be issued under their names.[15]

In their respective Answers with Counterclaims, Magdalena[16] and the owner of Camella Homes, CII,[17] both moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the Heirs of Tulauan have no cause of action against them. In addition, Magdalena raised the defense that the action for reconveyance was already barred by prescription and/or laches.[18]","This resolves the two separate Motions for Reconsideration filed by respondents Communities Isabela, Inc. (CII)[1] and Magdalena Mateo Lorenzo (Magdalena), assisted by her husband, Jaime Lorenzo,[2] both of which seek for reconsideration and setting aside of the Court's Decision[3] promulgated on September 7, 2022. The Court granted the Petition for Review on Certiorari[4] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court and reversed and set aside the Decision[5] dated July 31, 2018, and the Resolution[6] dated July 15, 2019, of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 107610 which, in turn, upheld the Orders dated September 16, 2014,[7] and June 20, 2016,[8] in Civil Case No. 36-3826 rendered by Branch 36, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Santiago City.","In the Decision[35] dated September 7, 2022, the Court granted the petition as follows:

WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated July 31, 2018[,] and the Resolution dated July 15, 2019[,] of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 107610 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

Let the records of this case be REMANDED to Branch 36, Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Santiago City. The RTC is ordered to continue with the proceedings and decide the case with dispatch.

SO ORDERED.[36]

The Court ruled that while the Heirs of Tulauan used the word ""fraudulent"" in their complaint, a reading of the allegations therein as a whole would show that the action was indeed based on a purported inexistent document. Corollary thereto, following Article 1410 of the New Civil Code which states that the action or defense for the declaration of the inexistence of a contract does not prescribe, the action for reconveyance filed by the Heirs of Tulauan is imprescriptible.[37]

Accordingly, the Court ordered that the case be remanded to the RTC for the conduct of a full-blown trial to settle the factual issues of laches and whether the respondents are innocent purchasers for value and in good faith. Ultimately, these will determine whether an action for reconveyance is still available as a remedy to the Heirs of Tulauan.[38]","FOR THESE REASONS, the Motions for Reconsideration filed by respondents Communities Isabela, Inc. and Magdalena Mateo Lorenzo are GRANTED. The Decision of the Court promulgated on September 7, 2022, is hereby SET ASIDE. The Decision dated July 31, 2018, and the Resolution dated July 15, 2019, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 107610 are AFFIRMED. The complaint for reconveyance filed by petitioners Heirs of Teodoro Tulauan in Civil Case No. 36-3826 filed before Branch 36, Regional Trial Court, Santiago City is DISMISSED for failure to state a cause of action."

MALLARI,* RESPONDENTS.","Before the Court are consolidated Petitions for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the Decision[2] and Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA) which held that: (a) Ricardo D. Angeles (Angeles), petitioner in G.R. No. 223582 and one of the respondents in G.R. No. 223788, was not illegally dismissed by St. Catherine Realty Corporation, Erwin S. Dizon, Celestino S. Dizon, and Mario B. Mallari (St. Catherine et al.), petitioners in G.R. No. 223788 and respondents in G.R. No. 223582; and (b) Francisco Pacheco, Jr. (Pacheco), another respondent in G.R. No. 223788, was illegally dismissed by St. Catherine et al.

In a Resolution[4] dated November 16, 2016, the Court ordered the consolidation of G.R. Nos. 223582 and 223788.

As narrated by the CA in its June 8, 2015 Decision, the facts are as follows:

Petitioner St. Catherine Realty Corporation (St. Catherine) is a domestic corporation engaged in subdivision development such as the Dizon Estate Subdivision (DES) in San Agustin, San Fernando, Pampanga.

[Angeles] had worked for St. Catherine from March 2001 until June 1, 2010. Throughout his employment; he worked as a driver, marketing staff and later as surveyor/purchaser. On the other hand, [Pacheco] had worked for St. Catherine from August 2006 until June 1, 2010 as landscaper.

Sometime in March 2010, [Angeles and Pacheco] were instructed to canvass the prices of various ornamental plants for landscaping to be planted in DES.

St. Catherine alleged that [Angeles and Pacheco] misrepresented the prices of the ornamental plants which were canvassed at Danbel's Garden as follows:

Qty.

[PHP] 145.00
Believing the foregoing to be the true and correct prices of the needed ornamental plants, St. Catherine directed [Angeles and Pacheco] to purchase the said plants which the duo did on March 24, 2010, shown by Sales Invoice No. 1134 issued by Danbel's Garden, viz:
","Time and again, the Court has explained that under the Labor Code, loss of trust and confidence is a justified cause for dismissal of employees occupying positions of trust and confidence, whether managerial or rank-and-file. Absent substantial evidence that the dismissed employees occupy such positions, their termination on the ground of loss of trust and confidence is illegal and cannot be upheld.
Before the Court are consolidated Petitions for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the Decision[2] and Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA) which held that: (a) Ricardo D. Angeles (Angeles), petitioner in G.R. No. 223582 and one of the respondents in G.R. No. 223788, was not illegally dismissed by St. Catherine Realty Corporation, Erwin S. Dizon, Celestino S. Dizon, and Mario B. Mallari (St. Catherine et al.), petitioners in G.R. No. 223788 and respondents in G.R. No. 223582; and (b) Francisco Pacheco, Jr. (Pacheco), another respondent in G.R. No. 223788, was illegally dismissed by St. Catherine et al.","The Court has also held that in labor cases, the Court may review findings of fact when the labor tribunals and the CA reach conflicting conclusions:

At the outset, it should be emphasized that as a rule, this Court is not a trier of facts and this applies with greater force in labor cases. Hence, factual findings of quasi-judicial bodies like the NLRC, particularly when they coincide with those of the Labor Arbiter and if supported by substantial evidence, are accorded respect and even finality by this Court. But where the findings of the NLRC and the Labor Arbiter are contradictory, as in the present case where the LA and the CA are one in ruling that respondent was illegally dismissed from work while the NLRC ruled otherwise, this Court may delve into the records and examine for itself the questioned findings.[50] (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)

Here, the LA dismissed the complaint[51] of Angeles and Pacheco, while the NLRC ruled that both were illegally dismissed. On the other hand, the CA held that Pacheco was illegally dismissed, while Angeles was not. The labor tribunals and the CA having reached contradictory conclusions, the Court may delve into the records and resolve the factual issues itself.

Under Article 297(c) of the Labor Code,[52] fraud or willful breach by employees of the trust reposed in them by the employer or the latter's duly authorized representative is a just cause for termination of employment. As previously explained by the Court:

The language of Article 282(c) of the Labor Code states that the loss of trust and confidence must be based on willful breach of the trust reposed in the employee by [the] employer. Such breach is willful if it is done intentionally, knowingly, and purposely, without justifiable excuse, as distinguished from an act done carelessly, thoughtlessly, heedlessly[,] or inadvertently. Moreover, it must be based on substantial evidence and not on the employer's whims or caprices or suspicions otherwise, the employee would eternally remain at the mercy of the employer. Loss of confidence must not be indiscriminately used as a shield by the employer against a claim that the dismissal of an employee was arbitrary. And, in order to constitute a just cause for dismissal, the act complained of must be work-related and shows that the employee concerned is unfit to continue working for the employer. In addition, loss of confidence as a just cause for termination of employment is premised on the fact that the employee concerned holds a position of responsibility, trust and confidence or that the employee concerned is entrusted with confidence with respect to delicate matters, such as the handling or care and protection of the property and assets of the employer. The betrayal of this trust is the essence of the offense for which an employee is penalized.[53] (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)

In Colegio San Agustin-Bacolod v. Montaño,[54] the Court laid out the requisites for a valid dismissal on the ground of loss of trust and confidence:

First, the employee must be holding a position of trust; and second, the employer shall sufficiently establish the employee's act that would justify loss of trust and confidence. The act must be characterized as real wherein the facts that brought about the act were clearly established, and that the employee committed the same without any justifiable reason.[55] (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)

To justify a dismissal on this ground, the loss of trust and confidence must be substantial and ""attended by a degree of severity"":

Loss of trust and confidence may be a just cause for termination of employment only upon proof that: (1) the dismissed employee occupied a position of trust and confidence; and (2) the dismissed employee committed ""an act justifying the loss of trust and confidence.""

. . . .

For loss of trust and confidence to be a valid ground for dismissal, it must be substantial, and not arbitrary, whimsical, capricious, and concocted. It demands that a degree of severity attends the employee's breach of trust.[56] (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)

Only substantial evidence is required to justify termination on the ground of loss of trust and confidence.[57] However, the precise degree differs depending on whether the employee occupying a position of trust and confidence is a managerial employee or a rank-and-file employee:

As to the second requisite that there must be an act that would justify the loss of trust and confidence, however, the degree of proof required in proving loss of trust and confidence differs between a managerial employee and a [rank-and-file] employee. The Court already made the distinction between managerial employees and rank-and-file personnel insofar as terminating them on the basis of loss of trust and confidence; thus:

. . . [W]ith respect to rank-and-file personnel, loss of trust and confidence, as ground for valid dismissal, requires proof of involvement in the alleged events in question, and that mere uncorroborated assertions and accusations by the employer will not be sufficient[.][58] (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)

It bears stressing that ""it is not the job title but the nature of the work that the employee is duty-bound to perform which is material in determining whether [the employee] holds a position where greater trust is placed by the employer and from whom greater fidelity to duty is concomitantly expected.""[59]

St. Catherine et al. do not claim that Angeles is a managerial employee. Consequently, his dismissal on the ground of loss of trust and confidence can only be upheld if he was a fiduciary rank-and-file employee.

Fiduciary rank-and-file employees include cashiers, auditors, property custodians, or those who, in the normal exercise of their functions, regularly handle significant amounts of money or property.[60] Whether an employee occupied a position of trust and confidence or was routinely charged with the care and custody of the employer’s money or property, is a factual question.[61]

The LA did not make any factual determination that Angeles regularly handled significant amounts of St. Catherine's money or property, while the CA merely stated that it was ""convinced that [Angeles] occupied a position of trust and confidence,"" as he had ""full control of the information on the prices of goods that he submits to the administration of St. Catherine,"" and ""full control of the means, manner, and terms of the purchase of goods for and in behalf of St. Catherine.""[62] Based on the foregoing, the CA concluded that it is ""safe to assume that [Angeles] is entrusted with confidence with respect to delicate matters such as the handling and protection of the property and assets of St. Catherine.""[63] Absent substantial evidence that Angeles regularly handled significant amounts of St. Catherine's money or property, this assumption is not sufficient to qualify Angeles as a fiduciary rank-and-file employee who could be dismissed for loss of trust and confidence.

Even assuming that Angeles was a fiduciary rank-and-file employee, St. Catherine et al. failed to prove that he committed willful and deliberate acts leading to a loss of trust and confidence.

In an illegal dismissal case, the onus probandi rests on the employer to prove that its dismissal of an employee was for a valid cause.[64]","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition[89] in G.R. No. 223582 is GRANTED, while the Petition[90] in G.R. No. 223788 is DENIED.

On the other hand, in Criminal Case No. II-14655, Batomalaque was accused of violating Section 4(e) in relation to Sections 3(a), 3(h), 4(a), and 10(a) of Republic Act No. 9208, in further relation to Section 5(a) of Republic Act No. 8369,[5] and Sections 5 and 7 of Republic Act No. 7610,[6] otherwise known as the Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act. The accusatory portion of the Information states:

That sometime from the month of November 2008 up to August 2009 in the City of xxxxx, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court; the said accused, by means of deceit and taking advantage of the complaining witness BBB on account of the latter's poverty and lack of education, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously RECRUIT said girl for the purpose of sexual exploitation through cyber sexes; that is, by employing her as a cyber-sex model at the accused's residence inside the latter's locked room wherein the said girl was made to entertain customers over the internet by posing in front of the web camera equipped with video­-conferencing facilities; during which the complainant-female was instructed by the accused [to] perform lascivious and sexual acts alone or with other cyber-sex model her age; such as going naked, licking her partner's penis, having sexual intercourse with another female cyber-sex model by licking the latter's vagina, showing her private parts and such other similar sexual exploitations and pornographic performances as the accused and her internet customers would direct her to do after which the accused would give her [PHP] 100.00 to [PHP] 150.00; to the damage and prejudice of one BBB.

Contrary to law.[7] (Emphasis supplied)

Upon arraignment, Batomalaque, assisted by counsel, pleaded not guilty to both charges. Thus, pre-trial ensued, followed by trial on the merits.","This is an appeal under Rule 122 of the Rules of Court, as amended, seeking to reverse and set aside the Decision[1] dated December 14, 2022 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 01628-MIN.
The assailed issuance affirmed the Decision[2] dated April 30, 2015 issued by Branch x of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of xxxxx City, Lanao del Norte in Criminal Case Nos. II-14654 and 11-14655 which, in turn, found accused-appellant Roxin Grace Batomalaque (Batomalaque) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 4(e) of Republic Act No. 9208,[3] otherwise known as the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003.","The appeal is utterly bereft of merit.

I.

The term ""Trafficking in Persons"" is defined under Section 3(a) of Republic Act No. 9208 as follows:

(a) Trafficking in Persons – refers to the recruitment, obtaining, hiring, providing, offering, transportation, transfer, maintaining, harboring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders by means of threat or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the person, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person for the purpose of exploitation which includes at a minimum, the exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs.

The recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of a child for the purpose of exploitation shall also be considered as ""trafficking in persons"" even if it does not involve any of the means set forth in the preceding paragraph.

Based on the foregoing, the elements of Trafficking in Persons are:

(1)
The act of ""recruitment, transportation, transfer or harbouring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders.""
 	 
(2)
The means used which include ""threat or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the person, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another;"" and
 	 
(3)
The purpose of trafficking is exploitation which includes ""exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs.""[38] (Emphasis supplied.)
In the instant case, the RTC and the CA found that the crimes committed by Batomalaque both fall under Sections 4(a) and (e) of Republic Act No. 9208, viz.:

Section 4. Acts of Trafficking in Persons. – It shall be unlawful for any person, natural or juridical, to commit any of the following acts:

(a) To recruit, transport, transfer; harbor, provide, or receive a person by any means, including those done under the pretext of domestic or overseas employment or training or apprenticeship, for the purpose of prostitution, pornography, sexual exploitation, forced labor, slavery, involuntary servitude or debt bondage;

. . . .

(e) To maintain or hire a person to engage in prostitution or pornography;

In addition, under Section 6(a)[39] of the same law, the crime of Trafficking in Persons becomes qualified when the trafficked person is a child. Tangentially, Section 3(b) of this statute defines a child as ""a person below 18 years of age or one who is over 18 but is unable to fully take care of or protect himself/herself from abuse, neglect, cruelty, exploitation, or discrimination because of a physical or mental disability or condition.""[40]

Guided by the foregoing precepts, the Court puts its imprimatur on the findings and conclusions of the courts a quo, albeit with a modification as to the nomenclature of the crime that was committed against BBB.

The Court notes that while the Information in Criminal Case No. II-14654 alleges the minority of AAA as a qualifying circumstance, nothing of that sort was alleged in the Information in Criminal Case No. II-14655. Thus, while the prosecution was able to establish all of the elements of the crime of Qualified Trafficking in Persons under Republic Act No. 9208 in Criminal Case No. II-14654, Batomalaque could only be found guilty of the crime of Trafficking in Persons in Criminal Case No. II-14655.

After all, Batomalaque is still entitled to the constitutional right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusations against her as stated in the Informations to which she was asked to plead prior to trial.[41] She can be convicted only of the crime alleged in the Informations and duly proven during the trial.[42] Accordingly, even though BBB's minority was proven in the course of the trial, Batomalaque cannot be convicted of the crime of Qualified Trafficking in Persons in Criminal Case No. II-14655 because the former's minority was not alleged in the Information in that case.

At any rate, the evidence adduced by the prosecution demonstrate that as against AAA, Batomalaque (a) committed the acts of recruiting, maintaining, and hiring AAA; (b) by means of taking advantage of his vulnerability as a minor; and (c) for the purpose of prostitution or pornography.

On other hand, as against BBB, Batomalaque (a) committed the acts of recruiting, maintaining, and hiring BBB; (b) by means of taking advantage of her vulnerability as a person, or giving payments or benefits to achieve her consent to perform the debased acts in front of an online audience; and (c) for the purpose of prostitution or pornography.","ACCORDINGLY, the appeal is DENIED for lack of merit. The Decision dated December 14, 2022 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 01628-MIN is hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION as follows:

1.
In Criminal Case No. II-14654, accused-appellant Roxin Grace Batomalaque is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Qualified Trafficking in Persons as defined and penalized under Section 4(a) in relation to Sections 6(a) and 10(c) of Republic Act No. 9208, otherwise known as the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003, and is sentenced to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and to PAY a fine in the amount of PHP 5 million. She is also ORDERED to PAY the minor victim, AAA, the amounts of PHP 500,000.00 as moral damages and PHP 100,000.00 as exemplary damages.

"G.R. No. 219598, August 07, 2024","ARNOLD D. NAVALES, REY C. CHAVEZ, ROSINDO J. ALMONTE, AND ALFONSO E. LAID, PETITIONERS, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","Before the Court are two consolidated Petitions for Review on Certiorari[2] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the Decision[3] and Resolution[4] of the Sandiganbayan that found petitioners Arnold D. Navales (Navales), Rey C. Chavez (Chavez), Rosindo J. Almonte (Almonte), Alfonso E. Laid (Laid), [and William V. Guillen (Guillen)] guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019, as amended.

Petitioners were officials of the Davao City Water District (DCWD). Navales, Chavez, [and Guillen] were members of the Pre-Bidding and Awards Committee-B (PBAC-B), while Almonte was the Division Manager of the DCWD Engineering and Construction Department and Laid, the Assistant General Manager for Administration.[5]

In Board Resolution No. 97-248 adopted on November 21, 1997, the DCWD Board of Directors approved the recommendation of DCWD General Manager Wilfredo A. Carbonquillo (Carbonquillo) to undertake the Cabantian Water Supply System Project with a budgetary cost of PHP 33,200,000.00 and to directly negotiate its initial well drilling phase with Hydrock Wells, Inc. (Hydrock). The phase consisted of the simultaneous drilling of two wells located in Cabantian (the VES 15 Project) and Communal (the VES 21 Project), estimated at PHP 4,000,000.00 each.[6]

On November 24, 1997, the president of Hydrock informed Carbonquillo of the company's willingness to undertake the projects pending DCWD approval to test the availability of water by drilling a pilot hole for electric logging since its crew and equipment were idle.[7]

In Resolution No. 05-97 dated November 25, 1997, the PBAC-B dispensed with the advertisement requirement in the conduct of bidding and instead, invited accredited well drillers to participate in the VES 15 and VES 21 Projects. Of the four drillers invited, only three responded: Hydrock, AMG Drilling, and Drill Mechanics Incorporated (Drill Mechanics). AMG Drilling and Drill Mechanics, however, requested that the projects be implemented on a later date due to unavailability of equipment.[8]

In Resolution No. 06-97 approved on December 16, 1997, the PBAC-B endorsed the matter to the head of the DCWD for approval, with a recommendation to award the project to Hydrock by negotiated contract, taking into account the company's track record, efficiency, and quoted price in relation to the urgency and importance of the projects.[9]

In Resolution No. 98-27 dated February 13, 1998, the DCWD board approved the PBAC-B recommendation and awarded the VES 15 Project at PHP 2,807,100.00 and the VES 21 Project at PHP 2,349,180.00 to Hydrock. On even date, Carbonquillo issued a notice of award to Hydrock.[10]

In 2005, several complaints were filed against petitioners for the following offenses: (1) violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019, for the alleged non-observance of the proper bidding procedure in the VES 21 Project; (2) violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019, for the alleged non-observance of the proper bidding procedure in the VES 15 Project; (3) grave misconduct, grave abuse of authority, dishonesty, and gross negligence in implementing the VES 21 Project; and (3) grave misconduct, grave abuse of authority, dishonesty, and gross negligence in implementing the VES 15 Project.[11] In essence, petitioners were charged with dispensing with the competitive public bidding required by Presidential Decree No. 1594.[12] These complaints proceeded independently.

With respect to the VES 21 Project, an Amended Information was filed against petitioners and several other DCWD officials for violating Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019. The accusatory portion reads:

That sometime in November 1997 to February 1999, and immediately prior or subsequent thereto, in the City of Davao, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the accused WILFREDO A. CARBONILLO, a high-ranking public official, being then the General Manager A, WILFRED GACUS YAMSON and ALFONSO EDEN LAID, both being then Assistant General Manager A, WILLIAM VELASCO GUILLEN, REY CAÑETE CHAVEZ and ARNOLD DOMINGO NAVALES, all being then Department Managers C, and ROSINDO JAPAY ALMONTE, Division Manager C, all of the Davao City Water District (DCWD), Davao City, while in the performance of their official administrative functions as such, conspiring and confederating with each other, acting with evident bad faith and manifest partiality, and committing the offense in relation to office, did then and there willfully, unlawfully[,] and criminally give unwarranted benefit, preference[,] and advantage to Hydrock Wells, Inc., represented by Mr. Roberto Puentespina, with business address at Bolcan Street, Agdao, Davao City by awarding thereto through a negotiated contract, the Well Drilling Project at VES 21 (Alegre's Property) in Communal, Davao City, amounting to Two Million Two Hundred Forty Four Thousand Seven Hundred Eighty Pesos (P2,244,780.00) by passing PBAC-B Resolution No. 05-97 which dispensed with the requirements of open competitive public bidding through advertisement in newspapers of general circulation and by issuing PBAC-B Resolution No. 06-97, to make it appear thereon that there was a failure of public bidding, and to recommend that the project be pursued through a negotiated contract with Hydrock Wells, Incorporated, when all the accused knew fully well that there was no legal basis to declare a failed bidding and to resort to a negotiated contract because no actual open competitive public bidding as required by law was conducted in connection with the awarding of this project, whereupon no three qualified bidders have tendered their respective bids, and that, Hydrock Wells, Inc., was already allowed to start working on the project as early as December 29, 1997 which date was way before the actual completion of the documentation and awarding of the said project considering that the Notice of Award was issued only on February 13, 1998 and the Notice to Proceed was issued only on February 20, 1998.","A violation by public officers of procurement laws will not ipso facto lead to their conviction under Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019, or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act. To convict them for violating the special penal law, the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt not only defects in the procurement, but also all the elements of the crime.[1]","This Court is not unmindful of its rulings that the dismissal of an administrative case does not bar the filing of a criminal prosecution for the same or similar acts subject of the administrative complaint and that the disposition in one case does not inevitably govern the resolution of the other case/s and vice versa. The applicability of these rulings, however, must be distinguished in the present cases.

[. . . .]

[. . .] Unlike in the cases cited by the prosecution, this Court's Decision in the administrative case against Nicolas ruled squarely that he was not guilty of bad faith and gross neglect of duty, which constitute an essential element of the crime under Section 3(e) of [Republic Act] No. 3019. Under the doctrine of stare decisis, such ruling should be applied to the criminal case for violation of Section 3(e), [Republic Act] No. 3019, the facts and evidence being substantially the same.

In fine, absent the element of evident bad faith and gross neglect of duty, not to mention want of proof of manifest partiality on the part of Nicolas, the graft case against him cannot prosper.[35] (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)

In G.R. Nos. 194763–64, the Court categorically ruled that petitioners cannot be held administratively liable for grave misconduct in the absence of evidence establishing corruption, bad faith, or complicity with Carbonquillo in the procurement of the VES 21 Project. Thus:

In the present case, there is no evidence on record that will convincingly establish that petitioners Yamson, Chavez, Navales and Guillen, who were the members of the PBAC-B, conspired or colluded with Carbonquillo and/or each other or with the invited well drillers, or that they schemed to rig the procurement process to favor Hydrock. There is also no evidence showing that they benefited from the procurement of the project. Much less was there any evidence that petitioners Almonte and Laid, who were not even members of the PBAC-B, conspired with their co-petitioners and the other bidding participants in the procurement of the VES 21 Project. Collusion may be determined from the collective acts or omissions of the PBAC-B members and/or contractors before, during and after the bidding process, and the respondents, as complainants, have the burden to prove such collusion by clear and convincing evidence. And while Hydrock eventually benefited from the VES 21 Project, having been awarded the contract, it should be stressed that Hydrock was not the only well driller invited by the PBAC-B to participate in the project. AMG and DMI were likewise invited by the PBAC-B, only that it was Hydrock's acceptable proposal and track record that clinched the award. And even then, the role of the PBAC-B was only to recommend the award of the project to Hydrock. It is DCWD, through its Board of Directors, that has the authority to approve, and has in fact, ultimately decided to award the contract to Hydrock.

What is unmistakable here is that it was Carbonquillo who was predisposed to award the project to Hydrock sans the benefit of any bidding. This is clear from the tenor of his letter to DCWD's Board of Directors already recommending direct negotiation of the project to Hydrock. But to the credit of both the PBAC-B and the Board of Directors, Carbonquillo's recommendation was disregarded, and the PBAC-B proceeded to invite other accredited well drillers. And absent any evidence establishing corruption, bad faith or complicity with Carbonquillo, the petitioners cannot be held liable for grave misconduct or any other grave offense classified under the Civil Service Law. At most, it is only petitioners Yamson, Chavez, Navales and Guillen, as members of the PBAC-B, who should be held individually accountable for their failure to strictly comply with the procurement procedure laid down in [Presidential Decree] No. 1594 and its [Implementing Rules and Regulations], which constitutes Simple Neglect of Duty.[36] (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)

An application of Pahkiat leads to the conclusion that the Court's findings in G.R. Nos. 194763–64 on the administrative charge of grave misconduct may affect the outcome of the present criminal case of graft, the facts and evidence between the two being substantially the same. Specifically, in view of the express ruling that petitioners are not guilty of corruption, bad faith, or gross neglect of duty, which are essential elements of the crime under Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019, the criminal case against them will not prosper in the absence of evidence to establish their guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

That said, even if the Court makes its own assessment of the facts and records of the present criminal case, independent of the findings in the administrative case, petitioners must still be acquitted. Contrary to the conclusions of the Sandiganbayan, the prosecution failed to establish the concurrence of all the essential elements of the crime charged against petitioners. Hence, while the findings of fact of the Sandiganbayan as a trial court are accorded weight and respect, the Court shall not hesitate to reverse the conclusions which are based on a misappreciation of facts relative to applicable law and jurisprudence.[37]

To recall, petitioners were charged with violating Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019, which states:

SECTION 3. Corrupt practices of public officers. — In addition to acts or omissions of public officers already penalized by existing law, the following shall constitute corrupt practices of any public officer and are hereby declared to be unlawful:

. . . .

(e) Causing any undue injury to any party, including the Government, or giving any private party any unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of his official administrative or judicial functions through manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence. This provision shall apply to officers and employees of offices or government corporations charged with the grant of licenses or permits or other concessions.

Accordingly, jurisprudence has laid down the following elements to sustain a conviction under Section 3(e): (1) the offender is a public officer discharging official, administrative, or judicial functions; (2) he or she acted with manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence; and (3) in the discharge of functions, his or her action caused undue injury to any party, including the government, or gave any unwarranted benefits, advantage, or preference.[38]

A judicious review of the case records reveals that while the prosecution established the first element, namely, that petitioners were public officers of the DCWD performing official functions, it failed to prove the presence of the second and third elements beyond reasonable doubt.","FOR THESE REASONS, the Consolidated Petitions for Review on Certiorari are GRANTED. The Decision dated March 26, 2015 and the Resolution dated August 7, 2015 of the Sandiganbayan (Special Third Division) in Criminal Case No. SB-07-CRM-0067, are REVERSED. Petitioners Arnold D. Navales, Rey C. Chavez, Rosindo J. Almonte, Alfonso E. Laid, and William V. Guillen are ACQUITTED for failure of the prosecution to prove their guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

Upon arraignment, Enriquez pleaded not guilty to both charges. Trial ensued.","""The right against unreasonable search and seizure is a facet of the right to privacy, which guards against unreasonable State intrusion into its people's private lives . . . . Thus, [a search warrant's] issuance and subsequent implementation must comply with the necessary requirements for its validity.""[1]

This Court resolves the appeal[2] assailing the Decision[3] of the Court of Appeals affirming with modification the Regional Trial Court's Decision[4] that accused-appellant Lucky Enriquez y Casipi (Enriquez) is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of one count of illegal possession of dangerous drugs, and one count of illegal possession of equipment, instrument, apparatus, and other paraphernalia for dangerous drugs under Sections 11 and 12 of Republic Act No. 9165.","This Court cannot give credence to the prosecution's argument that the sketch attached to the search warrant distinguished the place to be searched. A perusal of the Regional Trial Court's Consolidated Judgment shows that while Search Warrant No. 5368 (2017) was marked by the prosecution as an exhibit during the preliminary conference, the alleged attached sketch map was not included.[52] The Court of Appeals even stated that the ""sketch map is not extant in the record[.]""[53] As such, the courts were unable to verify whether the sketch map was truly attached to the search warrant and if it described the premises to be searched with particularity.

The doubtful existence of the sketch map or its failure to properly identify the premises to be searched is evident in the Regional Trial Court's and the Court of Appeals' recognition that the government agents were only able to locate accused-appellant's house through the confidential informant's assistance.

The Regional Court, in its Consolidated Judgment, stated that:
While the warrant merely states ""Informal Settler's Compound, NIA Road, Barangay Pinyahan, Quezon City,[""] it shall be noted that a sketch of the house was indicated in the Search Warrant. In fact the agents who implemented the search warrant was accompanied by the informant who pinpointed them to the exact location of the house of the accused.[54]
The Court of Appeals, on the other hand, was explicit that the confidential informant's help was vital in leading them to the house:
While the given address may be considered imprecise or non­specific, the agents of the PDEA were able to locate Lucky's house because their informant was with them and the informant knew exactly the location of the premises to be searched. Although the sketch map is not extant in the record, Agent Million nevertheless testified that they were able to locate the house of Lucky through the help of their confidential informant.[55]
The failure to present the sketch map, coupled with the necessity of the confidential informant's assistance, casts serious doubt on whether the address stated in the search warrant met the definiteness or particularity requirement. As such, it is clear that the search warrant issued was so broadly worded that it constituted a general warrant proscribed by the Constitution.[56]

Aside from the search warrant's invalidity, the government agents' execution was tainted with multiple irregularities.","ACCORDINGLY, the appeal is GRANTED. The June 30, 2020 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR H.C. No. 40646 is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

A. Antecedents

To put the present issue and the Court's ruling herein in proper perspective, as will be discussed thoroughly below, it is apt to recall the antecedents that led to the present Petition, as culled from the Court's June 23, 2021 Resolution and the case records.

The case before the MeTC

In an Amended Information dated June 11, 2008, Dr. Agbayani was charged with reckless imprudence resulting in serious physical injuries for allegedly using an unsterilized medical instrument in the operation he conducted on the left knee of private complainant Saul Q. Hofileña, Jr. (Saul).[6] The accusatory portion of the Information reads:
That on or about January 5, 2006, in the City of Manila, Philippines, the said accused, being then the surgeon and/or orthopaedist of complainant Saul Q. Hofileña, Jr., did then and there voluntarily but without malice, conduct an operation (arthroscopy) upon said complainant in a reckless manner by using a medical instrument (arthroscope) that was not sterilized without taking the necessary precaution to avoid injury to said complainant, taking into consideration his employment or occupation and degree of intelligence, causing as a consequence of his said carelessness, recklessness, negligence, imprudence[,] and lack of precaution the said complainant to suffer serious physical injuries on his left knee which rendered him incapacitated for work and/or labor for more than thirty (30) days and in fact said complainant had undergone another operation at St. Luke's Hospital, Quezon City on his left knee to remove the infection introduced by the accused and subsequent operation on his right wrist as a result of walking with a cane for a prolonged period of time, to the damage and prejudice of said Saul Q. Hofileña, Jr.[7]
Dr. Agbayani pleaded not guilty to the crime charged. Thereafter, trial on the merits ensued.[8]

The prosecution presented the following witnesses: (1) Saul; (2) Saul's private secretary, Emilie Valdivia (Valdivia); (3) Dr. Debbie P. Dela Fuente (Dr. Dela Fuente), the clinical and anatomic pathologist who signed the Report containing the findings on the infection sustained on Saul's left knee; (4) Elizabeth S. Hofileña (Elizabeth), wife of Saul; and (5) Christine Marie Javelona Pascual (Pascual), the medical technologist who conducted the test and examination of the specimen taken from Saul.[9]

The prosecution likewise submitted the following documentary exhibits: (i) criminal complaint of Saul, Exhibits ""A"" to ""A-7-B""; (ii) Dr. Agbayani's prescription, Exhibit ""B""; (iii) Reply Affidavit of Saul, Exhibit ""C-C-6-B""; (iv) Supplemental Affidavit of Saul, Exhibit ""D"" to ""D-10-B"" with attachments marked and incorporated thereto as Annexes ""A"" to ""WWWW''; (v) Answer of Dr. Agbayani, together with its Annexes, particularly Annex ""G"" thereof, i.e., the sterilization record, Exhibit ""E"" to ""E-1"";[10] (vi) Medical Center Imus Result/the report signed by Pascual, RMT Medical Technologist and Dr. Dela Fuente, Pathologist, Exhibit ""F""; (vii) Affidavit of Valdivia, Exhibit ""G"" to ""G-2-A"" and ""I""; (viii) Supplemental Affidavit of Valdivia, Exhibit ""H"" to ""H-2-A""; (ix) Logbook of Medical Center Imus, Exhibit ""J"" to ""J-1"" and ""K"" to ""K-1""; (x) Check Voucher, Exhibit ""L"" to ""L-7-A""; (xi) Affidavit of Saul's wife, Exhibit ""M"" to ""M-3"" with attached Annex; and (xii) Affidavit of Pascual, Exhibit ""N"" to ""N-A.""[11]

Saul identified the handwritten findings (marked as Exhibits ""B"" and ""B-1"") which show the diagnosis, as well as the signature of Dr. Agbayani signed in front of him. He likewise identified the admission slips (marked as Exhibits ""C,"" ""C-1,"" ""C-2,"" ""C-3,"" and ""C-4"") which show his confinement at the Manila Doctors Hospital. Other documents identified by Saul include: the sterilization record (Annex ""G"" of Dr. Agbayani's Answer which the prosecution adopted as part of its Exhibits ""E"" and ""E-1""),[12] and a copy of the report signed by Pascual, RMT medical technologist and Dr. Dela Fuente, pathologist (marked as Exhibits ""F"" and ""F-1"").[13]

Saul narrated that Dr. Agbayani first diagnosed him with ""ANTERIOR CRUCIATE LIGAMENT"" (ACL), but after the operation, the latter informed him that he does not have ACL, but rather osteoarthritis and advised him to lose weight. Saul relayed that Dr. Agbayani did not give him any written diagnosis and in fact, it was him who presented the MRI result before he was operated on by the latter. Additionally, Saul alleged that after the operation, Dr. Agbayani gave him antibiotics. Soon after, he visited Dr. Agbayani in his office to complain about the infection. Dr. Agbayani explained to him about the arthroscope device and told him that it was very difficult to sterilize the lens thereof which the former inserted in his knee. Saul admitted that there was no written agreement between him and Dr. Agbayani as to the fact that it was the latter who will personally sterilize the instrument. Nonetheless, Saul averred that Dr. Agbayani stated in a general way that ""I'll take care of everything. I'll see to it that everything is okay.""[14]

Meanwhile, Valdivia testified that she is Saul's secretary since 1995. She narrated that she heard the conversation between Dr. Agbayani and the prosecution, including Dr. Agbayani's answers to the latter's questions.[15]

Dr. Dela Fuente, a clinical and anatomic pathologist with eighteen years of experience and a consultant of Medical Center Imus since 2002, testified that when she signed the Report dated February 23, 2006 (marked as Exhibits ""F"" and ""F-1""), she checked the logbook and confirmed the name of the medical technologist who conducted the test. Dr. Dela Fuente explained that staphylococcus, as mentioned on the Report, is an organism found in several parts of the body, some of which are coagulase negative, while others are coagulase positive. The one that causes diseases is the coagulase positive staph aureus. Dr. Dela Fuente explained that coagulase negative staph aureus is not as invasive, but they can be opportunistic infections, but these days, there are so many species that are also invasive, meaning, they cause so much disease. Heavy growth of coagulase negative staph aureus means that a lot of them are growing in the discharge of the patient. Dr. Dela Fuente attested that findings on her report are true and accurate. When asked by the defense counsel, Dr. Dela Fuente admitted that she did not perform the test on the specimen of Saul; rather, it was only the results that were given to her.[16]

For her part, Elizabeth narrated that the wound on Saul's knee where the arthroscope was inserted became infected with a heavy growth of coagulase negative staphylococcus, per the findings of the Medical Center Imus.[17]

Finally, Pascual testified that there was a positive bacterial growth in the wound discharge that she examined that day and that she was not the one who typed the entries in Exhibit ""F"" (Medical Center Imus Result),[18] albeit it was her findings. She admitted that she was not the one who received the sample she analyzed—since that duty belonged to the personnel in charge of the receiving section—but stated that she was certain that the specimen she examined came from Saul.[19]","This resolves the Petition for Habeas Corpus,[1] under Rule 102 of the Rules of Court, filed on September 8, 2023 by Angeli E. Akabane (Angeli), as the common-law spouse of Dr. Benigno A. Agbayani, Jr., seeking the release of the latter from confinement for allegedly having been deprived of his liberty without due process of law and under a void judgment that has not become final and executory.","The Petition is dismissed.
 
The Petition for Habeas Corpus is the wrong remedy
 

A Petition for Habeas Corpus is a proper remedy for a person illegally deprived of liberty. It exists as a speedy and effective remedy to relieve persons from unlawful restraint.[97] Rule 102, Section 1 of the Rules of Court provides the scope of a writ of habeas corpus, this includes ""all cases of illegal confinement or detention by which any person is deprived of his liberty, or by which the rightful custody of any person is withheld from the person entitled thereto."" Case law holds that the ""primary purpose of the writ 'is to inquire into all manner of involuntary restraint as distinguished from voluntary, and to relieve a person therefrom if such restraint is illegal.' 'Any restraint which will preclude freedom of action is sufficient.'""[98]

Conversely, however, ""if it appears that the person alleged to be restrained of his liberty is in the custody of an officer under process issued by a court or judge or by virtue of a judgment or order of a court of record, and that the court or judge had jurisdiction to issue the process, render the judgment, or make the order,"" the writ shall not be allowed nor the discharge of the person shall be authorized. Neither shall the remedy of a petition for habeas corpus authorize the discharge of a person ""convicted of an offense in the Philippines, or of a person suffering imprisonment under lawful judgment.""[99]

Under Rule 102, Section 2 of the Rules of Court, an application for a writ of habeas corpus may be made through a petition filed before the Court or any of its members, the CA or any of its members in instances authorized by law, or the RTC or any of its presiding judges.

In this case, and as shown by the foregoing factual narrations, Dr. Agbayani was charged with and convicted for the crime of reckless imprudence resulting in serious physical injuries by the MeTC, Branch 13 in Criminal Case No. 052772-CN and was, thus, sentenced to suffer imprisonment of two years of prision correccional minimum, in a Judgment dated July 29, 2013. Dr. Agbayani's subsequent appeal from his conviction was dismissed by the RTC Manila on December 23, 2013.

Moreover, as Angeli herself admitted, and as the records show, the dismissal by the RTC Manila of Dr. Agbayani's appeal was already upheld by the Court in the following: (a) Resolution dated June 23, 2021 denying his Petition for Review on Certiorari; (b) Resolution dated March 16, 2022 denying his Motion for Reconsideration and Supplemental Motion for Reconsideration; and (c) Resolution dated October 3, 2022 which denied his Motion to elevate the case to the Court En Banc and noted without action his Second Motion for Reconsideration. The foregoing Court's rulings had already become final and executory for which reason the MeTC, Branch 13 issued the warrant for his arrest resulting in the subsequent restraint of his liberty.

Under Article 365 of the Revised Penal Code, a person found guilty of reckless imprudence shall suffer the penalty of arresto mayor in its maximum period, which ranges from four months and one day to six months, to prision correccional in its medium period, which ranges from two years, four months, and one day to four years and two months. Meanwhile, Batas Pambansa Bilang 129 vests MeTCs with the exclusive original jurisdiction over all offenses punishable with imprisonment not exceeding six years. Verily, the MeTC, Branch 13 which rendered the July 29, 2013 Judgment against Dr. Agbayani and subsequently issued the Warrant of Arrest upon finality of the Court's rulings denying his Petition had jurisdiction to issue the same. Consequently, the Court is hard-pressed to conclude that the imprisonment of Dr. Agbayani or the restraint in his liberty was tainted with any illegality to justify the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.

In simpler terms, the arrest and detention/incarceration of Dr. Agbayani was the result of a process issued by a court or judge or by virtue of a judgment or order of a court of record which has jurisdiction to issue the same. As a person ""convicted of an offense in the Philippines, or of a person suffering imprisonment under lawful judgment,"" Dr. Agbayani is rightfully held under custody for which the remedy of a writ of habeas corpus cannot lie. It must be stressed that the writ of habeas corpus shall not be allowed, nor the discharge of the person shall be authorized when the person alleged to be restrained of his liberty is convicted of an offense in the Philippines and thus, was suffering imprisonment under lawful judgment.

Moreover, since the Court's Resolutions dated June 23, 2021, March 16, 2022, and October 3, 2022 had already become final and executory and therefore immutable, the legal correctness of the RTC Manila's dismissal of Dr. Agbayani's appeal can no longer be assailed even in the present petition for habeas corpus, the same being an extraordinary remedy the primary purpose of which is to inquire into all manner of involuntary restraint—not the legal correctness of a court's decision.
 
Case law settles that once a judgment lapses into finality, it becomes immutable and unalterable. As such, it may no longer be modified or amended by any court in any manner even if the purpose of the modification or amendment is to correct perceived errors of law or fact. This principle, known as the doctrine of immutability of judgment, is a matter of sound public policy, which rests upon the practical consideration that every litigation must come to an end and to avoid delay in the administration of justice. To be sure, the doctrine recognizes several exceptions, namely: (1) the correction of clerical errors; (2) the so-called nunc pro tunc entries which cause no prejudice to any party; (3) void judgments; and (4) whenever circumstances transpire after the finality of the decision rendering its execution unjust and inequitable.[100]

None of the exceptions apply in this case since Angeli essentially asks the Court to revisit the December 23, 2013 Order of the RTC Manila dismissing Dr. Agbayani's appeal on the ground that it was purportedly issued in violation of Dr. Agbayani's due process rights and, hence, is void. Verily, the perceived nullity of the RTC Manila's Order does not entail mere correction of clerical errors or nunc pro tunc entries nor does it present a circumstance that renders the execution of the MeTC, Branch 13 Judgment unjust and inequitable. Lastly, it bears stressing that the legal correctness of the RTC Manila's dismissal of Dr. Agbayani's appeal for failure to file the memorandum of appeal within the extended period has already been decided by the Court with finality. Thus, the Court's June 23, 2021, March 16, 2022, and October 3, 2022 rulings on this issue constitutes res judicata to the present Petition that essentially challenges the validity and legal correctness of the RTC Manila's dismissal of Dr. Agbayani's appeal.
 
The petition for habeas corpus was filed in violation of the principle of hierarchy of courts
 

Finally, the Petition for Habeas Corpus should have been filed before the lower court pursuant to the principle of hierarchy of courts. The hierarchy principle commands that cases must first be brought before the lowest court with jurisdiction, and not before the higher courts. Petitions for habeas corpus fall under the concurrent jurisdiction of the RTC, the CA, and the Court, and hence, should have been filed before the RTC.
 
Supervening events rendered the present petition for habeas corpus moot and academic
 

On October 27, 2023, Angeli, through counsel, informed the Court via Manifestation and Motion,[101] that Dr. Agbayani passed away on October 5, 2023 at the Jose Reyes Memorial Medical Center. A copy of Dr. Agbayani's Death Certificate[102] was attached to said Motion. Nonetheless, Angeli implores the Court to resolve the petition, despite the apparent mootness, since the unwarranted dismissal of the appeal by the RTC Manila in grave violation of Dr. Agbayani's constitutional due process rights, the situation is of an exceptional character and paramount public interest is involved, the constitutional issue raised requires formulation of controlling principles to guide the bench, the bar, the public, and the case is capable of repetition yet evading review. Angeli reiterated the foregoing arguments in her Compliance[103] filed on December 18, 2023.

A case becomes moot and academic when the conflicting issue that may be resolved ceases to exist as a result of supervening events such that a declaration thereon would be of no practical value.[104] A ""moot and academic"" case is one that ceases to present a justiciable controversy over which courts can exercise judicial power. Thus, as a rule, courts decline jurisdiction over such case, or dismiss it on ground of mootness.[105]

The principle on mootness traces its roots from the express constitutional decree that judicial power—with which the Supreme Court (and all other courts that may be established by law) is vested—includes the duty to ""settle actual controversies"" ""involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable.""[106] While judicial power has been expanded under the present Constitution by including the power to ""determine whether or riot there has been a grave abuse of discretion""[107] on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government, it remains that judicial power must be based on an actual case or controversy at whose core is the existence of a right which is legally demandable and enforceable. Without this core element of actual case or controversy, courts have no jurisdiction to act.[108]

Case law defines actual case or controversy as one ""that is appropriate or ripe for determination, not conjectural or anticipatory, lest the decision of the court would amount to an advisory opinion. The power does not extend to hypothetical questions since any attempt at abstraction could only lead to dialectics and barren legal question and to sterile conclusions unrelated to actualities.""[109]

Because the existence of an actual case or controversy is an indispensable requirement in the exercise of judicial power, courts, including the Court, should be very cautious in conducting a review of an otherwise moot petition. Indeed, ""where an issue is moot on its face, the application of any of the exceptions should be subjected to a strict test because it is a deviation from the general rule. The Court should carefully test the exceptions to be applied from the perspectives both of legality and practical effects and show by these standards that the issue absolutely requires to be resolved.""[110] Consequently, any exception that the Court has recognized to the rule on mootness must be justified only by an implied recognition that a continuing controversy exists.

To be sure, case law recognizes exceptions to the mootness doctrine which permit courts to resolve otherwise moot and academic cases. The exceptions include: (i) grave violation of the Constitution; (ii) exceptional character of the situation and paramount public interest; (iii) when the constitutional issue raised requires formulation of controlling principles to guide the bench, the bar, and the public; and (iv) the case is capable of repetition yet evading review.[111]

Applying the foregoing precepts, the Court finds that the present Petition for Habeas Corpus has been rendered moot by the supervening death of Dr. Agbayani thereby precluding the Court from further exercising its judicial power for lack of a justiciable controversy. Further, and contrary to Angeli's argument, none of the exceptions to the mootness principle are present in this case that would justify continued exercise of the Court's jurisdiction.

In this respect, it bears reiterating that the purpose of a petition for habeas corpus is to seek the relief of persons from unlawful restraint. Verily, the supervening death of Dr. Agbayani in this case effectively relieved him from his incarceration, thus, rendering the petition moot and academic. At any rate, as elsewhere discussed in this Resolution, the arrest and detention/incarceration of Dr. Agbayani was lawful, resulting from a process issued by a court or judge or of a judgment or order of a court of record which has jurisdiction to issue the same. As such, the writ of habeas corpus cannot be allowed since Dr. Agbayani was convicted of an offense in the Philippines and thus, was suffering imprisonment under lawful judgment.

All told, the Petition for Habeas Corpus is dismissed for being the wrong remedy and for violation of the hierarchy of court principle. At any rate, the petition is moot and academic.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Habeas Corpus is DISMISSED."
"G.R. No. 259609, August 07, 2024","PAOLO B. DAVANTES, PETITIONER, VS. C.F. SHARP CREW MANAGEMENT INC., CLAUS-PETER OFFEN TANKSCHIFFREEDEREI (GMBH & CO.) KG, AND/OR MIGUEL ROCHA, RESPONDENTS.","Davantes alleged that he had been working with C.F. Sharp Crew Management Inc. (C.F. Sharp) on behalf of its principal, Claus-Peter Offen Tankschiffreederei (GMBH & Co.) KG, for 20 years and had completed all his employment contracts without any health issues.[6]

On May 13, 2017, Davantes was hired as an able seaman on board vessel BSL Elsa for a tour of duty of one month and covered by the Verdi/IMEC-IBF TCC Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). Before deployment, Davantes underwent a Pre-Employment Medical Examination (PEME) wherein he was found fit to work.[7]

On June 24, 2017, the crew members of BSL Elsa were instructed to undertake an emergency drill under the sweltering heat of the sun. According to Davantes, the drill took a toll on him. He was brought to his cabin for rest. While still feeling dazed, Davantes reported for his duty that midnight. At around 3:00 a.m. of June 25, 2017, Davantes felt his heart beating abnormally fast. Thinking that it was merely fatigue, he finished his duty but he already felt suffocated. Davantes waited until 9:00 a.m. of the same day to report his condition. After assessment by the Master, Davantes was disembarked and brought to a shore-­side clinic in Venezuela. Eventually, he was brought to a hospital since his condition deteriorated. At the hospital, Davantes underwent Coronary Bypass Graft surgery. Thereafter, on July 25, 2017, Davantes was repatriated to the Philippines.[8]

Upon arrival, Davantes was referred to Dr. Robert Lim (Dr. Lim) of Cardinal Santos Medical Center. Several tests were conducted and he was observed to have high white blood cell and platelet count and Anterolateral Wall Ischemia. After four months of treatment, Dr. Lim diagnosed Davantes with ""Myocardial Infarction, Coronary Artery Disease, Hypertension."" As such, Davantes was declared unfit to work. Davantes also consulted his physician of choice, Dr. Antonio C. Pascual (Dr. Pascual) of the Philippine Heart Center, who likewise declared him as unfit to work.[9]

On March 7, 2019, Davantes filed a complaint for total and permanent disability benefits, damages, and attorney's fees against C.F. Sharp.[10] On March 14, 2018, Davantes was given a compensation of USD 20,900.00. However, Davantes claims that the amount of USD 20,900.00, which he already received, is grossly inappropriate to the USD 102,308.00 he claims to be entitled pursuant to the CBA.[11]

For their part, C.F. Sharp averred that Davantes was referred to Marine Medical Services for further evaluation and treatment for his ""S/P Myocardial Infarction; Coronary Artery Disease; Hypertension; S/P Coronary Artery Bypass Graft."" After initial examination, Marine Medical Services observed the following: (1) Davantes had chest pain upon waking up on June 26, 2017; (2) Davantes was previously diagnosed with Hypertension by a private doctor in Marikina; and (3) Davantes is a cigarette smoker and occasionally drinks alcohol. Hence, the company-designated physician gave Davantes a final disability grading of Grade 7 for moderate residual or disorder.[12]

Further, C.F. Sharp narrated that Davantes had previously filed a complaint for disability benefits. The said previous complaint was docketed as NLRC-NCR Case No. 03-04582-18, but was dismissed upon motion of both parties and after they have entered into a settlement agreement. By virtue of the settlement agreement between Davantes and C.F. Sharp, the former received the amount of USD 20,900.00 or equivalent to a Grade 7 disability benefit. Accordingly, Davantes executed a Release of All Rights, Pagpapaubaya sa Lahat ng Karapatan, and Affidavit of Claimant, all of which were dated March 14, 2018. On even date, the LA in NLRC-NCR Case No. 03-04582-18 dismissed the case with prejudice.[13]

To their surprise, Davantes filed another complaint. Thus, C.F. Sharp argues that this later complaint should be dismissed on the ground of res judicata. C.F. Sharp also argues that Davantes is not entitled to disability benefits under the CBA because the latter requires the disability to be caused by an accident, which Davantes failed to allege and prove. Lastly, C.F. Sharp claims that there was concealment on the part of Davantes when he did not declare during his PEME that he had a pre-existing illness or condition.[14]","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] assailing the Decision[2] dated October 20, 2021 and Resolution[3] dated March 7, 2022 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 167172. The CA annulled the Decision dated January 31, 2020 and Resolution dated August 28, 2020 of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) in NLRC LAC CN. (M) 11-000725-19 OFW.[4] The NLRC, in turn, affirmed with modifications the Decision dated August 30, 2019 of the Labor Arbiter (LA) granting petitioner Paolo B. Davantes (Davantes) total and permanent disability benefits in the total amount of USD 98,848.00 based on the Schedule of Disability Compensation in the Verdi/IMEC-IBF TCC Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA).[5]","The Petition has merit.

Preliminarily, the Court notes that the Order dated March 14, 2018 issued by the NLRC dismissed with prejudice a previous claim for disability benefits filed by Davantes.[23] The said dismissal of the previous claim was premised on Davantes's execution of ""Release of All Rights, Pagpapaubaya sa Lahat ng Karapatan, and Affidavit of Claimant,"" all dated March 14, 2018 and issued in favor of respondents.[24]

Quitclaims are generally frowned upon for being contrary to public policy. Nevertheless, the Court has recognized some legitimate waivers that represent a voluntary and reasonable settlement of a worker's claim.[25] In order for a deed of release, waiver or quitclaim pertaining to an existing right to be valid, it must meet the following requirements: (1) that there was no fraud or deceit or coercion on the part of any of the parties; (2) that the consideration for the quitclaim is sufficient and reasonable; and (3) that the contract is not contrary to law, public order, public policy, morals or good customs, or prejudicial to a third person with a right recognized by law.[26]

Here, the Court cannot sustain the validity of the quitclaim. As will be discussed below, there is merit in Davantes's supplication that the settlement amount of USD 20,900.00 is disproportionate to the disability benefits which he should have received.[27]

The following pronouncement of the Court in Manansala v. Marlow Navigation Phils., Inc., et al.[28] is instructive:
As laypersons, seafarers cannot be expected to make completely accurate accounts of their state of health. Unaware of the nuances of medical conditions, they may, in good faith, make statements that turn out to be false. These honest mistakes do not negate compensability for disability arising from pre-existing illnesses shown to be aggravated by their working conditions. However, when a seafarer's proper knowledge of pre­-existing conditions and intent to deceive an employer are established, compensability is negated.[29]
Further explained in Manansala is the conduct of PEME for the seafarers:
Prospective seafarers undergo a pre-employment medical examination (PEME) to determine if they are fit to work. Republic Act No. 8042, as amended, otherwise known as the Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act of 1995, tasks the Department of Health to regulate the operations of clinics conducting PEMEs for migrant workers.

Department of Health Administrative Order No. 2007-0025, which was in effect when petitioner took his PEME, articulated guidelines on PEMEs for seafarers. It identified minimum test requirements, summarized as follows:

As to their source, there are two categories of information obtained in PEMEs. First is information obtained from and colored by the prospective seafarer's opinion, i.e., information on medical history gained from probing questions asked to prospective seafarers and answered by them to the best of their knowledge. Second is information generated by procedures conducted by health professionals.[30]
After the PEME, a prospective seafarer is found either: (1) fit for sea duty; (2) unfit for sea duty; or (3) temporarily unfit for sea duty. While PEME is not an in-depth examination of the actual status of a prospective seafarer's health, it must still fulfill its purpose of ascertaining capacity to safely perform tasks at sea.

Upon finding that the prospective seafarer is fit for sea duty, an employment contract may now be executed.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is GRANTED.

"G.R. No. 263676, August 07, 2024","PEDRO PEQUERO Y NOLLORA, ALIAS ATTY. EPAFRODITO NOLLORA, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","Prosecution's Version of Facts

Sometime in 2005, Ponciano Banjao (Banjao) met Pedro who was supposed to be the lawyer-brother of a security guard named Rolando Pequero (Rolando). It was Pedro who appeared as counsel of Rolando at the Municipal Trial Court (MTC), Taytay, Rizal, and prepared pleadings and signed as ""Atty. Epafrodito Nollora.""[5]

On June 22, 2011, Banjao filed a complaint at the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) – Special Action Unit about this certain Pedro falsely representing himself as a lawyer. Banjao informed Special Investigator Melvin Escurel (SI Escurel) that Pedro had been representing himself publicly as a lawyer and would again appear for a particular case in a trial court in Binangonan, Rizal on October 14, 2011. A team headed by NBI Agent Jerome Bomediano (Agent Bomediano) conducted an entrapment operation on the said date. Pedro was apprehended when he appeared as Atty. Epafrodito Nollora for a particular client at the MTC, where the presiding judge even admonished him for usurpation of authority.[6] SI Escurel then executed a Joint Affidavit of Arrest,[7] which became the basis for the criminal cases against Pedro.

Defense's Version of Facts

Pedro denied the charges against him and averred that he was wrongfully identified as Pedro Pequero y Nollora when in fact he is really Atty. Epafrodito Nollora, without a middle name. Pedro swore that he is truly a lawyer and that a person named Epafrodito Nollora y Ariem is the one who is not a lawyer.[8] It was this Epafrodito Nollora y Ariem, his deceased relative, who had previously used his identity as a lawyer in another case.[9]

Pedro further argued that on the day that he was arrested, he was at the Municipal Assessor's Office of Binangonan, Rizal to pay real property taxes and not for a supposed hearing of a client.[10]","For the Court's consideration is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court filed by Pedro Pequero y Nollora, alias ""Atty.

CR No. 44373, which dismissed Pedro's Petition for Review under Rule 122 of the Rules of Court and affirmed his conviction for the crimes of: (1) use of illegal alias in violation of Section 1, in relation to Section 5, of Commonwealth Act No. 142, as amended by Republic Act No. 6085; (2) use of fictitious name under Article 178, paragraph 1, of the Revised Penal Code; and (3) usurpation of authority or official functions under Article 177, also of the Revised Penal Code.","The instant Petition for Review on Certiorari is partially meritorious.

It bears stressing at the very outset that the core issue raised in the present petition is a question of fact. Pedro insists that he is really Atty. Epafrodito Nollora. The Court has stressed, in a plethora of cases, that questions of fact, which would require a re-evaluation of the evidence, are inappropriate under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. The jurisdiction of the Court under Rule 45, Section 1 is limited only to errors of law as the Court is not a trier of facts.[25] While there are recognized exceptions to this rule,[26] none of which was established in this case. The Court, therefore, finds no reason to review the findings of fact of the MTC, RTC, and the CA.

The facts established in this case are as follows:

1.
Pedro's registered name at birth is Pedro Pequero y Nollora and not Atty. Epafrodito Nollora.[27]
 	 
2.
Pedro continually and publicly used the alias ""Atty. Epafrodito Nollora"" and represented himself as a lawyer.[28] The prosecution presented several documents at the MTC where he purported himself to be Atty. Epafrodito Nollora who was also the supposed counsel of clients filing the same, thus:
 	 	 

(a)
Notarized Plaridel Bail Bond No. 59270 dated [October 24, 2011];
 	 	 

(b)
Notarized Waiver of Appearance dated [October 24, 2011];
 	 	 

(c)
Notarized Commitment to Renew Bail Bond dated [October 24, 2011];
 	 	 

(d)
Notarized Undertaking dated [October 24, 2011];
 	 	 

(e)
Certificate of Detention of Pedro Pequero dated [October 21, 2011];[29]
 	 
3.
On October 14, 2011, an entrapment operation was conducted by the NBI operatives. He was caught representing as a counsel for a client in a case before the MTC of Binangonan, Rizal.[30]
 	 
4.
Pedro also filed several pleadings at the MTC where he signed as Atty. Epafrodito Nollora.[31] As found by the CA, these are the pleadings filed with the Court wherein Pedro signed as Atty. Epafrodito Nollora:
 	 	 

(a)
Motion for Postponement dated February 24, 2012;
 	 	 

(b)
Reply to the Opposition of the Offended Party to the Accused Motion for Reinvestigation dated [April 2, 2012];
 	 	 

(c)
Motion to Quash dated [August 18, 2012];
 	 	 

(d)
Manifestation and Motion dated [June 19, 2013];
 	 	 

(e)
Motion for reconsideration dated 19 June 2013; and
 	 	 

(f)
Supplemental Manifestation and Motion dated [October 29, 2013].[32]
5. Per Certification of the Office of the Bar Confidant, there is only one Epafrodito Nollora who was admitted to the Philippine Bar, and the said Epafrodito Nollora already died on May 19, 1986.[33]

6. Pedro illegally assumed the identity of the deceased Atty. Epafrodito Nollora and stood as a lawyer for supposed clients.[34]

From the foregoing established facts, the Court agrees with the courts a quo that Pedro is guilty of use of illegal alias under Commonwealth Act No. 142, as amended by Republic Act No. 6085.

Section 1 of Commonwealth Act No. 142, as amended reads:

Section 1. Except as a pseudonym solely for literary, cinema, television, radio or other entertainment purposes and in athletic events where the use of pseudonym is a normally accepted practice, no person shall use any name different from the one with which he was registered at birth in the office of the local civil registry, or with which he was baptized for the first time, or, in case of an alien, with which he was registered in the bureau of immigration upon entry; or such substitute name as may have been authorized by a competent court: Provided, That persons, whose births have not been registered in any local civil registry and who have not been baptized, have one year from the approval of this act within which to register their names in the civil registry of their residence. The name shall comprise the patronymic name and one or two surnames.

In this case, Pedro's alleged alias, ""Atty. Epafrodito Nollora,"" was used not for literary, cinema, television, radio, or entertainment purposes and in athletic events but to represent himself as a lawyer to the prejudice of the believing public. Pedro, likewise, had no authority to use the alias. Records are bereft of any showing that Pedro was legally authorized to use other names than his name registered at birth in the civil registry.[35]

Pedro is also guilty of the crime of use of fictitious name to cause damage.

At the outset, the MTC, the RTC and the CA convicted Pedro of the crime of use of fictitious name to cause damage under Article 178 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Presidential Decree No. 38,[36] which states:

Article 178. Using fictitious name and concealing true name. The penalty of prision correccional shall be imposed upon any person who shall publicly use a fictitious name for the purpose of concealing a crime, evading the execution of a judgment or causing damage.

Any person who conceals his true name and other personal circumstances shall be punished by arresto mayor.

The prosecution was able to establish that Pedro publicly used the name ""Atty. Epafrodito Nollora,"" which is not his real and registered name at birth. Although strictly speaking, it is not a fictitious name as there was a real Atty. Epafrodito Nollora, the real Atty. Nollora had long been dead. By using the name and assuming the identity of the deceased, Pedro was successful in using a fictitious name which caused damage to the public, especially his paying clients who believed that they were being represented by a true and genuine lawyer.

It bears stressing at this point, that the MTC, the RTC, and the CA correctly convicted Pedro of violating the 1st paragraph of the above-quoted provision of the Revised Penal Code (use of fictitious name to cause damage) and imposed upon him the penalty of arresto mayor against Pedro. While it may seem that the courts a quo erred in imposing the penalty of arresto mayor considering that the proper penalty for violating the 1st paragraph of the above-quoted provision is prision correccional, Article 178 of the Revised Penal Code had already been amended by Republic Act No. 10951,[37] particularly Section 29 thereof, viz.:

Section 29. Article 178 of the same Act is hereby amended to read as follows:

Article 178. Using fictitious name and concealing true name. - The penalty of arresto mayor and a fine not to exceed One hundred thousand pesos ([PHP] 100,000.00) shall be imposed upon any person who shall publicly use a fictitious name for the purpose of concealing a crime, evading the execution of a judgment or causing damage.

Any person who conceals his true name and other personal circumstances shall be punished by arresto menor or a fine not to exceed Forty thousand pesos ([PHP] 40,000.00).

Such amendment has retroactive application to the instant case per Section 100,[38] Republic Act No. 10951, as it is favorable to Pedro. While under the first paragraph of Article 178 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Presidential Decree No. 38, (i.e., prior to its amendment by Republic Act No. 10951) any person who is found using a fictitious name to cause damage is to be penalized with a prison term of prision correccional, the penalty imposed by the amendment introduced by Republic Act No. 10951, which is a prison term of arresto mayor is shorter than that of prision correccional. Thus, the latter should be applied as it is favorable to Pedro. Hence, the prison term of arresto mayor imposed by the MTC, as affirmed by the RTC, and the CA is proper. The penalty of fine in the amount of PHP 500.00 is retained.

Anent Pedro's guilt for the crime of usurpation of authority or official functions under Article 177[39] of the Revised Penal Code, the Court finds it necessary to reverse the MTC, RTC, and CA's Decisions, and acquit Pedro of the said crime.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is PARTIALLY GRANTED. The Joint Decision of the Municipal Trial Court in Criminal Case Nos. 11-252, 11-253 and 11-254, as affirmed by the Regional Trial Court and the Court of Appeals in its Decision dated March 23, 2022 and Resolution dated September 19, 2022 in CA-G.R. CR No. 44373, is MODIFIED in that: (i) in Criminal Case No. 11-253 for use of fictitious name, Pedro Pequero y Nollora is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of use of fictitious name (Article 178, Paragraph 1 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 10951) and is hereby sentenced to imprisonment of four months of arresto mayor, including all its accessory penalty as prescribed by law and to pay a FINE of PHP 500.00, with subsidiary imprisonment for nonpayment; and (ii) in Criminal Case No. 11-254 for usurpation of authority or official function, Pedro Pequero y Nollora is ACQUITTED of the crime of usurpation of official functions as defined and penalized under Article 177 of the Revised Penal Code."
"G.R. No. 264746, August 07, 2024","MARCELINA VILLANUEVA, DOING BUSINESS UNDER THE NAME AND STYLE ""VEDGE TRADING"", PETITIONER, VS. COCA-COLA BOTTLERS PHILS., INC., JONATHAN ERASGA, BENJAMIN I. DEQUINA, JR., ALLAN D. EVANGELISTA, AND EUGENIO D. EVANGELISTA, RESPONDENTS.","Coca-Cola is a corporation engaged in the production, manufacture, distribution, and sale of softdrinks and other related products.[7]

On November 26, 2012, Coca-Cola filed with the RTC a Complaint[8] for collection of a sum of money against Marcelina, docketed as Civil Case No. 12-1152.

Coca-Cola averred that it entered into a dealership agreement[9] with Marcelina, who was doing business under the name and style, ""Vedge Trading.""[10] Through the dealership agreement, Vedge Trading was given an exclusive area with a number of outlets where it could distribute or sell Coca-Cola products.[11] Coca-Cola also opened a credit line for Vedge Trading.[12] Thus, Coca-Cola products were delivered to Vedge Trading,[13] subject to the payment term of seven days from billing day.[14] As proof of the delivery of its products, Coca-Cola presented several delivery invoices[15] and a statement of account,[16] among others.

Supposedly, Vedge Trading incurred past due accounts with Coca-Cola for the period of May 23, 2010 to June 21, 2010 in the total amount of PHP 649,316.00, exclusive of interests and penalties.[17] Coca-Cola sent several demand letters[18] to Marcelina, but the outstanding debt remained unpaid.[19] Thus, it filed its Complaint against Marcelina to collect the debt.

Marcelina denied knowledge of any dealership agreement with Coca-Cola.[20] While she admitted that she registered a business in the name of ""V.E.D.G.E. Trading"" with the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI),[21] she asserted that it was her nephews Allan, Dequina, Erasga, and Eugenio, who managed the business. Marcelina thus filed her Third Party Complaint[22] against her nephews, insisting that they are the ones who must be held liable for the delivered yet unpaid products of Coca-Cola.

Marcelina particularly testified[23] that her nephews enticed her to finance and invest in the business of trading, distributing, or selling softdrinks. However, Dequina and Erasga were both sales representatives of Coca-Cola. As such, they were prohibited from engaging in a dealership with Coca-Cola.[24] Marcelina thus agreed to be the registered owner of ""V.E.D.G.E. Trading,"" which stood for her and her nephews' surnames, i.e., Villanueva, Erasga, Dequina, and Evangelista.[25] Resultantly, on August 18, 2009, the DTI issued a Certificate of Business Name Registration[26] to Marcelina as the registered owner of ""V.E.D.G.E. Trading.""

According to Marcelina, she gave her nephews a total of PHP 325,000.00 as capital for the business, but she never received any profits or returns for her investment. She maintained that she had no participation in the business, and that Erasga was the operations manager of Vedge Trading while Allan, Dequina, and Eugenio were the sales representatives. Supposedly, on March 13, 2010, she appeared before Barangay Daniel Fajardo, Las Piñas City[27] and declared before the Barangay Chairperson that from then on, she was ""severing [her] ties and partnership with the Third party defendants.""[28] Further, on December 12, 2012, she executed an Affidavit of No Operation,[29] stating that Vedge Trading ""did not operate since year 2010[.]"" Thus, on December 18, 2012, the City Treasurer of Las Piñas issued a Certification,[30] stating that Vedge Trading ""has ceased its operation and officially retired effective December 18, 2012[.]""

On cross-examination, Marcelina stated that she visited the warehouse of Vedge Trading every afternoon to see what was happening in its operations.[31] She also admitted that Allan, Dequina, and Eugenio were mere employees of Vedge Trading.[32]

Meanwhile, Allan, Dequina, and Eugenio denied liability for the claims of Coca-Cola supposedly because they were mere employees of Vedge Trading.[33] Allan particularly testified that: Erasga and Marcelina put up Vedge Trading in 2009; Erasga was the one who managed the business; Allan sold Coca-Cola products and remitted the proceeds of the sale to Erasga; and he frequently saw Marcelina at the warehouse of Vedge Trading together with Erasga, and that he often heard the two discussing the finances of Vedge Trading.[34] Similarly, Eugenio mentioned that: while he usually remitted to Erasga the payments for the Coca-Cola products that he had sold, he once remitted purchase payments to Marcelina; and Erasga managed the business, but Eugenio often saw him together with Marcelina at the business' bodega or warehouse.[35]

As to Erasga, he did not file his answer to the Third Party Complaint despite service of Summons[36] and Alias Summons.[37] Thus, upon Motion[38] of Marcelina, the RTC issued its Order[39] dated February 6, 2017, declaring Erasga in default.","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] (Petition) under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court seeking a reversal of the Decision[2] dated February 18, 2022, and Resolution[3] dated December 6, 2022 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 112750. The CA reversed the Decision[4] dated December 28, 2018 of Branch 141, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Makati City in Civil Case No. 12-1152 that dismissed the Complaint[5] dated November 15, 2012 (Complaint) for collection of a sum of money filed by respondent Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc. (Coca-Cola) against petitioner Marcelina Villanueva (Marcelina), as well as the Third Party Complaint[6] dated May 6, 2013 (Third Party Complaint) filed by Marcelina against third party defendants Jonathan Erasga (Erasga), Benjamin I. Dequina, Jr. (Dequina), Allan D. Evangelista (Allan), and Eugenio D. Evangelista (Eugenio) (collectively, third party defendants), both on the ground of lack of cause of action.","The Court affirms the CA Decision with modification. Marcelina is liable to Coca-Cola for the entire unpaid obligation. However, the Court finds that Marcelina and Erasga entered into an unregistered partnership; thus, after paying the debt, Marcelina may claim from Erasga the reimbursement of his pro rata share in the debt to Coca-Cola.

Coca-Cola and Vedge Trading entered into a dealership agreement. Thus, Coca-Cola is entitled to collect payments for its delivered yet unpaid products
Marcelina argues that the dealership agreement was not sufficiently proven because the written contract between the parties was never presented in court. The Court disagrees.

While a written dealership agreement between Coca-Cola and Vedge Trading was never presented during trial, the Court finds that the existence and execution of the contract was sufficiently established.

The delivery invoices[62] presented by Coca-Cola uniformly state that the customer, Vedge Trading, agrees that all its ""purchases from [Coca-Cola] shall be paid on the due date."" With the transaction, Vedge Trading was authorized to sell Coca-Cola products to outlets within a defined territory.

The dealership agreement in question is therefore a contract of sale of goods,[63] whereby Coca-Cola, as seller, sold its products in bulk or wholesale to Vedge Trading, for a price certain to be paid at a later date, so that the latter may re-sell the products to other outlets.

Significantly, there is nothing in the Civil Code which requires the contract of sale between Coca-Cola and Vedge Trading to be in written form. Instead, the Court has consistently held that a contract of sale of goods, as in the case at bar, is perfected by mere consent.[64] There is therefore no merit in Marcelina's argument that the non-presentation of the purported written dealership agreement was fatal to Coca-Cola's cause.

The Court is aware that under the Statute of Frauds in Article 1403,[65] paragraph 2(d) of the Civil Code, an agreement for the sale of goods at a price not less than five hundred pesos is unenforceable. However, the Statute of Frauds applies only to executory and not to completed, executed, or partially executed contracts.[66] In this regard, the Court has ruled that when the seller in a contract of sale has complied with its obligation to deliver the goods, the contract is considered partially executed or performed; thus, the Statute of Frauds will not apply.[67]","WHEREFORE, the Decision dated February 18, 2022 and Resolution dated December 6, 2022 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 112750 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION, in that:

COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, RESPONDENT.","Petitioner MGI is a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the Philippines.[6] It is registered as a Renewable Energy (RE) Developer of the 20 MW Maibarara Geothermal Power Generation Project in Batangas and Laguna under Certificate of Registration No. GRESC 2011-01-025 issued by the Department of Energy (DOE) and Certificate of Registration No. 2011-006 issued by the Board of Investments (BOI).[7] MGI is also a registered VAT taxpayer with the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) under Certificate of Registration No. OCN3RC0000483772 and Taxpayer's Identification Number (TIN) 007-843-328-000.[8]

MGI filed with the Revenue District Office No. 43A in Pasig City four administrative claims for the refund of its alleged unutilized input VAT attributable to zero-rated sales for the four quarters of TY 2013, thus:

The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) failed to act on said administrative claims for refund filed by MGI. Thus, MGI filed various petitions for review before the CTA, docketed as CTA Case Nos. 9119, 9201, 9254 and 9336 on August 18, 2015, November 16, 2015, February 5, 2016, and April 25, 2016, respectively.[10]","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the Decision,[2] dated November 26, 2020, and the Resolution,[3] dated June 2, 2021, of the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) En Banc (EB) in CTA EB No. 2111 (CTA Case Nos. 9119, 9201, 9254, and 9336). The CTA EB affirmed the Decision,[4] dated March 4, 2019, and the Resolution,[5] dated July 9, 2019, of the CTA Special First Division (CTA Division) in CTA Case Nos. 9119, 9201, 9254, and 9336, which denied Maibarara Geothermal, Inc.'s (MGI) claim for tax refund/credit of unutilized input value-added taxes (VAT) for the first, second, third, and fourth quarters of taxable year (TY) 2013.","The issues raised in the Petition are whether MGI is an entity engaged in zero-rated sales and whether it may claim a tax refund in the amount of PHP 81,572,707.81 for creditable input tax attributable to zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sales, pursuant to Section 112(A) of the NIRC.

To resolve the foregoing, this Court must re-examine the facts and the evidence offered by MGI in the courts below. It is an accepted doctrine that this Court is not a trier of facts. It is not its function to review, examine, and evaluate or weigh the probative value of the evidence presented.[55]

MGI argues, however, that certain exceptions to this rule exist in this case such that this Court should nonetheless review the CTA's findings of fact. Specifically, MGI argues that the CTA's ruling was tainted with grave abuse of discretion and its judgment was based on a misapprehension of facts.[56]

Thus, MGI asks this Court to make its own appreciation of the documents it submitted to establish its alleged zero-rated sales, particularly Official Receipt No. 0501, which was deemed illegible by the CTA EB.[57] It also reiterates its contention before the CTA EB that it had already established the existence of its zero-rated sales for the first quarter of 2014 in another case decided by the CTA EB, where refund of its input VAT incurred in TY 2012 was granted.[58] Finally, it insists that a DOE Certificate of Endorsement is not necessary to avail of the incentives under Republic Act No. 9513.

The Court disagrees with MGI. It finds no exceptions to the general rule, that this Court will not review findings of fact, obtaining in this case.

MGI alleges that the CTA EB committed grave abuse of discretion in issuing its Decision and that its judgment was based on a misapprehension of facts. However, the Court finds that MGI's Petition failed to support these allegations. It has neither shown that the CTA EB acted capriciously or whimsically in issuing its ruling, nor has it demonstrated that the CTA EB misapprehended the facts of the case. A party filing the petition has the burden of showing convincing evidence that the appeal falls under one of the exceptions. A mere assertion is not sufficient.[59]
 
MGI has complied with the statutory requirements to qualify its transactions for zero-rating	 

The first issue is whether MGI has proven that it is engaged in zero­-rated sales under Republic Act No. 9513 and its IRR, such that it qualifies for VAT zero-rating under Section 108(B)(7) and may claim a refund of input VAT under Section 112(A) of the NIRC.

Section 108(B)(7) of the NIRC reads as follows:
Sec. 108. Value-added Tax on Sale of Services and Use or Lease of Properties. –

. . . .

(B) Transactions Subject to [0%] Rate. — The following services performed in the Philippines by VAT-registered persons shall be subject to [0%] rate:

. . . .

(7) Sale of power or fuel generated through renewable sources of energy such as, but not limited to, biomass, solar, wind, hydropower, geothermal, ocean energy, and other emerging energy sources using technologies such as fuel cells and hydrogen fuels. (Emphasis supplied)
If an entity is engaged in zero-rated transactions, there is no output tax that can be credited against its input tax. Thus, said entity is allowed to obtain a credit/refund of input taxes attributable to zero-rated transactions. Section 112(A) of the NIRC provides as follows:
SEC. 112. Refunds or Tax Credits of Input Tax. —

(A) Zero-rated or Effectively Zero-rated Sales. — Any VAT­-registered person, whose sales are zero-rated or effectively zero-rated may, within two [] years after the close of the taxable quarter when the sales were made, apply for the issuance of a tax credit certificate or refund of creditable input tax due or paid attributable to such sales, except transitional input tax, to the extent that such input tax has not been applied against output tax: Provided, however, [t]hat in the case of zero-rated sales under Section 106(A)(2)(a)(1), (2) and (B) and Section 108(B)(1) and (2), the acceptable foreign currency exchange proceeds thereof had been duly accounted for in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP): Provided, further, [t]hat where the taxpayer is engaged in zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sale and also in taxable or exempt sale of goods or properties or services[] and the amount of creditable input tax due or paid cannot be directly and entirely attributed to any one of the transactions, it shall be allocated proportionately on the basis of the volume of sales. (Emphasis supplied)
As pointed out by the CTA EB, this Court, in the case of San Roque, has broken down the foregoing provision and specified the requirements for a claim for refund/tax credit[60] thereunder to prosper:
To claim refund or tax credit under Section 112(A), petitioner must comply with the following criteria: (1) the taxpayer is VAT registered; (2) the taxpayer is engaged in zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sales; (3) the input taxes are due or paid; (4) the input taxes are not transitional input taxes; (5) the input taxes have not been applied against output taxes during and in the succeeding quarters; (6) the input taxes claimed are attributable to zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sales; (7) for zero-rated sales under Section 106(A)(2)(1) and (2); 106(B); and 108(B)(1) and (2), the acceptable foreign currency exchange proceeds have been duly accounted for in accordance with BSP rules and regulations; (8) where there are both zero-­rated or effectively zero-rated sales and taxable or exempt sales, and the input taxes cannot be directly and entirely attributable to any of these sales, the input taxes shall be proportionately allocated on the basis of sales volume; and (9) the claim is filed within two years after the close of the taxable quarter when such sales were made.[61] (Emphasis supplied)
In question in the present case is whether MGI complied with the second and ninth requirements. The presence of zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sales is critical for the fulfillment of the ninth requirement, as it is from the close of the taxable quarter when such sales were made that the two-­year prescriptive period is reckoned.

As to the second requirement, MGI argues that a Certificate of Endorsement from the DOE is not indispensable for an RE Developer to avail of the incentive of VAT zero-rating under Republic Act No. 9513.[62] MGI contends that Section 15(g) of said law only requires that the taxpayer be certified as an RE Developer by the DOE, and it has complied with this requirement, as evidenced by its Certificate of Registration No. GRESC 2011-01-025.[63] Moreover, a Certificate of Endorsement from the DOE is only required to avail of the incentives under Section 15(b) of Republic Act No. 9513, i.e., duty free importation of RE machinery, equipment, and materials and the sale, transfer, or disposition of such imported capital machinery, equipment, and materials.[64]

Section 15(b) of Republic Act No. 9513 reads as follows:
Sec. 15. Incentives for Renewable Energy Projects and Activities. – RE developers of renewable energy facilities, including hybrid systems, in proportion to and to the extent of the RE component, for both power and non-power applications, as duly certified by the DOE, in consultation with the BOI, shall be entitled to the following incentives:

[. . . .]

(b) Duty-free Importation of RE Machinery, Equipment and Materials – Within the first ten [] years upon the issuance of a certification of an RE developer, the importation of machinery and equipment, and materials and parts thereof, including control and communication equipment, shall not be subject to tariff duties: Provided, however, [t]hat the said machinery, equipment, materials[,] and parts are directly and actually needed and used exclusively in the RE facilities for transformation into energy and delivery of energy to the point of use and covered by shipping documents in the name of the duly registered operator to whom the shipment will be directly delivered by customs authorities: Provided, further, [t]hat endorsement of the DOE is obtained before the importation of such machinery, equipment, materials[,] and parts are made.","FOR THESE REASONS, the instant Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED.

UNTALAN [(Untalan)], CRISANTO C. CANDO [(Crisanto)], RONEL RELUCIO [(Relucio)], GERARDO CANDO, JR. [(Cando)], DIONISIO SALAZAR [(Salazar)] and MARIO M. CALPITO [(Calpito)] that she could secure for them jobs in Guam, and as a result of such enticement, said [Untalan], [Crisanto], [Relucio], [Cando], [Salazar] and [Calpito] who were interested to have such employment, gave and delivered to [accused-appellant] the total sum of FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED [(PHP 460,500.00)] PESOS, Philippine Currency, representing processing and placement fees in connection thereof, to the latter's damage and prejudice as they were not able to get job in Guam through no fault of their own as promised by [accused-appellant], who likewise failed to reimburse to herein complainants the aforementioned amount despite repeated demands; that considering that there are three or more complainants prejudiced by the unlawful acts of [accused-appellant], the same is deemed committed [in] large scale and considered an offense involving economic sabotage.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[4]
Upon arraignment, accused-appellant pleaded not guilty to all the charges. Pre-trial and trial then ensued. The prosecution presented the following as witnesses: private complainants Calpito, Cando, Salazar, Untalan, Alicia Zulueta (Zulueta), and Untalan's wife, Leonora Untalan (Leonora). The CA summarized the prosecution's evidence as follows:
On different occasions, private complainants were recruited by [accused-appellant] to work in Guam for a fee.","Before the Court is an ordinary appeal[1] filed by accused-appellant Sonia Valle y Lapurga (accused-appellant) assailing the Decision[2] (CA Decision) dated July 28, 2017 of the Court of Appeals – Manila, Special Fifteenth Division (CA) in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 08412. In the questioned CA Decision, the CA affirmed the Joint Decision[3] dated December 4, 2015 of Branch 27, Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Cabanatuan City, in Criminal Case Nos. 10490 to 10493 and 12468 to 12474, convicting accused-appellant for one (1) count of illegal recruitment in large scale and four (4) counts of estafa.","The appeal is partly meritorious. The Court acquits accused-appellant on the charge of illegal recruitment in large scale but affirms the convictions for estafa.

""To prove illegal recruitment two elements must be shown, namely: (1) the person charged with the crime must have undertaken recruitment activities, or any of the activities enumerated in Article 34 of the Labor Code, as amended; and (2) said person does not have a license or authority to do so.""[17] Both the RTC and the CA found that the said elements are present in this case. The Court, however, disagrees with regard to the presence of the second element.

The Court has previously emphasized that ""non-possession of a license to recruit is an essential ingredient of the crime of illegal recruiting.""[18] A negative fact that is an element of an offense, such as the non-possession of a license, needs to be positively proved by the prosecution.[19] As with all criminal cases, the burden of proof is entirely and solely on the prosecution. ""This is the essence of the presumption of innocence; the accused need not even do anything to establish his [or her] innocence as it is already presumed.""[20] The prosecution in this case, however, failed to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that accused-appellant is a non-licensee.

As noted by the CA, the prosecution did not submit as evidence any certification from the POEA that accused-appellant is not a licensee. In previous cases involving illegal recruitment, the Court has consistently used the POEA certification as evidence of the second element of illegal recruitment.[21] The CA in this case nevertheless upheld the conviction by saying that accused-appellant herself admitted to the lack of certification.[22] The Court notes, however, that accused-appellant's testimony—which was considered by the CA as an admission—was to the effect that her sister's recruitment agency was licensed and that she had no connection with the said agency. Contrary to the CA's understanding, this was not an admission that she herself was not licensed. To recall, her entire defense was that she did not recruit private complainants at all. Therefore, the context of her statement was that it is true that she has a sister who was working at a licensed recruitment agency. It was not, however, an admission that she undertook recruitment activities while not being a licensee.

Hence, there is nothing in the record of this case that supports the second element beyond a reasonable doubt. Accused-appellant must perforce be acquitted of the illegal recruitment charge.

Accused-appellant's acquittal from the illegal recruitment case, however, does not automatically result in her acquittal in the estafa cases.

The crimes of illegal recruitment and estafa, while intertwined in many cases of recruitment, have different elements. The penal law on illegal recruitment was enacted specifically as a deterrent to those who conduct recruitment activities without having been previously vetted by the government. It is the commission of acts considered by the law as recruitment activities without possessing the necessary government license or permit which is the essence of the crime. Thus, in previous cases, the Court classified illegal recruitment as malum prohibitum,[23] where intent to deceive, for instance, is immaterial. As a result, even those who are actually capable of sending workers abroad for employment—if their licenses or permits have already expired—may still be liable for illegal recruitment.

On the other hand, the thrust of estafa under Article 315(2)(a) of the Revised Penal Code is broadly to punish those who use deceit such as false pretenses in order to gain something and to cause damage to another. Thus, the elements of the crime of estafa are as follows:
(a) there must be a false pretense, fraudulent act or fraudulent means;

(b) such false pretense, fraudulent act or fraudulent means must be made or executed prior to or simultaneously with the commission of the fraud;

(c) the offended party must have relied on the false pretense, fraudulent act or fraudulent means, that is, he or she was induced to part with his or her money or property because of the false pretense, fraudulent act or fraudulent means; and

(d) as a result thereof, the offended party suffered damage.[24]
In accused-appellant's case, she made false representations that she had the capability to send private complainants to Guam for work. Because private complainants or their relatives had personal relationships with her—with many of them considering her their ""kumare"" according to their testimonies—private complainants believed and relied on her representations. It was thus accused-appellant's false promises and misrepresentations that caused private complainants to part with their money, as payment for supposed placement and processing fees, which they never recovered from accused-appellant. The representations were false from inception as accused-appellant had absolutely no capacity to place others abroad for purposes of employment. True enough, private complainants were not able to leave for their destination or work there, or even refund the money they gave to accused-appellant because she went into hiding.

Clearly, all the elements of estafa—false pretense which was contemporaneous with the fraud, reliance, and damage capable of pecuniary estimation—are present in this case. Accused-appellant's convictions for estafa committed against Calpito, Caldo, Salazar, and Untalan should thus be affirmed. The penalties to be imposed, however, should be modified in light of the enactment of Republic Act No. 10951.[25]","ACCORDINGLY, the appeal is hereby PARTIALLY GRANTED.

"G.R. No. 260973, August 06, 2024 ","BENJAMIN TOGADO Y PAILAN, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","On May 28, 2014, Judge Cynthia R. Marino Ricablanca of the Regional Trial Court of Santa Cruz, Laguna issued Search Warrant No. 14-948 against Benjamin Togado (Togado).[1]

A portion of the Search Warrant stated:
It appears to the satisfaction of the undersigned Presiding Judge after examining under oath the applicant PO3 Arnel P. Bigata, Chief Intel, Magdalena MPS, Magdalena, Laguna, and his witness that there is probable cause to believe that the crime of Violation of R.A. 10591 (Comprehensive Firearms & Ammunitions [sic] Regulation Act), has been committed and there are good and sufficient reasons to believe that Benjamin Togado, Jr. has in his possession and control/custody unlicensed firearms and ammunitions [sic] which may be found at his residence/premises at Brgy. Buenavista, Magdalena, Laguna, and as shown in the attached sketch, which should be seized and brought to the undersigned, to wit:
a. ONE (1) cal. [.]45 pistol;
b. ONE (1) 9mm pistol;
c. ONE (I) cal. .38 revolver; and
d. Assorted ammunitions [sic].[2]
On May 29, 2014, Senior Inspector Jesus Lintag assigned Police Officer I Mar San Luis (PO1 San Luis), PO1 Marvin Alcantara (PO1 Alcantara), PO3 Emerson Bautista (PO3 Bautista), and PO3 Arnel Bigata (PO3 Bigata; collectively, the search warrant team) to carry out the search. PO3 Bigata was the team leader, while PO1 San Luis and PO1 Alcantara were the searchers.[3]

The search warrant team was first briefed before proceeding to Togado's house.

Upon arrival, the police officers showed the Search Warrant to Togado and explained its contents.[4] A few minutes later, Barangay Kagawad Juan E. Esquibel (Barangay Kagawad Esquibel) also arrived and told the search warrant team to begin the search.[5]
 
When the search warrant team entered the house, Togado ""pointed to the police officers a .45-caliber pistol placed on top of a chair.""[6]

PO1 San Luis inspected the firearm and found that its magazine had five live ammunitions.[7] PO1 San Luis secured the firearm and magazine by placing these items inside a ziplock plastic and marking the plastic with ""MMS-01 5/29/14.""[8]

The rest of the search warrant team did not find any other firearm within the premises.[9]

Thereafter, the search warrant team prepared a Certification of Orderly Search signed by PO3 Bigata as the team leader and Barangay Kagawad Esquibel as witness.[10]

The search warrant team also took photographs and prepared an inventory of the seized items.[11] The inventory was signed by Barangay Kagawad Esquibel as witness, together with PO1 San Luis and PO1 Alcantara as the seizing officers.[12]

The search warrant team informed Togado of his rights as an accused and arrested him.[13]

At the police station, Togado explained that he would use the confiscated firearm whenever he would do his rounds in the barangay (""nagroronda"").[14]

The confiscated firearm was then turned over by PO1 San Luis to PO3 Bautista.[15]

The Firearms and Explosives Office of the Philippine National Police certified that Togado was ""not a registered firearm holder of any kind or caliber per verification.""[16]

Togado was subsequently charged with violation of Section 28 of Republic Act No. 10591 or the Comprehensive Firearms and Ammunition Regulation Act for illegal possession of firearms and ammunition. The Information states:
That on the [sic] May 29, 2014, on or about 6:45 in the evening, at Brgy. Buenavista, Municipality of Magdalena, Province of Laguna, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above­named accused, without being authorized by law, did then and there willfully, unlawfully[,] and feloniously have in his possession, custody[,] and control one (1) cal. 45 pistol with Serial No. 738115, five (5) pieces of live ammunitions for calibre [sic] .45 firearm, one (1) magazine in violation of the aforementioned law.","In cases involving violations of Republic Act No. 10591 or the Comprehensive Firearms and Ammunition Regulation Act, the prosecution should present before the court the exact same firearm that was confiscated from the accused. Further, the prosecution should prove that the integrity of the confiscated firearm was preserved. Otherwise, the accused should be acquitted based on reasonable doubt.","The Court of Appeals did not err in ruling that the Search Warrant was valid, but a review of the records shows that petitioner should be acquitted on reasonable doubt because the evidence was tampered with, and the witness failed to identify with certainty the firearm and live ammunition confiscated from petitioner.

On the validity of the Search Warrant, petitioner argues that there is nothing on record that would prove that the judge personally examined the complainant and the witnesses before issuing the Search Warrant.[51] Petitioner also argues that the address at ""Brgy. Buenavista, Magdalena, Laguna"" does not describe the place to be searched with sufficient particularity.[52]

Ogayon v. People[53] instructs us that ""failure to attach to the records the depositions of the complainant and [their] witnesses and/or the transcript of the judge's examination, though contrary to the Rules, does not by itself nullify the warrant"" because such requirement ""is merely a procedural rule and not a component of the right.""[54] It was further clarified that in the absence of records, ""a warrant may still be upheld if there is evidence in the records that the requisite examination was made and probable cause was based thereon.""[55]

In this case, the Search Warrant itself stated the name of the applicant and that a witness was examined.[56] In addition, PO1 Alcantara testified that before applying for the issuance of a search warrant, he inquired with the Firearms and Explosives Office on whether petitioner is a registered firearm holder.[57]

Moreover, the place to be searched and the items to be seized were described with sufficient particularity. The Search Warrant had a map attached to it, and it also enumerated the firearms to be confiscated.[58]

Hence, there was no error on the part of the Court of Appeals in upholding the validity of the Search Warrant.

II

Nevertheless, we rule that petitioner should be acquitted on reasonable doubt.

To reiterate, the elements of violation of Section 28 of Republic Act No. 10591 are:
(a)
the existence of the subject firearm; and
(b)
the fact that the accused who possessed or owned the same does not have the corresponding license for it.[59]
The first element was not proven because of the prosecution's failure to show that the integrity of the firearm was preserved. Republic Act No. 10591 does not contain any provision on chain of custody and the proper handling of seized firearms and ammunition. However, it should be stressed that the Philippine National Police has an operations manual to guide its members on various matters, including the handling and preservation of the integrity of confiscated firearms. At the very least, the police officers should have followed its internal operations manual.

The 2021 Revised Philippine National Police Operational Procedures is the prevailing manual, but considering that this case involves a Search Warrant that was issued in 2014, we take a look at the 2013 Philippine National Police Operational Procedures Manual.[60] The pertinent provision of the operations manual states:
15.3 Mandatory Examination of Firearm Seized/Confiscated during Police Operation
All firearms, cartridges, and slugs seized, captured or recovered during checkpoints or pursuit operations or in any other police operations including those seized during the service of warrants and, more importantly, those recovered from the crime scene shall immediately be submitted to the local Crime Laboratory (CLO) which shall in turn process it for capturing and cross-matching through the Integrated Ballistics Identification System (IBIS);

The field investigation or investigator-on-case (IOC) shall submit the photo of the firearm and the receipt issued by the local Crime Laboratory Office for the said firearm/cartridges/slugs to the prosecutor or the court;

Should the prosecutor eventually require the physical submission of the firearm, the investigator-on-case shall manifest with the prosecutor or court that a subpoena be issued for the Crime Laboratory which issued the receipt to present the said firearm; and

It is also imperative that the chain of custody be strictly observed and documented and therefore, as much as practicable, it shall be the investigator-on-case (IOC) who shall personally submit the recovered firearms/shells/slugs to the local Crime Laboratory. (Emphasis supplied)
Notably, the provision does not state where the marking should be placed; only that ""the chain of custody be strictly observed and documented."" The phrase may lack specificity, but it is still a directive that a confiscating officer must be able to keep a record of the handling, safekeeping, and preservation of the seized firearm. For confiscated firearms and ammunition, it is more prudent to place the marking on the confiscated item itself, not on the plastic. Law enforcers and courts should remember that the crucial piece of evidence is the confiscated item, not the plastic containing it. Once the confiscated item is marked and placed inside a plastic container, the container should also be sealed in a manner that would indicate whether the plastic has been tampered with.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is GRANTED. The October 13, 2021 Decision and May 11, 2022 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 43471 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Petitioner Benjamin Togado y Pailan is ACQUITTED for the prosecution's failure to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. He is ordered RELEASED from confinement unless he is being held for some other legal grounds.

Let a copy of this Decision be furnished to the Chief of the Philippine National Police for their information.

Let entry of judgment be issued immediately."
"G.R. No. 268546, August 06, 2024","AN WARAY PARTY-LIST, REPRESENTED BY FLORENCIO GABRIEL ""BEM"" NOEL, AND VICTORIA ISABEL NOEL, IN HER OWN PERSONAL CAPACITY, PETITIONERS, VS. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, DANILO T. PORNIAS, JR.,• AND JUDE A. ACIDRE, RESPONDENTS.","An Waray is a duly registered multi-sectoral party-list organization which participated in the 2013 National and Local Elections (NLE).[4] For the 2013 NLE, An Waray's nominees were: (1) Neil Benedict A. Montejo (Montejo); (2) Acidre; and (3) Victoria. An Waray obtained a total of 541,205 votes or 1.96% of the total votes cast for party-lists, thereby emerging as one of the winners of seats in the House of Representatives (HoR).[5]

Thus, in Resolution No. 0006-13[6] dated May 24, 2013 of COMELEC sitting as the National Board of Canvassers (NBOC), An Waray was one of the 14 party-list groups proclaimed as initial winners, guaranteed with one seat each.

On May 28, 2013, the NBOC issued Resolution No. 0008-13[7] which cancelled the registration of some party-list groups, resulting in the adjustment of the seat allocations. Due to this realignment, An Waray's number of seats was increased to two ""without prejudice to the proclamation of other parties, organizations or coalitions which may later on be established to be entitled to one guaranteed seat and/or additional seat.""[8]

On May 29, 2013, An Waray's second nominee, Acidre, submitted his resignation from the party, citing ""pressing personal reasons.""[9] Consequently, Victoria succeeded as An Waray's second nominee.

On June 5, 2013, the NBOC issued a Certificate of Proclamation (CoP) to An Waray as one of the winning party-lists in the 2013 NLE, entitling its first nominee, Montejo, to sit in the HoR.[10]

On June 26, 2013, Montejo took his oath of office before then House Speaker Feliciano Belmonte, Jr. (Speaker Belmonte).[11] Premised on the tally indicated in NBOC Resolution No. 0008-13, An Waray's second nominee, Victoria, took her oath of office separately on July 13, 2013 before Senator Francis Joseph ""Chiz"" Escudero.[12]

The counsel for An Waray sent a letter to the NBOC requesting for a CoP in favor of its second nominee, Victoria. In its Resolution No. 0018-13[13] dated July 17, 2013, the NBOC merely noted the letter-request.[14]

On July 16, 2013, the COMELEC En Banc accepted Acidre's resignation from An Waray through Minute Resolution No. 13-0085.

In a Decision dated October 22, 2013, the Court in Abang Lingkod Party-List v. COMELEC[15] (Abang Lingkod) reversed COMELEC's cancellation of Abang Lingkod's party-list registration. The Court thus ordered COMELEC to proclaim Abang Lingkod as one of the winning party-list groups during the 2013 NLE.[16]

On August 20, 2014, COMELEC issued NBOC Resolution No. 13-030 (PL)/0004-14 where it declared the final distribution of seats for party-list groups in accordance with the Court's computation in the landmark case of Barangay Association for National Advancement and Transparency (BANAT) v. COMELEC[17] (BANAT). In the said Resolution, An Waray was listed as entitled to only one guaranteed seat.[18]

In the years following the 2013 NLE, An Waray continued to participate in the party-list elections and was able to secure one seat in the HoR in 2016, another seat in 2019, and another seat in 2022.

On May 10, 2019, Pornias, invoking his alleged standing as a registered voter and taxpayer, and Acidre, then a sitting second nominee of Tingog Sinirangan Party-List in the HoR, filed with COMELEC a petition[19] for the cancellation of An Waray's registration pursuant to Section 6 of Republic Act No. 7941[20] or the ""Party-List System Act"". They asserted that Victoria, with the knowledge and consent of An Waray, deliberately took her oath of office as a Member of the 16th Congress not only without having been validly proclaimed by the NBOC, but also when An Waray was finally adjudged to have been legally entitled to one seat only.[21] On this score, Pornias and Acidre submitted a Memorandum dated November 29, 2018 issued by COMELEC Regional Election Director for Region VIII, certifying that, ""[b]ased on the records at hand, this office did not issue any Certificate of Proclamation to Atty. Victoria Isabel G. Noel, 2nd nominee of An Waray Party-List.""[22] They posited that the aforementioned acts constitute a violation of election laws by An Waray and Victoria, thus justifying the cancellation of An Waray's registration under Section 6(5)[23] of Republic Act No. 7941.[24]

In their Joint Verified Answer,[25] An Waray, represented by their then sitting Representative in the HoR, Florencio Gabriel ""Bem"" Noel (Bem), and Victoria, countered that from the time An Waray assumed its second seat through Victoria in 2013, no one ever questioned the same. As such, Victoria was able to discharge her official duties as representative of An Waray, without any interruption in accordance with NBOC Resolution No. 0008-13, which has not been revoked, amended, or vacated by COMELEC.[26] They also averred that the petition failed to present any legal basis in its conclusion that An Waray or Victoria committed any violation of election laws.[27]","Before the Court is a Petition for Certiorari with Urgent Prayer for Preliminary Injunction, Temporary Restraining Order and/or Status Quo Ante Order with Motion for Conduct of Special Raffle[1] (Petition) filed under Rule 64, in relation to Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, which assails the following Resolutions issued by public respondent Commission on Elections (COMELEC) in SPP No. 19-008:
1.
Resolution[2] dated June 2, 2023 of the COMELEC Second Division, granting the petition of private respondents Danilo T. Pornias, Jr. (Pornias) and Jude A. Acidre (Acidre) for cancellation of the registration of petitioner An Waray Party-List (An Waray) as a party-list organization; and


2.
Resolution[3] dated August 14, 2023 of the COMELEC En Banc, denying petitioners An Waray and Victoria Isabel Noel's (Victoria) (collectively, petitioners) motion for reconsideration.","The Petition is dismissed for lack of merit.

At the outset, the Court resolves the issue of jurisdiction. Specifically, An Waray alleges that the HRET has exclusive jurisdiction over the case because Bem and Victoria had already become members of the HoR. Respondents counter that it is COMELEC which has jurisdiction, as clearly and categorically provided in the Constitution and Republic Act No. 7941. The significance of this issue in the present case is that if it is the HRET that has sole jurisdiction, then the same likewise excludes the Court and only after the HRET has decided and such decision has been brought to the Court on petition for review can the Court properly take cognizance of the case.

It is well to mention that the COMELEC-HRET jurisdiction issue is a staple issue raised in virtually every case involving the qualifications or eligibilities of candidates for Congress and the Senate which are filed with these two bodies or with the Court, if the same are resolved after such candidates have already won in the elections. In most of these cases, the underlying issue of whether the candidate has already legally become a Member of the HoR oftentimes becomes the determinant question, the answer to which identifies the body having jurisdiction. Thus, in most of these cases, the controversy and the arguments revolved around the requisites of becoming a Member of the HoR, that is: 1) a valid proclamation, 2) a valid oath of office, and 3) assumption to the office sought.

This is not, however, the determinant issue in this case. That Bem and Victoria became HoR Members and the relevant dates therefor are facts which are not contested. The issue here is whether the cancellation of An Waray's registration falls under the HRET's jurisdiction on account of its effect upon the status of Bem's membership in the HoR and the validity of Victoria's past membership therein. Stated otherwise, the jurisdiction issue here relates more to the nature of the action filed, assuming as a given that petitioner party-list won in the last elections and has a nominee sitting as a Member of the HoR.

COMELEC has the exclusive jurisdiction to rule on the cancellation of An Waray's party-list registration, as it is categorically provided such power to cancel party-list registrations under the law.
Foremost, as jurisdiction is a matter of substantive law, reference to the Constitution or statute is necessary. The main case from which the present certiorari petition stemmed, is a petition for the cancellation of An Waray's party-list registration. Hence, to determine which body possesses jurisdiction over the case, one need only to refer to the law conferring the same.

Jurisdiction over cancellation of party-list registrations is categorically conferred by Section 6 of Republic Act No. 7941 on COMELEC, thus:

SEC. 6. Refusal and/or Cancellation of Registration. – The COMELEC may, motu proprio or upon verified complaint of any interested party, refuse or cancel, after due notice and hearing, the registration of any national, regional or sectoral party, organization or coalition on any of the following grounds:

(1) It is a religious sect or denomination, organization or association organized for religious purposes;

(2) It advocates violence or unlawful means to seek its goal;

(3) It is a foreign party or organization;

(4) It is receiving support from any foreign government, foreign political party, foundation, organization, whether directly or through any of its officers or members or indirectly through third parties for partisan election purposes;

(5) It violates or fails to comply with laws, rules or regulations relating to elections;

(6) It declares untruthful statements in its petition;

(7) It has ceased to exist for at least one (1) year; or

(8) It fails to participate in the last two (2) preceding elections or fails to obtain at least two percentum (2%) of the votes cast under the party­-list system in the two (2) preceding elections for the constituency in which it has registered. (Emphasis supplied)

This power of COMELEC is recognized in the Constitution, as it likewise grants to COMELEC the concomitant power to register party-list organizations. Article IX-C, Section 2 provides:

SECTION 2. The Commission on Elections shall exercise the following powers and functions:

. . . .

(5) Register, after sufficient publication, political parties, organizations, or coalitions which, in addition to other requirements, must present their platform or program of government; and accredit citizens' arms of the Commission on Elections. Religious denominations and sects shall not be registered. Those which seek to achieve their goals through violence or unlawful means, or refuse to uphold and adhere to this Constitution, or which are supported by any foreign government shall likewise be refused registration.

Financial contributions from foreign governments and their agencies to political parties, organizations, coalitions, or candidates related to elections constitute interference in national affairs, and, when accepted, shall be an additional ground for the cancellation of their registration with the Commission, in addition to other penalties that may be prescribed by law. (Emphasis supplied)

The power of COMELEC to register party-lists is echoed in Republic Act No. 7941, which confers upon COMELEC the sole and exclusive jurisdiction to act on petitions for registration of party-lists, after the same is published and after the parties are given due notice and hearing. Needless to say, the discretion of COMELEC when it acts on petitions for registration includes denying such petitions. Republic Act No. 7941 provides:

SEC. 3. Definition of Terms. – (a) The party-list system is a mechanism of proportional representation in the election of representatives to the House of Representatives from national, regional and sectoral parties or organizations or coalitions thereof registered with the Commission on Elections (COMELEC). Component parties or organizations of a coalition may participate independently provided the coalition of which they form part does not participate in the party-list system.

. . . .

SEC. 5. Registration. – Any organized group of persons may register as a party, organization or coalition for purposes of the party-list system by filing with the COMELEC not later than ninety (90) days before the election a petition verified by its president or secretary stating its desire to participate in the party-list system as a national, regional or sectoral party or organization or a coalition of such parties or organizations, attaching thereto its constitution, by-laws, platform or program of government, list of officers, coalition agreement and other relevant information as the COMELEC may require: Provided, That the sectors shall include labor, peasant, fisherfolk, urban poor, indigenous cultural communities, elderly, handicapped, women, youth, veterans, overseas workers, and professionals.

The COMELEC shall publish the petition in at least two (2) national newspapers of general circulation.

The COMELEC shall, after due notice and hearing, resolve the petition within fifteen (15) days from the date it was submitted for decision but in no case not later than sixty (60) days before election.

Clearly, both the Constitution and the statute—Republic Act No. 7941—categorically vest in COMELEC the power and authority to decide on matters relating to an organization's participation in the party-list system—from the grant or denial of its petition for registration as a party, organization or coalition to participate in the party-list elections, to the cancellation of a previously granted registration.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Certiorari is DISMISSED. The Urgent Prayer for Preliminary Injunction, Temporary Restraining Order and/or Status Quo Ante Order with Motion for Conduct of Special Raffle under Rule 64, in relation to Rule 65 of the Rules of Court is likewise DENIED. The assailed Resolution dated June 2, 2023 of the Commission on Elections Second Division and Resolution dated August 14, 2023 of the Commission on Elections En Banc in SPP No. 19-008 are hereby AFFIRMED."
"G.R. No. 265847, August 06, 2024","MA. ZARAH ROSE DE GUZMAN-­LARA, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS AND MANUEL N. MAMBA, RESPONDENTS.","During the May 2022 National and Local Elections (NLE), Lara and Mamba were candidates for the position of Governor of the Province of Cagayan. Mamba was then the incumbent Governor of the said province, having been elected as such during the May 2019 NLE.[4]

Lara filed a Petition[5] dated May 10, 2022, seeking the disqualification of Mamba as a candidate for the position of Governor of the Province of Cagayan in the May 2022 NLE on the grounds of massive vote-buying activities and unlawful disbursement of public funds, in blatant violations of Section 68[6] of the Omnibus Election Code (OEC).[7] In the same Petition, Lara likewise prayed that the COMELEC order and direct the Board of Canvassers to suspend and hold in abeyance the proclamation of Mamba as winner, should the latter receive the highest number of votes in the elections.[8]

Specifically, Lara averred that Mamba used the funds of the provincial government of Cagayan to distribute cash assistance ""ayuda"" to voters under the following programs: (1) ""No Barangay Left Behind;"" (2) ""No Town Left Behind;"" (3) Oplan Tulong sa Barangay;"" (4) and ""Krusada Kontra Korapsyon."" Lara likewise contended that the disbursements were done during the campaign period of March 25 to May 8, 2022.[9]

On May 11, 2022, the Provincial Board of Canvassers proclaimed Mamba as the duly elected Governor for the Province of Cagayan after garnering the highest number of votes legally cast for the said office.[10]

On December 14, 2022, the COMELEC Second Division issued a Resolution[11] granting Lara's Petition for Disqualification and disqualifying Mamba as a candidate for the position of Governor of the Province of Cagayan in the May 2022 NLE:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Petition is GRANTED. Respondent MANUEL N. MAMBA is DISQUALIFIED as a candidate for the position of Governor of the Province of Cagayan in the 09 May 2022 National and Local Elections.

Let the records of the case be forwarded to the Law Department of this Commission for the conduct of preliminary investigation relative to the election offense aspect of this case.

SO ORDERED.[12]
The COMELEC Second Division ruled that the pieces of evidence submitted by Lara were not substantial to disqualify Mamba on the ground of violation of Section 68 of the OEC. It noted that while the pieces of evidence showed that the conduct of cash distribution occurred, Mamba merely implemented the same in his capacity as Governor. Thus, it was not shown that the acts were done for the purpose of influencing, inducing, or corrupting the voters, as required under Section 68 of the OEC.[13]","This Court resolves the Petition for Certiorari[1] filed by Ma. Zarah Rose De Guzman-Lara (Lara), assailing the Resolution[2] of the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) En Banc and praying that the Resolution[3] of the COMELEC Second Division be affirmed. Lara avers that the COMELEC committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in dismissing the Petition for Disqualification she filed against private respondent Manuel N. Mamba (Mamba).","The Petition is meritorious.

To begin with, this Court, not being a trier of facts, shall only step in if there is a showing that the COMELEC En Banc committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. As defined, grave abuse of discretion means ""such capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to an excess or lack of jurisdiction. The abuse of discretion must be so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of a positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law[.]""[24] Thus, if it is sufficiently shown that the COMELEC En Banc exercised its power ""capriciously, arbitrarily, whimsically, or without basis under the law or the Constitution[,]"" this Court is otherwise duty-bound to ""redirect COMELEC's course along constitutional channels.""[25]

To recall, petitioner ascribes grave abuse of discretion on the part of the COMELEC for having ruled in the assailed Resolution that: (1) the Petition to disqualify respondent was filed out of time and must necessarily be dismissed; and (2) the belated filing thereof was in fact an infirmity which divests the COMELEC from jurisdiction to resolve the issues in the Petition for Disqualification.

After a judicious examination of the case, this Court is persuaded that the COMELEC gravely abused its discretion.

On procedural grounds, the COMELEC should have granted due course to the Petition for Disqualification by exercising liberality in the application of its procedural rules.

In dismissing the Petition for Disqualification as having been filed out of time, the COMELEC relied on Section 5, Rule 2, COMELEC Resolution No. 10673,[26] which provides for guidelines on the electronic filing of pleadings before the COMELEC:
SECTION 5. Schedule of Filing through E-mail. – The schedule of filing of verified pleadings, memoranda, comments, briefs, and other submissions through E-mail shall be from Monday to Friday, 8:00 am to 5:00 pm, excluding holidays. E-mails received beyond 5:00 pm shall be considered filed at 8:00 am of the next working day.
 
Where a deadline falls on a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday, official transaction shall be done on the next working day. (Emphasis supplied)
Indeed, a straightforward application of Section 5 reveals the Petition for Disqualification, filed via electronic mail on May 10, 2022, was filed out of time. The time stamp of the electronic mail, a copy of which is attached to the instant Petition, indicates that it was sent on 6:21 p.m. After a few hours, respondent was proclaimed as the winning candidate on May 11, 2022, at 1:39 a.m. Thus, the COMELEC denied the Petition for Disqualification pursuant to Section 5, which instructs that pleadings filed through electronic mail and received beyond 5:00 p.m. are considered filed at 8:00 a.m. of the next working day.

Nevertheless, in stringently applying its procedural rules, the COMELEC clearly lost sight of the peculiar nature of elections cases. After all, ""elections cases are, at all times, invested with public interest which cannot be defeated by mere procedural or technical infirmities.""[27]

Time and again, this Court has chosen to uphold the relaxation of election procedural rules in the interest of substantial justice. In the recent case of Uy v. Commission on Elections,[28] the COMELEC denied the petitioner's motion for reconsideration for being filed a day late, following the rule that any pleading sent through electronic mail beyond 5:00 p.m. would be deemed filed on the following day. Nonetheless, the COMELEC notably resolved the merits of the instant motion, which declared the petitioner as a nuisance candidate. In ruling that the Resolution by the COMELEC denying the motion for reconsideration was tainted with grave abuse of discretion, this Court held:
On April 19, 2022, Frederico received via electronic mail the COMELEC Second Division's Resolution declaring him a nuisance candidate. Frederico had five days from notice to move for reconsideration or until April 24, 2022. Considering that the last day fell on a Sunday, the time shall not run until the next working day. Accordingly, Frederico sent the Motion for Reconsideration through electronic mail on April 25, 2022, at 6:23 p.m. The COMELEC En Banc denied the Motion for being filed a day late following the rule that any pleading sent through electronic mail beyond 5:00 p.m. is deemed filed the following day. Nonetheless, the COMELEC affirmed the finding that Frederico is a nuisance candidate.

On this point, we cannot overemphasize that courts have always tried to maintain a healthy balance between the strict enforcement of procedural laws and the guarantee that every litigant be given the full opportunity for the just disposition of his cause. The Court has allowed several cases to proceed in the broader interest of justice despite procedural defects and lapses. These rulings are in keeping with the principle that rules of procedure are mere tools designed to facilitate the attainment of justice. Specifically, the COMELEC Rules of Procedure provides that '[i]n the interest of justice and in order to obtain speedy disposition of all matters pending before the Commission, these rules and any portion thereof may be suspended by the Commission.' Here, the COMELEC En Banc is deemed to have relaxed its procedures when it resolved the merits of the motion for reconsideration. In any event, the circumstances of the case merit the liberal application of the rules in the interest of substantial justice. The COMELEC received Frederico's Motion only more than an hour past 5:00 p.m. More importantly, the issue of whether Frederico is a nuisance candidate is determinative not only of the proper treatment of his votes but also as to the outcome of the elections. The grave injustice to Frederico is likewise not commensurate with his failure to comply with the rules.[29] (Emphasis supplied)
As in Uy, the issue of respondent's qualifications as a candidate for the position of Governor of the Province of Cagayan is crucial to the outcome of his votes and to the result of the elections. Accordingly, the analogous circumstances in Uy in relation to the instant case justifies a relaxation of the COMELEC rules of procedure in the interest of substantial justice. Verily, this Court finds no reason why the liberal interpretation of procedural rules accorded in Uy should not be applied in this case.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Certiorari is GRANTED. The March 6, 2023 Resolution of the Commission on Elections En Banc in SPA Case No. 22-089 (DC) is ANNULLED and SET ASIDE.

This case is REMANDED to the Commission on Elections En Banc for the proper disposition of Ma. Zarah Rose De Guzman-Lara's Petition for Disqualification against Manuel N. Mamba."
"A.M. No. MTJ-24-023 (Formerly OCA IPI No. 18-2966-MTJ), August 06, 2024","TEDWIN T. UY, COMPLAINANT, VS. PRESIDING JUDGE JORGE EMMANUEL M. LORREDO, METROPOLITAN TRIAL COURT, BRANCH 26, MANILA, RESPONDENT.","This resolves the Complaint-Affidavit[3] filed by Tedwin T. Uy (Tedwin) against Hon. Jorge Emmanuel M. Lorredo (Judge Lorredo) for exhibiting partiality in the administration of justice, conduct unbecoming of a judge, and irregularity in the performance of his official duties.

In his complaint, Tedwin alleged that Judge Lorredo actively participated in the criminal case hearings where the former was a co-accused. The transcribed stenographer's notes show that Judge Lorredo had made more entries, i.e., questions, comments, and manifestations, than the prosecutor and defense's counsels combined. Specifically, Judge Lorredo's entries numbered to 507, while the total of the prosecutor and the defense counsel's only amounted to 356.[4]

Further, Tedwin asserted that Judge Lorredo's statements and questions were not merely clarificatory but were adversarial, intimidating, oppressive, and outright cruel. During the presentation of Tedwin's daughter, Trisha Uy (Trisha), Judge Lorredo asked if she was mentally retarded, under medication, or downright stupid. As such, his statements were offensive, distasteful, inexcusable, and made at the expense of the court's integrity.[5]

Even Tedwin's then newly minted lawyer, Atty. Erly Ecal (Atty. Ecal), became the subject of Judge Lorredo's remarks. The latter kept interrupting her with questions, and intimidated and oppressed her. Further, he repeatedly questioned Atty. Ecal's competency as a lawyer as well as her educational attainment, going so far as to say that Atty. Ecal was ""[k]ulang ang aral.""[6]

Finally, Tedwin pointed out that this Court had previously found Judge Lorredo administratively liable for failing to exercise caution in his speech and in his conduct and admonished him to observe judicial temperament and avoid offensive or intemperate language.[7]

In his Comment,[8] Judge Lorredo asserted that he was merely performing his duty as a judge to ask questions to determine the accused's guilt. As the witnesses were very clever and evasive, he had to phrase his questions in a manner that would lead to the truth. He explained that he asked Trisha whether she was stupid, retarded, or under medication to prevent her from later claiming that these grounds affected her testimony.[9]

In its Report,[10] the Judicial Integrity Board recommended that Judge Lorredo be found guilty of unbecoming conduct and be ordered to pay a fine of PHP 10,000.00 with a stern warning that a repetition of the same or any similar act in the future will be dealt with more severely.[11]

The Judicial Integrity Board agreed that Judge Lorredo was exercising his judicial functions by actively participating in the examination of witnesses, as required by the Judicial Affidavit Rule. It observed that both Tedwin and Trisha gave evasive answers, necessitating Judge Lorredo's intervention.[12]

Nonetheless, Judge Lorredo's manner of asking questions and intemperate language constitute unbecoming conduct of a judge. His use of the words ""stupid,"" ""mentally retarded,"" and ""on medication"" were unnecessary and inappropriate. As a visible representation of the law, judges should conduct themselves in a manner above suspicion and reproach.[13]

The Judicial Integrity Board noted that Judge Lorredo was already sanctioned for his use of intemperate language in a previous administrative case and ordered to pay a fine of PHP 5,000.00 for unbecoming conduct of a judge. Thus, the Judicial Integrity Board recommended the imposition of a PHP 10,000.00 fine in accordance with Rule 140, as further amended by A.M. No. 21-08-09-SC.[14]

The sole issue for this Court's resolution is whether respondent should be held administratively liable for his actions.","Dismissal is the proper penalty for judges who repeatedly fail to meet the exacting standards of those allowed to don the judicial robes. This measure is necessary to ""protect and preserve the image and integrity of the entire judiciary.""[1] As the judicial service ""demands the best possible men and women from the service..., the Court will not hesitate to discipline its members who taint its image in the eyes of the public.""[2]","This Court has not hesitated to dismiss those who repeatedly fail to meet the exacting standards of those allowed to don the judicial robes, evident in the recent cases of Judge Larida v. Atty. Calma[33] and Re: Jose S. Jacinto.[34]

The same situation obtains here. Despite numerous warnings from this Court, the suspension of 30 days, and the imposition of fines that totaled PHP 55,000.00, respondent continues to commit the same offenses, showcasing his propensity to disregard the provisions of the New Code of Judicial Conduct. Further, his refusal to heed the various stern warnings reveals his obstinate attitude and utter disregard for this Court's authority. Evidently, this Court has no other recourse but to dismiss him from service, to ""protect and preserve the image and integrity of the entire judiciary.""[35]

As earlier discussed, respondent violated multiple provisions of the New Code of Judicial Conduct, i.e., Canon 2, Sections 1 and 2; Canon 3, Section 2; Canon 4, Section 1; Canon 5, Section 2; and Canon 6, Section 6. During deliberations Associate Justice Maria Filomena D. Singh correctly pointed out that that these constitute individual counts of unbecoming conduct.

Having been dismissed for the first count, respondent must be penalized for the remaining five counts of unbecoming conduct. Given the circumstances of this case, this Court deems it appropriate to impose upon him the maximum fine of PHP 35,000.00 for the remaining five counts of unbecoming conduct, amounting to a total of PHP 175,000.00.[36] This must be paid in accordance with Rule 140, Section 22.
SECTION 22. Payment of Fines. — When the penalty imposed is a fine, the respondent shall pay it within a period not exceeding three (3) months from the time the decision or resolution is promulgated. If unpaid, such amount may be deducted from the salaries and benefits, including accrued leave credits, due to the respondent. The deduction of unpaid fines from accrued leave credits, which is considered as a form of compensation, is not tantamount to the imposition of the accessory penalty of forfeiture covered under the provisions of this Rule.[37]
As the judicial service ""demands the best possible men and women from the service..., the Court will not hesitate to discipline its members who taint its image in the eyes of the public.""[38]","ACCORDINGLY, Hon. Jorge Emmanuel M. Lorredo, Presiding Judge, Branch 26, Metropolitan Trial Court of Manila is found GUILTY of unbecoming conduct. He is ordered DISMISSED from the service with forfeiture of all retirement benefits, except accrued leave credits, and perpetually disqualified from holding public office in any branch or instrumentality of the government, including government-owned or controlled corporations. He is also hereby ordered to PAY a FINE in the amount of PHP 35,000.00 for five counts of unbecoming conduct or a total of PHP 175,000.00 within a period not exceeding three months from the time this Decision is promulgated."
"G.R. No. 259815 (Formerly UDK 17421), August 05, 2024","MAZY'S CAPITAL, INC., PETITIONER, VS. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, REPRESENTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF NATIONAL DEFENSE, RESPONDENT.","The controversy involves a 46,143-square meter property known as Lot No. 937 (Lot 937 or subject property) located in Cebu City. Lot 937 was part of the Banilad Friar Lands Estate (Friar Lands) which has been the subject of several disputes that have reached the Court through the years.[5] Much like the other Friar Lands cases, the Court is again faced with the issue of who between two contending parties is the rightful owner of the disputed property, the determination of which is best resolved after the Court first exhaustively examines the history of the present case.

Civil Case No. 781:
1938 Expropriation Proceedings

On September 5, 1938, or 86 years ago, the Commonwealth of the Philippines (Commonwealth) filed before the Court of First Instance of Cebu (CFI), an expropriation complaint[6] against various landowners of the Friar Lands, which was docketed as Civil Case No. 781 (Expropriation Case). The purpose of the expropriation was to carry out the development program of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) under the National Defense Act.[7] Among the parcels of land included in the Expropriation Case was Lot 937 which was registered under Transfer Certificate of Transfer (TCT) No. 5306[8] in the name of Eutiquio Uy Godinez[9] (Eutiquio), married to Felisa Sy Cip[10] (Felisa). Lot 937 was provisionally valued at PHP 1,845.72 in the Commonwealth's complaint.[11] As administratrix of Eutiquio's estate, Felisa filed her Answer.[12] In due course, the Commonwealth deposited the amount of PHP 9,500.00 with the Provincial Treasurer of Cebu as provisional value of all the lots to be expropriated.[13] Thereafter, the Commonwealth supposedly took possession of Lot 937.[14]

During the pendency of the proceedings, Felisa filed a motion[15] stating that she found the value of PHP 1,845.72 acceptable as just compensation for Lot 937 and prayed that the Commonwealth, which was already in possession of Lot 937, be ordered to pay her the said amount.[16] The CFI granted Felisa's motion in a Decision Parcial[17] dated April 22, 1939 (1939 Partial Decision). Pursuant thereto, the Commonwealth supposedly paid Felisa the amount of PHP 1,845.72, as evidenced by a Provincial Voucher[18] dated May 25, 1939.

Eventually, the CFI rendered a Decision[19] dated May 14, 1940 (1940 Decision), which set the amount of just compensation for each of the expropriated lots and ordered the government to pay the same. As regards Lot 937, the CFI deemed the same as already resolved based on the 1939 Partial Decision.[20]

World War II broke out in the Philippines in 1941 which ended only in 1945 after the Battle of Manila when the Philippines was liberated from Japanese occupation. The disruption by the war caused several controversies over the legal ownership and possession of the Friar Lands between the Philippine Army and the landowners and possessors thereof. Based on Federated Realty Corporation v. CA,[21] all 18 lots subject of the Expropriation Case were later converted into a national airport in 1947 by virtue of a Presidential Proclamation.[22]

G.L.R.O. Record No. 5988:
1954 Reconstitution of Title Case

On March 12, 1954, a Petition for Judicial Reconstitution of Title[23] was filed with the CFI. The petition was filed by Ramona U. Agustines, a supposed attorney-in-fact of Mariano Godinez (Mariano), Eutiquio's son, and alleged that Mariano inherited the property from Eutiquio and was the registered owner of Lot 937 which was covered by a title before the war; and that due to loss of records, the title number could no longer be determined. The petition claimed that Mariano was in possession of the property and that it was not encumbered, pledged, or sold. The case was docketed as G.L.R.O. Record No. 5988 (Reconstitution Case).

In an Order[24] dated March 1, 1956, the CFI granted the petition after finding that: (1) Mariano was the registered owner of the lot; and (2) both the owner's duplicate and the original copy of a certificate of title covering Lot 937 kept in the office of the Register of Deeds of Cebu had been lost or destroyed during the war. The CFI thus directed the Registry of Deeds of Cebu to issue a reconstituted title in the name of Mariano. Accordingly, Mariano was issued TCT No. RT-6757.

Civil Case No. CEB-19845:
1997 Reivindicatoria Action

On January 27, 1997, Eugenio Amores and Domingo Antigua, supposed attorneys-in-fact of Mariano, filed with Branch 9, RTC, Cebu City, (RTC-Br. 9) a reivindicatoria complaint[25] against the Republic, alleging that Mariano is the absolute and exclusive owner of Lot 937.[26] The case was docketed as Civil Case No. CEB-19845 (Reivindicatoria Case). In the complaint, it is alleged that Mariano was always in possession of the property through his overseer until the early 1990s when the Republic, through the Philippine National Police (PNP), took possession of the same based on the expropriation case notwithstanding the non-payment of just compensation. The PNP allegedly entered the property and constructed buildings and other structures on the property.[27]","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court[1] (Petition) filed by petitioner Mazy's Capital, Inc. (Mazy's) against respondent Republic of the Philippines (Republic), represented by the Department of National Defense (DND), assailing the Decision[2] dated March 20, 2020 and Resolution[3] dated September 30, 2021 issued by the Court of Appeals (CA), Cebu City in CA-G.R. CV No. 05860.[4] The CA reversed the dismissal of the Republic's Complaint for cancellation of reconstituted title and remanded the case to Branch 12, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Cebu City (RTC-Br. 12) for further proceedings.","Before the Court resolves the central issue pointed out earlier, there are several procedural matters which the Court must wade through.

A. RTC's Jurisdiction

Mazy's questions the RTC-Br. 12's jurisdiction, arguing that the Republic's Complaint is actually an action for annulment of judgment under Rule 47 as it seeks to nullify the judgment or order of the CFI that rendered a decision in the Reivindicatoria Case. Mazy's asserts that the RTC-Br. 12 has no jurisdiction as it cannot interfere with, much less annul, the orders or judgments of a co-equal court, owing to the doctrine of judicial stability or non-interference.[126]

The Court is not convinced and will lay to rest any doubts on the RTC­-Br. 12's jurisdiction in this case.

It is basic that jurisdiction over the subject matter of a case is conferred by law and determined by the allegations in the complaint which comprise the ultimate facts constituting the plaintiffs cause of action.[127] The nature of an action and which court has jurisdiction over it are determined based on the allegations and relief sought in the complaint.[128]

In Denila v. Republic,[129] the Court clarified that subject matter jurisdiction is only one of the several aspects of a court's jurisdiction. In order to exercise its powers validly and with binding effect, the court must also have jurisdiction over the issues, which the Court explained in this wise:
Jurisdiction is the basic foundation of judicial proceedings. It is simply defined as the power and authority — conferred by the Constitution or statute — of a court to hear and decide a case. Without jurisdiction, a judgment rendered by a court is null and void and may be attacked anytime. Indeed, a void judgment is no judgment at all — it can neither be the source of any right nor the creator of any obligation; all acts performed pursuant to it and all claims emanating from it have no legal effect.

In adjudication, the concept of jurisdiction has several aspects, namely: (a) jurisdiction over the subject matter; (b) jurisdiction over the parties; (c) jurisdiction over the issues of the case; and (d) in cases involving property, jurisdiction over the res or the thing which is the subject of the litigation. Additionally, a court must also acquire jurisdiction over the remedy in order for it to exercise its powers validly and with binding effect.

... Third, jurisdiction over the issues pertains to a tribunal's power and authority to decide over matters which are either disputed by the parties or simply under consideration. This aspect of jurisdiction is closely tied to jurisdiction over the remedy and over the subject matter which, in turn, is generally determined in the allegations of the initiatory pleading (complaint or petition) and not the result of proof. However, unlike jurisdiction over the subject-matter, jurisdiction over the issues may be conferred by either express or implied consent of the parties.[130] (Emphasis in the original; citations omitted)
From Mazy's arguments, it appears that it is questioning the RTC-Br. 12's exercise of jurisdiction over both the subject matter and the issues raised in this case.

At the time of the filing of the complaint, Batas Pambansa Blg. 129,[131] as amended, granted the RTC with exclusive original jurisdiction—
""(1) In all civil actions in which the subject of the litigation is incapable of pecuniary estimation;

""(2) In all civil actions which involve the title to, or possession of, real property, or any interest therein, where the assessed value of the property involved exceeds [PHP 300,000.00] or for civil actions in Metro Manila, where such value exceeds [PHP 400,000.00] except actions for forcible entry into and unlawful detainer of lands or buildings, original jurisdiction over which is conferred upon the Metropolitan Trial Courts, Municipal Trial Courts, and Municipal Circuit Trial Courts[.][132] (Emphasis supplied)
Before examining the Republic's Complaint, the Court first lays down the applicable legal principles.

In First Sarmiento Property Holdings, Inc. v. Philippine Bank of Communications,[133] the Court en banc ruled that the nature of an action is determined by the principal relief sought in the complaint. The Court distinguished the ""nature of the principal action or remedy"" from its consequences. Thus, an action involving the recovery of a sum of money may not necessarily be capable of pecuniary estimation if it is merely a consequence of a primary relief, such as an action for support or for foreclosure of mortgage, which cannot be estimated in terms of money and are therefore actions that are incapable of pecuniary estimation.[134] Moreover, ""if the primary cause of action is based on a claim of ownership or a claim of legal right to control, possess, dispose, or enjoy such property, the action is a real action involving title to real property.""[135]

Now looking at the Republic's Complaint, it is evident that the Republic essentially alleges that: (1) it is the ""rightful and lawful owner"" of Lot 937, having already expropriated the same and paid the corresponding amount of just compensation in 1939; (2) Mariano did not disclose this fact, among other things, to the CFI in the Reconstitution Case; and (3) such failure amounts to fraud which warrants the nullification of Mariano's TCT No. RT-6757, and all its derivative titles, if any.[136] Notably, the Republic did not pray that title to the property be reconveyed to it. It simply prayed for a judgment:
1. To declare as null and void and to order the cancellation of TCT No. RT-6757 covering Lot 937 in the name of defendant Mariano Godinez, as well as its derivative titles, if any;

2. To order defendant Mariano Godinez or any person in possession of the owner's copy of said TCT No. RT-6757 to surrender the same to the Registrar of Deeds of Cebu City;

3. For the Register of Deeds of Cebu City to cause the cancellation of TCT No. RT-6757 as well as of all its derivative titles, if there are any; and

4. To order defendant Mariano Godinez to pay the costs of suit as well as all the damages suffered by the plaintiff.

Other reliefs just and equitable under the premises are likewise prayed for.[137]
Based on the foregoing allegations, the Court is convinced that the Complaint is one that involves title to real property, not one that is incapable of pecuniary estimation. The principal relief sought is the cancellation of Mariano's title and any of its derivative titles on the ground of fraud supposedly perpetrated in the Reconstitution Case. This theory is premised on the Republic's assertion of ownership over Lot 937.

The next question that comes to fore is whether the assessed value of the subject property falls within the RTC's jurisdiction.

The general rule in real actions is that the complaint must allege the property's assessed value to determine which between the RTCs and the first­-level courts have jurisdiction over the same.[138] Strict compliance with this rule, however, may be relaxed if the assessed value of the property, though not alleged in the complaint, can be identified from the documents annexed to the complaint.[139]

Here, while the assessed value of Lot 937 was not alleged in the Republic's Complaint, the same can be found in the Reivindicatoria Complaint attached as Annex ""P"" thereof,[140] which states that the assessed value of the property is PHP 3,460,730.00.[141] This value places the action within the RTC's jurisdiction.

As to Mazy's argument on judicial stability and non-interference, this also has no merit.","WHEREFORE, the Petition is DENIED for lack of merit. The following are hereby declared NULL and VOID: (a) the Order dated March 1, 1956 issued by the Court of First Instance of Cebu in G.L.R.O. Record No. 5988 (Lot No. 937); (b) the reconstituted Transfer Certificate of Title No. RT-6757 in the name of Mariano Godinez; and (c) the Decision dated April 18, 2002 issued by Branch 9, Regional Trial Court of Cebu City, in Civil Case No. CEB-19845.

The instant case is hereby REMANDED to the Court of Appeals for further proceedings to hear and resolve with reasonable dispatch the issue of whether or not Mazy's Capital, Inc. is an innocent purchaser for value, whether the Republic is guilty of estoppel, and any other defense or claim that the parties may raise which has not yet been disposed of in this Decision, in accordance with this Decision. The Court of Appeals is hereby DIRECTED to cause the raffle of the case for purposes of this remand. Thereafter, the Court of Appeals is DIRECTED to submit to the Court its resolution in a sealed report.

"G.R. No. 217368*, August 05, 2024","RUBY SHELTER BUILDERS AND REALTY DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION, REPRESENTED BY ITS PRESIDENT, RUBEN SIA, PETITIONER, VS. ROMEO Y. TAN, ROBERTO L. OBIEDO AND ATTY. TOMAS A. REYES, RESPONDENTS.","Petitioner Ruby Shelter Builders and Realty Development Corporation (Ruby Shelter) obtained a loan from respondents Romeo Y. Tan and Roberto L. Obiedo (Tan and Obiedo), which was secured by a Real Estate Mortgage covering five parcels of land with Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) Nos. 29918, 38374, 38376, 39225 and 39232 located at Concepcion Pequeña, Naga City. As of March 2005, Ruby Shelter's outstanding debt amounted to PHP 95,700,620.00. In order to secure an extension for the re-payment of the loan, the parties executed a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) dated March 17, 2005, the pertinent portions of which are hereby reproduced:

1. That the FIRST PARTY is indebted to the SECOND PARTY in the aggregate sum of NINETY[-]FIVE MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED TWENTY PESOS [(PHP 95,700,620.00)], Philippine currency, covered by Real Estate Mortgages over five (5) parcels of land enumerated in paragraph 3 hereof.

2. That because of the FIRST PARTY's corporate offer to simultaneously execute Deeds of Absolute Sale over the properties as provided for and listed in paragraph 3 hereof, the SECOND PARTY here allows the FIRST PARTY to pay the said indebtedness, on or before [December 31, 2005]. Moreover, the SECOND PARTY hereby agrees to condone and/or write off the interests, penalties and surcharges from October 1, 2004 to December 31, 2005, or a total period of fifteen (15) months, amounting to SEVENTY[-]FOUR MILLION SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY[-]EIGHT THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FORTY[-]SEVEN PESOS [(PHP 74,678,647.00)].

3. Upon the execution hereof, and, by way of dacion en pago, the FIRST PARTY shall execute deeds of absolute sale to be uniformly dated January 2, 2006, over the following properties in favor of the SECOND PARTY, with the corresponding purchase prices, thus:

. . . .

4. The FIRST PARTY is here allowed to pay off the indebtedness covered by the Real Estate Mortgage, either by individual lots or the entire five (5) parcels of land as described in the immediately preceding paragraph, provided that the corresponding payment shall consider the earned and accrued interest and penalties, according to the following schedule: for parcel (a), the redemption sum shall be [PHP 25,328,939.00]; for parcel (b) the redemption money shall be [PHP 35,660,800.00]; for parcel (c) the redemption sum shall be [PHP 28,477,600.00]; for parcels (d) and (e) shall be [PHP 6,233,281.00].

5. If and when the FIRST PARTY is able to effect redemption of any of the property listed and enumerated in paragraph 3 hereof, the Deed of Absolute Sale dated [January 02, 2006] for the corresponding parcel of land shall be nullified and will have no force and effect and the SECOND PARTY shall then return the owner's duplicate copy of the certificate of title and shall likewise execute a Deed of Discharge of Mortgage.

6. In the event though that the FIRST PARTY shall not be able to tender any amount for the payment of the indebtedness corresponding to any of the parcel of land, then, the SECOND PARTY is hereby allowed to present the Deeds of Absolute Sale over the properties enumerated in paragraph 3 hereof, for registration with the Office of the Register of Deeds for Naga City so that the corresponding certificates of title in the name of the SECOND PARTY shall then be issued by the said Register of Deeds, after payment of necessary fees and taxes.

7. The parties hereby agree, if only to finally settle everything, to faithfully comply with and abide by their respective covenants; provided that if the FIRST PARTY shall contest, judicially or otherwise, any act, transaction, or event, related to or necessarily connected with this memorandum of agreement as well as the Deeds of Absolute Sale over the properties listed in paragraph 3 hereof, it hereby undertakes to indemnify the SECOND PARTY the amount of not less than TEN MILLION [PHP 10,000,000.00], Philippine currency, as liquidated damages, inclusive of costs and attorney's fees; provided still further that in the event that the FIRST PARTY shall contest the transaction, it shall obligate itself to pay off the condoned interests, surcharges and penalties in the amount of [PHP 55,167,000.00] (as stated in paragraph 2 hereof); provided finally, that should a contest be effected on this agreement, Mr. RUBEN SIA, obligates himself, jointly and severally with the FIRST PARTY, to assume personal obligation to effect the payments of the entire monetary obligations herein cited together with the FIRST PARTY.

8. In the alternative, the FIRST PARTY here agrees to execute deeds of sale over the five parcels of land listed in par. 3 hereof upon the execution of this agreement, in consideration for the receipt of FIVE MILLION PESOS [(PHP 5,000,000.00)] from the SECOND PARTY, in which case, the said sale shall constitute full payment (dacion en pago) and the FIRST PARTY'S entire liability is written off[.][6]

As a result, Ruby Shelter immediately executed separate Deeds of Absolute Sale, all dated January 3, 2006, covering the mortgaged properties in favor of Tan and Obiedo.[7]

On December 27, 2005, Ruby Shelter, through its president Ruben Sia (Sia), wrote a Letter[8] to Tan and Obiedo intimating its intention to redeem the properties and requesting for a meeting to discuss its concerns on the interests, surcharges, and penalties imposed on its original obligation. The parties met, but despite several dialogues, the parties failed to arrive at a mutually acceptable computation of the final amount.

Ruby Shelter claimed that on January 3, 2006, Tan and Obiedo prematurely caused the notarization of the deeds of absolute sale by respondent Atty. Tomas A. Reyes (Atty. Reyes). Tan and Obiedo allegedly made it appear that Sia personally appeared and ratified the instruments before Atty. Reyes.

Aggrieved by the premature notarization, Ruby Shelter filed a Complaint[9] mainly to annul the deeds of absolute sale, against Tan and Obiedo and Atty. Reyes (Tan et al.). Ruby Shelter averred therein that the deeds of sale are null and void for being pactum commissorium.

Tan et al. denied that the MOA constitutes a pactum commissorium and instead argued that Ruby Shelter voluntarily offered to execute the deeds of sale to ask for additional time to pay its outstanding debt and condonation of interest, penalties, and surcharges.

On March 23, 2006, Ruby Shelter filed an Amended Complaint[10] alleging that the titles of the mortgaged properties were already canceled, and new TCTs[11] were issued in the names of Tan and Obiedo.","Not all instances of alienation of mortgaged property by the debtor in favor of the creditor in the event of failure to timely pay the obligation will be declared void for being pactum commissorium. The prohibition does not extend to a mutual agreement between the debtor and the creditor that the property subject of the mortgage is sold to the latter to extinguish the obligation.
Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assailing the Amended Decision[2] of the Court of Appeals (CA), which reversed its earlier Decision[3] rendered on October 20, 2014. In the Amended Decision, the CA affirmed the Decision[4] and Order[5] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) which dismissed petitioner's complaint for annulment of deed of sale and declared that the parties had agreed to novate their earlier real estate mortgage.","The petition fails.

Tan et al. correctly argued that this case deserves outright dismissal for raising factual issues. In a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, the Court's scope of review is limited to questions of law. Factual issues are not within the province of the Court, as it is not a trier of facts[39] and is not required to reassess and recalibrate the oral and documentary evidence anew. The interpretation and construction of contracts are beyond the ambit of a petition for review on certiorari.[40] However, the Court, in exceptional circumstances, has the authority to review, and in proper cases, reverse the findings of the trial courts and appellate courts, viz.:

(1) when the findings are grounded entirely on speculation, surmises or conjectures; (2) when the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible; (3) when there is grave abuse of discretion; (4) when the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts; (5) when the findings of facts are conflicting; (6) when in making its findings the Court of Appeals went beyond the issues of the case, or its findings are contrary to the admissions of both the appellant and the appellee; (7) when the findings are contrary to the trial court; (8) when the findings are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based; (9) when the facts set forth in the petition as well as in the petitioner's main and reply briefs are not disputed by the respondent; (10) when the findings of fact are premised on the supposed absence of evidence and contradicted by the evidence on record; and (11) when the Court of Appeals manifestly overlooked certain relevant facts not disputed by the parties, which, if properly considered, would justify a different conclusion.[41] (Citation omitted)

The rule is settled that findings of the CA are conclusive on the parties and on this Court, and carry even more weight when the appellate court affirms the factual findings of the trial court.[42] The determination of the existence of pactum commissorium is a question of fact as it requires the court to look into contractual stipulations, and the intent of the parties.[43] Since Ruby Shelter raises arguments consisting mainly of factual matters, including questions on whether pactum commissorium is present, and because the findings of the courts a quo are supported by the evidence on record, the Court is not convinced that the instant petition merits exemption from the rule.

Regardless of the procedural defect inherent in this petition, the Court shall proceed to write finis on the substantive issues raised by Ruby Shelter.

The parties agreed to novate the
earlier loan agreement which resulted
in extinguishing the obligation by
way of dacion en pago

Article 1231 of the Civil Code provides the methods by which all civil obligations may be extinguished.[44] One of these modes is novation, which is defined as the extinguishment of an obligation by the substitution or change of the obligation by a subsequent one which terminates it, either by changing its objects or principal conditions, or by substituting a new debtor in place of the old one, or by subrogating a third person to the rights of the creditor.[45]

For novation to exist, the following elements must concur: (1) a previous valid obligation; (2) the agreement of all the parties to the new contract; (3) the extinguishment of the old contract; and (4) the validity of the new one. It is essential that there is consent of all the parties to the substitution, resulting in the extinction of the old obligation and the creation of a valid new one.[46]

As to essence, novation is classified as: (a) objective or real, where there is change in the cause, object or principal conditions of the obligation; (b) subjective or personal, where there is a substitution in the person of the debtor or a subrogation of the third person to the rights of the creditor; or (c) mixed, where there is a combination of objective and subjective novation.[47] As to form, novation may be expressed or implied as provided under Article 1292 of the Civil Code. As to extent, novation may be: (a) extinctive or total, where there is absolute extinguishment of the old obligation; or (b) partial or modified, where there is merely a modification of the old obligation.[48]

To gain proper perspective on the challenges raised by Ruby Shelter, We again quote the pertinent portions of the subject MOA:

1. That the FIRST PARTY is indebted to the SECOND PARTY in the aggregate sum of NINETY[-]FIVE MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED TWENTY PESOS [(PHP 95,700,620.00)], Philippine currency, covered by Real Estate Mortgages over five (5) parcels of land enumerated in paragraph 3 hereof[.]

2. That because of the FIRST PARTY's corporate offer to simultaneously execute Deeds of Absolute Sale over the properties as provided for and listed in paragraph 3 hereof: the SECOND PARTY here allows the FIRST PARTY to pay the said indebtedness, on or before [December 31, 2005]. Moreover, the SECOND PARTY hereby agrees to condone and/or write off the interests, penalties and surcharges from October 1, 2004 to December 31, 2005, or a total period of fifteen (15) months, amounting to SEVENTY[-]FOUR MILLION SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY[-]EIGHT THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FORTY[-]SEVEN PESOS [(PHP 74,678,647.00)].

3. Upon the execution hereof, and, by way of dacion en pago, the FIRST PARTY shall execute deeds of absolute sale to be uniformly dated January 2, 2006, over the following properties in favor of the SECOND PARTY, . . .

. . . .

4. The FIRST PARTY is here allowed to pay off the indebtedness covered by the Real Estate Mortgage, either by individual lots or the entire five (5) parcels of land as described in the immediately preceding paragraph, provided that the corresponding payment shall consider the earned and accrued interest and penalties, according to the following schedule . . .

5. If and when the FIRST PARTY is able to effect redemption of any of the property listed and enumerated in paragraph 3 hereof, the Deed of Absolute Sale dated [January 2, 2006] for the corresponding parcel of land shall be nullified and will have no force and effect and the SECOND PARTY shall then return the owner's duplicate copy of the certificate of title and shall likewise execute a Deed of Discharge of Mortgage.

6. In the event though that the FIRST PARTY shall not be able to tender any amount for the payment of the indebtedness corresponding to any of the parcel of land, then, the SECOND PARTY is hereby allowed to present the Deeds of Absolute Sale over the properties enumerated in paragraph 3 hereof, for registration with the Office of the Register of Deeds for Naga City so that the corresponding certificates of title in the name of the SECOND PARTY shall then be issued by the said Register of Deeds, after payment of [the] necessary fees and taxes.[49]

The parties disagree on how the MOA novated their previous loan agreement. For Ruby Shelter, the stipulations in the MOA merely changed the terms or mode of payment of the principal obligation; the immediate sale of the mortgaged realty only secured the payment of the principal obligation. On the other hand, Tan and Obiedo believe that there was an extinctive novation, in that Ruby Shelter's debt was extinguished by way of dacion en pago.

Both arguments are partially correct. We explain.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DENIED. The February 18, 2015 Amended Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 101180 is AFFIRMED WITH MODIFICATION. Ruby Shelter Builders and Realty Development Corporation, is ORDERED to PAY liquidated damages in the amount of PHP 10,000,000.00 with 6% interest per annum from the date of finality of this Decision until its full satisfaction."
"G.R. No. 169649, September 30, 2024","THE HEIRS OF THE LATE DOMINGO BARRAQUIO, NAMELY GLENN M. BARRAQUIO, MARIA M. BARRAQUIO, GREGORIO BARRAQUIO, DIVINA B. ONESA, URSULA B. REFORMADO, AND EDITHA BARRAQUIO, PETITIONERS, VS. ALMEDA INCORPORATED, RESPONDENT.","Respondent Almeda Incorporated thus filed its March 8, 2024 Motion for Reconsideration.[1]

Respondent argues that the certification adjudged as newly discovered evidence is hearsay evidence, without any probative value. Firstly, the person who issued it was not presented as a witness.[2] Further, while the certification was issued and signed by Arch. Jose O. Peña, its authenticity or validity was not established, considering petitioners did not show Arch. Peña's capacity or authority to sign it. Respondent likewise had no opportunity to cross-examine him.[3]

Respondent again also explains that the certification should not have been deemed new evidence, but suppressed or neglected evidence, considering it was in existence for six years before petitioners presented it in court. It points out that prior to the proceedings in the Supreme Court, petitioners did not avail of compulsory writs or obtain other evidence through the exercise of reasonable diligence.[4]

Respondent also argues that the Court of Appeals did not gravely abuse its discretion when it issued its July 23, 2008 Resolution.[5] When petitioners sought reconsideration, they explained that their failure to submit the documents was because of inadvertence and is an excusable negligence.[6] They thus sought the understanding of the Court, invoking meritorious grounds and the higher interest of substantive justice.[7] Respondent maintains that the Court of Appeals correctly held that failure to attach supporting papers is sufficient ground for dismissal.[8]

Respondent likewise reiterates that even if petitioners subsequently remedied the procedural lapses, petitioners are guilty of forum shopping.[9] It cites the Court of Appeals' finding that the parties, causes of action, and reliefs were similar. It highlights that petitioners did not mention that (a) G.R. No. 169649 was pending despite the cases being based on the same facts and discussion; (b) both Petitions sought the restoration of the CLOAs in petitioners' favor; and (c) this Court's judgment in G.R. No. 169649 will amount to res judicata in the other Petition.[10]

In their Comment on the Motion for Reconsideration,[11] petitioners heirs of Barraquio argue that respondent's Motion is a mere rehash of its arguments, which have been exhaustively discussed by this Court.[12] They thus quote this Court's ruling on all the issues raised in respondent's Motion for Reconsideration.[13]

In its Very Respectful Ex-Parte Motion to Resolve (Motion for Execution Pending Appeal),[14] citing their advanced age and that this case has been in litigation since April 21, 1999, petitioners pray that pending appeal, the Department of Agrarian Reform reconvey and the Register of Deeds of Sta. Rosa, Laguna reissue the CLOAs to them.[15]

Upon a judicious re-examination of the records, this Court grants respondent's Motion for Reconsideration.","On January 16, 2023, this Court rendered its Decision (January 2023 Decision) granting the Petitions in G.R. Nos. 169649 and 185594, and maintained the validity of the Certificates of Land Ownership Award (CLOAs) issued in favor of Domingo Barraquio.","Petitioners' Motion to Admit Newly Discovered Evidence should have been denied.

To recall, petitioners maintain that the subject property is classified as agricultural. To support this contention, in addition to other evidence, petitioners filed with this Court a Motion to Admit Newly Discovered Evidence on May 30, 2013, claiming that the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB) issued Certification No. 13-094-04 dated April 18, 2013 stating that the land covered by petitioners' CLOAs are agricultural land.[16] Pursuant to this, petitioners also obtained a Zoning Administration Certification from the City of Santa Rosa, Laguna, verifying that the land is agricultural (2013 Certifications). It states that the Zoning Administration Certification is based on Zoning Ordinance of 1981, or SB Municipal Ordinance No. 18, Series of 1981, dated September 9, 1981, as approved by HLURB Board Resolution No. R-36, Series of 1981, dated December 25, 1981.[17]

This Court finds that petitioners' Motion to Admit Newly Discovered Evidence failed to comply with the requirements for its grant.

Evidence is considered newly discovered if it may have already existed prior to or during trial, but the party offering did not know of its existence, or they could not have presented it during trial despite reasonable diligence.[18]

Rule 37, Section 1 of the Rules of Court[19] states:
RULE 37
New Trial or Reconsideration

SECTION 1. Grounds of and Period for Filing Motion for New Trial or Reconsideration. — Within the period for taking an appeal, the aggrieved party may move the trial court to set aside the judgment or final order and grant a new trial for one or more of the following causes materially affecting the substantial rights of said party:
(a)
Fraud, accident, mistake or excusable negligence which ordinary prudence could not have guarded against and by reason of which such aggrieved party has probably been impaired in his rights; or


(b)
Newly discovered evidence, which he could not, with reasonable diligence, have discovered and produced at the trial, and which if presented would probably alter the result.
As discussed in this Court's January 2023 Decision, the requisites to grant a motion for new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence are:
(1) the evidence was discovered after trial; (2) the evidence could not have been discovered and produced at the trial even with the exercise of reasonable diligence; (3) the evidence is material, not merely cumulative, corroborative, or impeaching; and (4) the evidence is of such weight that it would change the judgment if admitted.[20]
Rule 53 of the Rules of Court, as amended also has a provision for newly discovered evidence:
RULE 53
New Trial

SECTION 1. Period for Filing; Ground. — At any time after the appeal from the lower court has been perfected and before the Court of Appeals loses jurisdiction over the case, a party may file a motion for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence which could not have been discovered prior to the trial in the court below by the exercise of due diligence and which is of such a character as would probably change the result. The motion shall be accompanied by affidavits showing the facts constituting the grounds therefor and the newly discovered evidence. (1a)
Under Rule 53, the following requisites must be met: ""(a) the evidence could not have been discovered prior to the trial in the court below by exercise of due diligence; and (2) it is of such character as would probably change the result.""[21]

In addition to the stated requisites, the provisions are clear that there is a manner and time within which to raise the existence of newly discovered evidence: through a motion for new trial which must be raised within the period for taking an appeal. In Baclig v. Rural Bank of Cabugao, Inc.:[22]
[P]etitioner argues that newly-discovered evidence, consisting of a promissory note, shows that the Bank foreclosed the wrong obligation. However, the invocation of newly-discovered evidence is not proper in a Rule 45 petition. Firstly, under the Rules of Court, the existence of newly­-discovered evidence is raised in motions for new trial. Secondly, the motion raising the existence of such evidence is filed within the period for taking an appeal, or before the CA loses jurisdiction over the case. Here, not only is the newly-discovered evidence raised in a Rule 45 petition, the period for raising such matter had also already long lapsed.

Besides, petitioner failed to show that the supposed newly­-discovered evidence ""could not have been discovered and produced at trial even with the exercise of reasonable diligence.""[23] (Citations omitted)
In this case, the period to file a motion for new trial on newly discovered evidence has likewise lapsed. Under Rule 37 of the Rules of Court, petitioners ought to have requested for a new trial to present their newly discovered evidence within the period for taking an appeal. If they are filing their motion for new trial under Rule 53, it should have been filed at any time after the appeal from the lower court has been perfected and before the Court of Appeals loses jurisdiction over the case. Here, petitioners raised their newly discovered evidence after filing their Rule 45 Petition in the Supreme Court. Their motion is thus improper and filed out of time.

Delving now into the substantive requisites, this Court emphasizes that it is necessary to prove, not merely allege, that the evidence could not have been presented during the trial despite the exercise of reasonable diligence. The key to its nature as ""newly discovered"" is the failure to secure or locate the evidence despite the exercise of reasonable diligence before or during trial. The party claiming that a piece of evidence is newly discovered must thus establish why the evidence was not presented earlier.[24]

In Office of the Ombudsman v. Coronel,[25] this Court denied the motion for new trial on newly discovered evidence because the movant failed to prove that the evidence could not have been obtained during the investigation:
We are convinced that the Affidavits do not constitute ""newly discovered evidence."" Respondent did not prove that, even with reasonable diligence, she could not have obtained them during the investigation. There is no showing whatsoever that her corroborating witnesses hesitated or declined to give their testimonies.

As it is, the additional evidence offered by Coronel amount to no more than ""forgotten"" evidence, the belated uncovering of which would not have justified a reconsideration of the case. Forgotten evidence refers to evidence already in existence or available before or during a trial; known to and obtainable by the party offering it; and could have been presented and offered in a seasonable manner, were it not for the sheer oversight or forgetfulness of the party or the counsel. Presentation of forgotten evidence is disallowed, because it results in a piecemeal presentation of evidence, a procedure that is not in accord with orderly justice and serves only to delay the proceedings. A contrary ruling may open the floodgates to an endless review of decisions, whether through a motion for reconsideration or for a new trial, in the guise of newly discovered evidence. (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)
In this case, as stated in the January 2023 Decision, the 2013 Certifications were issued after the proceedings in the lower tribunals. Petitioners maintain that the 2013 Certifications could not have been produced at the earlier proceedings even with the exercise of reasonable diligence. It is suggested that the documents were suppressed.[26] However, petitioners did not sufficiently show this.","ACCORDINGLY, respondent's Motion for Reconsideration is GRANTED.

A ceasefire agreement between the government and the Moro National Liberation Front was signed on September 5, 1986 during the presidency of Corazon Cojuangco Aquino.[9] Thereafter, the people ratified the 1987 Constitution. It provided for the creation of the ARMM through an act of Congress. The ARMM was created through Republic Act No. 6734,[10] which took effect on August 1, 1989.[11]

On September 15, 1993, then President Fidel V. Ramos (President Ramos) issued Executive Order No. 125, which provided for a comprehensive, integrated, and holistic peace process with Muslim groups. Executive Order No. 125 created the Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process to give momentum to the peace talks with the Moro National Liberation Front.[12]

Then President Joseph Ejercito Estrada (President Estrada) continued the peace talks with the MILF during his term. The talks, however, were limited to cessation of hostilities. Both sides were given until December 1999 to conclude the peace process,[13] but they did not meet the deadline. In 2000, acts of violence escalated and the threats to the lives and security of civilians in Southern Mindanao increased. President Estrada then declared an ""all-out war"" against the MILF.[14]

Peace negotiations with the MILF resumed under the presidency of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. On March 24, 2001, a General Framework for the Resumption of Peace Talks between the government and the MILF was signed. Republic Act No. 9054[15] was also enacted on March 31, 2001 and took effect on August 14, 2001, seeking to strengthen and expand the Organic Act for the ARMM. Through this, six municipalities in Lanao del Norte voted for their inclusion in the ARMM.

On August 5, 2008, the Arroyo administration drafted the Memorandum of Agreement on Ancestral Domain and pursued negotiations with the MILF. It outlined the creation of a Bangsamoro Juridical Entity, a proposed subdivision of the Philippines which would cover portions of Mindanao and Palawan. However, negotiations fell through on October 14, 2008 when this Court, in Province of North Cotabato v. GRP,[16] declared the Memorandum of Agreement on Ancestral Domain unconstitutional. This Court held that the treatment of the Bangsamoro Juridical Entity as an associative state is unconstitutional, as the Constitution recognizes only one state, that is the Philippine state.[17]

On October 15, 2012, the Philippine government, under then President Benigno S. Aquino III (President Aquino III), and the MILF executed the Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro, which strengthened the dialogue between the two parties. On December 17, 2012, by virtue of Executive Order No. 120,[18] President Aquino III instituted the Bangsamoro Transition Commission to create a draft of the Bangsamoro Basic Law.[19] The attached documents of the Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro were completed in January 2014.[20] On March 27, 2014, the government then signed the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro, which consolidated and affirmed the understanding and commitment between the Philippine government and the MILF, including the agreements, guidelines, statements, and terms of reference signed and acknowledged from 1997 to 2014.

The culmination of the decades-long struggle, negotiations, and policy­making happened when Republic Act No. 11054[21] or the Bangsamoro Organic Law was signed into law by then President Rodrigo Roa Duterte (President Duterte) on July 27, 2018.[22] Pursuant to the Bangsamoro Organic Law, the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) issued Resolution No. 10425,[23] which set the rules on the conduct of a plebiscite for its ratification.

The Bangsamoro Organic Law provided for the establishment of a political entity for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) and its corresponding basic governmental structure. The law further provides for the Bangsamoro identity, territorial jurisdiction, government, basic rights, justice system, national defense and security, fiscal autonomy, and regional economy. It declares that the establishment of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region and the determination of its territorial jurisdiction shall take effect upon the law's ratification by majority of the votes cast in a plebiscite.

On October 17, 2018, the Province of Sulu, represented by its Governor Abdusakur A. Tan II (Governor Tan), filed a Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition[24] with an Urgent Prayer for the Issuance of Temporary Restraining Order and/or writ of Preliminary Injunction before this Court. It urges this Court to declare unconstitutional the Bangsamoro Organic Law and to enjoin the conduct of the plebiscite for its ratification. This Petition was docketed as G.R. No. 242255.

The Province of Sulu argues that the Bangsamoro Organic Law violates several constitutional provisions when it: (1) abolished the ARMM, a constitutional creation which can be abolished only through constitutional amendment;[25] (2) provided for a parliamentary form of government in BARMM without an Executive or Legislative branch, wherein the chief minister is elected by the parliament and not the people;[26] (3) automatically included the present geographical area of ARMM in the territory of BARMM;[27] (4) denied the people of the Province of Sulu the option to join or not join BARMM;[28] (5) erased the autonomy and identity of the indigenous people in the Province of Sulu;[29] and (6) designated the MILF to lead the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, in violation of the equal protection clause.[30]

As a response to the Petition of the Province of Sulu, the League of Bangsamoro Organizations, Inc., represented by its president, Hashim B. Manticayan, sent a Letter[31] dated November 5, 2018 to this Court, asking that the Petition of the Province of Sulu be junked. It argues that the creation of BARMM is constitutional and essential for peace to flourish in Mindanao. This Court subsequently noted the Letter in its January 29, 2019 Resolution.[32]

In a November 6, 2018 Resolution, this Court required the respondents in G.R. No. 242255 to file a comment on the Province of Sulu's Petition within 10 days from notice thereof.[33]

On December 10, 2018, the Province of Sulu filed an Omnibus Motion[34] to set the case for oral arguments with a prayer for the immediate issuance of a temporary restraining order and/or preliminary injunction to stop the conduct of the plebiscite. However, this Court resolved to defer action on the Omnibus Motion until such time when the comment to the Petition has been filed.[35]

On December 11, 2018, the Philippine Constitution Association (PHILCONSA) also filed a Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition with a Prayer for the Issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction[36] before this Court, assailing the constitutionality of the Bangsamoro Organic Law and praying that all ""projects or activities grounded or emanating from [Republic Act No. 11054]"" and Executive Order No. 120 be halted.[37] This Petition was docketed as G.R. No. 243246.

PHILCONSA mainly argues that the ARMM and the Cordilleras are the only autonomous regions recognized in the Constitution and the Congress, on its own, cannot make a new entity like BARMM.[38]

It also lists all other supposed constitutional infirmities found in the Bangsamoro Organic Law in that: (1) the establishment of BARMM is not supported by the Constitution; (2) the provisions of the Bangsamoro Organic Law unduly expanded the legislative powers of an autonomous region; (3) it infringes on the rights and identities of indigenous people by lumping together Lumads with the Bangsamoro people; (4) the Constitution does not allow the creation of special courts for commercial and criminal cases; (5) it gives the Bangsamoro government the power to declare nature reserves, aquatic parks, forests, watershed reservations, and other protected areas—a power which only belongs to the Congress; (6) it gives BARMM the capacity to enter into foreign trade relations even though this is solely a presidential function; (7) it unduly gives BARMM the power to have its own economy; (8) it allows BARMM to create a separate flag; (9) the BARMM parliament usurped the Congress' power to grant tax exemptions; (10) it also unduly gives the parliament the power to create government-owned and -controlled corporations; (11) it illegally allows that some of the national taxes be given to BARMM; and (12) it gives BARMM the power to contract foreign loans, a power solely vested in the president.[39]

On January 7, 2019, the Philippine Association of Islamic Accountants, Inc., represented by its president, Amanoding D. Esmail, filed a Motion for Leave to File Intervention[40] and attached its Answer-in-Intervention,[41] opposing the Province of Sulu's Petition in G.R. No. 242255.

The Philippine Association of Islamic Accountants, Inc. argues that: (1) the Constitution does not limit Congress from passing subsequent legislations establishing, strengthening, or abolishing the ARMM;[42] (2) the parliamentary government provided under the Bangsamoro Organic Law is part of the Philippine political order[43] and does not run afoul the separation of powers and checks and balances, since the Bangsamoro government would still be a subsidiary state of the Philippine government;[44] (3) the provision in the Bangsamoro Organic Law directing the ARMM to vote as one in the plebiscite conforms to the equal protection principle and does not discriminate against any province or city;[45] (4) the designation of the MILF as the lead in the Bangsamoro Transition Authority passed the test of the equal protection clause;[46] (5) the Bangsamoro Organic Law is designed to protect the religious minority and promote the general welfare of the Bangsamoro and the people of Muslim Mindanao;[47] (6) the Bangsamoro Organic Law is a social justice legislation made in compliance with the country's commitment to implement the 2007 United Nations Declaration for the Rights of the Indigenous Peoples;[48] and (7) petitioner Governor Tan of the Province of Sulu lacks legal standing since he failed to show personal or material interest that will be prejudiced or affected adversely by the passage of the law.[49]

On the same day, Algamar A. Latiph, Musa Malayang, and Pendatun B. Disimban (collectively, Latiph et al.) also filed an Urgent Motion[50] for this Court to admit their Comment-in-Intervention,[51] which also opposes the Province of Sulu's Petition. They pray that the constitutionality of the Bangsamoro Organic Law be upheld.","This Court resolves the consolidated Petitions for Certiorari and Prohibition with prayers for Temporary Restraining Orders and/or Preliminary Injunctions filed under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, seeking to: (1) declare unconstitutional Republic Act No. 11054, otherwise known as the Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (Bangsamoro Organic Law, for brevity); and (2) enjoin the conduct of a plebiscite for its ratification.

The struggle of the Bangsamoro people for self-determination can be traced as far back as the early days of imperialism.[3] However, it was the 1968 Jabidah Massacre, when young Tausug and Sama men were massacred by Philippine Army officers in the island of Corregidor, which sparked the armed conflict between the Philippine military forces and Muslim armed opposition groups. The Jabidah Massacre gave birth to the establishment of Moro separatist groups such as the Moro Independence Movement, and eventually, the Moro National Liberation Front.[4]

The declaration of Martial Law in 1972 became a catalyst for the rebellion of the Moro National Liberation Front against the government. This took a political and financial toll on the administration of then President Ferdinand E. Marcos, Sr. (President Marcos), prompting it to pursue the 1976 Tripoli Agreement with the Moro National Liberation Front. The Agreement ""provided the general principles for Muslim autonomy in the Philippine South.""[5]

President Marcos immediately implemented the Tripoli Agreement. He issued Presidential Proclamation No. 1628, ""Declaring Autonomy in Southern Philippines."" A plebiscite was conducted in the provinces covered under the Tripoli Agreement. Further, the Legislative enacted Batas Pambansa Blg. 20, ""Providing for the Organization of Sangguniang Pampook (Regional Legislative Assembly) in Each of Regions IX and XII."" President Marcos then ordered the creation of Autonomous Region IX and XII.[6]","Province of North Cotabato held that the concept of association is not recognized under our Constitution:
No province, city, or municipality, not even the ARMM, is recognized under our laws as having an ""associative"" relationship with the national government. Indeed, the concept implies powers that go beyond anything ever granted by the Constitution to any local or regional government. It also implies recognition of the associated entity as a state.[408] (Emphasis in the original)
Thus, the Court declared it as unconstitutional:
The [Memorandum of Agreement on Ancestral Domain] cannot be reconciled with the present Constitution and laws. Not only its specific provisions but the very concept underlying them, namely, the associative relationship envisioned between the GRP and the [Bangsamoro Juridical Entity], are unconstitutional, for the concept presupposes that the associated entity is a state and implies that the same is on its way to independence.[409] (Emphasis in the original)
The character of the relationship between the national government and the Bangsamoro remains within constitutional parameters. This is demonstrated by three provisions.

First, embodying Article X of the Constitution, the relationship expands delegated legislative authority to the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, as previously listed. These are beyond those typically granted to local government units, while retaining the general supervisory powers of the president over it.[410]

Second, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region was created by Congress, through an organic act, which is assailed here. The Bangsamoro Organic Law defines its government structure, with the Executive department and Legislative Assembly.

Finally, the national government retains ""[a]ll powers, functions, and responsibilities not granted by the Constitution or by national law to the Bangsamoro Government.""[411]

In Disomangcop, we explained that decentralization ensures effective regional autonomy, allowing local government units to exercise a level of self-determination distinct from the central government:
A necessary prerequisite of autonomy is decentralization.

Decentralization is a decision by the central government authorizing its subordinates, whether geographically or functionally defined, to exercise authority in certain areas. It involves decision-making by subnational units. It is typically a delegated power, wherein a larger government chooses to delegate certain authority to more local governments. Federalism implies some measure of decentralization, but unitary systems may also decentralize. Decentralization differs intrinsically from federalism in that the sub-units that have been authorized to act (by delegation) do not possess any claim of right against the central government.

Decentralization comes in two forms—deconcentration and devolution. Deconcentration is administrative in nature; it involves the transfer of functions or the delegation of authority and responsibility from the national office to the regional and local offices. This mode of decentralization is also referred to as administrative decentralization.

Devolution, on the other hand, connotes political decentralization, or the transfer of powers, responsibilities, and resources for the performance of certain functions from the central government to local government units. This is a more liberal form of decentralization since there is an actual transfer of powers and responsibilities. It aims to grant greater autonomy to local government units in cognizance of their right to self-government, to make them self-reliant, and to improve their administrative and technical capabilities.[412] (Citations omitted)
Then in Limbona v. Mangelin,[413] we discussed two types of autonomy:
[A]utonomy is either decentralization of administration or decentralization of power. There is decentralization of administration when the central government delegates administrative powers to political subdivisions in order to broaden the base of government power and in the process to make local governments ""more responsive and accountable,"" and ""ensure their fullest development as self-reliant communities and make them more effective partners in the pursuit of national development and social progress."" ...

Decentralization of power, on the other hand, involves an abdication of political power in the favor of local governments units declared to be autonomous. In that case, the autonomous government is free to chart its own destiny and shape its future with minimum intervention from central authorities. According to a constitutional author, decentralization of power amounts to ""self-immolation,"" since in that event, the autonomous government becomes accountable not to the central authorities but to its constituency.","ACCORDINGLY, the application for the issuance of a temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction in G.R. Nos. 242255 and 243246, and the Motion for Inhibition in G.R. No. 243246 are DENIED for lack of merit.

"G.R. No. 265195, September 09, 2024","IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR ISSUANCE OF A WRIT OF AMPARO IN FAVOR OF HENRY V. TAYO, JR., ALIAS ""MAGELAN TAYO,"" HIEZEL V. TAYO, MERLINA V. TAYO, AND HENRY C. TAYO, SR., PETITIONERS, VS. PMAJ JOERY T. PUERTO, STATION COMMANDER OF BACOLOD CITY POLICE STATION 8, PSSG ROBERTO P. GAURANA, JR., DUTY JAILER OF BACOLOD CITY POLICE STATION 8, AND PATROLMAN GARRY BUGANOTAN, DESK OFFICER/RECORDS CUSTODIAN OF BACOLOD CITY POLICE STATION 8, RESPONDENTS.","On September 27, 2022, at around 11:30 a.m., Tayo, Jr. was arrested and detained at Bacolod City Police Station 8 (BCPS 8), owing to separate complaints for theft filed by Genoveva B. Bona (Bona) and Melleza Basco Besana (Besana). When both Bona and Besana did not pursue their case, Tayo, Jr. was released to Besana and five barangay tanods of Barangay Singcang-Airport at around 11:30 p.m. of the same day.[4]

After Tayo, Jr.'s supposed release from the police station, his family did not hear from or see him, prompting them to proceed to the police station to inquire as to his whereabouts. However, respondents, who were officers of the BCPS 8, namely, Police Major Joery T. Puerto (PMAJ Puerto), station commander, Police Staff Sergeant Roberto P. Guarana, Jr. (PSSg Guarana, Jr.),[5] duty jailer, and Patrolman Garry Buganotan (Pat Buganotan), desk officer/records custodian (PMAJ Puerto et al.), informed them that they had already released Tayo, Jr. together with Besana. At that point, PMAJ Puerto et al. showed them a video clip recorded by Pat Buganotan where Tayo, Jr. appeared, signing the release logbook.[6]

Unconvinced, the Tayo family requested a copy of the CCTV footage of Tayo, Jr. leaving the police station. Thereupon, PMAJ Puerto assured them that they would be furnished the footage once available.[7]

In the interstice, the Tayo family sought the assistance of the Regional Office of the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) and the Public Attorney's Office (PAO), which soon sent requests[8] to the police officers of BCPS 8 to produce the footage. As there was no response, the Tayo family went to NAPOLCOM to seek further assistance.[9]

Subsequently, PMAJ Puerto, accompanied by several police officers, went to the house of the Tayo family to inform them that an investigation into Tayo, Jr.'s whereabouts was being conducted and that an information technology (IT) personnel was already assigned to retrieve the footage. Despite this, no progress was made, prompting the Tayo family to request for help from the Regional Office of the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG).[10]

Distressed that they were given the runaround, the Tayo family instituted before the RTC a Petition for a Writ of Amparo with Prayer for Issuance of a Production Order[11] against PMAJ Puerto et al. Finding the petition sufficient in form and substance, the RTC issued an Order dated January 13, 2023, directing the branch clerk of court to issue a writ of amparo, and PMAJ Puerto et al. to file a verified written return within 72 hours from the service thereof.[12]

In their Verified Return[13] dated January 16, 2023, PMAJ Puerto et al. averred that the Tayo family failed to show, through substantial evidence, that they were responsible for Tayo, Jr.'s disappearance. Moreover, there was no showing of any refusal on their part to provide information on his whereabouts. Even with the assistance of their IT specialist, Police Corporal Junel Valladarez Tornea (PCpl Tornea), the footage which showed Tayo, Jr. leaving the police station could not be retrieved, as their recording device could only store up to five days of data.[14]

PMAJ Puerto et al. also accompanied the Tayo family to the barangay hall of Barangay Pahanocoy, where they obtained a different footage of Tayo, Jr. supposedly boarding a tricycle headed north. Upon further investigation, Tayo, Jr. was last seen by one Arthur Deocadez (Deocadez) on board a tricycle with an unidentified individual at around 5:10 p.m. of September 30, 2022.[15]

During the scheduled summary hearing, the Tayo family decried that the footage shown to them in Barangay Pahanocoy was blurry. Despite multiple requests, they were unable to access any clear footage of Tayo, Jr. Upon the other hand, Besana, one of the complainants for theft, and to whom Tayo, Jr. was supposedly released, avouched that PMAJ Puerto et al. made her sign the release logbook when, in truth and in fact, she did not witness Tayo, Jr. leave the police station.[16] She stated in her Judicial Affidavit,[17] thusly—
On September 27, 2022 around 11:30pm, I was able to sign the logbook for the release of Magelan Tayo;

On September 27, 2022 around 11:30pm I saw Magelan Tayo at Bacolod City Police Station 8 but I and the five (5) other barangay kagawads who went [there] left after signing the logbook for the release of Magelan Tayo;

After I signed the logbook for his release, Magelan Tayo was left there at Bacolod City Police Station 8 and I went home;

On September 28, 2022 around 8:00am, I went to the house of petitioners and informed them that HENRY V. TAYO, JR. has allegedly been released to my knowledge;

The last time I saw Magelan Tayo was at [the] Bacolod City Police Station 8 on September 27, 2022 around 11:30pm while we were signing the logbook[.][18]
Similarly, Joenick B. Francisco (Francisco), one of the barangay tanods who accompanied Besana to the police station, avowed that they did not see Tayo, Jr. leave the police station.[19]

For their part, PMAJ Puerto et al. maintained that Tayo, Jr.'s family failed to show, through substantial evidence, that they had a hand in Tayo, Jr.'s disappearance, and that they refused to provide information on his whereabouts.[20] Pat Buganotan explicated that he was unable to take a video recording of Tayo, Jr. leaving the police station because he was then simultaneously performing functions as ""the jailer, the desk officer, and the radio operator"" and that ""he ended the recording of the video when he had to answer the radio.""[21]

Meanwhile, PCpl Tornea testified that in late October 2022, PMAJ Puerto summoned him to assist in the retrieval of the requested footage. However, upon inspection, he discovered that the footage was defective and could ""only show the live view of the scene captured.""[22]

In due course, the RTC rendered the assailed Decision,[23] dismissing the Petition for a Writ of Amparo and denying the prayer for the issuance of a Production Order for want of substantial evidence. The RTC held that there was no showing of any refusal on the part of PMAJ Puerto et al. to provide information on Tayo, Jr.'s whereabouts. Thus, his disappearance ""after his release from the custody of BCPS 8 lacks the indispensable element of government participation.""[24]

Aggrieved, the Tayo family lodged the present Petition for Review on Certiorari[25] before this Court, ascribing error on the part of the RTC in dismissing their Petition for a Writ of Amparo and denying their prayer for the issuance of a Production Order. They propound the following reasons: first, they attribute suspicious behavior to the police officers, as Pat Buganotan admitted during cross-examination that his act of taking Tayo, Jr.'s video while he was signing the release logbook deviated from the standard police procedure; and second, Pat Buganotan's ""explanation that he was not able to take a video of [Tayo, Jr.] actually walking out of the station because he answered the radio is unbelievable, if not highly suspicious, since failing to capture that moment (which is the most important) would defeat his purpose of taking the video[.] ""[26]

By the same token, the Tayo family bemoaned lack of cooperation and coordination among the police officers, citing PCpl Tornea's confirmation ""that BCPS 8 never sent him any request for the repair of their CCTV as he was only requested to access the same on October 23, 2022 or almost a month after the petitioners had requested for a copy of the footage.""[27] Accordingly, the Tayo family entreat the Court to reverse the RTC's ruling and grant the following reliefs:
A writ of amparo be issued against respondents PMAJ JOERY T. PUERTO, Station Commander of Bacolod City Police Station 8, [PSSg] ROBERTO P. GAURANA, JR., Duty Jailer of Bacolod City Police Station 8, and PATROLMAN GARRY BUGANOTAN, Desk Officer/Records Custodian of Bacolod City Police Station 8;

A Production Order be issued pursuant to Section 14 (c) of A.M. No. 07-9-12-SC or the Rule on the Writ of Amparo commanding the police officers of BCPS 8 to produce and permit inspection of documents, as well as the production and copying of the CCTV footage relating to the alleged release of Henry V. Tayo, Jr. on September 27, 2022; and

An Order commanding the respondents to locate the whereabouts of Henry V. Tayo, Jr., alias ""Magelan,"" and upon locating him, to turn over his custody to the herein petitioners.[28]
On August 1, 2023, the Court issued a Notice of Resolution,[29] requiring PMAJ Puerto et al. to submit their Comment on the Petition.[30] Complying therewith, PMAJ Puerto et al. averred in their Comment[31] that the RTC committed no reversible error in dismissing the Petition for a Writ of Amparo and denying the issuance of a Production Order.

In their Reply,[32] the Tayo family iterated their reasons in the Petition for Review on Certiorari, namely: one, PMAJ Puerto et al. failed to explain why they sent the request to access the footage to PCpl Tornea ""only on October 23, 2022 or almost a month after the Tayo family requested for a copy of the footage;""[33] two, the police officers' negligence and failure to provide the footage evinced their ""refusal to give information on the fate or whereabouts"" of Tayo, Jr.[34]; and three, Pat Buganotan's act of taking Tayo, Jr.'s video while he was signing the release logbook showed hallmarks of suspicious behavior as it was highly irregular and deviated from the standard procedure.[35]","At the pith of this Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] is the Decision[2] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) in Spec. Pro. No. 23-2935, which dismissed the Petition for the Issuance of a Writ of Amparo with Prayer for the Issuance of a Production Order[3] filed by petitioners Hiezel V. Tayo, Merlina V. Tayo, and Henry C. Tayo, Sr. (collectively, Tayo family) for the purported enforced disappearance of Henry V. Tayo, Jr., alias ""Magelan Tayo"" (Tayo, Jr.).","The Petition is impressed with merit.

Section 19[36] of the Rule on the Writ of Amparo[37] is explicit that both questions of fact and law can be raised before the Court in a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45. As a rule then, the Court is not bound by the factual findings made by the lower court which rendered the judgment in a petition for the issuance of the writ of amparo.[38]

Withal, Section 1 of the Rule on the Writ of Amparo defines a petition for a writ of amparo as ""a remedy available to any person whose right to life, liberty, and security is violated or threatened with violation by an unlawful act or omission of a public official or employee, or of a private individual or entity.""

The Court promulgated the Amparo Rule ""in light of the prevalence of extralegal killings and enforced disappearances"" in the country. It was an exercise for the first time of the Court's expanded power to promulgate rules to protect our people's constitutional rights, which made its maiden appearance in the 1987 Constitution in response to the Filipino experience of the martial law regime. As the Amparo Rule was intended to address the intractable problem of ""extralegal killings"" and ""enforced disappearances,"" its coverage, in its present form, is confined to these two instances or to threats thereof.[39]

Two years after the promulgation of the Amparo Rule, Congress enacted Republic Act No. 9851,[40] which provided the first statutory definition of enforced or involuntary disappearance[41]—
Section 3. For purposes of this Act, the term:

. . . .

(g) ""Enforced or involuntary disappearance of persons"" means the arrest, detention, or abduction of persons by, or with the authorization, support or acquiescence of, a State or a political organization followed by a refusal to acknowledge that deprivation of freedom or to give information on the fate or whereabouts of those persons, with the intention of removing them from the protection of the law for a prolonged period of time.
In Navia v. Pardico,[42] the elements constituting ""enforced disappearance"" as statutorily defined under Section 3(g) of Republic Act No. 9851[43] are enumerated as follows:
(1)
[T]hat there be an arrest, detention, abduction or any form of deprivation of liberty;


(2)
[T]hat it be carried out by, or with the authorization, support or acquiescence of, the State or a political organization;


(3)
[T]hat it be followed by the State or political organization's refusal to acknowledge or give information on the fate or whereabouts of the person subject of the amparo petition; and,


(4)
[T]hat the intention for such refusal is to remove subject person from the protection of the law for a prolonged period of time.[44]
Likewise, the Amparo Rule ordains that, in order for the court to render judgment granting the privilege of the writ, the petitioner must be able to discharge the burden of proving the allegations in the petition by the standard of proof required, i.e., substantial evidence.[45] More than a mere scintilla, substantial evidence is such relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might determine as adequate to support a conclusion.[46]

Thence, for the protective writ of amparo to issue, allegation and proof that the persons subject thereof are missing are not enough. It must also be shown and proved by substantial evidence that the disappearance was carried out by or with the authorization, support or acquiescence of the State or a political organization, followed by a refusal to acknowledge the same or give information on the fate or whereabouts of said missing persons, with the intention of removing them from the protection of the law for a prolonged period of time. Simply put, the petitioner in an amparo case has the burden of proving by substantial evidence the indispensable element of government participation.[47]","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is GRANTED.

On April 13, 2014 at about 12:00 noon in front of xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx, Bukidnon, Philippines, within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, JOEMARIE UBANON Y MAN-AN Alias JOEMARIE FRANCESCO alias Alex and AMIRAH MACADATAR Alias OMERA, conspiring, confederating and mutually helping one another, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and criminally recruit, transport, transfer, harbor and provide [c]omplainants [AAA270934], 14 years old, [BBB270934] 14 years old and [CCC270934], 15 years old, under the pretext of domestic employment for the purpose of forced labor, slavery or involuntary servitude to the damage and prejudice of Complainants in such amount as maybe allowed by law.

Contrary to and in violation of Section 4(a), [Republic Act No.] 9208 in relation to Section 6(a) and Section 10(c), [Republic Act No.] 9208.[2]
When arraigned, Joemarie pleaded ""not guilty."" Trial then ensued.

The prosecution offered as evidence the birth certificates and testimonies[3] of private complainants AAA270934, BBB270934, and CCC270934.[4]

Private complainants testified that on April 14, 2014, they were watching a Manny Pacquiao fight at xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx. While taking a break in a motorela, a person who introduced himself as Joemarie, approached them and offered them work as onion peelers in xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx, with a monthly wage of PHP 2,500.00. AAA270934 expressed her desire to work and told Joemarie that they would go home first to ask permission from their parents. However, Joemarie insisted that the employer was already waiting for them. Joemarie instructed AAA270934's brother to inform their parents about their employment, then brought private complainants to xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.[5]

Joemarie accompanied private complainants to the house of Amirah's daughter, DDD.[6] He told them to watch television while waiting for DDD. Soon after, DDD arrived. Joemarie turned up the television volume and had a private conversation with DDD. Then, they all took a motorela to the bus terminal at xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx. At the terminal, Joemarie instructed private complainants to board the bus with DDD. After reaching xxxxxxxxxxxxxx, private complainants wanted to get off the bus but DDD stopped them. Private complainants and DDD arrived at Iligan City and took a van to Marawi City. By the time the van reached Marawi City, private complainants were already afraid and hungry. They had dinner and rested at Amirah's house. The next day, private complainants were brought to different homes.[7]

AAA270934 was taken to Talyugon, Lanao del Sur where she worked as a domestic helper to a Maranao family. While AAA270934 was fetching water at a common faucet, she met BBB270934 and discovered that the latter also performed domestic work. After two weeks, AAA270934 tearfully told her employer that she was homesick. AAA270934's employer comforted her and assured her that she would contact Amirah, AAA270934 then learned from her employer that her mother already received PHP 2,000.00 and that she would be given an additional PHP 2,000.000 before going home. However, AAA270934 did not receive the money. AAA270934 was eventually reunited with BBB270934 and CCC270934.[8]

BBB270934 was also brought to Talyugon, Lanao del Sur where she worked as a domestic helper to a Maranao family for two weeks. She was not paid for her service. Meanwhile, CCC270934 was brought to Iligan City, where she worked as a house helper. Like AAA270934 and BBB270934, CCC270934 was not paid for her labor.[9]

Amirah subsequently took private complainants to xxxxxxxxxxx and turned them over to AAA270934's father at the xxxxxxxxxxx Police Station. She then returned to Marawi City.[10]

Joemarie denied the accusations. He asserted that Amirah used to be his wife's employer. Joemarie claimed that on April 13, 2014, at 12:00 p.m., he was at the jeepney terminal bound for San Fernando, Bukidnon. There, three girls and a boy approached him and asked if he knew someone who could provide them with work. Joemarie referred them to Amirah and took them to her house. Before leaving, Joemarie reminded private complainants to ask permission from their parents. He maintained that he just wanted to help private complainants, who are his fellow indigenous people.[11]

On June 24, 2021, the Regional Trial Court (RTC) convicted Joemarie for qualified trafficking in persons:[12]
WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court finds Joemarie Ubanon alias Jomarie Francisco alias Alex guilty beyond reasonable doubt for Qualified Trafficking and sentences him to life imprisonment and pay a fine of [PHP 2,000,000.00] without eligibility for parole. He is also directed to pay [AAA270934], [BBB270934] and [CCC270934] the sum of [PHP] 200,000.00 as moral damages and [PHP] 100,000.00 as exemplary damages with interest at 6% per annum until full payment.

Joemarie Ubanon alias Jomarie Francisco alias Alex shall serve sentence at Davao Penal Farm and Prison, Dujali, Davao del Norte. His preventive suspension at BJMP xxxxxxxxxxx is fully credited in the service of his sentence.

The charge against Amirah Macadatar alias Omera is archived pending her arrest. Let alias warrant of arrest issue against her.

SO ORDERED.[13]
The RTC found all the elements of trafficking in persons present. Through deception and moral ascendancy, Joemarie recruited private complainants to work in a distant place as house helpers without their consent and without receiving compensation for their labor.[14]

Joemarie elevated the case to the CA.[15] Joemarie lamented that the prosecution failed to prove his involvement in the crime. Specifically, there was insufficient evidence to show that he had taken part in transporting the victims to Marawi City for forced labor.[16]

In its Brief, the People of the Philippines, through the Office of the Solicitor General, submitted that Joemarie's false offer of employment, refusal to let the victims seek permission from their parents, and instruction to accompany Amirah's daughter to Marawi City, showed a unity of action and purpose with Amirah to recruit and transport the victims as house helpers and subject them to forced labor.[17]

On August 25, 2023, the CA affirmed Joemarie's conviction for qualified trafficking in persons but deleted the phrase ""without eligibility for parole"", thus:[18]
WHEREFORE, the Appeal is DENIED. The Judgment of the Regional Trial Court, 10th Judicial Region, Branch xxxxxxxxxxx, Bukidnon, dated 24 June 2021, in Criminal Case No. 25601-14val, is hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION that the phrase ""without eligibility for parole"" in the dispositive portion is DELETED.

SO ORDERED.[19] (Emphasis in the original)
Hence, this recourse.[20] Joemarie now challenges his conviction by reiterating that the prosecution failed to establish his participation in recruiting and transporting the victims to Marawi City for forced labor.[21]","The present appeal assails the August 25, 2023 Decision[1] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 03063-MIN which affirmed the conviction of Joemarie Ubanon y Man-an alias ""Jomare Francesco"" alias ""Alex"" (Joemarie) for qualified trafficking in persons under Section 4, in relation to Section 6(a) and Section 10(c) of Republic Act No. 9208, as amended by Republic Act No. 10364.","The appeal lacks merit.

In criminal cases, an appeal throws the entire case wide open for review and the reviewing tribunal can correct errors, though unassigned in the appealed judgment, or even reverse the trial court's decision based on grounds other than those that the parties raised as errors. The appeal confers the appellate court full jurisdiction over the case and renders such court competent to examine records, revise the judgment appealed from, increase the penalty, and cite the proper provision of the penal law.[22]

Guided by these precepts, the Court will now determine whether the CA and the RTC correctly found the accused-appellant Joemarie Ubanon y Man-an guilty, including the appropriate penalty and damages.

Accused-appellant is guilty of qualified trafficking in persons

Section 3(a) of Republic Act No. 9208, as amended, defines ""trafficking in persons"" as:
(a) Trafficking in Persons — refers to the recruitment, transportation, transfer or harboring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders by means of threat or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction. fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the persons, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person for the purpose of exploitation which includes at a minimum, the exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs.
The elements of trafficking in persons, which consist of the acts performed, the means employed, and the purpose of the accused, are as follows: (1) The act of recruitment, transportation, transfer or harbouring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders; (2) the means used, which include threat or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the person, or the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another; and (3) the purpose of trafficking being for exploitation which includes exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs.[23]

Section 3(d) of Republic Act No. 9208 defines the term ""forced labor and slavery"" as ""the extraction of work or services from any person by means of enticement, violence, intimidation or threat, use of force or coercion, including deprivation of freedom, abuse of authority or moral ascendancy, debt-bondage or deception.""[24]

Trafficking is qualified when the trafficked person is a child.[25] Section 3(6) of Republic Act No. 9208, as amended, defines ""child"" as ""a person below 18 years of age or one who is over 18 but is unable to fully take care of or protect [themself] from abuse, neglect, cruelty, exploitation, or discrimination because of a physical or mental disability or condition."" The crime is also qualified if committed on a large scale or against three or more persons, individually or as a group.[26]

The prosecution established all these elements beyond reasonable doubt. AAA270934, BBB270934, and CCC270934 positively testified that Accused­-appellant convinced them to work as onion peelers in a nearby town. He introduced the victims to DDD and accompanied them to the bus terminal. He directed the victims to board the bus with DDD, who subsequently brought them to Amirah in Marawi City. There, private complainants were deployed to work as domestic helpers without compensation.[27] The three victims were all minors under Section 3(b) of Republic Act No. 9208, as proven by their birth certificates. Accused-appellant took advantage of the victims' vulnerability as minors and their eagerness to earn money. CCC270934 testified:
Q:
[CCC270934], do you know Joemarie Ubanon?
A:
No.
....


Q:
When he talked to you whether you want to work as onion peeler, you agreed, am I correct?
A:
Yes, because Joemarie said that ______________ and ______________ [sic] were there.


Q:
You agreed because you yourselves wanted to work?
A:
Yes, because I know ______________ [sic], Ma'am.
....


Q:
You went with him because you wanted to work, am I correct?
A:
Yes.[28]
Accused-appellant inveighed that he simply accompanied AAA270934, BBB270934, and CCC270934 to DDD's house. There is no direct evidence that he participated in transporting the victims to Marawi City to render forced labor.

We disagree.","ACCORDINGLY, the appeal is DENIED. The Decision dated August 25, 2023 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 03063-MIN is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION.

He is ORDERED to pay a fine of PHP 2,000,000.00, and is ORDERED to pay moral damages of PHP 500,000.00 and exemplary damages of PHP 100,000.00 to each of the minor victim, AAA270934, BBB270934, and CCC270934.

(b) Child — refers to a person below eighteen (18) years of age or one who is over eighteen (18) but is unable to fully take care of or protect himself/herself from abuse, neglect, cruelty, exploitation, or discrimination because of a physical or mental disability or condition.
Meanwhile, Section 4 of Republic Act No. 9208, as amended, enumerates the acts that constitute trafficking in persons, thus:
SECTION 4. Acts of Trafficking in Persons. — It shall be unlawful for any person, natural or juridical, to commit any of the following acts:

HEIRS OF BURGOS MALAYA, REPRESENTED BY CAESAR SAUL MALAYA, PURIFICACION MALAYA, GINA M. MERANO, CHEREMIE MERANO, AND REGIE MALAYA, RESPONDENTS.","In 1952, Leodegario Musico (Musico) served as caretaker of a cocoland owned by Domingo Gutierrez (Gutierrez) in Romblon, Romblon. When Gutierrez died, his daughter, Araceli Gutierrez-Orola (Orola), took over the management of their property.[5]

Sometime later, Musico moved to Manila to work as a foreperson for Orola's husband. Musico's daughter Florsita and her husband, Ulderico Rodeo (the Rodeo spouses), continued to take care of Gutierrez's land. When Orola died, Gutierrez's grandson, Burgos Malaya (Burgos), was appointed as administrator of the estate.[6]

Upon Burgos's death, his heirs, represented by Reynaldo M. Malaya, entered into a Kasunduan[7] with the Rodeo spouses. It allowed the Rodeo Spouses to reside in the property for free while taking care of the land.[8]

In 2009, one of Burgos's children, Ceasar Saul Malaya, allegedly ordered the Rodeo spouses to vacate the property. He also asked his relatives to harvest the coconuts without the consent of Florsita or Ulderico.[9]

As such, the Rodeo spouses filed a Complaint[10] before the Office of the Provincial Adjudicator, claiming they were bona fide tenants of the property, and thus, entitled to the security of tenure.[11]

The Complaint filed was decided by the Office of the Regional Adjudicator. In its Decision,[12] the Office of the Regional Adjudicator dismissed the Complaint for lack of merit.[13] It found that the Rodeo spouses failed to establish all the elements of a tenancy relationship, particularly the requisite that there be sharing of harvests of the property. It also noted that the Rodeo spouses filed the case not against the landowner, but only against the heirs of Burgos, who used to be the administrator of the property.[14] Moreover, the Rodeo spouses could not state the ratio of the sharing of harvests between them and the heirs of Burgos.[15]

On appeal by the Rodeo spouses,[16] the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board issued a Decision[17] on January 29, 2019, affirming the ruling. It likewise held that the Rodeo spouses failed to establish all the elements of a tenancy relationship. Aside from the missing element of sharing of harvest, it also found lacking the element of consent by the landowner. It ruled that the Rodeo spouses' cultivation was only germane to fulfilling their obligations as caretakers of the land. Absent consent and sharing of harvests, the Rodeo spouses were only cultivators of the property.[18]

The Board found that Musico himself was not a tenant; as such, the Rodeo spouses cannot succeed as tenants.[19] It also ruled that they cannot claim that they are tenants in their own right since they could not produce any piece of evidence that there was sharing of harvests.[20]

In its September 29, 2021 Decision,[21] the Court of Appeals denied the Petition for Review filed by the Rodeo spouses. Again, it found that they failed to establish the elements of consent and sharing of harvests and that they were not installed as tenants under the Kasunduan.[22]

In a September 19, 2022 Resolution,[23] the Court of Appeals denied the Rodeo spouses' Motion for Partial Reconsideration.[24]

Thus, the Rodeo spouses filed their Petition[25] before this Court against the heirs of Burgos. They argue that there is a written implied tenancy between the parties in the Kasunduan, and that they had cultivated the land and shared the harvest with respondents.[26]

In their Comment,[27] respondents counter that there is no agricultural leasehold relationship.[28] They add that the lower tribunals have already settled the issues raised by petitioners.[29]

This Court resolves whether the Court of Appeals erred in denying the Petition for Review on the ground that there is no tenancy relationship between the parties.

We deny the Petition.","Cultivating the land of another does not automatically mean that an agricultural leasehold relation arises between the tiller and the landowner. The party claiming to be an agricultural lessee must show that the elements of an agricultural leasehold are present to be afforded protection under our agrarian laws.

This Court resolves the Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] assailing the Decision[2] and Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board rulings[4] finding that there is no agricultural leasehold relation between the parties.","This Court resolves whether the Court of Appeals erred in denying the Petition for Review on the ground that there is no tenancy relationship between the parties.

I

A look at the long history of agrarian laws in our country, and how they evolved from share tenancy to agricultural leasehold, is in order.

Before the Spanish colonial period, land ownership in the Philippines was through a communal system. The produce harvested from the land were shared equally. But this system of communal land ownership changed when the Spaniards arrived.[30] They ""purchased communal lands from heads of the different barangays and registered the lands in their names.""[31] Then, all lands not privately owned were deemed owned by the State.[32]

The Spanish colonial period also introduced the encomienda system.[33] The caretaker of the land was called the encomendero. Natives who tilled the lands under the encomienda system could not own the land or its produce. Instead, they were required ""to pay tribute to their encomenderos.""[34]

The hacienda system was like the encomienda system. Those who tilled the hacienda could also not own the land or its produce despite their hard work. It was a system of forced labor, akin to slavery.[35]

Vestiges of the encomienda and hacienda systems could be seen in our earlier agricultural tenancy laws.

Act No. 4054, or the Philippine Rice Share Tenancy Act, defined the contract of share tenancy as ""one whereby a partnership between a landlord and a tenant is entered into, for a joint pursuit of rice agricultural work with common interest in which both parties divide between them the resulting profits as well as the losses.""[36] In Pineda v. Pingul,[37] this Court explained the policy behind the law:
The Rice Share Tenancy Law, Act No. 4054, as amended by Commonwealth Act No. 178 and Republic Act No. 34, intended to protect the interests of both the landlord and the tenant, without infringing upon or curtailing the proprietary rights of the landlord or owner, was undoubtedly conceived mainly to redeem the tenant from his life of misery, want and oftentimes oppression, arising from onerous terms of his tenancy. Side by side with this objective, and in obedience to the declared principle of promoting social justice to insure the well-being and economic security of all the people (Constitution, Article 11, Section 5), and to the mandate to afford protection to labor and to regulate the relations between landowner and tenant (Constitution, Article XIV, Section 6), the Rice Share Tenancy Law was also aimed at the upliftment of the social and financial status of the tenant.[38]
Act No. 4054, as amended, was eventually superseded by Republic Act No. 1199, which classified agricultural tenancy into either leasehold tenancy or share tenancy. Section 4 states:
SECTION 4. Systems of Agricultural Tenancy; Their Definitions. — Agricultural tenancy is classified into leasehold tenancy and share tenancy.

Share tenancy exists whenever two persons agree on a joint undertaking for agricultural production wherein one party furnishes the land and the other his labor, with either or both contributing any one or several of the items of production, the tenant cultivating the land personally with the aid of labor available from members of his immediate farm household, and the produce thereof to be divided between the landholder and the tenant in proportion to their respective contributions.

Leasehold tenancy exists when a person who, either personally or with the aid of labor available from members of his immediate farm household, undertakes to cultivate a piece of agricultural land susceptible of cultivation by a single person together with members of his immediate farm household, belonging to or legally possessed by, another in consideration of a price certain or ascertainable to be paid by the person cultivating the land either in percentage of the production or in a fixed amount in money, or in both.
The definition of leasehold tenancy was amended in Republic Act No. 2263. Section 4, as amended, states:
Leasehold tenancy exists when a person who, either personally or with the aid of labor available from members of his immediate farm household, undertakes to cultivate a piece of agricultural land susceptible of cultivation by a single person together with members of his immediate farm household, belonging to or legally possessed by, another in consideration of a fixed amount in money or in produce or in both. (Emphasis supplied)
As the years passed, it became apparent that share tenancy did not work in favor of the tenant-farmers.[39] In 1963, Republic Act No. 3844, or the Agricultural Land Reform Code, was signed into law. It abolished agricultural share tenancy, declaring it as contrary to public policy.[40] Republic Act No. 6389 later amended Republic Act No. 3844 and converted all existing contracts of share tenancy into agricultural leasehold.[41]

The main difference between agricultural leasehold and share tenancy is that an agricultural leasehold relation is not extinguished ""by mere expiration of the term or period in a leasehold contract nor by the sale, alienation or transfer of the legal possession of the landholding.""[42] It also allows the lessee to purchase the land tilled because it provides for a lessee's right of preemption[43] and redemption,[44] as the case may be.

In 2009, Republic Act No. 9700 repealed Section 53 of Republic Act No. 3844.[45] Other than that, the provisions of Republic Act No. 3844 not expressly repealed and remain consistent with subsequent laws still have suppletory effect.

The most recent agrarian reform law is Republic Act No. 11953, or the New Agrarian Emancipation Act. The law condones the principal debt of agrarian reform beneficiaries subject to certain requirements.[46] It also protects the rights to just compensation of landowners whose agricultural lands were subjected to the agrarian reform program.[47]

Our agrarian reform laws primarily aim to uplift the lives of agricultural lessees while recognizing the rights of landowners to have a share in the harvest or to receive a fixed amount of money.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DENIED.

That on or about January 13, 2011 in the city of Manila, Philippines, the said accused, with intent to kill, with treachery and evident premeditation and taking advantage of superior strength, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and use personal violence upon JET LEE REYES y DAQUIL, by then and there stabbing her with a kitchen knife on the abdomen, thereby inflicting upon the latter a mortal stab wound which was the direct and immediate cause of her death thereafter.

Contrary to law.[5]
Upon Aspiras' request, a preliminary investigation was conducted by Assistant City Prosecutor Lourdes A. Gatdula, who eventually issued a Resolution dated May 3, 2011 affirming the finding of probable cause to indict Aspiras for murder. The Resolution was approved by both Senior Assistant City Prosecutor Maria Gene Z. Julianda-Sarmiento and then City Prosecutor Jhosep Y. Lopez. Aspiras' subsequent Motion for Reconsideration was denied in a Resolution dated August 1, 2011.[6]

Aspiras pleaded not guilty during arraignment.[7]

During the pre-trial conference, the prosecution and defense stipulated on ""the date and place of the crime[,] the knife used in the stabbing, [and] the fact that the victim died after [Aspiras] stabbed her.""[8]

Aspiras was released on bail after posting a cash bond. Trial on the merits then ensued.[9]

Cleopatra Reyes (Cleopatra), the mother of the victim, Jet Lee Reyes (Jet Lee) testified that Jet Lee and Aspiras are common law spouses. They live with her in a three-storey house located at 409 Moriones Street, Tondo, Manila, with the spouses occupying the room at the third floor, while she and her granddaughters occupy the room at the second floor.[10]

At 6:00 p.m. on January 13, 2011, Rio, a friend of the Reyes family, arrived with a bottle of Emperador brandy. Rio invited Aspiras for a drinking spree while playing cards. The two were later joined by Jet Lee and three others, Aiza, Jersey and Jellie. The drinking spree ended at around 10:00 p.m.[11]

While Cleopatra was resting in her room, she overheard Aspiras and Jet Lee arguing while they were going up to the third floor. Afterwards, Cleopatra heard Jet Lee screaming for help and shouting that she was stabbed by Aspiras. Cleopatra hurriedly went out of her room to check on Jet Lee. She met the half-naked Aspiras descending from the third floor with bloodied hands.[12]

Shortly after, Cleopatra saw Jet Lee also going down the stairs and holding onto her bloodied side. She embraced Cleopatra and said ""mommy sinaksak po ako ni Kenneth."" Cleopatra immediately asked for help from their neighbor and brought Jet Lee to Mary Johnston Hospital in Juan Nolasco Street, Tondo, Manila. Jet Lee died shortly thereafter.[13]

Cleopatra also testified that Aspiras and Jet Lee usually argue ""because of jealousy, especially since Jet Lee was a dance instructor and she usually goes home with pictures of her male students.""[14]

Aiza Padillo (Padillo), a friend of the couple, ""testified that sometime in September 2010, while Jet Lee was in her house, Aspiras suddenly arrived and dragged Jet Lee to the bathroom. [Padillo] alleged that [Aspiras] hit Jet Lee and exclaimed 'hindi ka pakikinabangan ng iba sisirain ko mukha mo.' ""Aiza asserted that Aspiras is the jealous type who has the tendency to hurt another person.""[15]

On cross-examination, Padillo averred that she knew about Aspiras' jealousy because Jet Lee told her about it. She had also witnessed Aspiras' jealousy whenever all three of them are together. When someone stares at Jet Lee, Aspiras gets angry then inflicts harm or utters hurtful words against Jet Lee, such as ""lumalandi ka na naman."" Padillo revealed that Aspiras pulls Jet Lee's hair, slaps her or kicks her because of jealousy.[16]

Jersey Reyes (Jersey), Jet Lee's brother, testified that one time, Aspiras became silent and upset during a drinking spree after Jet Lee purportedly said something wrong. The next day, Jet Lee already had a contusion, but he was told not to interfere. Jersey affirmed that when he was still living in the Reyes' house, he would hear Aspiras and Jet Lee quarreling since their rooms were adjacent to each other. At the time of the incident though, he was no longer living in the house. He was the one who found the knife in the couples' room and turned it over to the police.[17]

PO2 James G. Lagasca, the investigating officer assigned to the case, testified that Aspiras was shouting ""hindi ko sinasadya"" while visibly drunk in the police station.[18]

Dr. Jesille Cui Baluyot, the medico-legal officer who examined Jet Lee's body, declared that ""Jet Lee sustained two stab wounds: a defensive wound on the right shoulder and a fatal wound on the right abdomen; as well as hematoma on the lateral side of the right eye.""[19]

For his part, Aspiras claimed that after the drinking session, he went up to their room, washed Jet Lee's uniform and hung them in the bathroom. Then, he rejoined the people conversing in the sala until he fell asleep. An angry Jet Lee then woke him up, and both of them went up to their room.[20]

After going to their room, Aspiras claimed he slept but was awakened by Jet Lee, who was mad because her clothes were hung in the bathroom and not outside the house. Aspiras noticed that Jet Lee was holding a knife on her right hand. He told Jet Lee to put the knife down but she refused and thrust the knife toward Aspiras' stomach. He was able to parry the thrust and tried to wrest the knife from Jet Lee's hand. ""Nag-aagawan po kami, naghilahan kami ng kutsilyo"" averred Aspiras. Afterwards, Jet Lee suddenly shouted ""Ahhh"" holding the right side of her body. Aspiras saw blood where the knife pierced Jet Lee's body. He claimed he did not intend to stab her.[21]

Aspiras got rattled and ran downstairs, leaving Jet Lee. He saw Jet Lee's mother in the stairway, who asked him what happened. He replied, Jet Lee 'may saksak'. He continued running away from the house when he met a neighbor, Liza. He told her to help Jet Lee. He felt blank until the police arrested him.[22]

On cross-examination, Aspiras admitted that he was the jealous type, but only when he and Jet Lee were still a new couple.[23]","This Court resolves a Petition for Review[1] assailing the Court of Appeals Decision,[2] which affirmed with modification, the Regional Trial Court Decision[3] convicting petitioner of homicide, and its Resolution[4] denying petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration.","The issues for resolution are: first, whether or not the Court of Appeals erred in not annulling and setting aside the Regional Trial Court's Decision for lack of jurisdiction since the Information was not signed and approved by the City Prosecutor as required under Rule 112, Section 4 of the Rules of Court; and second, whether or not the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the petitioner's conviction for homicide.

The Petition is denied.

I

The Information filed against petitioner was signed by Assistant City Prosecutor Francisco L. Salomon, and was approved ""for the City Prosecutor"" by Assistant Chief, Inquest Division, Prosecutor Elaine Y. Cerezo.[30] The accompanying certification of the Assistant City Prosecutor also stated that it was filed with the prior authority of the City Prosecutor.

Petitioner contends that the Information did not comply with Rule 112, Section 4[31] of the Rules of Court requiring prior written authority or approval of the City or Provincial Prosecutor. Hence, the criminal case must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.[32]

The Court of Appeals, in rejecting petitioner's contention, held:
Perusal of the Information showed that although there is no signature or indication of an express approval of the City Prosecutor, there is a stamp which stated that the same was approved ""for the City Prosecutor,"" in addition to the certification of the Assistant City Prosecutor that it was filed with the prior authority of the City Prosecutor. Aside from this, there is no question that Kenneth asked for a preliminary investigation even after the conduct of inquest and before his arraignment. In any case, the records show that the Resolution dated May 3, 2011 in relation to the preliminary investigation was signed by the City Prosecutor. Additionally, the said Resolution stated that the Information was approved by the Chief Inquest Prosecutor. Furthermore, the filing of the said Information enjoys the presumption of regularity. In view of these, this Court finds no convincing reason to invalidate the Information.[33]
We agree with the Court of Appeals.

Essentially, petitioner questions the correctness of the accompanying certification in the Information, if it was filed with the prior approval of the City Prosecutor. This is a factual matter that is not proper to be resolved in a Rule 45 petition. More importantly, petitioner did not file a motion to quash[34] before he entered his plea, but raised his objection for the first time on appeal before the Court of Appeals. Such failure amounts to a waiver on his part to question the purported defect.

In Gomez v. People,[35] this Court held that the lack of written authority or approval to file the Information is a waivable ground for a motion to quash information. This Court further clarified that the requirement of a prior written authority or approval of the city or provincial prosecutor is a matter of procedure, and does not affect the validity of the Information nor the jurisdiction of the court over the subject matter and the person of the accused.
Lack of prior written authority or approval on the face of the Information by the prosecuting officers authorized to approve and sign the same has nothing to do with a trial court's acquisition of jurisdiction in a criminal case.","WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Petition is DENIED. The Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 38333 is AFFIRMED. Accused KENNETH KARL ASPIRAS y CORPUZ is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Homicide, and is sentenced to suffer an indeterminate penalty of seven (7) years of prision mayor, in its minimum period, as minimum, to fourteen (14) years of reclusion temporal in its minimum period, as maximum.

"G.R. No. 257483, October 30, 2024","SONIA BALAGTAS, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","This Court resolves the Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] filed by Sonia Balagtas (Balagtas) assailing the Decision[2] and Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA), which affirmed the Decision[4] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC). The RTC found Balagtas guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of qualified theft.[5]

The instant case stemmed from an Information[6] filed against Balagtas, the accusatory portion of which states:
That on or about the period comprised from June, 2006 to February 2007, in Quezon City, Philippines, the above-named accused being then employed as an Operation Manager of VISATECH INTEGRATED CORPORATION and represented by ANTHONY GALORPO located at 200 Pluto Street, Brgy. Bahay Toro, this City, and as such have free access to the property stolen, with grave abuse of confidence reposed upon her by the said company, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously, with intent of gain and without the knowledge and consent of the owner thereof, take, steal and carry away cash money in the amount of Php304,569.38, Philippine Currency, which represents six (6) payroll periods which she padded belonging to said VISATECH INTEGRATED CORPORATION, to the damage and prejudice of the said offended party in the amount aforementioned.","In cases of qualified theft committed with grave abuse of confidence, the prosecution must first establish the existence of a relationship of confidence between the offended party and the accused. If the prosecution fails to prove this relationship any subsequent claims of grave abuse of confidence would be unfounded.","The Petition is partly meritorious.

Balagtas argues that: (1) there is no direct evidence proving the first element of qualified theft, i.e., the taking of PHP 304,569.38;[29] (2) the evidence is inconsistent and unsubstantiated, and one witness denies payroll padding;[30] and (3) the evidence against her were illegally obtained.[31]

We shall address these arguments in sequence.

The elements of qualified theft committed with grave abuse of confidence as defined under Articles 308 and 310 of the Revised Penal Code are:
(1) taking of personal property; (2) said property belongs to another; (3) said taking be done with intent to gain; (4) that the taking be done without the owner's consent; (5) that it be accomplished without the use of violence or intimidation against persons, nor of force upon things; and (6) that it be done with grave abuse of confidence.[32]
Balagtas argues that the prosecution failed to present any direct evidence proving the first element because nobody allegedly saw her pad the payroll and pocket the total amount of PHP 304,569.38.[33]

This argument has no merit.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is PARTIALLY GRANTED. The September 23, 2020 Decision and the September 24, 2021 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 41206 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION in that Sonia Balagtas is found guilty of simple theft and is sentenced to suffer the penalty of imprisonment for an indeterminate period of six months of arresto mayor, as minimum, to four years and two months of prision correccional, as maximum. Sonia Balagtas is further ORDERED to PAY Visatech Integrated Corporation the amount of PHP 304,569.38 with legal interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of finality of this Decision until full payment."
"G.R. No. 268094, October 30, 2024","PEAKPOWER SAN FRANCISCO, INC., PETITIONER, VS. ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION, RESPONDENT.","PSFI operates a 1 x 5.2 MV (Gross) Wartsila 12V32 Bunker/Diesel-fired power plant located at the ASELCO Office Compound. The power plant is contracted exclusively to ASELCO and directly connected to its distribution system. ASELCO is a distribution utility (DU) that uses the PSFI Power Plant primarily as a peaking plant and as an intermediate source of electricity, especially when there is a supply shortage from the Mindanao Grid.[4] This agreement is covered by a PPTA between PSFI and ASELCO, which was executed on May 29, 2013 (First PPTA).[5]

On December 8, 2014, PSFI and ASELCO negotiated and executed another PPTA (Second PPTA) contract for an additional Wartsila 12V32 generating unit (additional unit) at the PSFI Power Plant under substantially the same terms and conditions as the First PPTA. Under their agreement, PSFI would finance, build, and operate the unit, and then transfer it to ASELCO at the end of the term of the PPTA for the additional unit.[6]

On June 11, 2015, the Department of Energy (DOE) issued Department Circular No. DC2015-06-0008 (2015 DOE Circular) requiring all distribution utilities to procure their power supply agreements (PSAs) exclusively through a Competitive Selection Process (CSP). The main features of a CSP-compliant operations were provided as follows:

Section 3. Standard Features in the Conduct of CSP. After the effectivity of this Circular, all Dus shall procure PSAs only through CSP conducted through a Third Party duly recognized by the ERC and the DOE. In the case of ECs, the Third Party shall also be duly recognized by the National Electrification Administration (NEA).[7]

On April 28, 2016, ASELCO and PSFI filed an application for the approval of their Second PPTA with prayer for the issuance of provisional authority.[8]

On October 7, 2016, the ERC granted the prayer for the issuance of provisional authority and issued an Order and Notice of hearing, setting the Application for hearing, on the determination of its compliance with jurisdictional requirements, expository presentation, pre-trial conference, and presentation of evidence.[9]

On May 8, 2017, the ERC granted provisional authority to ASELCO and PSFI for the implementation of their Second PPTA. The dispositive portion of that Order states:","This Court resolves a Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition With Application for the Issuance of Temporary Restraining Order and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction[1] filed before this Court by Peakpower San Francisco, Inc. (PSFI), assailing the September 11, 2019 Order[2] (First Order) and the March 1, 2023 Order[3] (Second Order) (collectively, assailed orders) of the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC), which dismissed PSFI's and Agusan Del Sur Electric Cooperative, Inc. (ASELCO)'s application for the approval of their Power Purchase and Transfer Agreement (PPTA).","The Rules of Court are clear regarding the proper appeal from decisions and final decisions of quasi-judicial agencies, which include the ERC:

RULE 43

Appeals From the Court of Tax Appeals and Quasi-Judicial Agencies
to the Court of Appeals

Section 1. Scope. — This Rule shall apply to appeals from judgments or final orders of the Court of Tax Appeals and from awards, judgments, final orders or resolutions of or authorized by any quasi-judicial agency in the exercise of its quasi-judicial functions. Among these agencies are the Civil Service Commission, Central Board of Assessment Appeals, Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of the President, Land Registration Authority, Social Security Commission, Civil Aeronautics Board, Bureau of Patents, Trademarks and Technology Transfer, National Electrification Administration, Energy Regulatory Board, National Telecommunications Commission, Department of Agrarian Reform under Republic Act No. 6657, Government Service Insurance System, Employees Compensation Commission, Agricultural Invention Board, Insurance Commission, Philippine Atomic Energy Commission, Board of Investments, Construction Industry Arbitration Commission, and voluntary arbitrators authorized by law.[20]

Clearly, the decisions and final orders of the Energy Regulatory Board, predecessor of the respondent,[21] are explicitly included as those which are subject to the remedy of appeal, first to the Court of Appeals. In determining whether an order from quasi-judicial agencies is interlocutory or final, jurisprudence provides that a final order is one that ""finally disposes of, adjudicates or determines the rights, or some rights of the parties, either on the controversy of some definite and separate branch thereof, and which concludes them until it is reversed or set aside.""[22] Such final orders are a proper subject of appeal, not certiorari.

In this case, the respondent's assailed Orders clearly disposed of the controversy over petitioner's application when it dismissed the same with prejudice and directed it and ASELCO to stop implementing their Second PPTA immediately. Also, the assailed Orders terminated, without prejudice to any rate adjustment, the provisional authority granted to ASELCO and petitioner. Given the adjudication on the controversy, the proper appeal should have been lodged with the appropriate court within 15 days from petitioner's receipt of the final order.

Nevertheless, it is an established principle in case law that the mere availability of an appeal is not a sufficient ground to prevent a party from making use of the extraordinary remedy of certiorari:

[A]lthough Section 1, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court provides that the special civil action of certiorari may only be invoked when ""there is no appeal, nor any plain speedy and adequate remedy in the course of law,"" this rule is not without exception. The availability of the ordinary course of appeal does not constitute sufficient ground to prevent a party from making use of the extraordinary remedy of certiorari where the appeal is not an adequate remedy or equally beneficial, speedy and sufficient. It is the inadequacy—not the mere absence—of all other legal remedies and the danger of failure of justice without the writ, that must usually determine the propriety of certiorari.[23]

Given the potential injustice or injurious effects of the assailed Orders in this case, the mere presence of the remedy of appeal should neither preclude the parties from availing of a certiorari, nor should it prevent this Court from entertaining it.

II.
The CSP Requirement in the 2015 DOE Circular, its effectivity, and its mandatory nature, is unequivocal
At the outset, it bears emphasizing that the mandatory nature and effectivity of the CSP requirement in the 2015 DOE Circular is not in dispute.

The petitioner was created by the EPIRA, which declares the following State policies:

(b) To ensure the quality, reliability, security and affordability of the supply of electric power;
(c) To ensure transparent and reasonable prices of electricity in a regime of free and fair competition and full public accountability to achieve greater operational and economic efficiency and enhance the competitiveness of Philippine products in the global marker;
(d) To enhance the inflow of private capital and broaden the ownership base of the power generation transmission and distribution sectors in order to minimize the financial risk exposure of the national government;
. . . .
(f) To protect the public interest as it is affected by the rates and services of electric utilities and other providers of electric power.[24]

The EPIRA likewise states that generation of electric power shall be competitive and open.[25] For the distribution sector, which includes ASELCO, the EPIRA is clear that DUs shall have the obligation to supply electricity in the least costly manner to its captive market, subject to the collection of distribution retail supply rate duly approved by respondent.[26] Finally, with the objective of market competition in the interest of consumers, the EPIRA states that DUs may enter into bilateral power supply contract subject to review by ERC.[27] This provision unequivocally requires approval from the respondent before the execution of any power supply agreement, such as the Second PPTA in this case.

With this as the legal and policy backdrop, the DOE issued the 2015 DOE Circular mandating all DUs to undergo a competitive selection process in securing power supply agreements (PSAs). It stated the following general principles:

Section 1. General Principles. Consistent with its mandate, the DOE recognizes the Competitive Selection Process (CSP) in the procurement of PSAs by the DUs ensures security and certainty of electricity prices of electric power to end-users in the long-term. Towards this end, all CSPs undertaken by the DUs shall be guided by the following principles:

(a) Increase the transparency needed in the procurement process in order to reduce risks;
(b) Promote and instill competition in the procurement and supply of electric power to all electricity end-users;
(c) Ascertain least-cost outcomes that are unlikely to be challenged in the future as the political and institutional scenarios should change; and
(d) Protect the interest of the general public.

The 2015 DOE Circular included a provision that the ""[respondent] in coordination with the DOE shall issue supplemental guidelines and procedures to properly guide the DUs and the Third Party in the design and execution of the CSP.""[28] Nevertheless, the same Circular already detailed the standard features in the conduct of CSP:

Section 3. Standard Features in the Conduct of CSP. After the effectivity of this Circular, all DUs shall procure PSAs only through CSP conducted through a Third Party duly recognized by the ERC and this DOE. In case of ECs, the Third Party shall also be duly recognized by the National Electrification Administration (NEA).

Under this Circular, CSPs for the procurement of PSAs of all DUs shall observe the following:

(a) Aggregation for un-contracted demand requirements of DUs;
(b) Annually conducted; and
(c) Uniform template for the terms and conditions in the PSA to be issued by the ERC in coordination with the DOE.

Verily, the effectivity of the 2015 Circular placed the DUs, including ASELCO, under obligation to reform their process of selecting contractors from the power generation companies, without any qualification by the ERC, with the objective of security and certainty in electricity prices.

We quote below the entirety of Section 43 of the EPIRA, prescribing the functions of the ERC, and there is absolutely nothing whatsoever in this complete enumeration of the ERC's functions that grants the ERC rule­ making power to supplant or change the policies, rules, regulations, or circulars prescribed by the DOE. The ERC's functions, as granted by the EPIRA, are limited, inter alia, to the enforcement of the implementing rules and regulations of the EPIRA, and not to amend or revoke them. At most, as stated in paragraph (m) of Section 43, the ERC may only take any other action delegated to it pursuant to EPIRA. The ERC may not exceed its delegated authority.[29]

In the Alyansa case, this Court was unequivocal about the effectivity of the CSP requirements:

Section 5 of the 2015 DOE Circular states the non-retroactivity of the Circular's effect.

Section 5. Non-Retroactivity. This Circular shall have prospective application and will not apply to PSAs with tariff rates already approved and/or have been filed for approval by the ERC before the effectivity of this Circular.

Clearly, PSAs filed with the ERC after the effectivity of the 2015 DOE Circular must comply with CSP as only PSAs filed ""before the effectivity"" of the Circular are excluded from CSP.

Section 10 of the 2015 DOE Circular provides for its effectivity:

Section 10. Effectivity. This Circular shall take effect immediately upon its publication in two (2) newspapers of general circulation and shall remain in effect until otherwise revoked. (Boldfacing added)

The 2015 DOE Circular took effect upon its publication on 30 June 2015 in the Philippine Daily Inquirer and the Philippine Star. Section 10 expressly declares that the ""Circular [....] shall remain in effect until otherwise revoked."" Indisputably, CSP became mandatory as of 30 June 2015. Taking all these provisions together, all PSAs submitted to the ERC after the effectivity of the 2015 DOE Circular, on or after 30 June 2015, are required to undergo CSP.[30] (Emphasis supplied)

Hence, the CSP requirement itself is prospective in application because it only comes into effect for PSA applications submitted to the ERC after June 30, 2015, which was the effectivity date of the 2015 DOE Circular.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Certiorari filed by Peakpower San Francisco, Inc. is GRANTED. The September 11, 2019 Order and the March 1, 2023 Order issued by the Energy Regulatory Commission in ERC Case No. 2016-064 RC are REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

PONDOC, IN THEIR CAPACITY AS COMMISSIONERS, ALL OF THE COMMISSION ON AUDIT, RESPONDENTS.","Petitioner Edito A.G. Balintona (petitioner) was a former Mayor of the Municipality of Sarrat, Ilocos Norte (the Municipality). During his term, the Municipality received financial assistance from the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) allocation of Congressman Roque R. Ablan, Jr. (Ablan), former Representative of the First District of Ilocos Norte (First District). In three separate transactions in 2009 and 2010, a total of PHP 30,000,000.00 PDAF funds was returned to Ablan through the 1st District Monitoring Office, in the sequence of events that follows:

First Fund Transfer

On December 19, 2008, an Advice of NCA Issued[4] signed by then Department of Budget and Management (DBM) Secretary Rolando G. Andaya, Jr., (Andaya) informed the Director of DBM Regional Office No. 1 of cash allocation in the amount of PHP 10,000,000.00 issued for credit to the said Regional Office's account. The stated purpose of the funds is ""[t]o cover the cash requirements of the Municipality of Sarrat, Ilocos Norte for priority programs and projects in the 1st District, Ilocos Norte, authorized under Special Allotment Release Order (SARO) No. ROCS-08-09458 dated November 25, 2008, issued per request of Congressman Roque R. Ablan, Jr., 1st District, Ilocos Norte, chargeable against the [Fiscal Year (FY)] 2008 Budget, R.A. 9498.""[5]

Pursuant to the Advice, Atty. Janet B. Abuel (Abuel), Director IV of the DBM Regional Office No. 1 sent to petitioner a Notice of Funding Check Issued[6] dated December 24, 2008. The Notice stated that the amount of PHP 10,000,000.00 was deposited for credit to the account of the Municipality and ""represents financial assistance to the Municipality for priority development programs and projects in the 1st District of Ilocos Norte, which was released ... upon the request of Honorable Congressman Roque R. Ablan, Jr.""[7]

Petitioner claims that prior to the written notice from the DBM, Ablan personally informed petitioner that he (Ablan) requested the DBM to release his PDAF allocation for the implementation of his priority projects in the First District. Ablan further told petitioner that he would be requiring the transfer of said amount from the Municipality to the account of the 1st District Monitoring Office at the Laoag City Branch of the Philippine National Bank (PNB).[8]

According to petitioner, it was the first time he encountered a request for transfer of PDAF funds. He claims to have asked his fellow mayors and the Provincial Auditor whereby he was informed that similar transfers were requested from and earlier made by the Municipalities of Dumalneg, Burgos, Bacarra, and Vintar, all belonging to the First District of Ilocos Norte, and there was no recorded audit disapproval or disallowance whatsoever.[9]

In preparation for the transfer, petitioner sought authorization from the Sangguniang Bayan of Sarrat (Sangguniang Bayan). Resolution No. 2009-01[10] dated January 5, 2009 authorized petitioner to ""enter into a [Memorandum of Agreement (MOA)] with Congressman Roque R. Ablan, Jr. for the transfer and implementation of the amount of [PHP 10,000,000.00)""[11] covered by SARO No. ROCS-08-09458.

Meanwhile, Ablan's request was formalized through a January 8, 2009 letter[12] addressed to petitioner, informing petitioner that the PHP 10,000,000.00 released to the Municipality through SARO No. ROCS-08-09458 was ""intended to cover financial support for Priority Development Programs and Projects of [Ablan's] district."" Thus, he requested ""the immediate transfer of [f]unds to [the] District Monitoring Office, 1st District, Ilocos Norte Congressional Office with [his] Philippine National Bank Account Number 152903300011.""[13]

Subsequently, a MOA[14] was signed between petitioner and Ablan on January 12, 2009. Under the MOA, the 1st Congressional District of Ilocos Norte, represented by Ablan, shall, among others, (1) cause the implementation of the fund for its priority development programs in the First District of Ilocos Norte and furnish the Municipality a list of said programs and projects from time to time, and (2) administer, manage, disburse, and utilize the said fund for its avowed purpose and in accordance with auditing and accounting rules and regulations and other pertinent laws. The Municipality, represented by petitioner, shall (1) transfer and deposit the amount of PHP 10,000,000.00 to the account of the 1st District Monitoring Office, and (2) monitor the implementation of the program by the 1st Congressional District and require the submission of progress report from time to time.

Referencing the letter request of Ablan, petitioner thus wrote to Sarrat Municipal Accountant Enrico Paz and OIC Municipal Treasurer Liza Cariño, instructing them to process the appropriate documents for the transfer.[15] Pursuant to petitioner's instructions, the transfer was made.[16]

Second Fund Transfer
 
Some months later, petitioner claims that he was again personally informed by Ablan that he (Ablan) had requested DBM the release of PHP 10,000,000.00 intended for the implementation of Ablan's priority development projects in the First District, and that upon receipt thereof, it had to be transferred to the 1st District Monitoring Office's account, just like the first transfer.[17] Thereafter, petitioner received Notice of Funding Check Issued[18] dated May 28, 2009, advising petitioner of the deposit of another PHP 10,000,000.00 released under SARO No. ROCS-09-01883 dated April 13, 2009.[19] Another letter[20] was again received from Ablan on June 15, 2009, requesting the immediate transfer of the amount covered by the Notice.

Petitioner again sought legislative authority from the Sangguniang Bayan, which in turn promulgated Resolution No. 2009-37[21] on June 8, 2009. On June 15, 2009, another MOA[22] was executed by petitioner and Ablan, containing the same terms as the earlier MOA. Petitioner instructed the Municipal Accountant and Municipal Treasurer to effect the second transfer,[23] which was completed on even date.[24]

Third Fund Transfer

On December 10, 2009, an Advice of NCA Issued[25] signed by Andaya, notified the DBM Regional Office No. 1 of the deposit PHP 10,000,000.00 pertaining to SARO No. G-09-08-006 dated October 26, 2009. Petitioner claims that on the following day, he was faxed a copy of the said Advice of NCA Issued by the office of Ablan.[26] Simultaneously, he received a phone call from Ablan informing him of the incoming funds and that it was going to be transferred to the 1st District Monitoring Office just like in the two previous instances.[27]

As with the first two transfers, petitioner requested the authorization from the Sangguniang Bayan to enter into a MOA with Ablan for the implementation and transfer of the funds. Resolution No. 2009-65[28] was issued on December 14, 2009 for that purpose.

Ablan and petitioner signed a third MOA[29] on December 21, 2009, containing common terms as the first two MOAs where the Municipality shall transfer the funds while the 1st District Congressional Office will cause the implementation of its priority development programs in the First District of Ilocos Norte and utilize and disburse the transferred funds therefor.
 
After passing pre-audit, the appropriate municipal officers transferred the funds[30] as directed by petitioner.[31] Ablan's earlier verbal instructions to transfer the funds to the 1st District Monitoring Office was formalized through a Letter[32] dated January 4, 2010.

In this way, a total amount of PHP 30,000,000.00 of Ablan's PDAF funds was transferred from the Municipality to the 1st District Monitoring Office.

Two years later, former COA Commissioner Heidi L. Mendoza issued a Memorandum dated February 28, 2012 addressed to Marilyn J. Llaguno, the Audit Team Leader (ATL) assigned to the Municipality.[33] In the Memorandum, it was observed that not a single project was implemented by the Municipality and instead, the funds were transferred to the private bank account of the 1st District Monitoring Office. Furthermore, the third transfer passed in pre-audit as appearing on the face of the relevant Disbursement Voucher. Thus, the ATL was required to explain why the fund transfers were allowed in audit or pre-audit and to provide information on the audit actions taken on the fund transfers.

In turn, ATL Llaguno wrote to petitioner on August 30, 2012, requesting a list of projects that were implemented together with the supporting documents.[34] In response, petitioner submitted the Notices from the DBM, the letters from Ablan, the Sangguniang Bayan Resolutions, the pertinent MOAs signed by him and Ablan, and the documents effecting the transfers. Petitioner also explained that their understanding was that the ""implementation of the PDAF funds"" would be undertaken by the 1st District Congressional Office as stated in the request for transfer by Ablan. Petitioner assured the ATL that the Municipality is still exerting best efforts in getting in touch with the 1st District Congressional Office.[35]

Audit Observation Memorandum (AOM) No. 13-008[36] signed by ATL Llaguno was issued on January 10, 2013 noting that the transfers of PHP 30,000,000.00 were not yet liquidated as required by COA Circular No. 94-103 dated December 13, 1994, thus proper utilization for its intended purpose, including compliance with COA accounting, auditing rules and regulations, was not ascertained. It concluded, thus:
As a source agency, the municipality must require the implementing agency to submit reports or the list of projects with the supporting documents as stated under the provisions of COA Circular No. 94-013. We therefore recommend that the municipality should require the implementing agency to submit reports for monitoring purposes and liquidation.[37]
On June 4, 2013, ATL Llaguno separately wrote to petitioner[38] and for the first time to Ablan,[39] requesting the submission of a list of projects implemented pertaining to the PHP 30,000,000.00 together with supporting documents.","Before the Court is a Petition for Certiorari[1] (Petition) under Rule 64 assailing the Decision No. 2017-468[2] dated December 28, 2017 and Resolution No. 2020-024[3] dated January 8, 2020 rendered by the Commission on Audit (COA), affirming the disallowance of three fund transfers from the Municipality of Sarrat, Ilocos Norte to the District Monitoring Office, 1st District, Ilocos Norte Congressional Office (1st District Monitoring Office) in the aggregate amount of PHP 30,000,000.00.","The Court sides with petitioner on this point. It is well-settled that public officers are presumed to know and are expected to keep abreast of the rules and regulations bearing upon their functions. Arguably, this presumption operates with greater strength upon a member of the bar. However, as shown above, the circumstances of this case prevent its full application. Lastly and perhaps as an aside, it bears to note that the legislator proponent who requested the fund transfers was himself a member of the bar.

It is unfair to penalize public officials based on overly stretched and strained interpretations of rules which were not that readily capable of being understood at the time such functionaries acted in good faith. If there is any ambiguity, which is actually clarified years later, then it should only be applied prospectively.[109]

In fine, the Court holds that petitioner cannot be held civilly liable for the disallowed amounts for having acted in good faith with respect to the disallowed fund transfers.","ACCORDINGLY, premises considered, the Petition for Certiorari is hereby PARTLY GRANTED.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[3]
The case was raffled to the Branch xxxxxxxxxxx, Regional Trial Court, xxxxxxxxxxx.[4] Upon arraignment, Dela Cruz pleaded not guilty to the charge.[5]

During trial, AAA267163[6] and Dela Cruz testified for the prosecution[7] and the defense, respectively.[8]","This Appeal[1] assails the Decision[2] dated October 28, 2022 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR HC No. 14824, affirming with modification the conviction of accused-appellant Eduardo Dela Cruz y Tolentino (Dela Cruz) for rape in Criminal Case No. 3492-2015.","We modify.
 
Rape under Article 266-A(1) of the Revised Penal Code
 

Article 266-A(1) of the Revised Penal Code defines and penalizes rape, as follows:
Article 266-A. Rape: When and How Committed. – Rape is committed:

1)
By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:

a) Through force, threat, or intimidation;

b) When the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious;

c) By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority; and

d) When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present.
Rape by sexual intercourse requires the following elements: (1) the offender had carnal knowledge of the victim; and (2) such act was accomplished through force or intimidation; or when the victim is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; or when the victim is under 12 years of age.[30]

Here, AAA267163 unequivocally averred that Dela Cruz had carnal knowledge of her. She testified that she was inside a Born Again church when Dela Cruz touched her breast and vagina, and inserted his finger into her vagina. He then removed her shorts and underwear, laid her on a chair, kissed her vagina, and eventually inserted his penis into her vagina (""higa niya ako, kiss niya pisngi ko, kiss nya dede ko, kiss niya pepe ko, pasok nya titi niya sa pepe ko."").[31]
 
Both the trial court and the Court of Appeals found the sole testimony of AAA267163 to be credible, natural, convincing, and consistent. Though the medical certificate indicated that her hymen remained intact, and there were no indicated bleeding, abrasions, or erythema at the time of examination, the Court has consistently ruled that a medical certificate is merely corroborative in character and its absence does not disprove the occurrence of rape. It is enough that the evidence on hand convinces the court that conviction is proper, as in the present case.[32]

In any event, where the clashing values of the victim's positive testimony and accused-appellant's plain denial are in issue, the factual findings of the trial court thereon carry great weight and respect especially when sustained by the Court of Appeals as in this case. This is because trial courts are in the best position to ascertain and measure the sincerity and spontaneity of witnesses through their actual observation of the manner by which witnesses testified, acted, and behaved in court.[33] Against the bare denial of Dela Cruz, therefore, the positive testimony of the victim deserves greater weight and credit.
 
Dela Cruz is guilty of rape under Article 266-A paragraph 1(a) of the Revised Penal Code
 

We now reckon with the allegation in the Information that AAA267163 is a ""special child."" The trial court concluded that AAA267163 was a child based on her appearance and demeanor during the trial. It particularly noted that on the witness stand, she murmured ""hindi na ba ako babalik, uuwi na ba ako?"" According to the trial court, such action is ""attributed to a child of tender age."" Further, the trial court took into consideration that the defense did not object to the treatment of AAA267163 as a child witness.[34] Consequently, both the trial court and the Court of Appeals were convinced that Dela Cruz should be held liable for statutory rape under Article 266-A paragraph 1(d) of the Revised Penal Code.

We note that while the trial court did observe that based on the appearance and demeanor of AAA267163 during the trial, she was a child, it failed to identify or at least calculate her mental age. Also, the records did not bear any clinical identification of her mental age either. Verily, therefore, there is nothing to support the conclusion that the 16-year-old AAA267163 had a mental age of a child below 12 years old at the time she was raped to sustain a conviction for statutory rape.

In People v. XXX,[35] the mental disability of the victim was not disputed. However, the victim's level of disability has not been equated to a specific ""mental age."" The medical certificate merely stated that the victim is suffering from ""moderate retardation."" In ruling that there was no statutory rape, the Court ordained that the mental age of the victim must first be identified, viz.:
Evidence must be adduced to aid the court in determining not only the existence of the illness and its level of severity but as well of its manifestations and the corresponding mental age of the subject.

The determination of mental retardation, particularly, the degrees thereof, is deeply rooted in medical psychology; as such, courts are largely dependent upon psychometric evaluation. It is true that such mental condition can be proved by evidence other than medical and clinical evidence, such as the testimony of witnesses and the observation of the trial court. This may be sufficient when the issue is the ability of a subject to testify in court or to stand trial, the only consideration being the ability to comprehend the questions propounded and to respond to the same intelligibly.

However, when the determination of mental disability constitutes as an element of the crime of rape, or when the victim's mental age is necessary in characterizing whether carnal knowledge can be considered as statutory rape, or when mental disability relates to the capacity of the accused to commit the crime; the same must be medically defined and specified, over which the court must rely upon the findings and evaluation of experts in the field, social workers, or persons close to the subject sufficiently averring circumstances to depict the mental development and status. In the same way, the Court cannot merely rely upon the comparative classification of mental age vis-à-vis the level of mental retardation of a person provided for in Dalandas as past cases show us that mental aging is variable. And ultimately, the conviction of an accused of rape based on the mental retardation of the victim must be anchored on proof beyond reasonable doubt and not on mere inferences.

Courts cannot hastily resort to deductive reasoning with respect to the proper designation of the crime. The rule must be that in order to be properly appreciated, mental retardation, particularly when disputed, whether of the victim or of the accused, must be sufficiently characterized by adducing evidence stating the intelligence quotient, manifestations of the illness, and mental age.

The nature of a crime including its mode of commission must be sufficiently alleged as to allow the accused to adequately prepare for his or her defense. This requirement is vital in all criminal prosecutions as it is deeply rooted on one's constitutional rights to due process and presumption of innocence. While, admittedly, the penalty provided for by law is the same in any of the circumstances under Article 266-A(1) of the RPC, this fact alone does not diminish the substance of the requirement nor of the importance of the rule's observance.

Whereas, a victim's chronological age is factual and evidentiary in nature, which must be established by evidence during trial. Comparatively, the same also holds true even more with the determination of the mental age of a person suffering from mental retardation as it is primarily a scientific and a medical issue. As such it must be properly characterized and substantiated by medical evaluation or by adequate proof external manifestations of the person allegedly suffering from mental retardation.[36] (Citations omitted)
But this identification need not be based alone on the existence of a clinical or medical finding on record. In fact, the Court emphasized in People v. Bermas[37] that the lack of medical or clinical evidence does not preclude the presentation of other evidence to prove the victim's mental disability. Medical finding is necessary only for borderline cases when there is difficulty in ascertaining the mental capacity of the victim.[38] In cases where the cognitive disability is readily apparent, the trial court can resort to other pieces of evidence. Consequently, People v. Dumanon[39] pronounced that the trial court itself can determine whether a person is suffering from mental disability. People v. Dalandas[40] also recognized that the mental disability of persons and the degrees thereof may be manifested by their overt acts, appearance, attitude, and behavior.

To repeat, the trial court here made its own observation that AAA267163 was a child based on her appearance and demeanor, but failed to identify her mental age to support a conviction for statutory rape. This is significant considering that under the law then prevailing, statutory rape involved child victims who are below 12 years of age. Hence, in cases of statutory rape involving victims with cognitive deficiency, their mental age corresponding to that of a child below 12 years of age should be established.

As shown here, the mental age of AAA267163 was not proved, thus, Dela Cruz should be adjudged guilty not of statutory rape but of rape under Article 266-A paragraph 1(a) of the Revised Penal Code. To recall, Dela Cruz succeeded in having carnal knowledge of AAA267163 by using force or intimidation in the form of moral ascendancy.[41] AAA267163 called him ""Uncle Edward."" Too, the big discrepancy between their ages, i.e. 40 years old vis-à-vis 16 years old, is indicative of coercion. Further, as a full-grown adult, Dela Cruz took advantage of AAA267163, who was not only a minor but was even afflicted with cognitive disability. He even testified that he knew of her mental state ""[b]ecause she is roaming around and she is doing like this (the witness is shaking his body).""[42] He further observed that ""[i]t's like [AAA267163] doesn't have [a] mind. She is mentally disordered[.]""[43]","ACCORDINGLY, the Appeal is DENIED. The Decision dated October 28, 2022 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR HC No. 14824 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION.

Accused-appellant Eduardo Dela Cruz y Tolentino is found GUILTY of rape under Article 266-A paragraph 1(a) of the Revised Penal Code. He is sentenced to reclusion perpetua and ORDERED to PAY AAA267163 the following:

GIGANTE, UTILITY WORKER, ALL OF BRANCH 67, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, PANIQUI, TARLAC, RESPONDENTS.","The Memorandum,[1] dated February 13, 2023, issued by Court Administrator Raul B. Villanueva, Office of the Court Administrator (OCA), provides the following context:

On July 12, 2022, the Court, through an En Banc Resolution,[2] referred the letters of Maria Olympia N. Bailey (Maria Olympia) and Atty. Ana Murray Y. Santillan (Atty. Santillan) to the OCA for appropriate action.[3]

In the letter,[4] dated June 21, 2016, Spouses Arvin John Bailey (Arvin) and Maria Olympia Bailey (Spouses Bailey) sought confirmation from the OCA regarding the validity of their marriage. This arose due to a Decision, dated September 21, 2010, issued by Judge Castañeda in Civil Case No. 666-09, which declared their marriage null and void. The Spouses Bailey further stated that the Quezon City Civil Registrar refused to recognize the Decision and, consequently, did not proceed with the annulment registration. This was allegedly due to a pending administrative case against Judge Castañeda concerning annulment of marriage cases assigned to her sala. The Spouses Bailey elaborated that the Quezon City Civil Registrar refrained from pursuing the registration of their annulment due to their eventual reconciliation and Maria Olympia's subsequent pregnancy. Nevertheless, Arvin informed his company about the nullity of his marriage, which changed his status from ""married"" to ""annulled."" This modification resulted in Maria Olympia losing her status as a dependent and all contingent benefits thereof. Currently, Maria Olympia is endeavoring to obtain proof (i.e., a letter or document) from the OCA, which she intends to furnish to the legal department of Arvin's company to revert Arvin's status to married, thereby restoring her eligibility for dependent benefits.[5]

A review of the records revealed that Civil Case No. 666-09 was decided on September 21, 2010, during Judge Castañeda's suspension, but prior to her dismissal on October 9, 2012.[6]

As regards the letter,[7] dated June 5, 2018, Atty. Santillan also sought clarification on the validity of the decision rendered by Judge Castañeda during the latter's period of suspension and its legal implications on the status of Civil Case No. 595-M 2017, currently pending before Branch 10, RTC, Malolos, Bulacan. Atty. Santillan contended that the petitioner in Civil Case No. 595-M-2017 had declared in the Certificate of Non-Forum Shopping that a similar petition for the declaration of nullity of marriage had been previously filed in Judge Castañeda's court. Although Judge Castañeda decided on the petition, her decision was not recognized by the Quezon City Civil Registrar due to her suspension at that time. In the absence of any ruling on the validity of the decision, the petitioner lodged another petition for nullity of marriage in a different court in Bulacan.[8]

The records confirmed that Judge Castañeda was suspended from service effective from January 12, 2010, until October 9, 2012, when she was ultimately dismissed.[9]

In compliance with the Court En Banc's Resolution, the OCA, in its letters dated January 3, 2023, addressed to Spouses Bailey and Atty. Santillan, stated that if the cases were decided when Judge Castañeda was suspended from service, from January 12, 2010 until her dismissal on October 9, 2012, such decisions could be declared null and void or expunged by the Court. This is according to the case of Dr. Alday v. Judge Cruz, Jr.,[10] where the Court held that decisions, resolutions, orders, and other processes erroneously and improperly issued after a respondent judge was suspended from office may be declared null and void or expunged by the Court.[11] However, while the decision in Alday suggests that a judgment rendered by a judge under suspension may be declared null and void, and even expunged from the records as it cannot possibly produce any legal effect, the OCA clarified that it does not possess the authority to rule on the validity of the decision rendered by Judge Castañeda and its effect on the similar petition filed in another court. The OCA expressed that its authority is confined to the administrative supervision of lower court officials and personnel.[12]

In a recent Decision in Flores-Concepcion v. Judge Castañeda,[13] the Court dismissed the complaint against Judge Castañeda due to her demise during the pendency of the case.[14] However, the Court did not pass judgment on the validity of the decisions issued when Judge Castañeda was suspended. Consequently, the OCA advised the parties to seek judicial remedies as provided in the Rules of Court to obtain a definitive ruling on the validity of the decisions issued by Judge Castañeda.[15]

To recall, in the Resolution, dated January 27, 2015, in A.M. No. RTJ-12-2316 (OCA v. Hon. Liberty O. Castañeda, Presiding Judge, Atty. Paulino I. Saguyod, Clerk of Court, Lourdes E. Collado, Sheriff, Marylinda C. Doctor, Evelyn B. Antonio, Rosalie P. Sarsagat and Cheryl B. Esteban, Court Stenographers, George P. Clemente, Clerk, Maritoni Florian C. Cervantes, Court Interpreter, and Ruben A. Gigante, Utility Worker, All of Branch 67, Regional Trial Court, Paniqui, Tarlac), the Court resolved, among other things, to direct the OCA to conduct a thorough investigation into the specifics of each case adjudicated by former Judge Castañeda during her suspension period (i.e., from January 12, 2010 until her dismissal from the service on October 9, 2012) to identify any irregularities in the proceedings, including any instances of corruption, fraud, or bad faith involving any of the parties.[16]

Furthermore, in the subsequent Resolution, dated April 21, 2015, in A.M. No. RTJ-15-2404 (OCA v. Judge Castañeda), the Court authorized the OCA to take into custody and safeguard the records of the 1,237 cases decided by Judge Castañeda. The OCA also assigned a team to scrutinize the records of these cases and investigate them, per the Court's directive in its Resolution,[17] dated January 27, 2015, in A.M. No. RTJ-12-2316.[18] Out of the 1,237 cases, the OCA team managed to retrieve 1,194 cases that were decided by Judge Castañeda from Atty. Paulino Saguyod, Clerk of Court, Branch 67, RTC, Paniqui, Tarlac, from January 12, 2010 (the time of her suspension) to October 9, 2012 (the time of her dismissal from the service). Out of the 1,194 cases, the team examined 722 cases involving annulment or nullity of marriage. The team also noted that the most significant procedural flaws were found in cases involving Absolute Nullity or Annulment of Void Marriages.[19]","The validity of judicial decisions rendered during a judge's suspension period, particularly when such suspension spans a significant period, raises profound questions about the legitimacy and integrity of judicial acts performed during the period of incapacity. The case at hand, involving the suspension of Judge Liberty O. Castañeda (Judge Castañeda), formerly the Presiding Judge of Branch 67, Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Paniqui, Tarlac, brings to the forefront issues about the authority of a judge to continue adjudicating cases and rendering decisions that bear the gravitas of law during a period of suspension. The primary task before this Court is to determine whether the orders and decisions issued by Judge Castañeda during her suspension should stand or if they must be rendered void in order to preserve the sanctity of the judicial process.","In resolving this issue, the Court must strike a balance between safeguarding procedural integrity and upholding the rights of litigants who have relied in good faith on the decisions issued during her period of suspension. A critical guiding principle in this determination is the recognition that, while judicial authority must be exercised within legal bounds, the disruption of justice and the resultant harm to litigants cannot be overlooked. Therefore, the Court must weigh the need for procedural propriety against the broader goals of equity and justice, ensuring that the dispensation of law remains unsullied by administrative missteps and that the rights of the parties involved are protected.

The de facto officer doctrine offers a possible solution to this legal quandary. This doctrine, recognized in our jurisprudence, allows for the validation of acts performed by an individual exercising the duties of an office under color of authority, even if that person was not lawfully entitled to hold the office at the time. It exists as a rule of necessity and public policy, designed to prevent the disruption of governmental and judicial functions. It aims to protect the public and individuals who have relied on the official acts of persons performing duties with apparent authority.[20] In this regard, the de facto officer doctrine safeguards against the potential chaos that would ensue if all actions taken by improperly seated officers were to be retroactively invalidated. 
 
The Orders and Decisions issued by Judge Castañeda as a de facto officer from March 23, 2010 to June 3, 2011 are deemed valid
 

In the case of Judge Castañeda, it is undisputed that she was suspended from office from January 12, 2010 until October 9, 2012.[21] However, despite her suspension, she continued to issue decisions and orders in her capacity as Presiding Judge of Branch 67, RTC, Paniqui, Tarlac. Specifically, Judge Castañeda rendered decisions from March 23, 2010 to June 3, 2011, while no judicial acts were performed from January 12, 2010 to March 22, 2010, and from June 4, 2011 to October 9, 2012. During her active period, she adjudicated a total of 1,237 cases, raising serious concerns regarding the legality of these decisions. The Court has received several inquiries questioning the validity of these judicial acts, given that Judge Castañeda was suspended at the time and, therefore, ostensibly lacked the lawful authority to act as a judge.

Civil Service Commission v. Joson, Jr.[22] traced the historical underpinnings of the concept of a de facto officer:
The broad definition of what constitutes an officer de facto was formulated by Lord Holt in Parker v. Kent, and reiterated by Lord Ellenborough and full King's Bench in 1865 in Rex v. Bedford Level, ""One who has the reputation of being the officer he assumes and yet is not a good officer in point of law."" A de facto officer is one who is in possession of the office and discharging its duties under color of authority. By color of authority is meant that derived from an election or appointment, however irregular or informal, so that the incumbent is not a mere volunteer. The difference between the basis of the authority of a de jure officer and that of a de facto officer is that one rests on right, the other on reputation. It may be likened to the difference between character and reputation. One is the truth of a man, the other is what is thought of him. It is the color of authority, not the color of title that distinguishes an officer de facto from a usurper.[23] (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted.)
The de facto officer doctrine, grounded in principles of public policy and necessity, recognizes that while an officer may not hold valid legal title to the office, the actions they perform under the color of authority should not automatically be invalidated, particularly when the public or third parties have relied on their acts. The doctrine has been invoked to prevent disruptions in the functioning of government institutions, including the Judiciary, and to protect the public's confidence in the continuity and stability of governmental processes.[24]

In Tayko v. Capistrano,[25] the Court emphasized that the de facto officer doctrine was engrafted upon the law as a policy measure to protect the interests of the public and individuals involved in the official acts of persons exercising the duties of an officer without being lawfully entitled to do so. The Court further elaborated that it would be unreasonable to require the public to constantly question the legal title of an officer, as this would lead to confusion and uncertainty in government affairs.[26] This reasoning applies with equal force to judicial officers, whose acts carry significant legal consequences, thus:
The rightful authority of a judge, in the full exercise of his public judicial functions, cannot be questioned by any merely private suitor, nor by any other, excepting in the form especially provided by law. A judge de facto assumes the exercise of a part of the prerogative of sovereignty, and the legality of that assumption is open to the attack of the sovereign power alone. Accordingly, it is a [well-established] principle, dating from the earliest period and repeatedly confirmed by an unbroken current of decisions, that the official acts of a de facto judge are just as valid for all purposes as those of a de jure judge, so far as the public or third persons who are interested therein are concerned. The rule is the same in civil criminal cases. The principle is one founded in policy and convenience, for the right of no one claiming a title or interest under or through the proceedings of an officer having an apparent authority to act would be safe, if it were necessary in every case to examine the legality of the title of such officer up to its original source, and the title or interest of such person were held to be invalidated by some accidental defect or flaw in the appointment; election or qualification of such officer, or in the rights of those from whom his appointment or election emanated; nor could the supremacy of the laws be maintained, or their execution enforced, if the acts of the judge having a colorable, but not a legal title, were to be deemed invalid.[27] (Emphasis supplied)
The doctrine, rooted in fairness and justice, recognizes that the legal rights of individuals should not be imperiled for relying on the acts of an official who appeared to hold valid authority. Drawing from both American and Spanish legal traditions, the Court, in another case involving the authority of a judge, stated the rationale of the doctrine, thus:
It is a universally professed doctrine that the acts of judges considered such by common error, whether there be color or title or not . . . are valid and effective in favor of the public welfare. This, according to the phrase of one law, is the most humane course, one which can injure no one, and brings no discredit upon the administration of justice.[28] (Emphasis supplied)
Furthermore, in Republic v. Sereno,[29] the Supreme Court dealt with questions surrounding the validity of the acts of an officer–namely the Chief Justice–who had been allegedly unlawfully appointed. The application of the de facto officer doctrine in this case echoes its long-standing purpose: to uphold the validity of official acts performed by a person who, although later found to be unlawfully holding office, appeared to have the authority at the time of the act.

With the continuous reliance on this jurisprudential precept, the Court, in Tuanda v. Sandiganbayan,[30] required the presence of the following elements for the application of the de facto officer doctrine: (1) there must be a de jure office; (2) there must be a color of right or general acquiescence by the public; and (3) there must be actual physical possession of the office in good faith.[31] These elements were later reiterated and applied in the cases of Re: Nomination of Atty. Chaguile as Replacement for IBP Governor for Northern Luzon, Denis B. Gabawel[32] and Laud v. People.[33]

The Court finds these three elements that warrant the application of the de facto officer doctrine present in this case.","ACCORDINGLY, the Orders and Decisions rendered by Judge Liberty O. Castañeda, formerly the Presiding Judge of Branch 67, Regional Trial Court of Paniqui, Tarlac, acting as a de facto officer during her suspension from January 12, 2010 to October 9, 2012, are declared VALID. Let a copy of this Resolution be furnished to the parties concerned, and the same shall be duly entered into the records of the covered cases."
"A.C. No. 14211 [Formerly CBD 19-6078], October 29, 2024","MELINDA B. BAUTISTA-REGODOZ, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. VIVIAN G. RUBIA, RESPONDENT.","In her complaint-affidavit, Regodoz alleged that sometime in January 1998, she was referred by a church friend in Digos City to Atty. Rubia for legal assistance. Vicenta Nugas (Nugas) and Mindalina Pepino (Pepino) owed her PHP 5,000.00 and PHP 20,000.00, respectively. Both Nugas and Pepino were employees of Branch 18, Regional Trial Court, Digos City, Davao del Sur.[2]

During Regodoz's initial consultation with Atty. Rubia, she assured her that she could get back her money with interest. Atty. Rubia asked for PHP 600.00 to send the demand letters but did not issue a receipt therefor. They did not execute any written retainer agreement nor fixed the amount of legal fees for Atty. Rubia. She also informed Atty. Rubia that she could not afford the legal fees if it exceeded the amount to be collected. Atty. Rubia assured her further that the legal fees will be paid by Nugas and Pepino themselves should she win the case against them.[3]

Through the efforts of Atty. Rubia, Regodoz succeeded in getting Nugas and Pepino to acknowledge their indebtedness and sign a memorandum of agreement wherein they undertook to pay Regodoz. Eventually, however, Nugas and Pepino defaulted in their payment. Atty. Rubia consequently advised her to file a collection case before the Municipal Trial Court (MTC) of Digos City. Atty. Rubia told her that there was no need to go through the Katarungang Pambarangay as there was already a signed memorandum of agreement between her and the debtors.[4]

During the hearing held on October 7, 1999, Nugas and Pepino's counsel in the collection case interjected that the case should be dismissed on ground of misjoinder of parties. Based on her response, Atty. Rubia obviously did not know what Nugas and Pepino's affirmative defenses were. She was grossly negligent in her duty as counsel.[5]

Regodoz thereafter sent letters and made phone calls to Atty. Rubia, following up on the cases against Nugas and Pepino. But all Atty. Rubio did was send her a letter containing a shallow alibi for not communicating with her.[6]

Atty. Rubia got imported bags and goodies from Regodoz as a guarantee that she would pay for her legal services. The items she gave Atty. Rubia were all a product of her hard work when she was employed as a domestic helper in Hong Kong.[7]

Atty. Rubia did not inform Regodoz that Nugas and Pepino had already paid PHP 3,000.00 on March 31, 1998. She never received it. While the case was pending, Atty. Rubia did not advise her on the consequences of such development nor inform her of the steps to be taken. She kept asking Atty. Rubia about the status of her case but she did not receive a categorical advice.[8]

On April 23, 2015, Regodoz was alarmed by the inordinate delay in the prosecution of her case. While working in Canada at that time, she kept in touch with Atty. Rubia only through Messenger. Atty. Rubia misrepresented that she herself (Regodoz) had asked that the case be dismissed. Regodoz never made such a request. On the contrary, she requested Atty. Rubia, through registered mail and email, for copies of the case documents but her request went unheeded.[9]

It was only after she returned to the Philippines on March 16, 2018, that she was able to secure the case documents through the help of a good friend. She was able to confirm then that her case was dismissed. It was actually Atty. Rubia who moved to drop the case against Pepino due to misjoinder of parties. She was not made aware of this development. Even after the case was dismissed against Pepino, Atty. Rubia did not initiate a separate complaint despite being paid PHP 900.00 by her sister.[10]

Atty. Rubia violated her oath of fidelity to her client. Her conduct was unbecoming of a lawyer and officer of the court. She betrayed her trust and confidence, causing her injustice.[11]

By Order[12] dated September 17,2019, Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) Director for Bar Discipline Randall C. Tabayoyong directed Atty. Rubia to submit her answer within 15 days from notice.

By Order[13] dated July 30, 2020, IBP Commissioner Perpetuo T. Lucero, Jr. (Commissioner Lucero) directed the parties to submit their respective email addresses to which the subsequent notices and orders, including the invitation for video conferencing, shall be sent. This directive was issued in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. The parties were also directed to submit their mobile numbers for ease of communication.

By her Manifestation in Compliance with the Order dated July 30, 2020 and a Motion to Submit Belated Answer[14] dated November 3, 2020, Atty. Rubia submitted her email address and mobile number. She requested for an additional 15 days within which to file her answer as she had just recovered from vertigo.

On the other hand, per her Letter-Response[15] dated November 11, 2020, Regodoz manifested her compliance and waived the conduct of a mandatory conference.

In his Order[16] dated March 23, 2021, Commissioner Lucero deemed as waived the conduct of a mandatory conference. He gave the parties 15 days within which to file their respective verified position papers.

Only Regodoz submitted her Verified Position Paper[17] dated May 9, 2021.","This case arose from the Affidavit-Complaint[1] dated July 18, 2018 of complainant Melinda B. Bautista-Regodoz (Regodoz) for breach of professional responsibility, gross misconduct, gross negligence, and breach of the Lawyer's Oath against respondent Atty. Vivian G. Rubia (Atty. Rubia).","The provisions of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability (CPRA), as mandated under Section 1 of the General Provisions are applicable to the present case, thus:
SECTION 1. Transitory provision. The CPRA shall be applied to all pending and future cases, except to the extent that in the opinion of the Supreme Court, its retroactive application would not be feasible or would work injustice, in which case the procedure under which the cases were filed shall govern.
Previously, under the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR), jurisprudence imposed the penalty of suspension of varying durations on first­-time offenders of misappropriating of or failure to account for a client's funds, from six months[36] to two years,[37] depending on the discretion of the Court. If lawyers repeat the offense, compounded by other violations of the CPR, the Court meted the ultimate penalty of disbarment.[38] On the other hand, the CPRA imposes suspension for a period exceeding six months per infraction and, CPRA allows for a longer period of suspension, or even disbarment, if there are multiple infractions and/or aggravating circumstances.[39]

As for failure to file an answer or position paper before the IBP, jurisprudence, applying the CPR, considered such disobedience to the lawful orders of the IBP as conduct unbecoming of a lawyer and treated the same only as an aggravating circumstance.[40] Meanwhile, under the CPRA, disobedience of the lawful orders of the IBP are treated as a less serious offense.
 
In any event, despite the subtle distinctions of the CPR and CPRA on how Atty. Rubia's offenses are to be treated, the end result is the same. Hence, since there will be no injustice committed on Atty. Rubia by the retroactive application of the CPRA, the Court proceeds to examine Atty. Rubia's offenses and corresponding liability under the lens of the CPRA.

Notably, Commissioner Lopez-Baluyut found Atty. Rubia administratively liable for her failure to turnover to Regodoz the amount of PHP 3,000.00 as payments coming from Nugas and Pepino. As it was, however, the IBP-BOG found Atty. Rubia liable twice, one for a less serious offense and another for a serious offense. But, the IBP–BOG failed to specify the supposed acts or omissions of Atty. Rubia constituting these offenses.

After a thorough review of the records, the Court resolves to adopt the recommendation of Commissioner Lopez-Baluyut that Atty. Rubia be found liable for her failure to turnover PHP 3,000.00 to Regodoz, a breach of her fidelity to her client, which is a serious offense.

The relationship between lawyers and their clients is highly fiduciary and ascribes to lawyers a great degree of fidelity and good faith. As such, lawyers have the duty to account for the money or property they receive for or from their clients. When they receive money from a client for a particular purpose, they are bound to render an accounting of how the money was spent for the said purpose; and, in case the money was not used for the intended purpose, they must immediately return the money to the client. The failure of lawyers to return the money entrusted to them by their clients upon demand creates a presumption that they have appropriated the same for their own use.[41] Canon III, Sections 49 and 50 of the CPRA ordain:
SECTION 49. Accounting during engagement. — A lawyer, during the existence of the lawyer-client relationship, shall account for and prepare an inventory of any fund or property belonging to the client, whether received from the latter or from a third person, immediately upon such receipt.

When funds are entrusted to a lawyer by a client for a specific purpose, the lawyer shall use such funds only for the client's declared purpose. Any unused amount of the entrusted funds shall be promptly returned to the client upon accomplishment of the stated purpose or the client's demand.

SECTION 50. Separate funds. — A lawyer shall keep the funds of the clients separate and apart from his or her own and those of others kept by the lawyer.
Atty. Rubia claimed that she had already turned over to Regodoz the PHP 3,000.00 that was collected from Nugas and Pepino. But aside from this bare allegation, Atty. Rubia has not offered any substantiating evidence such as a receipt or any documentary proof. It is a basic rule in evidence that the person who alleges payment has the burden of proving that payment has indeed been made.[42] On this score, we quote with concurrence the relevant disquisition of Commissioner Lopez-Baluyut, viz.:
Complainant alleged that respondent received Three thousand eight hundred ([PHP] 3,800.00) from defendant Nugas and an amount of Two thousand pesos ([PHP] 2,000.00) from defendant Pepino. However, the two (2) Acknowledgment Receipts from Rubia Law Office both dated March 31, 1998 evidencing partial payment of their obligation show that said law office thru respondent herself received the amount of One thousand pesos ([PHP] 1,000.00) from defendant Nugas and Two thousand pesos ([PHP] 2,000.00) from defendant Pepino, respectively. Based on the conversations between the parties complainant was not informed about said payment and upon careful scrutiny of the evidence submitted, no reference can be found that respondent apprised her client or turned over said amounts to the complainant. The Complaint filed in court on June 1, 1998 is also silent as to the payments that were coursed through the respondent as the payments were not deducted [from] the amount originally claimed as obligations of the defendants to the complainant. It can be inferred that there was bad faith on the part of respondent considering that said payments were not disclosed in the complaint when payments were tendered personally to her prior to the institution of the complaint. It is established that respondent received the amount of One thousand pesos ([PHP] 1,000.00) from defendant Nugas and Two thousand pesos ([PHP] 2,000.00) from defendant Pepino, respectively. Consequently, the undersigned is convinced that respondent violated Canon 16 and Rules 16, 16.01 and 16.03 of Code of Professional Responsibility.[43]
In 1998, the sum of PHP 3,000.00 was quite substantial, when the Philippines, along with other Southeast Asian countries, was reeling from the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis. From a stable exchange rate of PHP 26.40 to a U.S. Dollar, the Philippine Peso considerably weakened by January 1998 with an exchange rate of PHP 42.70 to a U.S. Dollar. Through the sharp depreciation of the Philippine Peso, the financial system's reaction, the dramatic decline in trade, and the fall in investments, all drove the Philippine economy to the ground.[44] It should be in this economic context that Regodoz's relentless pursuit of the PHP 3,000.00 should be understood. To her, it was a substantial amount of money, and its value to her was so that she still pursued it in 2018 when she filed the administrative complaint against Atty. Rubia. Further, in 2024, the amount would be equivalent to about PHP 8,774.616.[45] Besides what should be considered here is not the mathematical value of the amount but the personal value it had to Regodoz, who earned her money while working as a domestic worker in Hong Kong.

Anent Atty. Rubia's failure to file her answer and position paper before the IBP—CBD, the Court finds her claim of depression as flimsy, if not bereft of credence. For one, her supposed state of depression has not been established. It is her mere say so. Nothing more. As it was, she has not produced any medical certificate or corroborative testimony to support such allegation. Verily, absent any valid justification, Atty. Rubia's failure or refusal to answer the complaint against her, is evidence of her contumacious attitude toward lawful orders of the court and illustrates her meager regard for her oath of office.[46]

On whether Atty. Rubia has the duty to return to Regodoz the amount of PHP 900.00 which she allegedly received from the sister of Regodoz as filing fee for a case to be refiled against Pepino, we are in accord with the observation of Commissioner Lopez-Baluyut that the narration of Regodoz with respect to the sequence of events did not jive with what actually transpired before the trial court. The complaint against Pepino was dimissed on April 6, 2004 but Regodoz claimed that Atty. Rubia was given money for the refiling of the complaint on January 20, 2000. Commissioner Lopez­ Baluyut observed that Regodoz could not have predicted that the complaint against Pepino would be dismissed in 2004 by giving money for refiling way back in 2000.[47]","ACCORDINGLY, respondent Atty. Vivian G. Rubia is:
declared GUILTY of violating Canon VI, Section 33(g) of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability. She is SUSPENDED from the practice of law for TWO YEARS;

declared GUILTY of violating Canon VI, Section 34(c) of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability. She is FINED PHP 35,000.00 and ordered to pay the same within three months from receipt of the Decision;

directed to RETURN the sum of PHP 3,000.00 to complainant Melinda B. Regodoz within three months from receipt of the Decision; and

STERNLY WARNED that future infractions shall be dealt with more severely.
Further, the Manifestation of Utmost Apology unto this Honorable Court, A Motion for Reconsideration and/or a Belated Answer dated June 20, 2024 is NOTED.

This Decision is IMMEDIATELY EXECUTORY.

Let copies of this Decision be furnished the Office of the Bar Confidant, to be appended to the personal record of respondent Atty. Vivian G. Rubia as an attorney; the Integrated Bar of the Philippines National Office and the local chapter to which she belongs, for their information and guidance; and the Office of the Court Administrator, for dissemination to all the courts in the country."
"A.M. No. RTJ-24-075 [Formerly JIB FPI No. 22-135-RTJ], October 29, 2024","ERNESTO CALLENA, JR., COMPLAINANT, VS. HON. CORPUS B. ALZATE, PRESIDING JUDGE, BRANCH 2, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, BANGUED, ABRA, RESPONDENT.","Callena claimed that from 2004 to 2021, Judge Alzate knowingly refused to pay his Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) dues. He asserts that said refusal cannot be excused simply because Judge Alzate is a judge. On the contrary, Judge Alzate should know the rules and his obligation to pay IBP dues.[3]

According to Callena, Judge Alzate sees himself as ""untouchable"" because of his connections in the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA). Too, Judge Alzate is known for his ""arrogance and self-centeredness,"" but lawyers are hesitant to complain because of their pending cases in his sala.[4]

In his Comment[5] dated May 26, 2022, Judge Alzate admitted that his name was not included in the list of qualified voters in the IBP chapter elections held on February 27, 2021. However, upon knowledge of Callena's complaint, he immediately secured an assessment of his arrears. Thereafter, he paid PHP 23,100.00 to the IBP Central Office for his IBP dues from 2004 to 2021 as evidenced by the IBP receipt dated May 24, 2022.[6]

Judge Alzate offered multiple reasons for his failure to pay his IBP dues. First. When he was a young lawyer, members of IBP Abra Chapter told him that one of the candidates in the IBP elections sponsored the payment of IBP dues for members of the chapter. Second. Whenever there were no ""sponsors"", he would pay his IBP dues to the chapter. But there was a time the IBP Abra Chapter did not remit payments to the IBP Central Office. When the non-remittance was discovered, he was told that the payment records would be reconciled. As years passed by, no reconciliation of accounts was made which resulted in him forgetting about his IBP dues. Third. One Judge Conrado Venus of Regional Trial Court, Narvacan advised him that when a lawyer employed in the government service fails to pay his IBP dues, the arrears would automatically be deducted from his or her retirement pay or from his or her earned leaves. Judge Alzate merely relied on said advice in utmost ""good faith.""[7]

Judge Alzate also pointed out that he never received any notice of delinquency or any resolution to suspend his member's privileges from the IBP Central Office.[8] Lastly, Judge Alzate denied having strong connections to the OCA.[9]

In his Reply[10] dated June 20, 2022, Callena disputed the ""tall tales"" of Judge Alzate. He asserted that Judge Alzate's excuses were merely an attempt to justify his ""deliberate [and] stubborn"" refusal to pay IBP dues despite being a lawyer for 37 years and a judge for 22 years.[11] In any event, Judge Alzate admitted his non-payment of IBP dues. He also chided Judge Alzate for paying his dues only after receiving an administrative complaint.[12]

More, Judge Alzate has been found guilty in the following administrative cases: (1) OCA IPI No. 03-1745-RTJ; (2) OCA IPI No. 15-4479-RTJ; and (3) A.M. No. RTJ-19-2574. Callena averred that the Supreme Court had been ""very compassionate with [Judge Alzate]"" despite his repeated acts of misconduct since the latter had only ever been admonished and fined.[13]

Judge Alzate in his Rejoinder[14] dated July 4, 2022 surmised that Callena's reply may have been authored by Atty. Maria Saniata Liwliwa Gonzales-Alzate (Atty. Gonzales-Alzate), counsel of Callena and wife of dismissed Judge Raphiel F. Alzate, a relative of his.[15] He alleged that Atty. Gonzales-Alzate had become ""ballistic"" since the dismissal of her husband from the Judiciary.[16]

In a Letter[17] dated June 16, 2022, the Judicial Integrity Board – Office of the Executive Director (JIB-OED) directed Judge Alzate to submit a verified comment ""concerning the administrative case against [him] as a member of the Philippine Bar.""[18] It cited Rule 140 of the Rules of Court, as amended, viz.:
Section 4. Administrative Case Considered as Disciplinary Actions Against Members of the Philippine Bar. – An administrative case against any of those mentioned in Section 1(1) of this Rule shall also be considered as a disciplinary action against [them] as a member of the Philippine Bar, provided, that the complaint specifically states that the imputed acts or omissions therein likewise constitute a violation of the Lawyer's Oath, the Code of Professional Responsibility, the Canons of Professional Ethics, or such other forms of breaches of conduct that have been traditionally recognized as grounds for the discipline of lawyers.
In response, Judge Alzate filed his Manifestation[19] dated July 5, 2022 where he: (1) averred that the administrative case against him should be dismissed for violation of the rule against forum shopping; and (2) adopted the contents of his Comment and Rejoinder.[20]","Under a verified Affidavit-Complaint[1] dated May 18, 2021, complainant Ernesto Callena, Jr. (Callena) charged respondent Hon. Corpus B. Alzate (Judge Alzate), Presiding Judge, Branch 2, Regional Trial Court, Bangued, Abra with simple misconduct constituting a violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct.[2","The Court resolves to adopt the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations of the JIB in its Report dated July 30, 2024.

In administrative proceedings, the quantum of proof necessary for a finding of guilt is substantial evidence or ""that amount of relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.""[33] The burden of substantiating the charges in an administrative proceeding falls on the complainant, who must be able to prove the allegations in the complaint with substantial evidence.[34]

Rule 139-A, Section 1 of the Rules of Court provides that all persons whose names appear or are included in the Roll of Attorneys compose an official body known as the Integrated Bar of the Philippines.[35] Membership in the IBP is automatic and without exception.[36] Every member of the Integrated Bar is required to pay annual dues for the ensuing fiscal year on or before the 31st day of December, as may be extended by the IBP Board of Governors.[37] There is nothing in the law or rules which allows the exemption of any person—much more for members of the bench such as Judge Alzate—from payment of IBP dues.[38]

Here, Judge Alzate admitted in his various submissions to the JIB that he failed to pay his IBP dues from 2004-2021.[39] He stated that:
Immediately after I received the instant complaint, I have undertaken steps to secure an assessment of my arrears and have PAID the IBP Central Office the amount of [PHP 23,100.00] corresponding to my dues from 2004-2021. . .

Admittedly, I have arrears with the IBP (which I have NOW PAID) but the non-payment is a mental lapse. I was under the belief that the advice of a senior judge was true. I relied on this belief in utmost good faith. Thus, the non-payment cannot be considered as a stubborn or arrogant refusal to pay[.]

Mr. Callena aver[s] that I only paid my delinquent dues when this complaint was filed. This is admitted. . .

Admittedly, I have been remiss in my duty to pay my dues on time. . .

. . . .

To emphasize, the non-payment on my part was based on an honest belief; I may be mistaken in assuming that the dues will be paid with interest at the time of retirement but this mistake was done in good faith and not tainted with an evil scheme to defraud the IBP. (Emphasis supplied)
These statements are judicial admissions that require no further proof[40] and remove the admitted facts from the field of controversy.[41] Thus, Judge Alzate's non-payment of IBP dues is beyond dispute.

In any event, the record is replete with documentary evidence of Judge Alzate's malfeasance. In a Letter[42] dated March 22, 2021, IBP National Treasurer Grace P. Quevedo-Panagsagan certified that ""Alzate, Corpus B."" with Roll No. 33514 had ""arrears in IBP Membership Dues"" from 2004-2021. By Certification[43] dated May 20, 2022, Marnelli A. Acosta, Legal Aid Clerk of IBP Abra Chapter, attested that based on the records of IBP Abra Chapter and its List of Members with Delinquencies issued by the IBP National Office, Judge Alzate has not paid his IBP dues for a period of 18 years. Lastly, IBP Official Receipt No. 224392 dated May 24, 2022 submitted by Judge Alzate shows that his payment of PHP 23,100.00 was ""Payment For M[embership] D[ues] 2004-2021.""[44]","ACCORDINGLY, Judge Corpus B. Alzate is found GUILTY of the less serious charge of simple misconduct under Section 15(a), Rule 140 of the Rules of Court, as amended by Administrative Matter No. 21-08-09-SC and FINED in the amount of PHP 150,000.00 payable within three months from the promulgation of this Decision. If unpaid, such amount may be deducted from his salaries and benefits, including accrued leave credits.

Judge Alzate is also found GUILTY of violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability. He is FINED in the amount of PHP 50,000.00 payable within three months from the promulgation of this Decision. Finally, he is STERNLY WARNED that a repetition of the same or similar offense will be dealt with more severely.

Lastly, Judge Alzate is directed to update his IBP membership dues and report his compliance within 10 days from receipt of this Decision."
"G.R. No. 259982, October 28, 2024","PACIFIC OCEAN MANNING, INC. AND/OR V. SHIPS UK LTD./NORDIC AMERICAN TANKERS LIMITED, PETITIONERS, VS. NICOLAS F. BOBILES, RESPONDENT.","On January 27, 2017, Bobiles inspected ... the welded pumps and found that the equipment needs servicing. When he lifted the equipment to be fixed in the work area, he felt something which snapped his back nerves. The impact caused pain which radiated from his shoulder down to his waist. The Master, who was advised on the condition of Bobiles who became incapable to work, requested a medical service from CIRM in Italy.

An advisory was given to the Master to prescribe him with several oral medications. Bobiles was also advised to stay in his cabin to take a rest. Despite the pain relievers, his back remained stiff including his waist. He was practically immobile because of the intense and piercing pain through his back. With this condition, Bobiles remained in his cabin for two weeks.

On February 6, 2017, when Bobiles was able to regain some level of comfort, he tried his best to return to duty but the excruciating pain prevented him from assuming his functions. As a result, Bobiles was advised to stay in his cabin to continue his bed rest... He religiously took medicines as advised and despite oral medications, Bobiles continued to be in severe pain.

On February 27, 2017, when the vessel arrived in Vadinar, India, Bobiles was disembarked upon the advice of the Master. He was brought to Divya Orthopaedic Hospital & Physiotherapy Center where he was attended by Dr. Niraj Vora, an orthopedic specialist who recommended Bobiles to undergo X-Ray and MRI on his Lumbosacral Spine. After undergoing the procedures, he was found to have ""L2-L3"" Instability. Dr. Vora prescribed medications and recommended for his repatriation.

Bobiles arrived in the Philippines on February 28, 2017 and he reported to his manning agent and was referred to Marine Medical Clinic, Manila. He was later endorsed to Cardinal Santos Medical Center, San Juan City and was attended by Dr. Robert Lim who advised [him] to undergo MRI on his lumbar spines.

On March 2, 2017, [per] the MRI, Bobiles was found to have severe injury on his lumbar spine described as ""At L4-5, there is a mild disc bulge with a superimposed 3x10 mm central and bilateral paracentral disc protrusion effacing the ventral thecal sa. No nerve root impingement seen; Minimal L2-3 and L3-4 disc bulges.""

These findings were identical to the previous diagnosis of the company doctor in India.

On March 8, 2017, Bobiles, per advice by Dr. Lim, underwent EMG-NCV. On April 21, 2017, the company doctor issued a diagnosis that Bobiles was suffering from ""L4-L5 Disc Herniation, 15 Radiculopathy."" With these findings, Bobiles was advised to undergo physiotherapy program. He underwent therapy at the Marine Medical Services from April 22, 2017 up to May 18, 2017, which was extended until June 13, 2017. Despite the therapies, Bobiles showed no favorable prognosis and so the therapy was extended on a month to month basis.

... Bobiles sought a second opinion from Dr. Manuel Fidel M. Magtira, MD... Dr. Magtira advised him to undergo laboratory test and examinations. Thus, Dr. Magtira issued a Medical Certificate dated October 30, 2017, pertinent portions of which states:
""Mr. Bobiles still continue[s] to have pain and discomfort on his lower back. He is unable to tolerate prolonged walking and standing. He has not regained his usual capacity. Being a [s]eaman, his works demands are heavy. Since the time of his injury he is unable to work at his previous occupation. Mr. Bobiles is UNFIT to work back as a seaman. He is now permanently disabled.

....
Bobiles claims that he lost the possibility of being employed as a seaman as he cannot tolerate the pain because of the injury...

... [POMI] maintains that ... based on his lumbosacral MRI result, which only showed mild disc bulges, patient is not permanently unfit to sea duties because he may improve over time. Thus, on September 4, 201[7], a final disability assessment of Grade 11 (slight rigidity or 1/3 loss of lifting power of the trunk) was determined by the company doctor... Bobiles refused the offer but never presented any 2nd contrary medical report.

[G]rievance proceedings ensued. [POMI] was willing to refer [Bobiles] to a 3rd doctor; however, Bobiles' representative moved to terminate the proceedings ""for failure to reach amicable settlement."" ...

Bobiles prays that [POMI] be ordered to pay him US$102,308.00 for total permanent disability, [USD] 4,000.00 for unpaid sick wages, [P]500,000.00 for actual and exemplary damages, plus 10% of the award for attorney's fees...

[POMI] prays for the dismissal of the case for utter lack of merit, with cost against Bobiles. In the alternative, [POMI] is willing to pay Bobiles the amount of [USD] 7,465.00 based on the Grade 11 disability assessment of the company designated physician.

... [POMI] maintains that the injury sustained by Bobiles was not a result of an accident, thus not covered by the CBA, and that damages and attorney's fees are not recoverable.[5] (Brackets and italics in the original)
On August 21, 2018, the NCMB issued a Decision in favor of Bobiles. It found that the appointment of a third doctor is not a condition sine qua non to the filing of a complaint for permanent total disability benefits and that his disability is total and permanent. Moreover, it ruled that the disability compensation rates in the CBA should be taken into consideration since they are more favorable to the seafarers. The dispositive portion reads:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment [i]s hereby rendered ordering [petitioners] to jointly and severally pay [Bobiles] the amount of US$102,308.00 as his total permanent disability compensation, plus attorney's fees equivalent to ten percent (10%) of the total monetary award or in their Philippine peso equivalent at the prevailing exchange rate at the actual date of payment.","Over the years, the Court has vacillated on the award of attorney's fees on the basis of Article 111 of the Labor Code and Article 2208 of the Civil Code in worker disability indemnification cases. We clarify that attorney's fees under Article 111 of the Labor Code are recoverable only where there is unlawful withholding of wages, not in cases involving only indemnification claims for disability or death. Anent attorney's fees under Article 2208(2) of the Civil Code, it is not sufficient that the plaintiff be compelled to litigate or incur expense to protect their interest. The litigation or incurrence of expense must be in relation to third persons. A contrary rule would make entitlement to attorney's fees the general rule instead of the exception and would negate the policy against placing a premium on the right to litigate. Finally, attorney's fees under Article 2208(8) of the Civil Code are recoverable only in actions for indemnity under workmen's compensation and employer's liability laws, not under contract.","It is likewise erroneous to base an award of attorney's fees on Article 2208(8) of the Civil Code for the mere reason that the case involves an action for indemnity for disability since said paragraph applies only when the action is under workmen's compensation and employer's liability laws.

Prior to the effectivity of Presidential Decree No. 442 or the Labor Code, workmen's compensation and employer's liability were governed by the Workmen's Compensation Act or Act No. 3428[46] and the Employer's Liability Act or Act No. 1874[47], respectively.[48] With their repeal by the Labor Code, workmen's compensation was thenceforth governed by Title II, Book IV of said Code titled Employee's Compensation and State Insurance Fund.[49] In the case at bench, however, the action for indemnity is not based on the workmen's compensation provisions of the Labor Code or any employer liability law for that matter, but on contract, specifically, the POEA-SEC. Hence, Article 2208(8) of the Civil Code finds no application here.

Since neither Article 111 of the Labor Code nor Article 2208(2) and (8) of the Civil Code apply, may the catch-all provision of Article 2208(11) justify an award of attorney's fees in this case? Our ruling in Estate of Buan v. Camaganacan[50] is instructive:
The exercise of judicial discretion in the award of attorney's fees under Article 2208(11) of the Civil Code demands a factual, legal, or equitable justification upon the basis of which the court exercises, its discretion. Without such justification, the award is a conclusion without a premise, its basis being improperly left to speculation and conjecture.[51]
Other than the bare statement that respondent was forced to litigate to enforce his rights, no factual, legal, or equitable justification was proffered to warrant attorney's fees. Au contraire, since petitioners covered all of respondent's treatment costs, as well as full sickness allowances, it is only equitable under the circumstances to delete the award of attorney's fees.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is PARTLY GRANTED. The July 15, 2021 Decision and March 22, 2022 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA­-G.R. SP No. 158388 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION in that the award of USD 60,000.00 or its equivalent in Philippine pesos shall be subject to 6% legal interest per annum from the finality of this Decision until full payment, and that the award of attorney's fees is DELETED."
"OCA-IPI No. 18-4887-RTJ, October 28, 2024","MARIA MAGDALENA R. JOVEN, COMPLAINANT, VS. HON. MONIQUE A. QUISUMBING-IGNACIO, PRESIDING JUDGE, BRANCH 209, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, MANDALUYONG CITY, VICTOR M. PE BENITO, SHERIFF IV, AND ALFREDO MARCELO BERMEJO, ADMINISTRATIVE AIDE IV, ALL OF BRANCH 209, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, MANDALUYONG CITY, RESPONDENTS.","The facts of the case are lifted from the Report[3] of the Judicial Integrity Board (JIB), as follows:
Anna Marie Sison (Sison), represented by her attorney-in-fact, Rosario de Silva Perion (Perion), filed the complaint in the Civil Case to recover possession of a parcel of land situated in Mandaluyong City, and covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 008-201000489. [Joven] was the defendant in the Civil Case.

During the hearing in the Civil Case on March 20, 2018, Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio tackled [two] incidents raised by the parties, i.e., Sison's motion for the issuance of Writ of Preliminary Mandatory Injunction (Writ of Injunction); and [Joven]'s Omnibus Motion to Dismiss, which was incorporated in her verified Answer with Affirmative and Special Defenses with Counterclaim.

During the hearing on the motion for the issuance of the Writ of Injunction, [Joven]'s counsel objected to portions of Perion's testimony, as narrated in her Judicial Affidavit for being leading and without basis. Thus, in her March 20, 2018 Order, Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio directed Perion: to file her ""Comment on the Motion to Strike Out Certain Portions of the Judicial Affidavit of [Perion] (Motion to Strike Out),"" which was made in open court; to file her Formal Offer of Evidence (FOE) relative to the motion for the issuance of a Writ of Injunction; and to file her Opposition to [Joven]'s Motion to Dismiss within [five] days therefrom, or until March 26, 2018. [Joven], on the other hand, was directed to file her Comment on the FOE, and to file her Reply to the Opposition, to be filed by Perion, within the same number of days from receipt thereof.

However, Perion filed her Opposition and her Comment to [Joven]'s Motion to Strike Out only on March 27, 2018. Thus, in her Reply, [Joven] also included therein a Motion to Expunge Comment/Opposition (Motion to Expunge).

In its May 9, 2018 Notice of Pre-Trial Conference, RTC Branch 209 scheduled the Pre-Trial Conference (Pre-Trial) on May 15, 2018, directing the parties in the Civil Case to submit their respective pre-trial briefs at least [three] days before the scheduled hearing, among others.
 
During the Pre-Trial on May 15, 2018, only Perion's counsel appeared. Moreover, it was only then that she submitted the required pre­-trial brief, without furnishing [Joven] or her counsel with a copy thereof. [Joven], on the other hand, submitted her pre-trial brief earlier on time and was present in court. Accordingly, [Joven]'s counsel moved for the outright dismissal of the case. However, Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio did not immediately rule on the motion and instead declared that the Civil Case should be first referred to mediation and Judicial Dispute Resolution.

In her May 15, 2018 Order, Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio cancelled the pre-trial and declared as submitted, the following motions of [Joven] for resolution: Omnibus Motion to Dismiss; Motion to Strike Out; and the open court Motion to Dismiss on the ground of plaintiffs (as represented by Perion) absence during the pre-trial and failure to submit a copy of the pre­trial brief on time.

[Joven] alleged that on May 30, 2018, she received [three] separate Orders from the RTC: the May 21, 2018 Order, denying all of Joven's motion to strike out certain portions of Perion's Judicial Affidavit; another May 21, 2018 Order, granting Perion's FOE; and the May 22, 2018 Order, denying [Joven]'s Omnibus Motion to Dismiss. [Joven] observed that in the issuance of the said Orders, Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio justified the shortcomings and corrected the errors in the pleadings filed by Perion.

In her June 4, 2018 Order, Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio denied [Joven]'s open court Motion to Dismiss the Civil Case, stating therein that Perion substantially complied with the requirements of the Rules of Court and that, since an earlier case involving the same subject matter was dismissed due to technicalities, the present Civil Case should now be decided on the merits. Thereafter, the Pre-Trial in the Civil Case was reset to July 24, 2018.

In a separate June 4, 2018 Order, Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio granted Perion's motion for the issuance of a Writ of Injunction, conditioned on her posting and court's approval of a bond in the amount of [PHP] 100,000.00.

On June 6, 2018, [Joven] was furnished with a copy of Perion's pleading [titled] ""Compliance (with Very Urgent Request for Approval and Issuance of Writ of Preliminary Mandatory Injunction)"" (Compliance with Request for WPI). Attached thereto as ""Annex A"" is a copy of the June 4, 2018 Order. [Joven] alleged that she was confused as to the nature of the said pleading as she had not yet received any court issuance relative to Perion's prayer for a Writ of Injunction.

In her June 7, 2018 Order, Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio issued the Writ of Preliminary Injunction.

On June 19, 2018, [Joven] filed a Motion for Reconsideration with Motion for Voluntary Inhibition. [Joven] claimed that she received copies of the [two] June 4, 2018 Orders only on June 13, 2018 through mail, while Perion received the same on June 5, 2018. [Joven] insisted that the belated receipt of the Orders effectively prevented her from pursuing the judicial remedies available to her.
 
[Joven] found it highly unusual that the Writ of Injunction was issued the day after Perion's filing of her Compliance with Request for WPI, essentially denying her the chance to oppose it. In addition, [Joven] also observed that all of her motions relative thereto were denied, while Perion's lone pleading, was immediately granted. [Joven] asserted that Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio's bias and partiality were further manifested when orders were sent to her through registered mail while those sent to Perion were served personally, despite the fact the offices of the counsels for both parties are in Mandaluyong City.

Since the Writ of Injunction was already issued, [Joven] filed a Motion to Recall Writ of Preliminary Injunction with Motion for Voluntary Inhibition (Motion to Recall), setting the hearing thereof on July 10, 2018. On that day, however, the scheduled hearing was reset to July 24, 2018 due to the delay in the delivery of the pertinent pleadings through regular mail.

On July 24, 2018, during the supposed hearing on [Joven]'s Motion to Recall, Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio ordered the parties to proceed with the pre-trial instead. [Joven]'s counsel at the time was appearing only by way of special appearance, for the sole purpose of her Motion to Recall. Nonetheless, the said counsel was ordered to read the pre-trial briefs already submitted so they could proceed with the pre-trial conference. Thereafter, Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio issued the Pre-Trial Order and set the trial dates for the plaintiffs presentation of evidence without referring the Civil Case for mediation or Judicial Dispute Resolution.

In her August 10, 2018 Order, Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio directed [Joven] to show cause why she should not be cited in contempt of court for disobeying the directives stated in the Writ of Injunction, which the latter received on August 13, 2018. From the records, it appears that the Writ of Injunction was served upon [Joven] on June 18, 2018.

In her August 17, 2018 Manifestation and Compliance, by way of response to the August 10, 2018 Order, [Joven] explained that due to the pendency of several incidents, the implementation of the Writ of Injunction should be suspended. Further, she stated that Sheriff Pe Benito did not go to her house for its implementation. In addition, [Joven] informed the court that her counsel of record just withdrew his appearance and she would need time to get a new one. Moreover, Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio has yet to refer the case to mediation or Judicial Dispute Resolution.

[Joven] opined that Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio was bent on having her evicted from the subject property, hence, her inaction on the pending incidents.

Thereafter, [Joven] filed a Motion To Set the Hearing for Judicial Dispute Resolution and Motion for Inhibition. [Joven] argued in the motion for inhibition that [Bermejo], who was detailed to RTC Branch 209 by the City of Mandaluyong, is related to Perion's counsel, Atty. Roberto C. Bermejo (Atty. Bermejo), thus, Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio cannot be expected to handle the Civil Case fairly. The hearing on both motions was set on a September 7, 2018, but was rescheduled on September 11, 2018.
 
In her September 11, 2018 Order, Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio referred the Civil Case to mediation. Upon the conclusion of the mediation hearing on September 18, 2018, [Joven] was immediately arrested by the police as soon as she exited the court room pursuant to a Warrant of Arrest issued by Judge Quisumbing-lgnacio on September 6, 2018 for [i]ndirect [c]ontempt of [c]ourt for her refusal to comply with the Writ of Injunction.

In her September 13, 2018 Order, Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio denied [Joven]'s motion for bail and ruled that the latter shall remain imprisoned until the directives of the Writ of Injunction are obeyed.

Finally, [Joven] concluded that the collective acts of the respondents in the case at bar caused her undue injury, and are in violation of Republic Act No. 3019 or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.

In her Comment, respondent Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio prayed for the immediate dismissal of the [C]omplaint for lack of merit, stressing at the outset, that in her October 8, 2018 Order, she had already inhibited from the Civil Case, as prayed for by [Joven] in the latter's several motions for inhibition.

Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio denied that she was merely getting back at [Joven], for the latter's filing of the instant administrative case when she issued the herein assailed Orders. She pointed out that she received the October 18, 2018 1st Indorsement from the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA), directing her to file her Comment on the letter of complaint, sometime in November 2018, while all of the Orders relative to the Civil Case, as assailed by [Joven] were issued prior to that date.","Before this Court is a Letter-Complaint[1] and Supplemental Complaint[2] (collectively, Complaint) filed by Maria Magdalena R. Joven (Joven) charging respondents Hon. Monique Quisumbing-Ignacio (Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio), Presiding Judge, Victor Pe Benito (Sheriff Pe Benito), Sheriff IV, and Alfredo Marcelo Bermejo (Bermejo), Administrative Aide IV, all of Branch 209, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Mandaluyong City, with gross ignorance of the law, gross misconduct, conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service, and violations of the New Code of Judicial Conduct, relative to Civil Case No. R-MND-18-00315-CV, titled ""Anna Marie Sison, represented by Attorney-in-Fact Rosario de Silva Perion v. Magdalena R. Joven (and all persons claiming rights under her),"" a case for recovery of property with prayer for the issuance of preliminary mandatory injunction (the Civil Case).","We adopt the recommendation of the JIB.

Time and again, this Court has ruled that the filing of an administrative complaint is not the proper remedy for every action of a judge considered ""aberrant or irregular"" especially when a judicial remedy exists.[7]

A perusal of the records of the case clearly shows that complainant Joven resorted to the filing of this administrative case merely to get back at Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio for the latter's alleged bias and partiality emanating from her denial of Joven's motions. However, what Joven failed to understand is that the assailed issuances of Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio were issued in the exercise of her judicial discretion, which is beyond the realm of administrative proceedings.

In Biado v. Hon. Brawner-Cualing,[8] this Court held that:
""[A]n administrative complaint is not the appropriate remedy for every act of a Judge deemed aberrant or irregular where a judicial remedy exists and is available."" It must be underscored that ""the acts of a judge in [their] judicial capacity are not subject to disciplinary action."" [They] cannot be civilly, criminally, or administratively liable for [their] official acts, ""no matter how erroneous,"" provided [they act] in good faith.[9] (Citations omitted)
In Bello III v. Judge Diaz,[10] We ruled that ""disciplinary proceedings against judges do not complement, supplement or substitute judicial remedies, whether ordinary or extraordinary. An inquiry into their administrative liability arising from judicial acts may be made only after other available remedies have been settled.""[11]

Likewise, in Ala v. Judge Peras,[12] We ruled that:
Until and unless there is an authoritative pronouncement that the questioned orders of the respondent Judges were indeed tainted by anomaly, there would be no ground to prosecute the respondent Judges, either administratively or criminally, for rendering them. Thus, an administrative complaint is not the appropriate remedy for every act of a judge deemed aberrant or irregular where a judicial remedy exists and is available, for if subsequent developments prove the judge's challenged act to be correct, there would be no occasion to proceed against [them] at all. Thus, the charges being judicial in nature, the remedy of the complainant should have been with the proper court/or the appropriate judicial action and not with the OCA by means of an administrative complaint.[13] (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)
From the foregoing, the alleged errors raised by Joven pertain to Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio's exercise of judicial discretion. Hence, these cannot be the proper subject of an administrative complaint but must be addressed through appropriate judicial remedies.

In fact, as correctly noted by the JIB, Joven filed a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 before the Court of Appeals (CA) on September 17, 2018, docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 157587, assailing the issuances of Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio. The CA dismissed the petition for being filed out of time.[14] Clearly, Joven was aware of the available judicial remedies for her case. This bolsters the fact that her resort to the present administrative complaint is improper.

Moreover, We emphasize that complainant Joven miserably failed to substantiate her claims that Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio acted in bad faith, and with bias and partiality through substantial evidence or such amount of relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion, even if other equally reasonable minds might conceivably opine otherwise.[15] The standard of substantial evidence is satisfied when there is reasonable ground to believe that respondent is responsible for the misconduct complained of, even if such evidence might not be overwhelming or even preponderant.[16]

Bad faith and malice cannot be presumed just because the judgment or order rendered by a Judge is adverse to the complainant.[17]

In Sampiano v. Judge Indar,[18] this Court defined bad faith in this wise:
Bad faith does not simply connote bad judgment or negligence; it imputes a dishonest purpose or some moral obliquity and conscious doing of a wrong; a breach of a sworn duty through some motive or intent or ill-will; it partakes of the nature of fraud. It contemplates a state of mind affirmatively operating with furtive design or some motive of self-interest or ill-will for ulterior purposes. Evident bad faith connotes a manifest deliberate intent on the part of the accused to do wrong or cause damage.[19] (Citation omitted)
Before a judge can be held liable for deliberately rendering an unjust judgment or order, one must be able to show that such judgment or order is unjust and that it was issued with malicious intent to cause injustice to the aggrieved party.[20] In administrative proceedings, the burden of proof rests on the complainant, who must be able to support and prove by substantial evidence his or her accusations against respondent. This Joven failed to do. Apart from her bare allegations, Joven failed to produce any evidence that would show that the assailed orders and issuances were issued without basis, and with manifest partiality. Adequate proof, not mere conjectures or speculations, should be offered. Otherwise, the same deserves no consideration at all.

Anent Joven's allegations against Sheriff Pe Benito and Bermejo, she likewise failed to prove the same through substantial evidence. Sheriff Pe Benito's participation in the Civil Case was limited to his ministerial duty of serving the writ of injunction, and the September 6, 2018 Order upon Joven. With regard to Bermejo, Joven failed to show how his relation to Atty. Bermejo was a factor in the issuance of Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio's assailed issuances.","ACCORDINGLY, the Complaint for gross ignorance of the law, gross misconduct, conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service, and violations of the New Code of Judicial Conduct against Hon. Monique A. Quisumbing-Ignacio, Presiding Judge, Victor Pe Benito, Sheriff IV, and Alfredo Marcelo Bermejo, Administrative Aide IV, all of Branch 209, Regional Trial Court, Mandaluyong City, is DISMISSED for lack of merit and for being judicial in nature."
"G.R. No. 270149, October 23, 2024","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES. PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. XXX270149, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.*","The instant case stemmed from an Information[5] filed against XXX270149, the accusatory portion of which reads:
That on or about 16th day of February 2015 in the xxxxxxxxxxx, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, exercising moral ascendancy, influence and parental authority over his daughter, [AAA270149], a six (6) year old minor, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have sexual intercourse with the latter, by inserting his penis inside her vagina, against her will and without her consent, to her damage and prejudice.

That the crime is qualified by the aggravating circumstance of relationship, the accused being the parent and/or biological father of the minor victim.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[6] (Emphasis in the original)
On November 20, 2019, the City Prosecutor of xxxxxxxxxxx originally charged XXX270149 with rape, which was docketed as Criminal Case No. FC-15-1707. The said case was dismissed for lack of authority of the signing prosecutor in accordance with Rule 112, Section 4 of the Rules of Court.[7] Upon securing the proper authority, the case was re-filed on December 12, 2019 and re-docketed as Criminal Case No. FC-19-3112.[8]

Upon arraignment, XXX270149 pleaded not guilty to the crime charged. Pre-trial was conducted, then trial on the merits ensued.[9] During pre-trial, the parties both stipulated that XXX270149 is the biological father of AAA270149.[10]

AAA270149 narrated that her parents are separated, and she lived with her father, XXX270149. On February 16, 2015, they went to the house of XXX270149's friend, Joey Amboyao (Joey), in xxxxxxxxxxx for a drinking session. Joey's wife, Melody Amboyao (Melody), their children, and AAA270149 were inside their house, while he and XXX270149 were drinking in their porch.[11]

AAA270149 went to the bathroom to defecate and then called XXX270149 to help her clean up. When XXX270149 was inside the bathroom with AAA270149, he removed his brief and AAA270149's panty, then he inserted his finger into AAA270149's vagina. Afterwards, she made AAA270149 lean on a cement wall inside the bathroom. XXX270149 was behind AAA270149 and inserted his penis into her vagina. She cried because it was so painful and uttered the words ""aray ko papa, tama na."" AAA270149 noted that while XXX270149 was doing these things to her, Melody was near the bathroom.

Melody testified that she sensed that something bad was happening to AAA270149, so she went inside the bathroom. When she brushed the curtain aside, she was surprised to see AAA270149's underwear on her feet, and XXX270149 was behind AAA270149 with his underwear down to his knees, and his penis was inside AAA270149's vagina.[12] Melody immediately ordered AAA270149 to go to her room, and when Melody checked her underwear, she saw blood stains on it.

Meanwhile, XXX270149 immediately went back to the porch where he was drinking liquor with Joey. Afterwards, Melody brought AAA270149 to Marilyn Tan (Marilyn), a social worker in their area. Marilyn also saw the blood stains on AAA270149's underwear. Then, they went to the police station to report the incident.[13]

Joey corroborated the testimony of Melody. He testified that XXX270149 asked him where AAA270149 was. Joey responded that AAA270149 went with Melody to buy some drinks. XXX270149 immediately ran away, and when Joey chased him, they engaged into a fist fight until the barangay tanods arrived to pacify them. XXX270149 was then brought to the barangay hall, and later to the police station.[14]

For his part, XXX270149 admitted that he is AAA270149's father, but denied the accusation against him. He testified that he went to the house of his friend Joey, with his daughter, to cook dog's meat. Joey asked him to climb a coconut tree to get a coconut, which they would use in cooking dog's meat. When he was at the top of the coconut tree, he heard his daughter AAA270149 calling him, so he immediately went down from the tree. Upon reaching down, Joey boxed him, so he ran away, leaving his daughter behind.[15]

In its Judgment,[16] the RTC found XXX270149 guilty of qualified rape, disposing as follows:
WHEREFORE, the Court finds accused [XXX270149] GUILTY of Qualified Rape under Article 266-A[,] paragraph 1(d), as qualified under Article 266-B of the RPC, as amended, and hereby imposes upon him the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA, without eligibility for parole, pursuant to Section 3 of [Republic Act] No. 9346.

The accused is likewise ordered to pay of [PHP] 100,000.00 as civil indemnity; [PHP] 100,000.00 as moral damages; and [PHP] 100,000.00 as exemplary damages, with interest at the rate of 6% per annum counted from the date of finality of this judgment until fully paid.","This Court resolves an Appeal[1] assailing the Decision[2] of the Court of Appeals (CA), which affirmed the Judgment[3] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) convicting XXX270149 of violation of Article 266-A in relation to Article 266-B(1) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended.[4]","The Appeal is bereft of merit.

Preliminary, as a rule, only questions of law, and not questions of fact, can be raised in a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. This Court, not being a trier of facts, is not duty-bound to re-examine and calibrate the evidence on record. It will not entertain questions of fact as the factual findings of the appellate courts are ""final, binding, or conclusive on the parties and upon this Court when supported by substantial evidence.""[22]

After a careful review of the records of this case, this Court finds no cogent reason to reverse the ruling of the CA. Time and again, this Court has ruled that the ""trial court's factual findings, especially its assessment of the credibility of witnesses, are accorded great weight and respect and binding upon this Court, particularly when affirmed by the CA.""[23]

Articles 266-A and 266-B(1) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 8353, state:
ARTICLE 266-A. Rape: When and How Committed. — Rape is committed:

1) By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:
a) Through force, threat, or intimidation;

b) When the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious;

c) By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority; and

d) When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present.
Article 266-B. Penalties. — Rape under paragraph 1 of the next preceding article shall be punished by reclusion perpetua.

....

The death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following attendant circumstances:
1) When the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, [stepparent], guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim[.]
Under Article 266-A(1) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, the elements of rape are:
(1) the offender is a man who had carnal knowledge of a woman; and (2) he accomplished such act through force or intimidation upon her; or she is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; or she is under 12 years of age or is demented. The gravamen of rape is carnal knowledge or sexual intercourse with a woman against her will or without her consent.[24] (Citation omitted)
In People v. Tulagan,[25] this Court held that if the victim of the sexual abuse is below 12 years old, the offender should be prosecuted for statutory rape under Article 266-A(d) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended. Here, AAA270149 was below 12 years old when the rape incident happened.

More, rape is qualified when the victim is under 18 years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, stepparent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim. The elements of qualified rape are: (1) sexual congress; (2) with a woman; (3) done by force and without consent; (4) the victim is under 18 years of age at the time of the rape; and (5) the offender is a parent (whether legitimate, illegitimate or adopted) of the victim.[26]

Hence, to raise the crime of rape, be it simple rape or statutory rape to qualified rape, the twin circumstances of minority of the victim and her relationship to the offender must concur. In the present case, the elements of qualified rape were sufficiently alleged in the Information: a) AAA270149 was 6 years old at the time of the rape incident; and b) accused-appellant is AAA270149's biological father. The foregoing elements were also sufficiently proven by the prosecution.

In People v. Pruna,[27] this Court enumerated the guidelines for proving the victim's age, thus:
In order to remove any confusion that may be engendered by the foregoing cases, we hereby set the following guidelines in appreciating age, either as an element of the crime or as a qualifying circumstance.

1. The best evidence to prove the age of the offended party is an original or certified true copy of the certificate of live birth of such party.

2. In the absence of a certificate of live birth, similar authentic documents such as baptismal certificate and school records[,] which show the date of birth of the victim[,] would suffice to prove age.

3. If the certificate of live birth or authentic document is shown to have been lost or destroyed or otherwise unavailable, the testimony, if clear and credible, of the victim's mother or a member of the family either by affinity or consanguinity who is qualified to testify on matters respecting pedigree such as the exact age or date of birth of the offended party pursuant to Section 40, Rule 130 of the Rules on Evidence shall be sufficient under the following circumstances:
a. If the victim is alleged to be below 3 years of age and what is sought to be proved is that [they are] less than 7 years old;

b. If the victim is alleged to be below 7 years of age and what is sought to be proved is that [they are] less than 12 years old;

c. If the victim is alleged to be below 12 years of age and what is sought to be proved is that [they are] less than 18 years old.
4. In the absence of a certificate of live birth, authentic document, or the testimony of the victim's mother or relatives concerning the victim's age, the complainant's testimony will suffice provided that it is expressly and clearly admitted by the accused.

5. It is the prosecution that has the burden of proving the age of the offended party. The failure of the accused to object to the testimonial evidence regarding age shall not be taken against [them].

6. The trial court should always make a categorical finding as to the age of the victim.[28] (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)
From the foregoing guidelines, the best evidence to prove the age of a person is the original birth certificate or certified true copy. In their absence, similar authentic documents may be presented such as baptismal certificates and school records. If the original or certified true copy of the birth certificate is not available, credible testimonies of the victim's mother or a member of the family may be sufficient under certain circumstances.[29] In the event that both the birth certificate or other authentic documents and the testimonies of the victim's mother or other qualified relative are unavailable, the testimony of the victim may be admitted in evidence provided that it is expressly and clearly admitted by the accused.[30]","ACCORDINGLY, the Appeal is DENIED.

CEB CR. HC. No. 03586, which affirmed the Decision[3] dated August 19, 2019 and the Order[4] dated September 17, 2019 of Branch 55, Regional Trial Court of xxxxxxxxxxx, xxxxxxxxxxx (RTC). The RTC found Andre Gayanilo y Eleveran (Andre), Stephen Lumanog y Eleveran (Stephen), and Aldrin Gayanilo y Eleveran (Aldrin; collectively, accused-­appellants) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of rape, as defined and penalized under Article 266-A, in relation to Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).","The appeal is without merit.

At the outset, it must be stressed that in criminal cases, an appeal throws the entire case wide open for review and the reviewing tribunal can correct errors, though unassigned in the appealed judgment, or even reverse the trial court's decision based on grounds other than those that the parties raised as errors. The appeal confers the appellate court full jurisdiction over the case and renders such court competent to examine records, revise the judgment appealed from, increase the penalty, and cite the proper provision of the penal law.[21]

Guided by the foregoing consideration, the Court affirms accused-­appellants' conviction with modification, as will be explained hereunder.

Pertinent portions of Article 266-A(l) and Article 266-B of the RPC respectively read:
Article 266-A. Rape: When and How Committed. – Rape is committed –

1) By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:

a) Through force, threat, or intimidation;

b) When the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious;

c) By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority; and

d) When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present.

....

Article 266-B. Penalty. – Rape under paragraph 1 of the next preceding article shall be punished by reclusion perpetua.

Whenever the rape is committed with the use of a deadly weapon or by two or more persons, the penalty shall be reclusion perpetua to death.
Thus, the elements of rape are: (a) the offender had carnal knowledge of the victim; and (b) such act was accomplished through force or intimidation, or when the victim is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious, or when the victim is under 12 years of age.[22]

Further, it bears stressing that sexual abuse cases are, more often than not, solely decided based on the credibility of the testimony of the private complainant. Thus, in evaluating the credibility of witnesses, the Court should abide by the following guidelines: (a) the Court gives the highest respect to the RTC's evaluation of the testimony of the witnesses, considering its unique position in directly observing the demeanor of a witness on the stand. From its vantage point, the trial court is in the best position to determine the truthfulness of witnesses; (b) absent any substantial reason which would justify the reversal of the RTC's assessments and conclusions, the reviewing court is generally bound by the lower court's findings, particularly when no significant facts and circumstances, affecting the outcome of the case, are shown to have been overlooked or disregarded; and (c) the rule is even more stringently applied if the CA concurred with the RTC.[23]

Moreover, in People v. Amper,[24] the Court held that ""when a woman says she was raped, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that a rape was committed, and if her testimony meets the test of credibility, conviction may issue on the basis thereof.""[25]

Here, the courts a quo correctly ruled that the prosecution—through the positive, candid, and categorical testimony of AAA—had established beyond reasonable doubt that accused-appellants had carnal knowledge of AAA through force. Thus, the Court finds no cogent reason to reverse the RTC's assessment of AAA's credibility, which was affirmed by the CA. Absent any evidence that such assessment was tainted with arbitrariness or oversight of a fact of consequence or influence—especially so when affirmed by the CA—it is entitled to great weight, if not conclusive and binding on the Court.[26] As such, accused-appellants' criminal liability must be sustained.

In an attempt to relieve themselves from liability, accused-appellants aver that no evidence, i.e., photographs, medical report and/or testimonial evidence from a medical expert, was presented during the trial to prove the physical trauma or hematoma that would have resulted from the alleged force that was exerted upon AAA. Accused-appellants further allege that AAA was not distressed the day after the alleged rape when she appeared before the police and medical officer, which negate AAA's claim that she was sexually molested by force, threat or intimidation. In addition, accused-appellants assert that AAA's testimony does not deserve credence as it is riddled with inconsistencies.[27]

Accused-appellants arguments fail to persuade.","ACCORDINGLY, the appeal is DENIED. The Decision dated February 10, 2021 and the Resolution dated September 29, 2021 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CEB CR. HC.

"G.R. No. 255703, October 23, 2024","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. SIM O. MATA, JR., ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","The instant case stemmed from an Information[4] charging Mata, Edgardo A. Tallado (Tallado), and Mario T. Dela Cruz (Dela Cruz), in their respective capacities as provincial legal officer, provincial governor, and supervising administrative officer of the Province of Camarines Norte of the aforesaid crime. The accusatory portion of the said Information reads:
That on 19 November 2012, or sometime prior or subsequent thereto, in Daet, Camarines Norte Province, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, accused public officers, EDGARDO A. TALLADO, being the Governor of Camarines Norte Province, SIM O. MATA, JR., Provincial Legal Officer[,] and MARIO T. DELA CRUZ, Supervising Administrative Officer of said province, committing the offense in relation to their office and taking advantage of their respective official positions, conspiring with one another did then and there willfully[,] unlawfully, and criminally cause undue injury and prejudice to Provincial Veterinarian Edgardo S. Gonzales, in the discharge of their official and/or administrative functions through evident bad faith, by adamantly ignoring the orders of the Civil Service Commission (CSC) directing TALLADO to reinstate Gonzales as Provincial Veterinarian from the Provincial Information Office back to the Provincial Veterinary Office (PVO), and with the cooperation of MATA and DELA CRUZ, TALLADO dropped Gonzales from the rolls and obstinately refused to effectuate CSC Decision No. 13-0841 dated 12 August 2013 directing him to restore Gonzales in the amount representing his compensation, salary[,] and allowances from the time he was removed from his station [or] specific position.","Before the Court is an ordinary appeal[1] assailing the Decision[2] dated September 25, 2020 and the Resolution[3] dated January 7, 2021 of the Sandiganbayan in Criminal Case No. SB-17-CRM-0250. The assailed Decision finds accused-appellant Sim O. Mata, Jr. (Mata) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 3019, entitled the ""Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.""","The appeal is meritorious.

I.

Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 states:
Section 3. Corrupt practices of public officers. — In addition to acts or omissions of public officers already penalized by existing law, the following shall constitute corrupt practices of any public officer and are hereby declared to be unlawful:

....

(e) Causing any undue injury to any party, including the Government, or giving any private party any unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of his official administrative or judicial functions through manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence. This provision shall apply to officers and employees of offices or government corporations charged with the grant of licenses or permits or other concessions.
Verily, the elements of violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 are as follows: (a) that the accused must be a public officer discharging administrative, judicial, or official functions (or a private individual acting in conspiracy with such public officers); (b) that they acted with manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or inexcusable negligence; and (c) that their action caused any undue injury to any party, including the government, or gave any private party unwarranted benefits, advantage, or preference in the discharge of his functions.[26]

The first element is self-explanatory. With respect to the second element, in People v. Naciongayo,[27] the Court explained that there are three means of committing the crime charged—i.e., through manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence—and proof of any of these in connection with the prohibited acts under Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 is enough to convict.[28] Finally, as regards the last element, Naciongayo further expounded that ""there are two ways by which a public official violates Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 in the performance of his functions, namely: (1) by causing undue injury to any party, including the Government; or (2) by giving any private party any unwarranted benefit, advantage or preference. The accused may be charged under either mode or both. The disjunctive term 'or' connotes that either act qualifies as a violation of Section 3 (e) of R.A. No. 3019. In other words, the presence of one would suffice[.] ""[29]

The first element is present in this case as it is undisputed that at the time material to this case, Mata was the provincial legal officer of the Province of Camarines Norte, and he committed the acts subject in the performance of his official duties.

However, the prosecution failed to establish beyond reasonable doubt the presence of the second and third elements in this case, as will be explained.

Essentially, the Sandiganbayan hinged Mata's conviction on his act of giving erroneous legal advice to Tallado, namely: first, not to immediately implement CSC Decision No. 120494, and instead, to make use of the legal remedies available to them; and second, to drop Dr. Gonzales from the rolls due to his purported absences.

The Court is not convinced.","ACCORDINGLY, the Appeal is GRANTED. The Decision dated September 25, 2020 and the Resolution dated January 7, 2021 of the Sandiganbayan in Criminal Case No. SB-17-CRM-0250 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Accused-appellant Sim O. Mata, Jr. is ACQUITTED of the crime of violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019, entitled the ""Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.""

Let entry of judgment be issued immediately.

Sim O. Mata, Jr. is required to SHOW CAUSE within thirty (30) days from receipt of this Decision as to why he should not be disciplined as a member of the Bar in accordance with the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability for his refusal to immediately implement CSC Decision No. 120494, in violation of prevailing civil service rules."

CONCHITA CARPIO-MORALES, IN HER CAPACITY AS OMBUDSMAN, AND HON. MEL SENEN S. SARMIENTO, IN HIS CAPACITY AS SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT, RESPONDENTS.","In 2009, the Bids and Awards Committee of the National Headquarters (NHQ BAC) of the Philippine National Police (PNP) issued Resolution No. 2009-53[2] for the procurement of the PNP Maritime Group's (PNP MG) 16 police coastal crafts. The NHQ BAC likewise issued Resolution No. 2009-54[3] delegating its authority to PNP MG for the procurement of said coastal crafts through public bidding. The delegated authority was subject to the condition that the procured items must be first accepted by an inspection and acceptance committee (IAC) created for the purpose or as determined by the NHQ BAC to ensure compliance with the National Police Commission (NAPOLCOM) specifications for coastal crafts, thus:
NOW THEREFORE, the Committee resolved, as it hereby resolves, to recommend to the Chief, PNP that the public bidding of the procurement of sixteen (16) units [of] Police Coastal Craft. . . should be delegated to [the PNP] MG Bids and Awards Committee subject to existing accounting and auditing rules and regulations. The item delivered, however, shall be accepted by the Inspection and Acceptance Committee (IAC) created for the purpose or as determined by the NHQ-BAC as a matter of procedure to ensure compliance with the NAPOLCOM confirmed PNP specifications and for record purposes.[4] (Emphasis supplied)
Accordingly, the PNP MG created its own Bids and Awards Committee (PNP MG BAC) which included Police Senior Superintendent (PSSUPT) Cornelio Salinas, Police Superintendent (PSUPT) Nepomuceno Corpus, Jr., and PSSUPT Michael Amos Filart (PSSUPT Salinas et al.).[5] However, the PNP MG failed to create its own IAC. Neither did the NHQ BAC issue any resolution or authorization for the inspection of the items to be procured by the PNP MG as the end user of coastal crafts.[6] Meantime, in September and October 2009, tropical storms Ondoy and Pepeng devastated the country and led to the declaration of a state of national calamity. In November 2009, strong tropical cyclones Quedan, Ramil, Santi, Tino, Urduja, and Vinta came in the wake of Ondoy and Pepeng.[7]

On November 27, 2009, the PNP MG BAC and its observers held a conference attended by two bidders: Four Petals Trading (Four Petals) and business partners Dante Samandan and Antonio Martines. However, Samandan and Martines were disqualified because their company was not registered and had no personality to participate. Thus, Four Petals became the sole participant. Considering that there were no existing specifications for coastal crafts yet, the PNP MG BAC used the particulars for motorized bancas under NAPOLCOM Resolution No. 2005-064.[8]

Thereafter, the PNP MG BAC found Four Petals qualified based on the following documentary requirements: (1) registration with the Department of Trade and Industry; (2) verified information sheet dated January 26, 2009; (3) verified letter of its proprietress, Ma. Pacita H. Umali; (4) certification of its personnel; (5) location map of its office address; (6) Parañaque City business permits for the years 2009 and 2010; (7) certificate of registration with the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR); (8) BIR tax clearance for 2008 and 2010; (9) certificate of registration dated August 12, 2009 issued by the Procurement Service of the Department of Budget and Management; (10) license to engage in afloat ship repair dated April 4, 2007 issued by the Maritime Industry Authority and (11) various certificates of good standing issued by the PNP MG, PNP Traffic Management Group, PNP Office of the Legal Service, and PNP Police Community Relations Group.[9]

Cognizant of the widespread and massive damage brought about by Ondoy and Pepeng, and given the announcement from the Department of National Defense (DND) and the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) that more typhoons were still to be expected, the PNP MG BAC issued undated Resolution No. 2009-10[10] recommending the emergency purchase of the coastal crafts and awarding the negotiated contract to Four Petals:
WHEREAS, inasmuch as there is a need to address immediately the problem of proper equipage, this Group recommends the emergency purchase of sixteen (16) Police Coastal Crafts.","The Court resolves in these consolidated Petitions for Review on Certiorari[1] the administrative liability of the members of the Bids and Awards Committee and chairperson of the Logistics Support Services in the procurement, inspection, and acceptance of police coastal crafts.","The Office of the Ombudsman exercises full administrative disciplinary jurisdiction over all elective and appointive officials, save only for impeachable officers. This power covers the entire range of administrative activities attendant to administrative adjudication. It includes the authority to receive complaints, conduct investigations, hold hearings in accordance with its rules of procedure, summon witnesses and require the production of documents, place under preventive suspension public officers and employees pending an investigation, determine the appropriate penalty imposable on erring public officers or employees as warranted by the evidence, and impose the corresponding penalties.[64] The quantum of proof in administrative proceedings necessary for a finding of guilt is substantial evidence or such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind may accept as adequate to support a conclusion.[65] The burden to establish the charges rests upon the complainant. The case should be dismissed for lack of merit if the complainant fails to show in a satisfactory manner the facts upon which his or her accusations are based.[66] The respondent is not even obliged to prove his or her exception or defense.[67] More importantly, an absolution from a criminal charge is not a bar to an administrative prosecution or vice versa. The ruling on the existence or absence of probable cause is entirely independent from an inquiry as to the administrative liability of the respondent.[68] Given these precepts, the Court now rules on the administrative liability of PSSUPT Salinas et al. and PSUPT Marasigan.

A review of the evidence on record shows that the prosecution discharged its burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt that: first, all the elements of the crimes charged are present; and second, accused-appellant is the one who perpetrated the crimes.[67]
 
The prosecution has proven beyond reasonable doubt that XXX270317 is guilty of acts of lasciviousness under Article 336 of the Revised Penal Code, in relation to Section 5(b) of Republic Act No. 7610.
 

To convict an accused of acts of lasciviousness under Article 336 of the Revised Penal Code, in relation to Section 5(b) of Republic Act No. 7610, the prosecution must prove all the elements of acts of lasciviousness under the Revised Penal Code and sexual abuse under Republic Act No. 7610.[68] Relevantly, the elements of acts of lasciviousness are: (1) the offender commits any act of lasciviousness or lewdness; (2) the lascivious act is done under any of the following circumstances: (a) by using force or intimidation; (b) when the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; or (c) when the offended party is under 12 years of age; and (3) the offended party is another person of either sex.[69]

On the other hand, sexual abuse under Republic Act No. 7610 has three elements: first, that the accused commits an act of sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct; second, the said act is performed with a child exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse; and third, the child, whether male or female is below 18 years old.[70]

Here, the prosecution was able to prove the relevant elements of acts of lasciviousness and sexual abuse to the point of moral certainty.

First, accused-appellant committed lascivious conduct against AAA270317. Section 2(h) of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of Republic Act No. 7610 defines ""lascivious conduct"" as follows:
""Lascivious conduct"" means the intentional touching, either directly or through clothing, of the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks, or the introduction of any object into the genitalia, anus or mouth, of any person, whether of the same or opposite sex, with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person, bestiality, masturbation, lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of a person; (Emphasis supplied)

SAGOT: Ako po ay iniiyot nya.

11. TANONG: Ano yung sinasabi mo na iniiyot ka ni papa?
SAGOT: Yun po ay yung ginagawa niya sa akin.

....

20. TANONG: Mga ilang beses ginawa sa iyo ni papa ([XXX270317]) na sinabi mo na pagsasamantala sa iyo?
SAGOT: Madaming madami po, hindi ko na po mabilang sa sobrang dami, at ang huli po ay kahapon po ng madaling araw, (Marso 6, 2015) mga alas kwatro (4:00 AM) habang ako po ay nagpapainit pong tubig na panligo ay lumapit si papa at pinipilit po akong pinapupunta sa bodega para daw po ako ay kanyang iyutin, pinaghihipo niya ang aking dede at pepe at nakatakbo ako palayo sa kanya at umakyat at natulog ulit ako ng kalahating oras at saka po ako lumabas ng wala na si papa sa labas.[74]
AAA270317 affirmed the contents of her affidavit when she was presented as a witness before the trial court;[75] the lower courts also found her testimony credible and worthy of belief.[76]

Second, AAA270317 was a child subjected to sexual abuse. Section 2(g) of the IRR of Republic Act No. 7610 defines ""sexual abuse"" as follows:
""Sexual abuse"" includes the employment, use, persuasion, inducement, enticement or coercion of a child to engage in, or assist another person to engage in, sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct or the molestation, prostitution, or incest with children;
In Quimvel v. People,[77] this Court ruled that the terms ""coercion"" or ""influence"" under the law is broad enough to include ""force and intimidation"" and influence is subsumed under the term persuasion or coercion.[78] Here, AAA270317 narrated that her father used force to grope her breasts and vagina.[79]

Third, the minority of AAA270317 at the time the rape incident occurred was proven by her certificate of live birth,[80] which shows that she was born on May 21, 2004. Thus, she was only 10 years old when XXX270317 sexually abused her.
 
Similarly, the prosecution has proven to the point of moral certainty that XXX270317 is guilty of six counts of sexual assault under Article 266-A(2) of the Revised Penal Code, in relation to Section 5(b) of Republic Act No. 7610.
 

To convict an accused of rape through sexual assault under Article 266-A(2) of the Revised Penal Code, the following elements must be proven beyond reasonable doubt: (1) the accused committed an act of sexual assault by (a) inserting his penis into another person's mouth or anal orifice, or (b) inserting any instrument or object into the genital or anal orifice of another person; and, (2) the act was accomplished (a) through the use of force or intimidation, or (b) when the victim is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious, or (c) when the victim is under 12 years of age or is demented.[81] In People v. Tulagan,[82] We held that when the victim is under 12 years of age or is demented, the proper nomenclature of the crime should be sexual assault under Article 266-A(2) of the Revised Penal Code, in relation to Section 5(b) of Republic Act No. 7610.[83]

Aside from the above elements, the courts are also guided by the following principles in the review of rape cases:
(1) [A]n accusation of rape, while easy to make, is difficult to prove and even harder for the person accused, though innocent, to disprove; (2) because rape, by its very nature, involves only two persons, the testimony of the complainant should be scrutinized with greatest caution; (3) the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merits and must not be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense; and (4) the complainant's credibility assumes paramount importance because her testimony, if credible, is sufficient to support the conviction of the accused.[84]
Thus, the primordial consideration in rape cases is the credibility of the testimony of the victim because the accused may be convicted solely on such testament, provided that it is credible, natural, convincing, and consistent with human nature and the normal course of things.[85]

Here, the prosecution proved the elements of the crime to the point of moral certainty through the clear and credible testimonies of AAA270317 and BBB270317, and documentary evidence.

AAA270317 and BBB270317's testimonies established that they were sexually assaulted by accused-appellant on six different occasions. AAA270317 narrated in her affidavit[86] that accused-appellant inserted his finger in her vagina on two occasions sometime in September 2013:
12. TANONG: Kelan at saan ginawa ni papa ([XXX270317]) iyon?
SAGOT: Nagsimula po iyon noong tumira kami xxxxxxxxxxx, xxxxxxxxxxx, noon pong September 2013.

13. TANONG: Pwede mo bang ikwento sa akin kung pano yung sinasabi mong pagsasamantala ni papa sa iyo?
SAGOT: Opo, Nagsimula po iyon pagkatapos ng dalawang araw na lumipat kami sa xxxxxxxxxxx galing Calamba, na pilit po akong isinama ni papa sa banyo at hinubad ang aking suot na shorts at panty, sinabihan po niya ako na huwag maingay at yung gagawin niya sa akin ay sa una lamang masakit at pagtagal ay masasarapan po ako at malaki daw ang tiyan ni mama kaya ako na ang gusto niya. Pagkahubad po niya ng aking shorts at panty ay kinandong niya ako, hubo po si papa at ipinasok niya ang daliri niya sa aking pepe (the victim show her right middle finger). Sinabi ko po na huwag po niya gawin iyon pero sinabihan niya ako na huwag maingay at huwag magsumbong. Pagkatapos po ay pinalabas na ako ni papa ng banyo.

....

16. TANONG: May sunod pa bang nangyari?
SAGOT: Opo, pagkatapos po ng isang araw ay gabi ng kumakain siya ng sili at isinama niya ulit ako sa banyo at doon ipinasok niya and daliri niyang maanghang kaya sumakit ang pepe ko, kaya pinaghugas na niya ako at pinalabas na ng banyo.[87]
On the other hand, BBB270317 averred in her affidavit[88] that she was anally penetrated by XXX270317 on three occasions in 2014 and again on March 6, 2015:
07. TANONG: Bakit ka narito sa Police Station nagayun?
SAGOT: Para po maikwento ko sainyo ang ginawa sa akin ni papa.

08. TANONG: Anong pangalan ni papa, edad at trabaho?
SAGOT: [XXX270317] po, 31 taong gulang, poultry boy at tubong Romblon, Romblon po.

09. TANONG: Ano yung sinasabi mong gusto mong sabihin sa akin na ginawa sa iyo ni papa mo.
SAGOT: Kasi po eh masama ang ginawa ni papa.

10. TANONG: Kagaya ng ano?
SAGOT: Hinindot po ako.

10. TANONG: Kailan at saan yung sinasabi mo na hinindot ka ni papa?
SAGOT: Hindi pa po ako napasok sa xxxxxxxxxxx Elementary School (sometime in 2014). Sa looban po, malayo sa aming bahay noon isinama po ako sa pangunguha ng sili.

11. TANONG: Ikwento mo nga sa akin kung anong nangyari doon sa looban?
SAGOT: Nangunguha po kami ng sili tapos po ay hinubadan ako ni papa ng shorts at panty, tapos po e pinahawak nya ako sa puno tapos po e hinindot ako ni papa sa pwet, hinubo ni papa ang kanyang shorts at brief (the victim demonstrate the sexual act of his father). Ipinasok ni papa ang kanyang titi sa aking puwet. Umiyak po ako at sinabihan ni papa na huwag maingay. Pagkatapos po na maipasok ni papa ang titi niya sa aking puwet ay pinagbihis na niya ako at biglang dumating si ate ([AAA270317]) at sinabi na hinahanap na ako ni mama.

12. TANONG: Meron pa bang nangyari?
SAGOT: Meron pa po, medyo matagal na din po, gabi po ay pinalabas ako ni papa, tapos po ay hinila ako sa bodega, hinubadan ng tsinelas, shorts at panty tapos po ay pinahiga/pinatuwad ako sa sahig (the victim demonstrated the position). Naghubo po si papa ng shorts at brief at nilagyan ng mantika ang kanyang titi tapos po eh pinasok niya ang kanyang titi sa aking puwet. Umiyak po ako at tinakpan niya ang aking bibig ng kanyang kamay at sinabing tumigil ako sa pag-iyak ko. Habang ipinapasok po ni papa ang kanyang titi sa aking puwet at hinahawakan niya ang dede ko. Sabi ko po sakanya ""PAPA AYOKO NA"", ang sagot po niya ay ""HALA HINDI KO NA BIBILHIN AT AASIKASUHIN ANG PROJECT MO"".

13. TANONG: May sunod pa bang nangyari?
SAGOT: Opo, meron pa po. Isang gabi po ay hinila ako ni papa papuntang CR, umiyak po ako at sinabi ko kay papa na ""PAPA, AYOKO NA, AYOKO NA"", pero po ang sabi nya ay ""HALA SIGE PAPALUIN KITA"", tapos po ay hinubadan niya ako ng shorts at panty at pinahawak sa pader tapos po ay hinubad niya ang kanyang shorts at brief at hinindot po niya ako, pinasok niya ang kanyang titi sa aking puwet. Pagkatapos ay binihisan na po niya ako at habang palabas ng CR ay hawak hawak ni papa ang pepe ko.

14. TANONG: May susunod pa bang nangyari?
SAGOT: Opo, kahapon po (Marso 6, 2015) ng madaling araw at titingnan ko po ang sinaing ni ate, paglabas ko ay nandoon si papa, pagkatingin ko po ng sinaing ay hinindot ako ni papa, hinalikan sa pisngi, hinubadan ng shorts at panty at pinahawak sa abuhan (lutuan) tsaka ipinasok ni papa ang kanyang titi sa aking puwet. Tapos po ay inihatid pa ako ni papa sa loob ng bahay hawak ang akin pepe.[89]
Both AAA270317[90] and BBB270317[91] affirmed the contents of their affidavit when they were presented as witnesses during trial. The RTC found their narration of what occurred ""credible, clear, positive, and convincing""[92] and the CA mirrored the RTC's findings and added that their testimonies are ""conclusive, logical, and probable.""[93]

It was duly proven by the evidence on record that both AAA270317 and BBB270317 were below 12 years of age when the sexual assaults occurred. Based on her certificate of live birth,[94] AAA270317 was only 9 years old when she was sexually assaulted by accused-appellant sometime in 2013. As for BBB270317, her certificate of live birth[95] reveals that she was only 8 years old when she was sexually assaulted by accused-appellant on four different occasions between 2014 to 2015.","FOR THESE REASONS, the appeal is DENIED.

"G.R. No. 268891, October 22, 2024","GERARDO ""JERRY"" A. NOVERAS, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS AND NARCISO DELA CRUZ AMANSEC, RESPONDENTS.","In the late afternoon of March 30, 2022, respondent Narciso Dela Cruz Amansec (Amansec) and his wife went to the Aurora Training Center (ATC) compound to visit a police officer friend who was stationed there. While walking towards the compound, which hosted facilities of the provincial government, Amansec saw a tarpaulin with a certain image and red background. When Amansec moved closer to the premises, he saw the same image and background being printed on tarpaulin sheets, which turned out to be materials for Noveras's vice-gubernatorial campaign. Amansec also discovered that the tarpaulin printing machine was being run by Michael Tecuico (Tecuico), a casual employee of the Aurora Local Government Unit (LGU). Amansec approached Tecuico and asked him to explain why Noveras's campaign materials were being printed on LGU premises. Amansec claimed that Tecuico got angry and defensive at the inquiry and forcibly removed him from the premises. Amansec thus filed a police report and applied for a search warrant of the ATC compound.[4]

On March 31, 2022, the executive judge of Branch 91, Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Baler, Aurora issued a search warrant for ""illegally printed election propaganda or campaign materials of Atty. Christian Noveras and Atty. Gerardo Noveras, Gubernatorial and Vice-Gubernatorial candidates for the Province of Aurora, respectively, which materials are deemed properties ""subject of the offense"" or 'fruits of the offense""; and printing machines being used as a means of committing an offense which are kept inside the said Printing Room, also referred to as the ""Extension Office of the Provincial Capitol"" located at the Training Center (ATC), Sitio Setan, Barangay Calabuanan, Baler, Aurora.""[5] The search warrant was implemented on April 2, 2022. Recovered from the ATC premises were the following items: one tarpaulin eco solvent printer, one inkjet printer, a personal computer set and computer peripherals, a semi-automatic eyelet machine, and 41 pieces of tarpaulin campaign materials and/or tarpaulin design templates[6] bearing the names of Noveras and other candidates for various provincial and municipal elective offices in Aurora.[7] The implementation of the search warrant was witnessed by an elected barangay official and three media representatives.[8] Amansec further alleged that one of the witnesses was able to take a photograph of the tarpaulin campaign materials showing that they were paid for by Christian Noveras, the incumbent vice-governor and Noveras's brother.

On April 20, 2022, Amansec filed a criminal complaint against Noveras, Tecuico, and other persons for violation of Section 261(o) of the Omnibus Election Code and Article 217 of the Revised Penal Code, in connection with the tarpaulin printing incident.[9]

On April 26, 2022, Amansec petitioned the COMELEC to disqualify Noveras from standing as a candidate, claiming that the tarpaulin printing incident was a violation of Section 261(o) ultimately attributable to Noveras, whose campaign materials were found on the scene.[10]

Noveras argued that the petition should be dismissed outright for Amansec's failure to appear in the preliminary conference.[11] Noveras denied the allegation that his campaign materials were being printed on LGU premises using LGU resources.[12] Furthermore, violation of Section 261(o) is not among the grounds for disqualification of a candidate under Sections 12 and 68 of the Omnibus Election Code or Section 40 of the Local Government Code (LGC).[13] Finally, Noveras argued that a final judgment of conviction is necessary to disqualify a candidate whether under Section 12 of the Omnibus Election Code or Section 40 of the LGC.[14]

The May 9, 2022 national and local Elections were conducted as scheduled, with Noveras remaining on the ballot. He garnered the highest number of votes for the position of vice-governor.[15]

On March 8, 2023, the Aurora provincial prosecutor's office found probable cause to charge Noveras and five other individuals with violation of Section 261(o) of the Omnibus Election Code; but on June 16, 2023, the Department of Justice (DOJ) modified the provincial prosecutor's ruling and dismissed the charge as against Noveras.[16]

On July 10, 2023, the COMELEC First Division resolved to grant Amansec's petition.

The First Division resolved the case on the merits despite Amansec's non-appearance in the preliminary conference, invoking the public interest in the resolution of election cases and the liberal interpretation of the COMELEC rules of procedure.[17] The First Division stressed Noveras's failure ""to set forth the substance of the matters upon which he relies to support his denial of the factual allegations against him. He failed to controvert the pieces of evidence clearly establishing that tarpaulins for his campaign were being printed using provincial government resources by a casual plantilla employee under his control and supervision.""[18]

Noveras was disqualified on the basis of Section 261(d)(1) of the Omnibus Election Code, as he influenced his subordinate, Tecuico, into doing acts beneficial to his campaign. The witness statements and search reports prove that Tecuico, a casual employee of the Aurora LGU, was caught in the act of printing Noveras's campaign materials using Aurora LGU equipment, inside Aurora LGU premises. It was also proven that Noveras appointed Tecuico to the LGU. As head of the Aurora LGU and the signatory of Tecuico's appointment, Noveras wielded not only moral and legal ascendancy over Tecuico, but also command and control prerogatives over the facilities and resources implicated in the tarpaulin printing incident. Given the circumstances, the First Division concluded that Tecuico would not have used Aurora LGU resources to print campaign materials in the ATC compound if not for the moral and legal ascendancy exercised over him by Noveras. Furthermore, any such use of provincial government resources and facilities would not have been possible without the knowledge or influence of Noveras, the incumbent provincial governor.[19]

Noveras may be disqualified on the basis of Section 261(d)(1) of the Omnibus Election Code despite its apparent repeal by Section 2 of Republic Act No. 7890. The effect of Republic Act No. 7890 on the treatment of acts of coercion affecting the right of suffrage is ambiguous, as it increased the penalty for such acts, but repealed the specific provisions defining and regulating such acts in Section 261(d)(1) and (2) of the Omnibus Election Code. The COMELEC First Division resolved the ambiguity by resorting to the legislative history of the statute, which shows that: 1) the scope of the original bill which became Republic Act No. 7890 was limited to removing bloc voting by religious groups from the enumeration of acts punished in Section 261(d); and 2) there was no discussion or intention to remove the prohibition against acts of coercion and undue influence affecting the right of suffrage by public officers. The poll body in division thus concluded that Section 2 of Republic Act No. 7890 should be read not as a blanket repeal of Section 261(d) of the Omnibus Election Code, but as a mere amendment to remove any reference to acts of coercion affecting the right of suffrage committed by leaders or officials of religious organizations, which means that Section 261(d) remains an available ground to disqualify public officers like Noveras.[20]

In a separate opinion, Commissioner Ernesto Ferdinand P. Maceda, Jr. (Commissioner Maceda) echoed the reasoning of the First Division and further explained that Javier v. COMELEC,[21] which construed Section 2 of Republic Act No. 7890 as an express and blanket repeal of Section 261(d) of the Omnibus Election Code, ""did not in any way diminish [the COMELEC's] power to act in the face of situations where the coercion of voters on matters of suffrage is clearly apparent.""[22]","This is a petition for certiorari[1] against the July 10, 2023 Resolution[2] of the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) First Division and the September 6, 2023 Resolution[3] of the COMELEC En Banc in SPA No. 22-048 (DC).
On October 6, 2021, petitioner Gerardo ""Jerry"" A. Noveras (Noveras) filed a certificate of candidacy (COC) for the position of Vice-Governor of the province of Aurora in the May 9, 2022 general elections. At that time, Noveras was the incumbent governor of Aurora.","
There is no substantial evidence to prove that Noveras used a fraudulent scheme to induce voters to cast their votes in his favor.
As the ponencia discusses, the election offense of use of fraudulent scheme or device has the following elements:

1)
The existence of a fraudulent device or scheme;
 	 
2)
The use of said fraudulent device or scheme for the purpose of inducement or compulsion; and
 	 
3)
The inducement or compulsion is intended to produce, or actually produces, the following results
 	 	 

a.
Registration or refraining from registration of any voter;
 	 	 

b.
Participation in a campaign;
 	 	 

c.
Refraining or desistance from any campaign;
 	 	 

d.
Casting of any vote;
 	 	 

e.
Omission to vote; or
 	 	 

f.
Any promise to do the foregoing acts.[85]
The ponencia finds that the unlawful use of government resources by public officers constitutes fraud.[86] As such, the printing of campaign materials for the election campaign of an incumbent public official by a government employee within government premises is a fraudulent device or scheme involving the diversion of government resources to unauthorized ends.[87] The ponencia likewise finds that the campaign materials were calculated to induce the electorate of Aurora to cast their votes in favor of Noveras and his ticket. Furthermore, since Noveras was the ""ultimate beneficiary"" of the acts committed by Tecuico and he exercised moral and legal ascendancy over the latter, he may be disqualified under Section 261(e) even if the unauthorized printing was done by someone else. [88]

I agree that the unlawful and unauthorized use of government resources by public officers constitutes fraud. However, the nature by which the ponencia holds Noveras liable for the use of the fraudulent device or scheme—by virtue of being the ultimate beneficiary and by having moral and legal ascendancy—is akin to a principal by inducement or a co-conspirator.

In order to be made liable as a principal by inducement, the person must have either directly forced or directly induced another to commit the crime.[89] Directly forcing another to commit a crime may be accomplished by: (i) using irresistible force, or (ii) causing uncontrollable fear; whereas, directly inducing the commission of a crime may be: (i) by giving a price, reward, or promise, or (ii) by using words of command.[90] On the other hand, in order to be made liable as a co-conspirator, the person must have performed an overt act in pursuance of or in furtherance of the conspiracy, i.e., active participation in the actual commission of the offense itself, or extending moral assistance to his or her co-conspirators by being present at the time of the commission of the crime, or by exerting a moral ascendance over the other co-conspirators by moving them to execute or implement the criminal plan.[91]

Verily, liability as either a principal by inducement or a co-conspirator necessitates an overt act. Corollary to the rule on burden of proof in administrative cases, such overt act must be proven with substantial evidence.

Thus, similar to the previous discussion, I submit that, even if the use of fraudulent scheme or device may be committed indirectly, there must still be at least some iota of evidence linking the person to these acts to justify holding him or her responsible or accountable for the same. It must be shown through substantial evidence that he committed an overt act which shows his or her involvement or participation, whether direct or indirect, in the use of the fraudulent device or scheme. At the very least, there must be substantial evidence to prove knowledge and approval of the fraudulent scheme.

Here, as mentioned, there is absolutely no evidence that (1) Noveras was involved in or even knew of the tarpaulin printing incident, (2) Noveras directly or indirectly instructed Tecuico to print his party's campaign materials using government equipment, and (3) Noveras directly or indirectly authorized the use of the government tarpaulin printer to print the campaign materials. Knowledge or permission cannot be inferred from Noveras' position as governor, especially as there is no showing that use of these government resources would absolutely be impossible without Noveras' authorization.

Further, the orchestration of a fraudulent scheme cannot likewise be automatically imputed against Noveras on the basis of him being the ""ultimate beneficiary"" of the campaign materials. As can be gleaned from the records, the seized campaign materials endorsed the entire slate of Partido ng Demokratiko Pilipino (PDP) Laban, including candidates for city and municipal offices.[92] It was also indicated in the materials that Christian supposedly paid for the same.[93] To conclude that Noveras is the perpetrator of this scheme on account of his name and face appearing in the materials is non sequitur.

Lastly, I submit that the fraudulent scheme of using government resources for partisan activities was not ""calculated to induce the electorate of Aurora to cast their votes in favor of Noveras and his ticket""[94]—at least, not in the sense intended by the law.

In determining the ""inducement"" contemplated by Section 261(e), the Court's discussion in Aisporna v. CA[95] is instructive:

Legislative intent must be ascertained from a consideration of the statute as a whole. The particular words, clauses and phrases should not be studied as detached and isolated expressions, but the whole and every part of the statute must be considered in fixing the meaning of any of its parts and in order to produce harmonious whole. A statute must be so construed as to harmonize and give effect to all its provisions whenever possible. The meaning of the law, it must be borne in mind, is not to be extracted from any single part, portion or section or from isolated words and phrases, clauses or sentences but from a general consideration or view of the act as a whole. Every part of the statute must be interpreted with reference to the context. This means that every part of the statute must be considered together with the other parts, and kept subservient to the general intent of the whole enactment, not separately and independently. More importantly, the doctrine of associated words (Noscitur a Sociis) provides that where a particular word or phrase in a statement is ambiguous in itself or is equally susceptible of various meanings, its true meaning may be made clear and specific by considering the company in which it is found or with which it is associated.[96] (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)

Here, the ""inducement"" or ""compulsion"" punished under Section 261(e) must be read in conjunction with the other prohibited acts in the provision, i.e., threatening, intimidating, or inflicting violence, injury, punishment, damage, loss or disadvantage. From the title of the sub-section alone, ""threats, intimidation, terrorism, use of fraudulent device[,] or other forms of coercion,"" it is evident that the offense is intended to pertain to a certain degree of devious acts or machinations. Accordingly, the fraudulent scheme to induce or compel the casting of votes penalized under Section 261(e), involves a level of deceit akin to an infliction of violence upon persons. Notably, Section 261(e) has indeed been used to prosecute and disqualify candidates who commit vote-buying, terrorism, and similar schemes to induce voters and/or to rig the elections in their favor.[97]

As such, campaign materials per se cannot ""induce"" the electorate to cast their votes in favor of a certain candidate under the contemplation of Section 261(e). By its very nature, campaign materials endorse specific candidates and persuade voters to cast their votes in favor of these candidates. As such, mere printing of campaign materials using government resources can hardly be considered as calculated to induce the electorate to vote in favor of a certain candidate.

Accordingly, I submit that there is likewise no substantial evidence to find Noveras guilty of committing the second class of acts prohibited under Section 261(e). There is, thus, no basis to disqualify Noveras on this ground.

There is no evidence—direct or circumstantial—proving the guilt of Noveras.
During the case deliberations wherein I raised the opinion which I now write, it was suggested that: 1) I am espousing the view that only direct evidence can be sufficient to hold Noveras accountable, and 2) that such a view is mistaken because circumstantial evidence, as laid down in the ponencia, suffices to support a finding of guilt.

For clarity, I do not think that direct evidence is necessary in this case. I agree that circumstantial evidence—or evidence which proves another fact than the act in issue but nevertheless proves the same by inference or logic—can be enough, as long as the requisites therefore as established in jurisprudence are satisfied.

Under Section 4, Rule 133 of the Revised Rules of Court, circumstantial evidence is sufficient for conviction if the following requisites concur: (a) there is more than one circumstance; (b) the facts from which the inferences are derived are proven; and (c) the combination of all the circumstances is such as to produce a conviction beyond reasonable doubt. These circumstances must be consistent with one another, and the only rational hypothesis that can be drawn therefrom must be the guilt of the accused.[98]

While this provision appears to refer only to criminal cases, the Court has applied its principles to administrative cases. In Re: AC No. 04-AM-2002 (Josejina Fria v. Gemiliana de los Angeles),[99] the Court ruled:

For the third requisite to seal the circumstantial evidence against respondent, it is essential that the circumstantial evidence presented must constitute an unbroken chain which leads one to a fair and reasonable conclusion pointing to the person being accused, to the exclusion of others, as the guilty person.

Though administrative proceedings are not strictly bound by formal rules on evidence, the liberality of procedure in administrative actions is still subject to the limitations imposed by the fundamental requirement of due process, especially if the charge, as in the case at bar, if found to be true, also warrants her indictment criminally.[100] (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)

To be clear and as shown by a plain reading of this opinion, what I submit is not that direct evidence is indispensable, but that no evidence—either direct or circumstantial—was proven or alleged in this case which can support a fair and reasonable conclusion of Noveras's guilt. As mentioned, even assuming as true the allegations of Amansec, there can be no reasonable inference that the elements of the charges were proven.

The truth is that there is not even a reasonable connection among these allegations and the elements of the offenses. To stress an example I gave earlier, the ponencia relies on the ""circumstantial evidence"" of employer-employee relationship between Noveras and Tecuico to infer that the former employed threats and intimidation on Tecuico for the latter to help in the campaign by printing his (Noveras') tarpaulins using the machines in Tecuico's office.

With due respect, I submit that the inference that the ponencia makes (employment of threats, intimidation) from the fact established (Noveras is Tecuico's superior) nowhere near satisfies the requirements of the law. It is not an inference that is ""a fair and reasonable conclusion [that points to Noveras], to the exclusion of [all] others, as the guilty person.""[101] The fact that Noveras is Tecuico's superior, alone, cannot, by any stretch of imagination, lock in Noveras as the only possible ""mastermind"" in Tecuico's acts or even that Tecuico was instructed to commit the offense and did not act by his own volition.","ACCORDINGLY, the present petition is DISMISSED.

"G.R. No. 264125, October 22, 2024","NOEL E. ROSAL, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS AND JOSEPH SAN JUAN ARMOGILA, RESPONDENTS.","In three separate petitions for disqualification[10] dated April 11, 2022, Armogila called for the disqualification of Noel, Carmen, and Barizo for alleged violations of Section 68(a)[11] and Section 68(e)[12] in relation to Section 261(v)(2)[13] of the Omnibus Election Code (OEC). Noel, Carmen, and Barizo were then running for the positions of Governor of Albay province, Mayor, and Councilor, respectively, in the City of Legazpi, Albay. Noel's disqualification case was raffled to the COMELEC First Division and was docketed as SPA No. 22-031 (DC). Carmen's disqualification case was raffled to the COMELEC Second Division and was docketed as SPA No. 22-032 (DC). Barizo's disqualification case was also raffled to the COMELEC Second Division and was docketed as SPA No. 22-030 (DC).

The petitions for disqualification similarly alleged that Noel, Carmen, and Barizo engaged in vote-buying under Section 68(a) of the OEC and violated the prohibition under Section 261(v) of the OEC against the release, disbursement, and expenditure of public funds within 45 days before the date of the regular election.[14]

Specifically, Armogila recounted that on March 31, 2022, Barizo posted in his Facebook account an activity called ""2-Day Tricycle Driver's Cash Assistance Payout @ Fishport Legazpi.""[15] The caption of the post read:
""2-Day Tricycle Driver's Cash Assistance Payout @ Fishport Legazpi.

Thank you Governor Noel E. Rosal, Mayor Gie Rosal, VM Bobby Cristobal, the incumbent [and] aspiring Councilors.

Salamat man sa TODA sa suporta asin marhay na kooperasyon! Mabuhay kamu!

(Transportation)

#tapatsubokmay puso""[16]
The post was also allegedly accompanied by photographs of Noel, Carmen, and Barizo with numerous individuals who were presumably tricycle drivers who went to the activity to receive the cash assistance.[17]

Armogila claimed that he inquired with the members of the Tricycle Operators' and Drivers' Association (TODA) to verify the post of Barizo. The tricycle drivers allegedly told him that as early as March 25, 2022, they were directly contacted by Barizo or his representative, inviting them to the activity. The tricycle drivers were made to understand that the payout was a ""cash assistance"" in the amount of PHP 2,000.00 from one Mayor Rosal, who may either refer to Noel as the then incumbent Mayor, or Carmen, who was then a mayoralty candidate. Armogila stressed that the messages received by the tricycle drivers expressly manifested gratitude for the support given to Noel, Carmen, and Barizo.[18]

Armogila further recounted that another cash payout in the amount of PHP 2,000.00 was staged by the local government unit (LGU) in favor of the senior citizens on April 2, 2022.[19]

Armogila alleged that the messages and the Facebook post manifested the intention to influence, induce, and corrupt the electorate in casting their votes in favor of Noel, Carmen, and Barizo. The timing of the release of the cash assistance and the display of election paraphernalia excluded any other explanation for the payout. The constant mention of the names of Noel, Carmen, and Barizo, who were electoral candidates, in the text messages and in the Facebook post clearly established electioneering. Armogila stressed that Carmen was not an incumbent public official then and hence, her presence during the payout was uncalled for and unnecessary if said activity was indeed part of an official government function.[20]

Armogila further emphasized that Section 261(v)(2) of the OEC provides that ""[s]hould [a] calamity or disaster occur, all releases normally or usually coursed through the said [ministries] and offices of other [ministries] shall be turned over to, and administered [and disbursed] by, the Philippine National Red Cross, subject to the supervision of the Commission on Audit or its representatives, and no candidate or his or her spouse or member of his family within the second civil degree of affinity or consanguinity shall participate, directly or indirectly, in the distribution of any relief, or other goods to the victims of the calamity or disaster."" Hence, where the cash assistance was made in response to the pandemic, the OEC has strictly provided for the process and mechanism governing the release of the same. None was, however, followed. Instead, according to Armogila, the release of the funds was facilitated by the office of Barizo, in apparent cooperation with Noel and with the special participation of Carmen.[21]

On April 25, 2022, the COMELEC First and Second Divisions issued Summons with Notice of Preliminary Conference to Noel, Carmen, and Barizo directing them to file their Verified Answer within a non-extendible period of five days from notice. The Preliminary Conference was set on May 4, 2022.[22]

On May 2, 2022, Noel, Carmen, and Barizo each filed their Answer and asked for the resetting of the preliminary conference. All essentially argued that the payout of cash assistance to tricycle drivers and senior citizens cannot be considered as vote-buying as the same was only a continuation of the programs that were already implemented as early as August 2021 under the 2020-2022 Medium Term Public Investment Program (MTPIP) of the Local Government of Legazpi City and were duly reported before the Commission on Audit (COA).[23]

For his part, Barizo also denied having knowledge of the Facebook post. He claimed that although he has an official Facebook page, he was not personally handling the same. He also asserted that his presence during the said cash assistance payout cannot be determined based on the screenshot of the photos submitted by Armogila. The persons who rendered the cash assistance were duly authorized disbursement personnel and not him. Barizo further denied having knowledge of the text messages allegedly received by the tricycle drivers regarding the schedule of the cash payout.[24]

Meanwhile, Noel, Carmen, and Barizo all won as Governor, Mayor, and Councilor, respectively, in the May 9, 2022 NLE.[25]

On May 11, 2022, the COMELEC First Division in SPA No. 22-031 (DC) issued an Order noting Noel's Verified Answer but denying his motion to reset the hearing on the preliminary conference, as it did not find the prior professional engagements of his handling lawyers as sufficient justification to relax the rules. The COMELEC First Division also then considered the case submitted for resolution.[26]

On the other hand, the COMELEC Second Division reset the preliminary conference in the cases of Carmen and Barizo in SPA No. 22-­032 (DC) and SPA No. 22-030 (DC), respectively, to May 19, 2022.[27]

On September 19, 2022, the COMELEC First Division in SPA No. 22-031 (DC) granted the petition for disqualification against Noel.[28] It also acted on the previous motions of Noel, specifically the Partial Motion for Reconsideration of the Order dated May 11, 2022 and the Supplemental Partial Motion for Reconsideration with Motion to Admit Marking of Documentary Evidence and Attached Memorandum. Finding no cogent reason to relax the rules, the COMELEC First Division denied these motions.[29]

The COMELEC First Division found that the cash assistance payouts constituted a violation of Section 261(v)(2) of the OEC on the prohibition against the release, disbursement, and expenditure of public funds by public officials and employees for all social welfare and development projects and activities during the campaign period. The COMELEC First Division did not give credence to Noel's argument that the cash assistance was exempted from the prohibition since the activity was just a continuation of what already started in 2021. The COMELEC First Division held that the law does not state that a continuing social welfare and development project is excluded or exempted from the prohibition. The exemption applies only to ongoing public works commenced before the campaign period or similar projects under foreign agreements.[30]

The COMELEC First Division also held that the purported compliance with the reportorial requirement pursuant to COA Circular No. 2013-004 was ineffectual. Even assuming that it was not, the requirement is applicable only to exempted ongoing public work projects commenced before the campaign period.[31]

However, even as the COMELEC First Division found Noel to have violated Section 261(v)(2), it nonetheless ruled that he is not guilty of vote-buying under Section 68(a) of the OEC. It found that the evidence attached to the petition shows that the recipients of the payouts were made aware that the amount they received was due them and was not for the purpose of influencing or inducing them to vote for Noel. The text messages of gratitude for the support cannot be construed as having been intended to influence or induce the recipients to vote for Noel or Carmen because nowhere in these messages were their candidacies mentioned.[32]

Noel moved for reconsideration, but the COMELEC En Banc issued on November 18, 2022 its assailed Resolution[33] denying the same. Hence, his present Petition in G.R. No. 264125.

On January 26, 2024, Bichara, the second placer in the gubernatorial position in the Province of Albay during the May 9, 2022 NLE, filed a Motion for Leave of Court to File Petition for Intervention with Attached Petition for Intervention before the Court in G.R. No. 264125.[34] Bichara argues therein that he should be declared the rightful governor of Albay following the disqualification of Noel.[35]

Meanwhile, on October 4, 2022, the COMELEC Second Division also granted the petition for disqualification against Carmen in SPA No. 22-032 (DC).[36]

Like the First Division, the COMELEC Second Division also found nothing in the subject Facebook post which would support the charge of vote-buying against Carmen. It found that ""[w]hat the [Facebook] post shows is an organized group that appears to be listening to the speaker, nothing else.""[37]

Neither did the COMELEC Second Division find any link between the supposed text messages to the tricycle drivers and Carmen. Said messages did not mention that the sender was she, nor was her name mentioned. As with the affidavits of the tricycle drivers, the COMELEC Second Division noted that they were able to identify the sender of the text messages, who was not Carmen. Hence, what they had was only a conjecture that the cash assistance might have come from her.[38]

The COMELEC Second Division also reviewed a compact disc (CD) which purportedly showed a gathering. It observed, however, that it was unclear when such gathering happened. While a senior citizen mentioned a date and from whom the PHP 2,000.00 cash payout came, the COMELEC Second Division noted that the expression of gratitude did not equate to participation or inducement on the part of Carmen.[39]

As to the charge of violation of Section 261(v)(2) of the OEC, the COMELEC Second Division held that the provision does not admit any exemption for as long as the prohibited act transpired during the 45-day ban before a regular election. Citing Velez v. People[40] (Velez), the COMELEC Second Division held that the law does not state that ongoing social development projects are excluded from the prohibition. The exemption as regards continuing programs or projects only applies to public works and not to social services and development.[41]

The COMELEC Second Division also held that the reporting to COA likewise does not matter, since the only instance that the supervision of COA is required is during a calamity and disaster, where the public funds are turned over to the Philippine Red Cross (PRC). Drawing attention to Section 13[42] of COMELEC Resolution No. 10747,[43] the COMELEC Second Division held that what should have been done by the LGU was to file a petition before the Clerk of COMELEC for the issuance of a Certificate of Exception for the social welfare projects it intended to implement during the prohibited period.[44]

As to the argument of Carmen that she should not be held liable under Section 261 (v)(2) of the OEC since she was then a mere candidate and not a public official or employee, the COMELEC Second Division ruled that she should nonetheless be considered as a principal by indispensable cooperation, pursuant to Section 263[45] of the OEC. The COMELEC Second Division determined that it was established that Carmen appeared to have benefited from the LGU's project where public funds were definitely released, disbursed, and spent to sponsor the cash payout. The said project, the distribution of the individual cash payouts, the attribution of the project not only to the LGU but to Carmen, as well, and the fact that she eventually won were vital elements of the offense. In other words, Carmen made it appear that she was one with the LGU and with her husband, who was then the incumbent mayor. Her mere presence during the distribution of the cash assistance rendered moral assistance to the LGU.[46]

On October 10, 2022, Carmen filed a motion for reconsideration.[47]

On December 7, 2022, Alfredo A. Garbin, Jr. (Garbin) filed a Motion for Leave to File Petition for Intervention in SPA No. 22-032 (DC). Garbin argued that, as the one who obtained the second highest number of votes for the position of Mayor of Legazpi City during the May 9, 2022 NLE, he stands to be affected by the COMELEC Second Division's Resolution and thus should be allowed to intervene in the case. The COMELEC Second Division granted Garbin's motion.[48]

On February 16, 2023, Cristobal, the candidate who won as Vice Mayor of Legazpi City in the May 9, 2022 NLE, filed his Answer-in-Intervention.[49]

On May 4, 2023, the COMELEC En Banc partially granted Carmen's motion for reconsideration, but only insofar as to the ground for upholding her disqualification. The COMELEC En Banc held that Carmen cannot be held liable for violating the prohibition against release, disbursement, or expenditure of public funds during the 45-day period prior to election day because she was not a public official at the time the offense was committed. Section 261(v) of the OEC prohibits any public official or employee to release, disburse, or expend public funds for social welfare programs during the prohibited period.[50]

The COMELEC En Banc also found it erroneous to relate Section 261(v) of the OEC with Section 263 of the OEC. For one, no evidence was presented to show that the acts committed by Carmen were indispensable in the commission of the offense. Even if she was not present in the activities, the same would have still been held and the distribution of the cash assistance during the prohibited period would still have occurred. Additionally, Section 263 of the OEC is entitled ""Persons criminally liable;"" and hence, is confined to an enumeration of individuals who may incur criminal liability when an election offense is committed.[51]

Nonetheless, the COMELEC En Banc held that Carmen should still be disqualified for giving money to influence, induce, or corrupt the voters under Section 68(a) of the OEC. Unlike Section 261(v), Section 68(a) does not distinguish, and it disqualifies any candidate who is found by COMELEC of giving money to influence, induce, or corrupt the voters. The COMELEC En Banc found that to an ordinary reader, the Facebook post of Barizo necessarily evoked the message that the cash assistance payouts were given by no other than Noel, Carmen, Cristobal, and the incumbent and aspiring Councilors. There could be no other reasonable interpretation because gratitude is ordinarily and naturally accorded to the giver.[52]","These are four consolidated Petitions for Certiorari[1] (Petitions) under Rule 65 in relation to Rule 64 of the Rules of Court, filed by petitioners Noel E. Rosal (Noel), Carmen Geraldine Rosal (Carmen), Jose Alfonso V. Barizo (Barizo), and Oscar Robert H. Cristobal (Cristobal). All Petitions are with applications for the issuance of a temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction.

In G.R. No. 264125, Noel assails the Resolution[2] dated September 19, 2022 of public respondent Commission on Elections (COMELEC) First Division, which granted the petition for disqualification filed by Joseph San Juan Armogila (Armogila) against Noel and consequently disqualified him to run for the position of Governor in the Province of Albay in the May 9, 2022 National and Local Elections (NLE). Noel also assails the Resolution[3] dated November 18, 2022 of the COMELEC En Banc, which denied his motion for reconsideration.

In G.R. No. 264125, a Motion for Leave of Court to File Petition for Intervention with Attached Petition for Intervention[4] was likewise filed by Al Francis C. Bichara (Bichara), praying that the Court order his proclamation as rightful Governor of Albay, following Noel's disqualification.[5]

In G.R. No. 266796, Carmen assails the Resolution[6] dated October 4, 2022 of the COMELEC Second Division, which also granted the petition for disqualification filed against her by Armogila and thusly disqualified her, as well, to run for the position of Mayor of Legazpi City in the May 9, 2022 NLE. Carmen also assails the Resolution[7] dated May 4, 2023 of the COMELEC En Banc, which partially granted her motion for reconsideration, but ultimately maintained her disqualification on a different ground.

These same Resolutions being challenged by Carmen are likewise being questioned in G.R. No. 266775 by Cristobal, the incumbent Vice Mayor of Legazpi City, on the ground that they incorrectly declared the second placer in the May 9, 2022 NLE as the duly elected Mayor of Legazpi City.

On the other hand, in G.R. No. 269274, Barizo assails the Resolution[8] dated May 5, 2023 of the COMELEC Second Division, which also granted the petition for disqualification filed against him by Armogila and thusly disqualified him to run as Councilor in Legazpi City for the May 9, 2022 NLE. Barizo also assails the Resolution[9] dated September 27, 2023 of the COMELEC En Banc, which denied his motion for partial reconsideration.","In resolving these consolidated Petitions filed via Rule 64 in relation to Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, the Court is limited to the finding of whether or not the respondent tribunal committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in issuing the assailed Resolutions.[67] Grave abuse of discretion refers to such arbitrary, capricious, or whimsical exercise of judgment as is tantamount to lack of jurisdiction.[68] Mere abuse of discretion is not enough; the abuse of discretion must be patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law, or to act at all in contemplation of law, as where the power is exercised in an arbitrary and despotic manner by reason of passion and hostility.[69]

There is grave abuse of discretion when a constitutional organ such as the COMELEC makes manifestly gross errors in its factual inferences such that critical pieces of evidence, which have been nevertheless properly introduced by a party, or admitted, or which were the subject of stipulation, are ignored or not accounted for.[70] A glaring misinterpretation of the constitutional text or of statutory provisions, as well as a misreading or misapplication of the current state of jurisprudence, is also considered grave abuse of discretion. The arbitrariness consists in the disregard of the current state of our law.[71]

Here, the Petitions must prosper if COMELEC, in appreciating and calibrating the evidence as it arrived at the assailed Resolutions, exceeded its authority or exercised its discretion in an excessive, arbitrary, and gravely abusive manner. The grant of the Petitions based on these asserted violations effectively recognizes that, in acting as it did, COMELEC committed errors of the level that effectively affected its jurisdiction.[72]

On the other hand, the Petitions must fail, however, if COMELEC's acts, even though viewed erroneous under the terms of the asserted violations, were still well within the limits of its powers under the Constitution and relevant statutes. The Court must, in such case, recognize COMELEC's exercise of its discretion in issuing the assailed Resolutions to be proper and well within its jurisdiction.[73]

Viewed through this narrow lens, the Court partly grants the Petitions. The Court affirms the COMELEC Resolutions in SPA No. 22-031 (DC) and in SPA No. 22-030 (DC), which disqualified Noel and Barizo, respectively, for violation of Section 261(v)(2) of the OEC. Insofar as the COMELEC Resolutions in SPA No. 22-032 (DC) are concerned, the Court affirms the disqualification of Carmen, albeit on a different ground, which is for violation of Section 261 (v)(2) of the OEC.

Anent the issue of who replaces the disqualified and removed elected public officials, the Court is compelled to resolve the same on a much narrower perspective as it weighs the peculiar circumstances arising in this case, warranting a seemingly unprecedent action but one that does not, in itself, aspire to become doctrinal precedent beyond the bounds of the present sui generis action.

I.
COMELEC did not commit grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in holding that Noel and Barizo are not guilty of vote-buying under Section 68(a) of the OEC. However, COMELEC committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction when it held Carmen guilty of vote-buying under the same Section.


Section 68(a) of the OEC reads:
Sec. 68. Disqualifications. – Any candidate who, in an action or protest in which he is a party is declared by final decision of a competent court guilty of, or found by the Commission of having

a. given money or other material consideration to influence, induce or corrupt the voters or public officials performing electoral functions[.]
To be disqualified under the above-quoted provision, the following elements must be proved: (a) the candidate, personally or through his or her instructions, must have given money or other material consideration; and (b) the act of giving money or other material consideration must be for the purpose of influencing, inducing, or corrupting the voters or public officials performing electoral functions.[74] These elements are absent in this case.

The ruling in Lozano v. Yorac[75] (Lozano) is instructive. The Court in said case upheld the factual findings and conclusions reached by COMELEC in ruling on the disqualification case of Jejomar Binay on the charge of vote-buying in this wise:
Respondent COMELEC, in dismissing the petition for disqualification and in holding that respondent Binay is not guilty of vote buying, ruled as follows:

. . . .
""There is ample evidence to show that it was not respondent Binay who 'gave' the plastic bags containing Christmas gifts to the witnesses who executed affidavits for the petitioners. The 'giver' was in fact the Municipality of Makati.

. . . .

""More[,] Petitioners' documentary evidence, among which are Exhibits 'A'; 'A-1'; 'A-2'; 'A-20'; 'B'; 'B-1'; 'B-2'; 'B-25'; 'C-1; 'C-2'; 'C-27'; 'D'; 'E' and 'F', all show indubitably that the Christmas packages which were distributed between the periods of December 22-30, 1987, were ordered, purchased and paid for by the Municipality of Makati and not by respondent Binay. There is more than prima facie proofs to show that those gift packages received by the witnesses for petitioners were intended as Christmas presents to Makati's indigents in December 1988.

""It would therefore appear from the evidence submitted by the petitioners themselves that the giver, if any, of the Christmas gifts which were received by the witnesses for the petitioners was in fact, the Municipality of Makati and not respondent Jejomar C. Binay. The presence of respondent Binay, if at all true at the time the gifts were distributed by the Municipality of Makati to the recipients of the Christmas gifts, was incidental. It did not make respondent Binay as the ""giver"" of those Christmas gifts. Nor did the giving of such gifts by the Municipal Government of Makati influence the recipients to vote for respondent Binay considering that the affiants themselves who testified for the petitioners admitted and were aware that the gift packages came from the Municipality of Makati and not from respondent Jejomar C. Binay.[""]

. . . .
We uphold the foregoing factual findings, as well as the conclusions reached by respondent COMELEC, in dismissing the petition for the disqualification of respondent Binay. No clear and convincing proof exists to show that respondent Binay was indeed engaged in vote buying. The traditional gift-giving of the Municipality of Makati during the Christmas season is not refuted. That it was implemented by respondent Binay as OIC Mayor of Makati at that time does not sufficiently establish that respondent was trying to influence and induce his constituents to vote for him. This would be stretching the interpretation of the law too far. Petitioner deduces from this act of gift giving that respondent was buying the votes of the Makati residents. It requires more than a mere tenuous deduction to prove the offense of vote-buying. There has to be concrete and direct evidence or, at least, strong circumstantial evidence to support the charge that respondent was indeed engaged in vote-buying. We are convinced that the evidence presented, as swell as the facts obtaining in the case at bar, do not warrant such finding.[76] (Emphasis supplied)
The foregoing conclusion in Lozano strongly applies in this case. The allegations and evidence against Noel, Carmen, and Barizo do not concretely and directly show that they personally initiated, controlled, or supervised the conduct of the cash assistance payouts for the purpose of influencing, inducing, or corrupting the recipients to vote for them.

To begin with, the cash assistance payouts were established to be the project of the LGU, specifically by the City Social Welfare and Development Office (CSWDO). It was a cash assistance program that was already the subject of Appropriation Ordinance No. 15-0007-2022, which was approved by the Sangguniang Panlungsod on March 1, 2022. The funds were therefore already obligated, having been included in the 2020-2022 MTPIP of the LGU. The MTPIP, in turn, was adopted by the Sangguniang Panlungsod by virtue of Resolution No. 14-0182-2019. The CSWDO had scheduled and started the implementation of the program in August 2021, extending cash assistance payouts to tricycle drivers on September 17, 21, and 24, 2021, and to senior citizens on August 26 to 27, 2021, September 2 to 4, 2021, September 9 to 11, 2021, September 16 to 17, 2021, and September 23 to 24, 2021.[77] In other words, it was sufficiently established that at the time relevant to these cases, the program was an ongoing one, commenced as early as 2021, long before the start of the election and campaign periods on January 9 and February 8, 2022, respectively. Moreover, it was spearheaded by one Maria Marlene G. Manaya of the CSWDO. Given this factual backdrop, it cannot be gainsaid that the decision to go through with the cash assistance payouts did not come from Noel, Carmen, and/or Barizo in any way, shape, or form. Apart from the Facebook post and text messages that merely informed of the events, there was no other evidence presented which would prove that they gave the cash assistance payouts personally or through their own instructions.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition in G.R. No. 264125 is DISMISSED. The COMELEC Resolutions dated September 19, 2022 and November 18, 2022 in SPA No. 22-031 (DC), disqualifying Noel E. Rosal to run as Governor of the Province of Albay during the May 9, 2022 National and Local Elections are AFFIRMED. The Petition for Intervention of Al Francis C. Bichara filed in the same case is DISMISSED.

The Petition in G.R. No. 266796 is DISMISSED. The COMELEC Resolutions dated October 4, 2022 and May 4, 2023 in SPA No. 22-032 (DC) disqualifying Carmen Geraldine Rosal to run as Mayor in Legazpi City in the May 9, 2022 National and Local Elections are AFFIRMED.

The Petition in G.R. No. 266775 is DECONSOLIDATED from G.R. No. 264125, G.R. No. 266796, and G.R. No. 269274.

Cristobal in order to determine whether he is also disqualified from running for the office of Vice Mayor in the 2022 National and Local Elections under Section 261(v)(2) in relation to Section 68 of the Omnibus Election Code.

In the meantime, the Status Quo Ante Order issued by the Court on May 11, 2023 is hereby LIFTED with immediate effect. Accordingly, the assailed COMELEC Resolutions dated October 4, 2022 and May 4, 2023 in SPA No. 22-032 (DC) shall likewise immediately take effect.

The Petition in G.R. No. 269274 is likewise DISMISSED and the COMELEC Resolutions dated May 5, 2023 and September 27, 2023 in SPA No. 22-030 (DC), disqualifying Jose Alfonso V. Barizo to run as Councilor in Legazpi City are AFFIRMED, with the MODIFICATION that the next highest-ranking Member of the Sangguniang Panlungsod be proclaimed to assume the vacated position of Jose Alfonso V.

Talawec argued that Amangyen misrepresented that he is eligible to run for public office and that he has never been found liable for an offense which carries with it the accessory penalty of perpetual disqualification because Amangyen was convicted for a violation of Presidential Decree No. 705 and was sentenced to suffer reclusion temporal in Criminal Case No. 2012-7-18-67 (For: Violation of Section 77 [formerly 68], of Presidential Decree No. 705, as amended)[7] titled, People of the Philippines v. Amangyen, before Branch 35, Regional Trial Court, Bontoc, Mountain Province (RTC Bontoc). This was later affirmed by the Court in G.R. No. 236892.[8] Pursuant to Articles 41 and 30 of the Revised Penal Code, the principal penalty of reclusion temporal carries with it the accessory of perpetual absolute disqualification, which deprives a person of the right to hold public office.[9] Additionally, Talawec alleged that Amangyen is disqualified to be a candidate pursuant to Section 12 of the Omnibus Election Code (OEC) after being sentenced to imprisonment for more than 18 months.[10]

On November 29, 2021, in his verified Answer, Amangyen countered that his conviction has not yet attained finality because of a pending Motion for Intervention filed by one Johnny B. Cailin (Cailin) before the Supreme Court.[11] Cailin, as the registered owner of Paracelis Furniture Shop, which was the subject of the criminal case against Amangyen, alleged that Amangyen's conviction is void for being tainted with grave abuse of discretion and violative of Cailin's constitutional right to due process of law.[12] Cailin prays for Amangyen's acquittal and seeks to be indicted and tried for the crime for which Amangyen was convicted. Amangyen further prayed for the summary dismissal of the Petition.[13]","Before the Court is a Petition for Certiorari[1] under Rule 64, in relation to Rule 65 (Petition), filed by petitioner Avelino C. Amangyen (Amangyen) to assail the Resolutions, dated April 19, 2022[2] and October 7, 2022,[3] of the respondent Commission on Elections (COMELEC), which granted the Petition[4] filed by private respondent Franklin W. Talawec (Talawec) to deny due course or cancel Amangyen's Certificate of Candidacy (COC) for the position of Mayor of Paracelis, Mountain Province in the May 9, 2022 National and Local Elections (2022 NLE).","The Petition is dismissed.   
 
Power of the COMELEC to suspend or relax its procedural rules	 

Amangyen contends that the COMELEC should have dismissed Talawec's Petition to cancel his COC because it invoked two grounds, namely, that he committed a material representation in the contents of his COC and that he is disqualified to be a candidate pursuant to Section 12 of the OEC after being sentenced to imprisonment for more than 18 months. He argues that this is in violation of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure[38], particularly Rule 23, Section 1 of the COMELEC Rules, which reads:
Section 1. Ground for Denial or Cancellation of Certificate of Candidacy. – A verified Petition to Deny Due Course to or Cancel a Certificate of Candidacy for any elective office may be filed by any registered voter or a duly registered political party, organization, or coalition of political parties on the exclusive ground that any material representation contained therein as required by law is false.

A Petition to Deny Due Course to or Cancel Certificate of Candidacy invoking grounds other than those stated above or grounds for disqualification, or combining grounds for a separate remedy shall be summarily dismissed.
While the COMELEC Rules provide that a Petition to Deny Due Course or Cancel a Certificate of Candidacy should invoke the exclusive ground that any material misrepresentation contained in a COC is false, the Court also agrees with the COMELEC that this procedural rule may be relaxed. Rule 1, Section 4 of the COMELEC Rules explicitly provides:
Section 4. Suspension of the Rules. –  In the interest of justice and in order to obtain speedy disposition of all matters pending before the Commission, these rules or any portion thereof may be suspended by the Commission.
The application of this rule is settled. In Hayudini v. COMELEC,[39] the Court reiterated the reason for the liberal interpretation of the COMELEC Rules, highlighting the need to ascertain the real choice of the electorate. It explained:
Settled is the rule that the COMELEC Rules of Procedure are subject to liberal construction. The COMELEC has the power to liberally interpret or even suspend its rules of procedure in the interest of justice, including obtaining a speedy disposition of all matters pending before it. This liberality is for the purpose of promoting the effective and efficient implementation of its objectives[—]ensuring the holding of free, orderly, honest, peaceful, and credible elections, as well as achieving just, expeditious, and inexpensive determination and disposition of every action and proceeding brought before the COMELEC. Unlike an ordinary civil action, an election contest is imbued with public interest. It involves not only the adjudication of private and pecuniary interests of rival candidates, but also the paramount need of dispelling the uncertainty which beclouds the real choice of the electorate. And the tribunal has the corresponding duty to ascertain, by all means within its command, whom the people truly chose as their rightful leader.[40] (Emphasis supplied)
In Caballero v. COMELEC,[41] the Court citing Hayudini excused the failure to personally serve a copy of the Petition to Deny Due Course or Cancel a Certificate of Candidacy to the respondent prior to its filing considering the physical impossibility of following the said requirement and the respondent received a copy of the said petition during a scheduled conference, which afforded him the opportunity to rebut the allegations through a memorandum.[42] The Court further explained that the relaxation of the rules was because the petition questioned the respondent's residency requirement, which pertains to his qualification and eligibility to run for public office and imbued with public interest.[43]

In the present case, Talawec sought to cancel Amangyen's COC because the latter misrepresented that he has not been found liable for an offense which carries with it the accessory penalty of absolute perpetual disqualification. This pertains to Amangyen's qualification and eligibility to run for public office and is thus imbued with public interest. Thus, the COMELEC was justified in not summarily dismissing the Petition even if it was not filed on the exclusive ground that a material representation in Amangyen's COC is false. The electorate of the Municipality of Paracelis has the right to vote for a candidate who is eligible to run for public office. To this end, the COMELEC has the discretion to brush aside any technicality that will prevent it from cancelling the certificate of candidacy of someone who is disqualified by law.   
 
Final and executory nature of the conviction for violation of Presidential Decree No. 705; Effect of the pending Petition for Modification of Penalty
 

Amangyen next argues that his conviction for qualified theft under Presidential Decree No. 705 has not yet attained finality because of the pendency of his Petition for Correction/Determination of Proper Imposable Penalty, which seeks to lower the penalty imposed against him following the passage of Republic Act No. 10951.[44]

This contention must be clarified. While Republic Act No. 10951 may apply to lower the penalty for Amangyen's conviction for qualified theft, this will not automatically suspend the service of his sentence for reclusion temporal and its accessory penalty of absolute perpetual disqualification until a decision to that effect by a competent court is rendered with finality.

As correctly pointed out by the COMELEC, the judgment of guilt against Amangyen for qualified theft under Presidential Decree No. 705 is already final and executory following the Entry of Judgment by the Court on July 23, 2018. Meanwhile, on September 16, 2017, Republic Act No. 10951 took effect and adjusted the value of property and damages on which the imposable penalties in the Revised Penal Code are based. The application of the law to cases with a final and executory judgment was clarified by the Court in Hernan v. Sandiganbayan,[45] where it held:
The general rule is that a judgment that has acquired finality becomes immutable and unalterable, and may no longer be modified in any respect even if the modification is meant to correct erroneous conclusions of fact or law and whether it will be made by the court that rendered it or by the highest court of the land. When, however, circumstances transpire after the finality of the decision rendering its execution unjust and inequitable, the Court may sit en banc and give due regard to such exceptional circumstance warranting the relaxation of the doctrine of immutability[.][46]
Thus, while the judgment in Amangyen's criminal case for qualified theft under Presidential Deere No. 705 had become immutable and unalterable, the same may be reopened insofar as modifying the penalty imposed due to the enactment of Republic Act No. 10951 after the finality of the said judgment. At any rate, pending resolution of Amangyen's Petition to determine the proper penalty for his conviction for qualified theft, he must continue to serve the sentence for reclusion temporal with the accessory penalty of absolute perpetual disqualification. Necessarily, the present petition to set aside the COMELEC ruling which disqualified him from running for the mayoralty position in the Municipality of Paracelis in the 2022 NLE must fail.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DISMISSED. The Resolutions, dated April 19, 2022 and October 7, 2022, of the Commission on Elections are AFFIRMED.

Petitioner Avelino C. Amangyen is found GUILTY of contempt of court for his failure to comply with the directive of the Court in its Resolution, dated February 21, 2023, and he is ORDERED to pay an additional fine in the amount of One Thousand Pesos PHP 1,000.00."
"G.R. No. 251518, November 27, 2024","DEL MONTE LAND TRANSPORT BUS COMPANY, DON L. MORALES, AND EILEEN FLORES, PETITIONERS, VS. ROMEO M. JARANILLA, MARLON H. GUANTERO, AND JESUS B. DOMANAIS, RESPONDENTS.","This case stemmed from consolidated complaints for illegal dismissal, full backwages, and reinstatement filed by respondents against petitioners. On November 25, 2013, LA Benedict G. Kato (LA Kato) issued a Decision granting the complaints and ruled that respondents were all illegally dismissed from their employment.[5]

DLTB, thereafter, interposed an appeal with the NLRC. On April 23, 2014, the NLRC issued a Decision[6] granting DLTB's appeal. The NLRC dismissed the consolidated complaints. In effect, the LA's Order dated November 25, 2013, was reversed and set aside.

Aggrieved, respondents moved for reconsideration. In its Resolution[7] dated October 31, 2014, the NLRC granted respondents' motion and reinstated the Decision of the LA.

Petitioners, thereafter, filed a Petition for Certiorari with the CA (CA-G.R. SP No. 138339) assailing the October 31, 2014 Resolution of the NLRC.[8] Pending resolution of CA-G.R. SP No. 138339, respondents moved for and secured a Writ of Execution[9] of the LA's November 25, 2013 Order. Pursuant to the said Writ, petitioners issued a check in the amount of PHP 1,189,364.42 as partial payment for the judgment award. Meanwhile, the balance of the judgment award shall be secured from the cash bond posted by petitioners in the amount of PHP 247,080.29.[10]

On March 27, 2015, LA Kato issued an Order[11] releasing to respondents the amounts that were due to them in satisfaction of the judgment award. Based on the Disbursement Vouchers, Jaranilla received the amount of PHP 397,541.02,[12] Guantero received the amount of PHP 387,895.25,[13]and Domanais, received the amount of PHP 403,928.14, all of which are exclusive of tax.[14]

Subsequently, on June 30, 2015, the CA, in CA-G.R. SP No. 138339 granted petitioners' Petition for Certiorari and annulled the October 31, 2014 Resolution of the NLRC.[15] The CA ratiocinated that respondents were legally dismissed from employment and that petitioners complied with the two-notice rule.[16] Essentially, the CA reinstated the April 23, 2014 NLRC Decision resulting in the dismissal of the complaints for supposed unlawful termination from employment by petitioners. On November 24, 2015, the Decision of the CA in CA-G.R. SP No. 138339 became final and executory.[17]

Thereafter, respondents filed before the LA a Motion for Issuance of Alias Writ of Execution.[18] Therein, respondents averred that the amount released to them corresponds to their accrued backwages or reinstatement wages computed only up to November 2014. They further claimed that considering that the NLRC, on motion for reconsideration, reinstated the LA's ruling, they are entitled to reinstatement wages from December 2014 up to the finality of the Decision of the CA reversing the LA's ruling. Accordingly, respondents asked for the issuance of an Alias Writ of Execution for the full satisfaction of their accrued backwages or reinstatement wages.[19]","For the Court's consideration is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court filed by Del Monte Land Transport Bus Company (DLTB), Don L. Morales, and Eileen Flores (collectively, petitioners) assailing the Court of Appeals (CA) Decision[2] promulgated on March 14, 2019, in CA-G.R. SP No. 151070, which affirmed the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC), Quezon City Resolution[3] dated January 30, 2017 in NLRC LAC No. 01-000227-14 (AE-10-16)(4), NLRC NCR CN 08-12004-13, NLRC NCR CN 08-12009-13, and NLRC NCR CN 08-12160-13. In its Resolution, the NLRC dismissed petitioners' appeal and affirmed the Labor Arbiter's (LA's) Order[4] dated August 30, 2016 in NLRC NCR Case No. 08-12004-13, issuing an Alias Writ of Execution in favor of Romeo M. Jaranilla (Jaranilla), Marlon H. Guantero (Guantero), and Jesus B. Domanais (Domanais), (collectively, respondents).","The instant petition is bereft of any merit.

In the instant petition, petitioners averred that the LA erred in granting the Motion for Issuance of Alias Writ of Execution considering that at the time of the filing thereof, respondents are no longer entitled to their accrued wages on account of the finality of the CA Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 138339, which declared respondents as legally dismissed.[32]

Petitioners likewise averred that they are entitled to restitution. They explained that while they admit that the LA's November 25, 2013 Decision is immediately executory, hence, respondents have the right to reinstatement, either actual or in payroll, such right ceased to have any legal effect when the NLRC reversed the LA Decision on April 23, 2014 They also insisted that the reinstatement by the NLRC of the LA Decision on reconsideration is no longer immediately executory. Accordingly, respondents are not entitled to reinstatement from October 31, 2014, when the NLRC reinstated the November 25, 2013 Decision of the LA until the same was reversed by the CA on June 30, 2015.[33]

The Court is not persuaded.","ACCORDINGLY, in view of the foregoing premises, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED. The Court of Appeals Decision dated March 14, 2019, in CA-G.R. SP No. 151070 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. The Labor Arbiter's Order dated August 30, 2016 is MODIFIED in that respondents Romeo M. Jaranilla, Marlon H. Guantero, and Jesus B. Domanais are entitled to reinstatement wages from November 25, 2013 to June 30, 2015. Let an Alias Writ of Execution be ISSUED to such effect.

The Labor Arbiter is further DIRECTED to make a re-computation of the amount of respondents' reinstatement wages for the said period and determine whether the amounts already released to respondents exceed or are less than the amounts that respondents are entitled to. Thereafter, the Labor Arbiter is DIRECTED to collect from petitioners the amount necessary for the full satisfaction of their reinstatement wages or return to petitioners any excess thereof."

OLASO III, LEA LIM-TIDMA, NERISSA S. OREJO, ZENAIDA CHIQUILLO, IVY OROLFO, RONNIE GOMEZ, AND GINA NUARIN, RESPONDENTS.","Spouses Kaw are the owners of a parcel of land located in Cagmanaba, Oas, Albay, with an area of 3,040 square meters and designated as Lot F in Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-158628. Lot F is covered by Tax Declaration No. 02-12-012-00000 with an assessed value of PHP 24,830.00.[5]

Spouses Kaw and Ivy Orolfo (Orolfo) were dentists and colleagues.[6] Orolfo introduced Spouses Kaw to the other respondents, who were interested in buying a portion of Lot F. Thus, sometime in February 2014, Spouses Kaw, together with Orolfo, Marilyn Nodalo (Nodalo), Manuel S. Olaso III (Olaso III). Lea Lim-Tidma (Lim-Tidma), Nerissa S. Orejo (Orejo), Zenaida Chiquillo (Chiquillo), Ronnie Gomez (Gomez), and Gina Nuarin (Nuarin) (collectively, respondents), visited Lot F. Spouses Kaw informed respondents that they were only selling the 2,000 square meter undetermined portion of Lot F (subject property) for PHP 1,200,000.00. Josephine then showed respondents a copy of a sketch plan prepared by a geodetic engineer for the right of way. Respondents then offered to purchase the subject property in two equal portions of 1,000 square meters at the purchase price of PHP 600,000.00 each, to be paid in two parts, with PHP 300,000.00 advance payment for each part. The balance shall be payable in six months.[7]

On March 10,2014, the first Deed of Conditional Sale was executed between Spouses Kaw and Nodalo, Olaso III, Lim-Tidma, and Orejo, covering the 1,000 square meters unsegregated and undesignated portion of the subject property. The parties agreed to bind themselves reciprocally to sell and buy said portion in consideration of PHP 600,000.00.[8]

On March 29, 2014, a second Deed of Conditional Sale, with provisions similar to the first deed, was executed between Spouses Kaw and Chiquillo, Orolfo, Gomez, and Nuarin. However, Spouses Kaw received only the amount of PHP 265,000.000, while the remainder of PHP 35,000.00 was paid to Orolfo. Orolfo stated that she acted as an agent in the sale transactions with Spouses Kaw; hence, it was her internal arrangement with Spouses Kaw that the PHP 35,000.00 would serve as her commission.[9]

The First and Second Deeds of Conditional Sale (collectively, Deeds of Conditional Sale) contained uniform provisions, as follows:
a)
Upon the execution of this instrument[,] the Vendees have shall [sic] jointly and severally pay (and in fact, have paid and delivered to) the Vendor the cash sum of THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PESOS ([PHP] 300,000.00), Philippine Currency, as and for INITIAL/DOWN PAYMENT, the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged by the Vendor to their entire satisfaction; Provided that, upon full payment of this initial/ down payment of [PHP] 300,000.00, the vendee shall have the right to enter into/ take beneficial possession and enjoyment or introduce improvements on the above described property even as the same is herein conditionally sold; provide moreover that, in the event of unilateral rescission by the Vendors of the herein sale agreement/transaction, for reasons or causes attributable to the Vendees (such as, but not limited to default in payment of the net balance or subsequent installment payments or violations of the terms of this agreement, among other grounds), the said down payment or any other subsequent advance/ installment payments shall be treated as and for EARNEST MONEY, which the Vendors at their option, may forfeited [sic] in their favor without further recourse or right of reimbursement by the Vendees; and provided finally that, in such event of rescission of the sale transaction/agreement any and all improvements introduced by the Vendees on the premises subject matter herein, agreed to be sold, may be appropriated by and at the option of the Vendors likewise without further recourse expectancy or payment of its value in favor of the Vendees.


b)
The remaining balance of THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PESOS ([PHP] 300,000.00), Philippine Currency, is hereby mutually agreed to be due and payable jointly and severally by the Vendees to the Vendors (their heirs, assigns), ON INSTALLMENT OR IN LUMP SUM within SIX (6) MONTHS from and after the date of the execution of this instrument; provided that, in the event of failure by the Vendee to SEASONABLY AND SATISFACTORILY pay such NET BALANCE ([PHP] 300,000.00), the Vendees shall immediately vacate and peacefully restore the herein sold premises to the Vendors;


c)
Upon full and satisfactory payment by the Vendees to the Vendors of the said net balance of PHP 300,000.00 (or the agreed total consideration of PHP 600,000.00), the Vendors shall forthwith execute and deliver in favor of the Vendees the (Final) Deed of Absolute Sale of the property above described and herein sold, together with its muniments of title;


d)
For all the time that this agreement is in full force and effect, the Vendors, shall not sell, lease or encumber or in any manner dispose of the above described property or any portion thereof, without the prior written consent of the Vendees, nor reciprocally, shall the Vendees assign, transfer, convey or in any manner hypothecate their rights under this agreement to third parties without the prior written consent of the Vendors; any such transaction entered into by either parties herein without the prior written consent of the other as herein provided, shall be null and void as to the offended party, as the case may be;


. . . .


f)
In the meantime, upon execution of this instrument and pending full and satisfactory payment by the Vendees of the said agreed total consideration of the sale, or its outstanding balance (WITH ZERO INTEREST), the Vendees (their heirs or assigns) shall remain in the exclusive beneficial possession and enjoyment of the above described parcel of land, subject of this agreement;[10]
Sometime in the second week of April 2014, Spouses Kaw visited the subject property and were surprised when they saw the following: (1) cottages surrounded by fence; (2) comfort room and an irrigation pump made of concrete materials: (3) eight cottage-like houses and several small cottages and concrete barriers near the seashore; (4) ""DIWATA IMACOTO BEACH RESORT"" signboard; and (5) a destroyed padlock in Spouses Kaw's own cottage. When Spouses Kaw confronted Orolfo, the latter explained that the fence was constructed for their protection, while the cottages were built for their convenience and were not being rented out to other people. However, Spouses Kaw learned from the neighbors that respondents were indeed renting out the cottages for a fee of PHP 500.00 to PHP 1,000.00.[11]

Thus, on September 29, 2015, Spouses Kaw filed with the RTC their Complaint for Rescission of Contract with Prayer for Preliminary Injunction against respondents. The Complaint was docketed by the RTC as Civil Case No. 2833 (Rescission Case).[12]

Spouses Kaw cited paragraph A of the Deeds of Conditional Sale, which states that the contracts may be unilaterally rescinded by the vendors Spouses Kaw in the event that respondents violated any of the terms of the agreements. Supposedly, by converting the subject property into a beach resort and renting out cottages to third persons without the prior written consent of Spouses Kaw, respondents violated paragraph D of the Deeds of Conditional Sale, which states that respondents, as vendees, cannot ""assign, transfer, convey or in any manner hypothecate their rights under [the] agreement to third parties without the prior written consent of the Vendors [Spouses Kaw].""[13]

Spouses Kaw further asserted that respondents violated paragraph A of the Deeds of Conditional Sale by causing, the construction of permanent improvements on the subject property. Purportedly, there were verbal agreements concomitant to the execution of the Deeds of Conditional Sale, wherein respondents agreed that they will only introduce temporary improvements made of light materials in the subject property. Further, after the Deeds of Conditional Sale were executed by the parties, Josephine reminded Orolfo that respondents could only build cottages made of light materials considering that they had not fully paid the contract price and there was no subdivision survey yet. She also told Orolfo not to fence the property pending the resolution of the issue on the right of way with the adjoining owners.[14]

In their Answer, respondents denied that they violated any of the provisions of the Deeds of Conditional Sale. By way of counterclaim, respondents prayed that the RTC order the Spouses Kaw: to accept payment of the balance of the purchase price (balance price) under the Deeds of Conditional Sale; to execute the deeds of absolute sale over the subject property; to surrender all documents necessary for the transfer of title to respondents; and to pay respondents moral damages and costs of suit.[15]

Respondents argued that the operation of a beach resort over the subject property cannot be construed as an assignment, transfer, conveyance, or hypothecation of their rights over the subject property under paragraph D of the Deeds of Conditional Sale. They further maintained that paragraph A of the Deeds did not impose any limitation on the kind of improvements that they may introduce in the subject property.[16]

Respondents also denied any verbal agreement with Spouses Kaw that prohibited them from using the subject property as a beach resort and from constructing permanent improvements thereon. Supposedly, Spouses Kaw were aware that the property was purchased for the purpose of engaging in a beach resort business.[17] During the negotiations for the sale, Spouses Kaw even encouraged respondents to develop the property into a beach resort and suggested the amount of rental fees that they could charge against visitors.[18] Further, Spouses Kaw knew that permanent improvements were being introduced on the subject property as Noel attended the birthday party of Orolfo's daughter while constructions were on-going. Respondents further asserted that they could already fence the portions sold to them because the boundaries have already been identified in the subdivision plan presented by the Spouses Kaw, who even helped them in locating the landmarks or mohon.[19]

Respondents argued that Spouses Kaw merely changed their mind as regards the Deeds of Conditional Sale after Josephine and Nodalo had a heated verbal spat about the improvements on the subject property. Josephine felt disrespected by Nodalo and wanted her to be excluded as a buyer.[20] Purportedly, on several occasions, respondents brought cash as payment for the balance price under the Deeds of Conditional Sale when they went to the Spouses Kaw, but the latter refused to accept their payment.[21] They also made a surprise visit at Josephine's dental clinic to pay the balance price, but Josephine angrily told them that she does not want their money.[22]

Respondents also insisted that the Complaint was filed by Spouses Kaw on September 29, 2015, only as a countersuit to the Consignation Cases previously instituted by some of the respondents against the Spouses Kaw.[23] It turned out that on September 5 and 19, 2014, Nodalo and Chiquillo separately filed with the Municipal Circuit Trial Court (MCTC), Polangui-Libon-Oas, Albay, two Complaints[24] for Consignation against the Spouses Kaw. The MCTC docketed the consignation complaints of Nodalo and Chiquillo as Civil Case No. 1712-P and Civil Case No. 1714-P (collectively, Consignation Cases), respectively. Nodalo and Chiquillo alleged that Spouses Kaw unjustifiably refused to accept payment of the balance price under the Deeds of Conditional Sale. Both respondents averred that they tendered payment of the balance price to Spouses Kaw under the Deeds of Conditional Sale, but the Spouses unjustifiably refused to accept their payment.[25]","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] (Petition) filed by spouses Noel John M. Kaw (Noel) and Josephine Caseres-Kaw (Josephine) (collectively, Spouses Kaw) assailing the Decision[2] dated July 14, 2021, and Resolution[3] dated August 8, 2022, of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 113795 that affirmed with modification as to the award of moral damages, the Decision[4] dated June 3, 2019 of Branch 12, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Ligao City, Albay in Civil Case No. 2833. The RTC dismissed the Complaint for Rescission of Contract with Prayer for Preliminary Injunction filed by Spouses Kaw for lack of merit.","The Petition is denied for lack of merit. The CA correctly ruled that Spouses Kaw failed to establish valid grounds for the rescission of the Deeds of Conditional Sale. However, the Court agrees with Spouses Kaw that Chiquillo and Nodalo committed forum shopping.   
 
The Deeds of Conditional Sale are contracts to sell
 

Preliminarily, the Court notes that the written agreements over the subject property were denominated by the parties as a ""Deed of Conditional Sale."" However, after a careful reading of the terms and conditions of the two agreements in issue, the Court finds that the real intention of the parties is to enter into contracts to sell, not conditional sale. In Nabus v. Sps. Pacson,[50] the Court explained the difference between a contract to sell and a conditional sale in this wise:
A contract to sell as defined hereinabove, may not even be considered as a conditional contract of sale where the seller may likewise reserve title to the property subject of the sale until the fulfillment of a suspensive condition, because in a conditional contract of sale, the first element of consent is present, although it is conditioned upon the happening of a contingent event which may or may not occur. If the suspensive condition is not fulfilled, the perfection of the contract of sale is completely abated. However, if the suspensive condition is fulfilled, the contract of sale is thereby perfected, such that if there had already been previous delivery of the property subject of the sale to the buyer, ownership thereto automatically transfers to the buyer by operation of law without any further act having to be performed by the seller.

In a contract to sell, upon the fulfillment of the suspensive condition which is the full payment of the purchase price, ownership will not automatically transfer to the buyer although the property may have been previously delivered to him. The prospective seller still has to convey title to the prospective buyer by entering into a contract of absolute sale.[51] (Emphasis supplied)
In a contract to sell, the prospective seller reserves title to the subject property despite previous delivery thereof to the prospective buyer. Thus, in a case,[52] the Court held that an agreement denominated as a ""Deed of Conditional Sale"" was, in truth, a contract to sell because the vendor promised to execute a deed of absolute sale only upon the vendee's completion of the payment of the full purchase price. The Court has also held that a contract pertains to an absolute sale if there is no stipulation granting the vendor the right to unilaterally cancel the contract the moment that the vendee fails to pay within a fixed period.[53] Conversely, an agreement is considered a contract to sell if there is a stipulation therein giving the vendor the right to unilaterally rescind the contract the moment that the vendee fails to pay within a fixed period.[54]

In the case at hand, the Deeds of Conditional Sale contain several stipulations on rescission and execution of the deed of absolute sale, to wit: 
a)
. . . provide moreover that, in the event of unilateral rescission by the Vendors of the herein sale agreement/transaction, for reasons or causes attributable to the Vendees (such as, but not limited to default in payment of the net balance or subsequent installment payments or violations of the terms of this agreement, among other grounds), the said down payment or any other subsequent advance/ instalment payments shall be treated as and for EARNEST MONEY, which the Vendors at their option, may forfeited in their favor without further recourse or right of reimbursement by the Vendees; and provided finally that, in such event of rescission of the sale transaction/agreement any and all improvements introduced by the Vendees on the premises subject matter herein, agreed to be sold, may be appropriated by and at the option of the Vendors likewise without further recourse expectancy or payment of its value in favor of the Vendees.


. . . .


c)
Upon full and satisfactory payment by the Vendees to the Vendors of the said net balance of PHP 300,000.00 (or the agreed total consideration of PHP 600,000.00), the Vendors shall forthwith execute and deliver in favor of the Vendees the (Final) Deed of Absolute Sale of the property above described and herein sold, together with its muniments of title[.][55] (Emphasis supplied)
The foregoing supports the conclusion that the Deeds of Conditional Sale are contracts to sell. First, paragraph A of the Deeds grants Spouses Kaw the right to unilaterally rescind the agreements in the event that respondents fail to pay the full purchase price within the period fixed in the contracts. Second, paragraph C of the Deeds expressly state that Spouses Kaw shall execute the Deeds of Absolute Sale only upon full and satisfactory payment of the total consideration for the subject property, even though it had already been delivered to respondents after the initial down payment and pending completion of the full purchase price.   
 
The remedy of rescission was available to Spouses Kaw
 

Given that the Deeds of Conditional Sale are contracts to sell, an issue arises on the availability of the remedy of rescission to Spouses Kaw.

The power to rescind obligations in the event of breach is provided in Article 1191 of the Civil Code, to wit:
ARTICLE 1191. The power to rescind obligations is implied in reciprocal ones, in case one of the obligors should not comply with what is incumbent upon him.

The injured party may choose between the fulfillment and the rescission of the obligation, with the payment of damages in either case. He may also seek rescission, even after he has chosen fulfillment, if the latter should become impossible.

The court shall decree the rescission claimed, unless there be just cause authorizing the fixing of a period.

This is understood to be without prejudice to the rights of third persons who have acquired the thing, in accordance with article 1385 and 1388 and the Mortgage Law.
The remedy of rescission under Article 1191 of the Civil Code in case of breach applies only to reciprocal obligations.[56] The availability of the remedy of a rescission in a contract to sell has been distinguished by the Court in Solid Homes, Inc. v. Sps. Jurado,[57] to wit:
The foregoing characters of a contract to sell are important in order to determine the laws and remedies applicable in case a party does not fulfill his or her obligations under the contract. In Olivarez Realty Corporation v. Castillo, we held that the prospective buyer's failure to fully pay the purchase price in a contract to sell is not a breach of contract under Article 1191 on the right to rescind reciprocal obligations. Citing Nabus, Olivarez held that ""[t]his is because there can be no rescission of an obligation that is still non-existent, the suspensive condition not having happened."" Thus, in case the prospective buyer does not comply, the contract to sell is cancelled and the parties shall stand as if the obligation to sell never existed. When a contract to sell is cancelled, the installments paid for the property are generally ordered reimbursed, especially if possession over the property has not been delivered to the prospective buyer.

The pronouncement in Olivarez should, however, be reconciled with our ruling in Gotesco Properties. Inc. v. Spouses Fajardo, wherein we upheld the buyer's right to rescind the contract to sell for failure of the seller to cause the transfer of the corresponding certificate of title upon full payment of the purchase price. Thus, a contract to sell is susceptible to rescission for substantial and fundamental breaches, as when the seller fails to comply with his obligation to sell the property despite the happening of the suspensive condition, because the power to rescind obligations is implied in reciprocal ones, in case one of the obligors should not comply with what is incumbent upon him. However, instead of rescission of the obligation, the injured party may choose that the contract be actually accomplished by the party bound to fulfill it. Specific performance refers to the remedy of requiring exact performance of a contract it) the specific form in which it was made, or according to the precise terms agreed upon.[58] (Emphasis supplied; citations omitted)
Following Solid Homes, the availability of rescission as a remedy in favor of Spouses Kaw will depend on whether the action is based on respondents' failure to pay the full purchase price within the period fixed by the parties, or whether it is based, on a substantial or fundamental breach of the contracts on grounds other than non-payment of the full purchase price. In the first case, the remedy of rescission is not available because the non-fulfillment of the suspensive condition for failure to pay the full purchase price simply prevents the obligation to sell the subject property from arising, and there can be no rescission of an obligation that is non-existent.[59] In the second case, the remedy of rescission is available because it would involve a substantial breach of a reciprocal obligation, which then authorizes the injured party to demand either rescission or specific performance of the obligation under Article 1191 of the Civil Code.[60]

Upon review of the records, the Court finds that the remedy of rescission was available to Spouses Kaw pursuant to Article 1191 of the Civil Code in relation to paragraph A of the Deeds of Conditional Sale.

As seen above, paragraph A of the Deeds of Conditional Sale expressly authorizes Spouses Kaw, as vendors, to unilaterally rescind the contracts in the event that respondents, as vendees: (1) defaulted in the payment of the balance price or subsequent installment payments therefor; or (2) violated the terms of the said agreements. Although the contracts provide for unilateral rescission in favor of Spouses Kaw, it is settled that judicial validation of such unilateral rescission is necessary, for it is only the final judgment of a court that will conclusively settle whether the action taken was correct in law.[61]

Here, Spouses Kaw instituted the Complaint for Rescission because respondents supposedly violated the terms of the Deeds of Conditional Sale when the latter leased the subject property as part of their beach resort business and introduced permanent improvements thereon. Simply, Spouses Kaw's action was based on a fundamental or substantial breach of obligations other than payment of the purchase price under the Deeds of Conditional Sale. Hence, the remedy of rescission under Article 1191 of the Civil Code was available to Spouses Kaw.   
 
Spouses Kaw failed to prove that respondents violated the terms of the Deeds of Conditional Sale or committed a substantial breach thereof
 

Having resolved the question of whether rescission was available as a remedy to Spouses Kaw, the Court proceeds to rule on the issue of whether the CA erred in finding that respondents did not commit a substantial breach of the agreements as to warrant their rescission.

As a rule, rescission is not permitted for a slight or casual breach of the contract, but only for such breaches that are substantial and fundamental as to defeat the object of the parties in making the agreement.[62] Hence, as correctly pointed out by the RTC and CA, rescission will not be granted in the following: (1) where the breach is only slight or casual; (2) where there has been substantial compliance; and (3) where the court finds valid reason for giving a period of fulfillment of the obligation.[63]

In the case at hand, Spouses Kaw argue that respondents committed a fundamental or substantial breach of the Deeds of Conditional Sale when they (1) introduced permanent improvements on the subject property, contrary to paragraph A of the Deeds regarding improvements and (2) leased cottages located on the subject property to third persons, in violation of paragraph D of the Deeds. The Court disagrees with Spouses Kaw and affirms the CA's finding that respondents did not commit a fundamental or substantial breach of their obligations under the Deeds of Conditional Sale. 
 
A.
Respondents did not violate paragraph A of the Deeds of Conditional Sale when they introduced permanent improvements on the subject property  
   
 
As to the alleged violation of paragraph A of the Deeds of Conditional Sale, Spouses Kaw maintain that there are concomitant verbal agreements concerning the kind of improvements that respondents are allowed to construct on the subject property. Supposedly, these concomitant verbal agreements must be referred to in defining the term ""improvements"" in paragraph A of the Deeds of Conditional Sale. Spouses Kaw assert that the terms of the agreements must be interpreted based on the ""intention of the contracting parties"" which may be determined by looking at all the words used in the contracts in their proper context.[64]

The Court is not persuaded.","WHEREFORE, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED. The Decision dated July 14,2021, and Resolution dated August 8, 2022, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 113795 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION in that:

"G.R. No. 219686, November 27, 2024","GIL APOLINARIO, PETITIONER, VS. HEIRS OF FRANCISCO DE LOS SANTOS, REPRESENTED BY EDWIN DELOS SANTOS, RESPONDENTS.","On July 4, 1998 at around 7:30 a.m., Rico Villahermosa (Rico), the 16-year old son of Teresita Villahermosa (Teresita), was cutting down a banana plant on the side of Maharlika Highway upon the instruction and under the supervision of Apolinario, his school principal. The banana plant fell and hit Francisco De Los Santos (Francisco) who was driving his motorcycle along Maharlika Highway at the time.[5]

As a result, Francisco fell from his motorcycle and unto the cemented highway. He suffered from head injuries and passed away on July 8, 1998, with his death certificate indicating ""post-traumatic brain swelling"" and ""diffuse cerebral contusion"" as his cause of death.[6]

Aggrieved, the Heirs of Francisco filed a complaint for damages against Apolinario and Teresita. They averred that Apolinario was negligent when he instructed Rico to cut down the banana plant situated at the side of the highway without taking the necessary precautions to ensure the safety of passing motorists and pedestrians, and that Rico's and Apolinario's gross negligence was the proximate cause of the injuries and death of Francisco.[7]

The Heirs further averred that due to Francisco's accident and death, they incurred PHP 50,000.00 in hospital and medical expenses and PHP 47,000.00 as funeral expenses, and prayed for the payment of PHP 428,800 as compensation for the loss of expected income of the deceased as member of the Sangguniang Bayan of Sta. Margarita, Samar; PHP 50,000 for moral damages, PHP 20,000 for exemplary damages; PHP 20,000.00 for attorney's fees, and PHP 10,000.00 for the litigation expenses.[8] Anent Francisco's income, respondents alleged that he was earning monthly emoluments of PHP 12,620.00 and expected to receive the same continuously until end the of his term on June 1, 2001.[9]

Elias Udjay (Elias) testified that his son Arnel also attended Barangay Palale Elementary School, and that he was only two arms' length away from Apolinario and Rico at the time of the incident.[10] A teacher called for pintakasi, an event supervised by Apolinario as the head of the teachers.[11] Elias was cutting grass along the school vicinity when he witnessed Apolinario instructing Rico to cut a banana plant just outside the fence of the school and across the highway opposite the school. While Rico was cutting down the plant, it hit Francisco.[12]

Edwin de los Santos (Edwin), the son of the deceased Francisco, testified that at the time of his father's death, Francisco was a member of the Sangguniang Bayan of Sta. Margarita.[13] He also brought with him his father's death certificate.[14]

Rico, who was not impleaded as a defendant but appeared in court as a witness, testified that he was 15 years old at the time of the incident.[15] The day prior to pintakasi, Apolinario conducted a meeting for the activity which his mother attended.[16] His mother told him that the attendees were advised that adult students may join the pintakasi and their parents need not go to school; hence, Rico attended the activity since he was old enough.[17] Rico likewise testified that during the activity, Apolinario instructed him to cut down the banana plant.[18] He crossed the road directly across the school and started cutting the banana plant, and he only saw Francisco when the banana plant was about to fall down.[19] After Francisco was hit at the back of his neck, Apolinario was at the side of the road and did not help Francisco. Afterwards, the police brought Francisco to the hospital. Thereafter, the pintakasi continued and Apolinario still issued orders to the participants.[20]

Teresita prayed for the dismissal of the complaint against her. She averred that her minor son cut down the banana plant on instruction of Apolinario and under his supervision as school principal.[21]

In his defense, Apolinario asserted that: (a) he could not have been supervising and instructing Rico on how to cut the banana plant since he was not present when the incident happened; (b) at the time of the incident, he was 10 meters away supervising the construction of a fence, while Rico was in the actual supervision of two teachers; (c) the incident did not take place on a school day; it was a Saturday, during an activity by parents, teachers, and the adult community of Brgy. Palale, Sta. Margarita, Samar; (d) his co-defendant Teresita should be the one held liable, as she sent Rico to the event without informing the school, parents, teachers, and adult community organization of such fact; (e) assuming that Rico was under the school's control and supervision during the activity, the responsibility attaches only to the teacher-in-charge. Apolinario also filed a counterclaim for the award of moral damages.[22]

For his part, Apolinario testified that he was the principal of Brgy. Palale Elementary School, Sta. Margarita, Samar at the time of the incident, which was a public elementary school and not a school of trade and industry.[23] He did not handle any classes, and the principal's office was not involved in the pintakasi as he did not attend any meeting with regard to the parent-teacher association. The teachers were the ones in charge of supervising the activities. A day before the activity, the teachers informed him that the pintakasi would be held, which involved the teachers and parents of their pupils.[24]

Apolinario asserted that when the late Francisco was hit by the felled banana plant at around 7:30 a.m., he was on his way to the central school. After he entered his office, a parent informed him that a boy was cutting a banana plant, and the trunk of the banana plant fell on Francisco along the highway, causing him to slip. He inspected the place of the incident.[25]","This resolves the Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] assailing the Decision[2] and the Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA), which modified the Regional Trial Court's Decision[4] that granted the Heirs of Francisco De Los Santos' (Heirs) complaint for damages against Gil Apolinario (Apolinario).","The petition is partly granted.

Apolinario, as the teacher-in-charge of Rico at the time of the commission of the latter's tortious act, is vicariously liable for damages


Preliminarily, the trial court's finding of negligence, when affirmed by the CA, is a question of fact that the Court cannot pass upon without going into factual matters touching on the finding of negligence. In petitions for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court, this Court is limited to reviewing only errors of law, not of fact, unless the factual findings complained of are devoid of support by the evidence on record, or the assailed judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts.[38]

Here, the RTC and the CA uniformly held that Apolinario was negligent in directing Rico to cut the plant without observing the degree of care required under the circumstances to prevent the incident leading to Francisco's death, and thus liable for damages. We find no reason to disturb the findings of the RTC and CA. However, considering Apolinario's assertion that it is Teresita and not him who should be held liable for damages for Rico's act, a discussion on the nature and basis of his liability and Teresita's is in order.

A teacher-in-charge's civil liability for quasi-delicts committed by pupils in their custody is anchored in Articles 2176 and 2180 of the Civil Code:
ART. 2176. Whoever by act or omission causes damage to another, there being fault or negligence, is obliged to pay for the damage done. Such fault or negligence, if there is no pre-existing contractual relation between the parties, is called a quasi-delict and is governed by the provisions of this Chapter. (1902a)

ART. 2180. The obligation imposed by article 2176 is demandable not only for one's own acts or omissions, but also for those of persons for whom one is responsible.

. . . .

Lastly, teachers or heads of establishments of arts and trades shall be liable for damages caused by their pupils and students or apprentices, so long as they remain in their custody.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is PARTLY GRANTED. The May 28, 2014 Decision and the June 24, 2015 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA G.R. CV No. 03433 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION.

Petitioner Gil Apolinario is ordered to pay respondent heirs of Francisco de los Santos the following: (a) PHP 250,000.00 as temperate damages; (b) PHP 50,000.00 as civil indemnity; (c) PHP 50,000.00 as moral damages; and (d) PHP 5,000.00 as litigation expenses.

"G.R. No. 271934, November 27, 2024","HEIRS OF AQUILINO RAMOS, REPRESENTED BY WILBUR M. RAMOS, MARILOU G. ILAGAN, LYDIA GALARRITA, BENJAMIN GALARRITA, THE MUNICIPAL ASSESSOR OF ALUBIJID, MISAMIS ORIENTAL, AND PROVINCIAL ASSESSOR OF MISAMIS ORIENTAL, PETITIONERS, VS. PROSALITA BAGARES AND DANTON BAGARES, REPRESENTED BY PROSERFINA GALARRITA, RESPONDENTS.","Respondents alleged that on July 24, 1995, they purchased a 3,000-square meter parcel of land owned by the late Basilia Galarrita-Naguita (Basilia), situated in Lanao, Alubijid, Misamis Oriental, and identified as Lot No. 12020. Said property is a portion of the 7,687-square meter landholdings of Basilia. Basilia also sold a portion of Lot No. 12020, consisting of 3,655 square meter to the Local Government of Alubijid, Misamis Oriental and the remaining portion, consisting of 1,032 square meter to Prosalita.[4]

Subsequently, Aquilino Ramos (Aquilino) filed before the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) a free patent over Lot No. 12020 consisting of 7,687 square meter. Respondents opposed the application and alleged that Aquilino deliberately tampered the Deed of Sale of Unregistered Land he submitted to the Provincial Environment and Natural Resources Office (PENRO) by changing Lot No. 12019 to Lot No. 12020. PENRO denied the free patent filed by Aquilino.[5]

Meanwhile, Marilou, Benjamin, Elyer, and Lydia were buyers of a portion of Lot No. 12020 from Aquilino. The case became the subject of barangay conciliation, but the parties failed to reach an amicable settlement of their dispute.[6] They averred that the portion of land claimed by respondents is not the same portion they owned and possessed since 1978.[7]

On June 14, 2004, petitioners argued that their predecessor-in-interest did not tamper with the Deed. Further, they maintained that after Aquilino bought the subject property, he and the rest of them lived in the subject property until he sold some portions of it.[8]","Before the Court are consolidated Petitions for Review on Certiorari[1] assailing the Decision[2] dated May 31, 2023, of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 06149-MIN filed by the following: (1) the Heirs of Aquilino Ramos, represented by Wilbur M. Ramos (Wilbur), Marilou G. Ilagan (Marilou), Lydia Galarrita (Lydia), and Benjamin Galarrita (Benjamin); and (2) Marilou, Benjamin, and Elyer Galarrita (Elyer) (collectively, petitioners).

The CA affirmed the Decision[3] dated March 19, 2019, of Branch 44, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Initao, Misamis Oriental in Civil Case No. 2004-487 which granted the complaint for Declaration of Nullity of Tampered Deed of Sale of Unregistered Land filed by Prosalita Galarrita Bagares (Prosalita) and Danton Bagares (Danton), represented by Proserfina Galarrita (Proserfina) (collectively, respondents).","It is settled that a Rule 45 petition should only raise questions of law as the Court is not a trier of fact.[20] ""A question of law arises when there is doubt as to what the law is on a certain state of facts, while there is a question of fact when the doubt arises as to the truth or falsity of the alleged facts.""[21]

In the case, the following issues raised are factual matters that are beyond the scope of an appeal by certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court: (1) whether the deed of sale of Lot No. 12020 is null and void for having been tampered with; (2) whether prescription has already set in in favor of petitioners; and (3) whether petitioners are buyers in good faith.

In any case, even if the consolidated petitions are given due course, they must still fail for petitioners' failure to prove that the CA erred in affirming the ruling of the RTC in favor of respondents. As aptly observed by the CA:
In the present case, the findings of the DENR that Aquilino Ramos deliberately tampered his free patent application for Lot No. 12020 carries great weight and should be accorded respect, more so, when Aquilino Ramos failed to rebut such findings. There being no controversion, the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties applies favorably to the DENR. This means that the DENR's findings has become conclusive...

Aside from the findings of the DENR, the Court notes that Aquilino Ramos admitted during the barangay proceedings that he tampered [with] the deed of sale attached in his free patent application to Lot No. 12020. The admission by Aquilino Ramos qualifies as a judicial admission. Since such statement is judicial admission, it does not require proof according to Section 4, Rule 129 of the Rules of Court, which provides:
SEC. 4. Judicial admissions. – An admission, verbal or written, made by a party in the course of the proceedings in the same case, does not require proof. The admission may be contradicted only by showing that it was made through palpable mistake or that no such admission was made.
Since there is judicial admission that the deed of sale was tampered [with], then there is no question that the Deed of Sale of Unregistered Land selling Lot 12020 is void. Consequently, the Deed of Sale of Unregistered Land selling Lot 12020 did not transfer ownership of the land to appellants, as Aquilino Ramos had no title or interest to transfer.[22] (Citations omitted)
Indeed, ""the trial court's findings of fact are entitled to great weight and will not be disturbed on appeal.""[23] ""The rule finds an even more stringent application where the findings are sustained by the CA.""[24]

Here, the Court finds no cogent reason to overturn the finding of the RTC, as affirmed by the CA, that the subject Deed of Sale is void for having been tampered with by Aquilino Ramos.

Moreover, there is no merit in the argument of the Heirs of Aquilino Ramos in G.R. No. 271934 that they acquired ownership of the subject property by prescription.

""Prescription is a mode of acquiring ownership through the lapse of time and under certain conditions.""[25] It may either be ordinary or extraordinary.[26] ""Ordinary acquisitive prescription requires possession of things in good faith and with just title for a period of ten years, while extraordinary acquisitive prescription requires uninterrupted adverse possession of thirty years, without need of title or of good faith.""[27] As correctly observed by the CA:
In the case at bar, ordinary acquisitive prescription is unavailing as it demands that the possession be ""in good faith and with just title,"" and there is no evidence on record to prove [the Heirs of Aquilino Ramos'] ""good faith.""

Likewise, [the Heirs of Aquilino Ramos'] adverse possession of the land fell short of the requirements for extraordinary acquisitive prescription to set in. The records show that the subject land is an unregistered land. When the [Heirs of Aquilino Ramos] filed the instant case on April 15, 2004, [they] were in possession of the land for only 26 years counted from the time of the alleged start of their possession in 1978. Obviously, it fell short of the required 30 years of uninterrupted adverse possession without just title and good faith.[28] (Citations omitted)
The Court likewise rejects the contention of Marilou, Benjamin, and Elyer in G.R. No. 272834 that they are buyers in good faith because they had no notice that the seller did not have the capacity to sell the subject property. The records show that Marilou, Benjamin, Elyer, and Lydia bought the property when it was still an unregistered land. Jurisprudence dictates that ""[t]he defense of having purchased the property in good faith may be availed of only where registered land is involved and the buyer had relied in good faith on the clear title of the registered owner.""[29]

Finally, the Court notes the following infirmities in the petition which further warrant the consolidated petitions' denial:

In G.R. No. 271934, the Petition lacks: (a) a statement of material date of receipt of the assailed CA Decision; and (b) the proof of service thereof to the adverse parties and the CA.

In G.R. No. 272834, the timeliness of the motion for extension to file a petition for review on certiorari could not be determined due to an illegible postal mark. The Petition also lacks: (a) the proof of service thereof to the adverse parties and the CA; (b) a verified declaration of electronic submission of the filed soft copy of the petition as required under the Rules on E-Filing (A.M. No. 10-3-7-SC and the Efficient Use of Paper Rule (A.M. No. 11-9-4-SC); and (c) a statement of material date of filing of the motion for reconsideration of the assailed CA Decision.

Moreover, the jurat of the verification and certification of non-forum shopping lacks affiant's current identification document issued by an official agency bearing the photograph and signature of the individual in violation of Rule II, Sections 2, 6, and 12 of the 2004 Rules of Notarial Practice, as amended by A.M. No. 02-8-13-SC dated February 19, 2008. The verification and certification of non-forum shopping, too, was signed by Benjamin without proof of authority to sign for and on behalf of Marilou and Elyer.

All told, the Court resolves to deny the instant petitions for: first, raising factual issues; second, being procedurally defective; and third, failure of petitioners to show that the CA committed any reversible error as to warrant the Court's exercise of its discretionary appellate jurisdiction.

However, the Court finds it proper to delete the award of attorney's fees, in line with prevailing jurisprudence.","ACCORDINGLY, the consolidated petitions are DENIED. The Decision dated May 31, 2023, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 06149-MIN is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION, in that the award of attorney's fees is DELETED."
"G.R. No. 261323, November 27, 2024","CAPTAIN RAMON R. VERGA, JR., PETITIONER, VS. HARBOR STAR SHIPPING SERVICES, INC., RESPONDENT.","Harbor Star is a domestic corporation duly incorporated in accordance with the laws of the Republic of the Philippines.[6] It is primarily engaged in the business of providing harbor assistance, towing services, salvage, repairs, dry dock, and other related services to foreign and domestic sea-going vessels.[7]

On the other hand, Verga was a shareholder of Davao Tugboat and Allied Services, Inc. (DATASI) and Davtug Multi-Purpose Cooperative (DAVTUG) which are both engaged in businesses similar to Harbor Star's.[8] Particularly, DATASI was a domestic corporation involved in the tug and towage business in the district port of Davao.[9] It was managed by Verga and two other pilots, Captain Vicente Lagura (Lagura) and Captain Edgardo Alaan (Alaan).[10] In the course of its business, DATASI's principal shareholders organized a cooperative, DAVTUG, on March 7, 2006 to acquire more tugboats under the benefit of Republic Act No. 9520,[11] or the Philippine Cooperative Code of 2008. According to Verga, DATASI has been dominating the tugboat business in Davao as early as 2006.[12]

On several occasions between November 2006 to May 2008, Harbor Star wrote to DATASI, requesting business meetings for the parties to collaborate and work synergistically despite being competitors in the tugboat and towage business.[13] Notably, Harbor Star proposed several schemes through which it and DATASI may jointly conduct tugboat operations in Davao, including, among others, merger, partnership, and a joint venture with assignment of area operations.[14]

Harbor Star alleged that sometime during the second semester of 2008, it eventually persuaded Verga, as well as Lagura and Alaan, to sell their shares of stock in DATASI, with the understanding that after the final audit of the books of the two entities, and after receipt of more than 50% of the agreed valuation of the shares, they will comply with their obligation to execute the pertinent documents for the transfer of their shares of stock in DATASI to Harbor Star.[15] Supposedly, the parties agreed in principle to the PHP 6,000,000.00 valuation of Verga's shares, which shall be adjusted depending on the outcome of the final audit.[16] Although a Memorandum of Agreement[17] was prepared by Harbor Star in connection with the transaction, the draft was not executed by the parties and their agreement was not reduced in writing.[18]

Thereafter, from September 2008 to July 2009, Harbor Star made several installment payments to Verga, for a total amount of PHP 4,000,000.00.[19]

Later, in 2012, Harbor Star found out that after its initial payment to Verga, the latter divested his shares in DATASI, thereby making it impossible for him to transfer his DATASI shares to Harbor Star.[20] In a Letter[21] dated February 21, 2012, Harbor Star demanded Verga to return the sums of money that he received as payment for his shares in DATASI. Instead of returning the money, Verga demanded an additional amount of PHP 2,000,000.00 from Harbor Star for the latter to purportedly complete the payment of the PHP 6,000,000.00 due under their agreement.[22]

Thus, on April 12, 2012, Harbor Star filed a Complaint against Verga, praying that he be ordered to return the PHP 4,000,000.00 that he received from Harbor Star.[23] It averred that: one, it orally entered into an agreement for the sale of Verga's shares in DATASI and DAVTUG; and two, by divesting his interests in DATASI, Verga made it impossible for him to comply with his obligation to transfer his DATASI shares to Harbor Star. Thus, Harbor Star argued that Verga should return the sums of money that he received for the said shares.

In his defense, Verga denied the purported oral contract of sale over his DATASI and DAVTUG shares to Harbor Star. He narrated that there were several negotiations for Harbor Star to buyout the shares of the members of DAVTUG. However, Harbor Star spread a rumor among the cooperative members that Verga, Lagura, and Alaan will receive commissions from the buyouts, resulting in dissension among the members. Harbor Star then took advantage of the situation and tricked Verga, Lagura, and Alaan to resign from DAVTUG and DATASI in exchange for PHP 6,000,000.00. Supposedly, their resignation will serve as a marketing tool for Harbor Star to entice ship owners and agents to avail themselves of Harbor Star's services instead of DATASI's and DAVTUG's.[24]

Verga further alleged that in pursuit of their agreement, he resigned from DAVTUG on July 11, 2009, after he received a total of PHP 4,000,000.00 from Harbor Star.[25] However, Harbor Star reneged on its obligation by refusing to pay the remaining PHP 2,000,000.00 balance of the resignation incentive. He thus filed his counterclaim against Harbor Star in the amount of PHP 2,000,000.00, representing the unpaid balance of the resignation incentive.

Finally, Verga argued that Harbor Star could not have validly entered into an oral contract for the acquisition of his DATASI and DAVTUG shares in the absence of the approval of a majority of the board of directors (Board) of Harbor Star and ratification by the shareholders representing at least 2/3 of the outstanding capital stock of the corporation, in accordance with Section 42[26] of Batas Pambansa Blg. 68,[27] or the Corporation Code.[28] He insisted that the alleged agreement with Harbor Star for the sale of his DATASI and DAVTUG shares was unenforceable under the Statute of Frauds,[29] as provided in Article 1403(2)(d)[30] of the Civil Code.","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] (Petition) under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assailing the Decision[2] dated October 28, 2021, and the Resolution[3] dated June 6, 2022, of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 109255. The CA denied the appeal of petitioner Captain Ramon R. Verga, Jr. (Verga) and affirmed with modification the Decision[4] dated November 17, 2016, of Branch 66, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Makati City in Civil Case No. 12-298 that granted the Complaint for Sum of Money and Damages (Complaint) filed by respondent Harbor Star Shipping Services, Inc. (Harbor Star) against Verga.

In its Resolution, the CA denied the Motion for Reconsideration[5] of Verga for lack of merit.","The Petition is denied for lack of merit.

The Petition raises factual issues that are beyond the scope of a Rule 45 proceeding.[66] It is not the function of the Court to analyze or weigh all over again the evidence already considered and ruled upon by the RTC and the CA.[67] While there are recognized exceptions[68] to the rule, Verga has not shown that any of the exceptions apply to the present case.

At any rate, the Court finds no reversible error in the challenged rulings of the CA.
 
I.
The records establish that the parties entered into a contract of sale over Vergas DATASI shares to Harbor Star
 

The CA determined that there is a preponderance of evidence showing that the parties entered into an oral contract to sell Verga's shares in DATASI and DAVTUG, and that Harbor Star made partial payments for the shares in the total amount of PHP 4,000,000.00. Given that Verga divested his interest in DATASI, the CA held that Verga made it legally impossible for him to transfer and deliver the DATASI shares to Harbor Star, thereby making him liable to return the money that he received from Harbor Star.[69]

Verga imputes error to the CA's conclusion upon the argument that he received PHP 4,000,000.00 from Harbor Star as incentive for him to resign from DATASI and DAVTUG and not as partial payment for his shareholdings.[70]

The Court partially agrees with the CA that based on the evidence on record, the parties entered into a contract for the buyout of Verga's shares. However, the Court finds that the agreement is an oral contract of sale, not a contract to sell. Further, the subject matter of the agreement pertained only to Verga's shares in DATASI and not in DAVTUG, given that the vouchers[71] evidencing Harbor Star's payment of PHP 4,000,000.00 to Verga referred only to the DATASI shares. The draft memorandum of agreement[72] attached to the record also indicates a sale of Verga's DATASI shares to Harbor Star.

Although the CA's finding as regards the nature of the contract between the parties as an oral contract to sell and not a contract of sale was unassigned, the Court finds it proper to review the same in determining the appropriate remedies available to Harbor Star.
 
A.
The sum of money that Harbor Star paid to Verga was for the latter's shareholdings in DATASI
 

Article 1371 of the Civil Code states that ""[i]n order to judge the intention of the contracting parties, their contemporaneous and subsequent acts shall be principally considered."" Otherwise said, the decisive factor in determining the nature of a contract is the intention of the parties, as shown by their conduct, words, actions and deeds prior to, during, and immediately after the execution of the agreement.[73] As explained by the Court in Javier v. Court of Appeals:[74]
It is settled that the previous and simultaneous and subsequent acts of the parties are properly cognizable indicia of their true intention. Where the parties to a contract have given it a practical construction by their conduct as by acts in partial performance, such construction may be considered by the court in construing the contract, determining its meaning and ascertaining the mutual intention of the parties at the time of contracting. The parties' practical construction of their contract has been characterized as a clue or index to, or as evidence of, their intention or meaning and as an important, significant, convincing, persuasive, or influential factor in determining the proper construction of the agreement.[75]
The previous, contemporaneous, and subsequent acts of the parties demonstrate that they entered into a contract of sale, wherein Verga, as seller, sold his DATASI shares to Harbor Star, as buyer, in exchange for a sum of money. The parties' conduct does not support Verga's contention that Harbor Star paid him PHP 4,000,000.00 only as an incentive for him to resign from DATASI and DAVTUG.

First, Verga testified that before he received a total of PHP 4,000,000.00 from Harbor Star supposedly as incentive for his resignation from DATASI and DAVTUG, Harbor Star presented to him a draft memorandum of agreement[76] to reflect its intention.[77] However, a reading of the draft memorandum reveals that it pertains to the sale of Verga's DATASI shares to Harbor Star, not to an agreement for Verga to resign from DAVTUG in exchange for a sum of money:
The First Party [Harbor Star] acknowledges that the Second Party [Verga] is a stockholder of the present exclusive provider of pilotage services in Davao City. The Second Party [Verga] undertakes to protect the interests of the First Party [Harbor Star] to enable it to recover its investments in the tugboats.

2. CONSIDERATION – In consideration for this Agreement, the Second Party [Verga] hereby sells all his interests in the tug company (DATASI) in the amount of PESOS: SIX MILLION (Php6,000,000), ONE MILLION PESOS (Php1,000,000) of which is hereby acknowledged by the Second Party as having been received by him as Advance Payment.[78] (Italics supplied)
Although the draft memorandum of agreement was not signed by the parties, it still provides an insight into the intent behind Harbor Star's payment of PHP 4,000,000.00 to Verga. Verily, the Court has considered prior drafts of an agreement to discover the intent of the contracting parties and the circumstances surrounding their contract.[79]

Second, as correctly pointed out by the lower courts, several of the payment vouchers issued by Harbor Star indicate that the sums of money that it remitted to Verga referred to payments for his DATASI shares.[80] The Court particularly notes that one of the voucher receipts signed by Verga states that that he received PHP 250,000.00 from Harbor Star as ""Partial Payment for DATASI Shares[.]""[81]

Notably, the Memorandum of Agreement and payment vouchers indicate that the subject of the agreement between the parties pertained only to Verga's shareholdings in DATASI and not in DAVTUG. Hence, in contrast to the lower courts' conclusions, the Court finds that the PHP 4,000,000.00 that Harbor Star paid to Verga was only for the latter's shares in DATASI, not DAVTUG.

Despite the payment vouchers, Verga denies receiving the money as payment for his DATASI shares because, allegedly, when he signed the receipt, it was blank and did not indicate the purpose for the payment. He avers that the phrase ""Partial Payment for DATASI Shares"" was merely intercalated.[82]

The Court cannot lend credence to Verga's insistence that the vouchers were intercalated because of the elementary principle that forgery or falsification is never presumed and must be proven by clear, positive, and convincing evidence.[83] Significantly, neither the RTC nor the CA made any finding of forgery as to the vouchers. Besides, as pointed out by the RTC, Verga's allegation lacks credibility because the voucher[84] itself states that the amount of PHP 250,000.00 was being remitted to him as partial payment for his DATASI shares, yet he did not refute the contents of the voucher.[85]

Third, prior to the oral contract of sale, the letters exchanged between Harbor Star and DATASI representatives reveal the former's intention to enter into a merger or partnership with DATASI.[86] The acquisition of Verga's shares in DATASI is more consistent with Harbor Star's previous offers of merger or partnership.

Finally, as pointed out by Harbor Star, Verga's resignation from DAVTUG does not appear to have been prompted by the PHP 4,000,000.00 that he received from Harbor Star. Based on the Letter[87] dated July 11, 2009, that Verga signed, he resigned from DAVTUG after the other members refused to buyout his shares in the cooperative:
Last July 5, 2009 we offered to sell our shares to the cooperative or its members with a request that we be informed by July 10, 2009. We have not been favored with a reply. We view this as a refusal to buy our shares as determined by the auditor.

We are therefore tendering our resignation as members of our cooperative effective on July 11, 2009.[88]
The foregoing circumstances reveal the intention of the parties to enter into a contract for Harbor Star to acquire Verga's shareholdings in DATASI. The CA was therefore correct in holding that Verga received PHP 4,000,000.00 from Harbor Star as payment for his shareholdings in DATASI.","WHEREFORE, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED for lack of merit. The Decision dated October 28, 2021, and the Resolution dated June 6, 2022, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 109255 are hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION, in that petitioner Captain Ramon R.

HEIRS OF MELANIA ROXAS, NAMELY: MANUEL A. ROXAS, MARIA ROSARIO ROXAS-URETA, ALEXANDER A. ROXAS, SALOME ROXAS-PANTALEON, PAUL GERARDO ROXAS, ELAINE ROXAS GAMBOA, MA. IMELDA ROXAS-CRUZ, AND DAVID ANTHONY ROXAS, RESPONDENTS.","Antonio Roxas (Antonio) and Melania Roxas (Melania) are the parents of Ferdinand, Manuel A. Roxas (Manuel), Maria Rosario Roxas-Ureta (Maria), Alexander A. Roxas (Alexander), Salome Roxas-Pantaleon (Salome), Paul Gerardo Roxas (Paul), Elaine Roxas-Gamboa (Elaine), Ma. Imelda Roxas-Cruz (Imelda), David Anthony Roxas (David), Conrado A. Roxas (Conrado), and Jesus A. Roxas (Jesus).[5]

In 1970, Melania's cousin Felicisma Garcia, married to Alfonso Garcia, executed a Deed of Absolute Sale (DOAS) in favor of Ferdinand over a 500-square-meter parcel of land located at Loakan, Baguio City (subject lot). Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-16657 was thereafter issued in Ferdinand's name. Melania built a house on the subject lot which the family used as a vacation house and residence of some of their children.[6]

From 1990 to 1995, Melania rented out a portion of the subject property to Alfredo Sison (Alfredo). In 1991, Paul started residing on the subject property together with his family.[7]

Antonio died on April 1, 1995. Subsequently, Ferdinand died on September 18, 2004, while Melania died on January 1, 2011.[8]

On November 11, 2014, Manuel, Maria, Alexander, Salome, Paul, Elaine, Imelda, and David (collectively, the Heirs of Melania) filed a Complaint[9] for the declaration of nullity of the DOAS and the cancellation of TCT No. T-16657. They alleged that it was Melania who purchased the subject lot, but she placed it in Ferdinand's name to protect the interests of her children in view of the existence of Antonio's illegitimate children. Ferdinand was 19 years old and still studying at the time of the sale. The house that Melania had built is declared in her name. Ferdinand never questioned his sibling's use of the subject property. The Heirs of Melania filed the complaint because the Heirs of Ferdinand sought to take over the subject property after Melania's death. The latter filed an unlawful detainer case against Paul before Branch 1, Municipal Trial Court in Cities, Baguio City. Jesus approved of the Complaint but did not join his siblings because he resides abroad. As for Conrado, his relationship with the Heirs of Melania is strained because he wants them to change their religion.[10]

The Heirs of Ferdinand countered that Ferdinand is the true owner of the subject lot. Antonio and Melania gave him the money to pay for the subject lot as they were overjoyed that he was about to graduate from college. Melania constructed the house with the permission of Ferdinand. Similarly, Ferdinand allowed Melania to rent out the property and keep the proceeds from it. Ferdinand also allowed Paul to reside on the subject property on the condition that he would vacate upon being asked to do so. When he asked Paul to leave, Melania pleaded with him to allow his brother to stay at least while she was still alive. Ferdinand paid the real property tax for the subject lot.[11]

The Heirs of Ferdinand averred that in 1988, Antonio and Melania transferred their assets to their family corporation, Mel-Rox Realty Inc. (Mel-Rox). After Antonio died, Mel-Rox gave the former's illegitimate children their share in his inheritance. Angela explained that Antonio's illegitimate children had their claim annotated on the titles of the properties registered under Mel-Rox. Thus, Mel-Rox paid Antonio's illegitimate children their claim on the estate of Antonio.[12] This prompted the legitimate children of Antonio and Melania to also ask for their share. On March 7, 1997, Melania, Conrado, Ferdinand, Elaine, and Imelda, as officers of Mel-Rox, executed a document entitled ""Donation/Gifts of Real Property and its Cash Equivalents to the Roxas Children from Mr. and Mrs. Antonio and Melania Roxas""[13] (Donation Document). Ferdinand's siblings were either given money or property. He did not receive anything as the subject property was already given to him.[14]

After Ferdinand died, the Heirs of Ferdinand met with some of the Heirs of Melania regarding the subject property as it was Ferdinand's wish for them to take over and improve it. They wanted to take possession of the subject property, but the Heirs of Melania told them that they could only do so after Melania's death. But even after Melania's death, Paul stayed on the subject property. Hence, they filed an ejectment case against him.[15]","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court filed by the heirs of Ferdinand A. Roxas (Ferdinand), namely: Angela Margarita T. Roxas (Angela), Dyan Paula T. Roxas (Dyan), Michael Jude T. Roxas (Michael), and Maria Katrina T. Roxas (Katrina) (collectively, the Heirs of Ferdinand), assailing the Decision[2] dated February 13, 2020, and the Resolution[3] dated September 29, 2020, of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 109260. The CA reversed the Decision[4] dated January 19, 2017, of Branch 5, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Baguio City, First Judicial Region in Civil Case No. 8146-R.","Considering the varying findings of the RTC and the CA, the Court deems it proper to give due course to the arguments raised by the Heirs of Ferdinand, albeit they involve factual issues.[36]

The Court grants the Petition.

Article 1448 of the Civil Code states:
ARTICLE 1448. There is an implied trust when property is sold, and the legal estate is granted to one party but the price is paid by another for the purpose of having the beneficial interest of the property. The former is the trustee, while the latter is the beneficiary. However, if the person to whom the title is conveyed is a child, legitimate or illegitimate, of the one paying the price of the sale, no trust is implied by law, it being disputably presumed that there is a gift in favor of the child.
The implied trust under Article 1448 is called a purchase money resulting trust, which has the following elements: (a) an actual payment of money, property or services, or an equivalent, constituting valuable consideration; and (b) such consideration must be furnished by the alleged beneficiary of a resulting trust. The party alleging the existence of the trust bears the burden of proving it.[37]

Notably, the last sentence of Article 1448 states that if the title is conveyed to a child of the one paying the price of the sale, the disputable presumption is that there is a gift in favor of the child. There being no question that Ferdinand is the child of Melania, and that Melania paid the purchase price for the subject lot, there is a disputable presumption that Melania intended to donate the subject lot to Ferdinand.

Being a disputable presumption, it may be overturned by contrary evidence. In Tong v. Go Tiat Kun,[38] the Court held that the presumption was overturned because of several factors. First, the child under whose name the property was titled did not prove that he had the means to pay for it. Second, the parent and his other children always had possession of the property. Third, the property remained undivided even though it was registered in the name of one child. The surviving heirs of the child under whose name it was titled only claimed ownership after the death of said child. Fourth, the surviving heirs of the child admitted that their predecessor-in-interest did not send any letter claiming ownership over the property and that they had their own residence. Finally, the parent paid the real property taxes.[39]

The Court disagrees with the CA that the Heirs of Melania successfully overturned the presumption in favor of Ferdinand.

Ferdinand admittedly did not pay for the subject lot. In addition, the subject lot was not divided. But the similarities with Tong end there. It was Ferdinand and his heirs who paid for the real property taxes on the subject lot.[40] Melania also consistently asked Ferdinand to permit Paul to stay in the subject lot and the house she had built. This showed that she respected Ferdinand as the owner of the subject lot. More, the Heirs of Ferdinand are in possession of TCT No. T-16657.

Melania's act of building a house on the subject lot, paying the taxes for said house,[41] and renting out a portion thereof,[42] do not negate her donative intent. As explained by Associate Justice Alfredo Benjamin S. Caguioa (Associate Justice Caguioa), ""these actions pertain only to the exercise of the right to the possession, use, and fruits of the lot.""[43]

Having settled that the presumption under Article 1448 stands, it must be determined if the donation should still comply with the formal requirements under the Civil Code. These requirements would depend on whether the property donated is movable or immovable.

In the Answer of the Heirs of Ferdinand before the RTC, they stated that what was given by Melania to Ferdinand was the money to purchase the subject lot.[44] Therefore, the applicable provision is Article 748 of the Civil Code, which states that ""[i]f the value of the personal property donated exceeds five thousand pesos, the donation and the acceptance shall be made in writing. Otherwise, the donation shall be void."" The DOAS states that the purchase price for the subject lot is exactly PHP 5,000.00;[45] hence, the donation need not be made in writing.

In any event, Associate Justice Caguioa astutely observed that ""it would be illogical for the law to require the presumed donation to still comply with the formal requisites because otherwise, there would be no need for the presumption.""[46] The presumption under Article 1448 is necessary precisely because the parent chose an unconventional mode in donating property to their child. The presumption under Article 1448 should not be overturned due to the failure to comply with the formal requisites under Articles 748 or 749 of the Civil Code but should instead be based on proof that the parent did not intend to donate the property to the child.

Accordingly, the Court agrees with the RTC that the complaint of the Heirs of Melania should be dismissed. However, the Court cannot sustain the award of attorney's fees for lack of factual and legal bases under Article 2208 of the Civil Code.","WHEREFORE, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is GRANTED.

"G.R. No. 252944, November 27, 2024","COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, PETITIONER, VS. PACIFIC HUB CORPORATION,* RESPONDENT.","In 2008, Pacific Hub sent a letter[8] to BIR, indicating its willingness to pay its unremitted taxes for years 2005 and 2006 but requested for abatement of penalties, surcharges, and interests due to continued financial losses. This was later followed by the filing sometime in 2010 of its Application for Abatement or Cancellation of Tax, Penalties and/or Interest,[9] as well as the payment of the basic deficiency withholding tax on compensation, expanded withholding tax, and value-added tax in the total amount of PHP 15,480,231.11.[10]

Pacific Hub eventually received the Notice of Denial dated January 10, 2014, rejecting its application for abatement. It also received the Warrant of Distraint and/or Levy dated September 12, 2014, enforcing the collection of the increments incident to its deficiency withholding tax on compensation and expanded withholding tax in the aggregate amount of PHP 13,792,867.56.[11]

Inevitably, Pacific Hub filed its Petition for Review[12] before the CTA seeking to annul and set aside the Notice of Denial and the Warrant of Distraint and/or Levy for having been irregularly issued in violation of its right to due process.[13]

In refutation, CIR contended that the CTA had no jurisdiction over the case as there was no final decision on a disputed assessment to be reviewed.[14] Moreover, the power to grant or deny a request for abatement is completely discretionary on the part of the CIR, hence, beyond the ambit of the CTA's appellate jurisdiction.[15] In any case, the exercise of this power was not attended by grave abuse of discretion.[16]

Ensuingly, the CTA Third Division rendered its Decision[17] annulling both the Notice of Denial and the Warrant of Distraint and/or Levy. The CTA held that it had jurisdiction over the case under its ""other matters"" jurisdiction.[18] It found that the Warrant of Distraint and/or Levy was void for having been issued without the benefit of a prior assessment issued against Pacific Hub.[19] In the same vein, the Notice of Denial was void for failing to state the reasons for the denial of the application, in contravention of the requirements under Revenue Regulations No. 13-2001.[20] Withal, the CTA clarified that the voiding of the Notice of Denial does not mean that Pacific Hub is readily entitled to its request for abatement. This matter is still left to the best discretion of the CIR.[21]

With its bid for reconsideration[22] having been rebuffed by the CTA Third Division,[23] the CIR filed its Petition for Review[24] before the CTA En Banc.

In the impugned Decision, the CTA En Banc affirmed the rulings of the CTA Third Division.[25] It reverberated that the CTA has jurisdiction to review the Notice of Denial issued by the CIR.[26] While the courts may not generally interfere with discretionary functions, such as the grant or denial of an application for abatement, it may do so when the exercise thereof is attended by grave abuse of discretion,[27] as in this case. Since the Notice of Denial bore no indication as to the reason why Pacific Hub's application was denied, the CIR clearly contravened the requirements under Revenue Regulations No. 13-2001.[28] Similarly, the Warrant of Distraint and/or Levy was also void for being issued without a prior assessment, thereby contravening Pacific Hub's right to due process.[29]

Unyielding, the CIR sought reconsideration but was again brushed aside by the CTA En Banc through the oppugned Resolution.

Now, before this Court, the CIR resolutely asseverates that the CTA En Banc erred in holding that: (1) the CTA had jurisdiction to review the Notice of Denial; (2) the Notice of Denial was not issued in accordance with BIR regulations; and (3) the Warrant of Distraint and/or Levy was not validly issued.","This Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] seeks to overturn the Decision[2] and the Resolution[3] of the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) sitting en banc which affirmed the nullity of the Warrant of Distraint and/or Levy[4] dated September 12, 2014 and the Notice of Denial[5] dated January 10, 2014 issued by petitioner Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) against respondent Pacific Hub Corporation (Pacific Hub), and which denied the subsequent motion for reconsideration[6] filed by CIR, in CTA EB No. 1837.","The Petition is devoid of merit.

The first issue raised by CIR calls for a clarification on the extent of the ""other matters"" jurisdiction of the CTA and whether this can extend to reviewing the CIR's exercise of its power to grant or deny applications for abatement or cancellation of taxes, penalties, and interests. The CIR argues that it has sole discretion on this matter and the CTA's act of assuming jurisdiction over the case encroaches upon the prerogatives of the executive department in violation of the principle of separation of powers.[30]

This argument fails to persuade.

The CTA's ""other matters"" jurisdiction in relation to the CIR is enshrined in Section 7(a)(1) of Republic Act No. 1125,[31] as amended by Republic Act No. 9282:[32]
SEC. 7. Jurisdiction. — The CTA shall exercise:

(a) Exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review by appeal, as herein provided:

(1) Decisions of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue in cases involving disputed assessments, refunds of internal revenue taxes, fees or other charges, penalties in relation thereto, or other matters arising under the National Internal Revenue Code or other laws administered by the Bureau of Internal Revenue[.](Emphasis supplied)
In Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Hambrecht & Quist Philippines, Inc.,[33] the Court had occasion to elucidate that the term ""other matters"" is virtually unbridled save for the qualifying phrase that immediately follows:
Plainly, the assailed CTA En Banc Decision was correct in declaring that there was nothing in the foregoing provision upon which petitioner's theory with regard to the parameters of the term ""other matters"" can be supported or even deduced. What is rather clearly apparent, however, is that the term ""other matters"" is limited only by the qualifying phrase that follows it.

Thus, on the strength of such observation, we have previously ruled that the appellate jurisdiction of the CTA is not limited to cases which involve decisions of the CIR on matters relating to assessments or refunds. The second part of the provision covers other cases that arise out of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) or related laws administered by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR).[34] (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)
Indeed, a plain reading of the provision yields the inevitable conclusion that the CTA has the power to review not only matters arising or incidental to tax assessments or refunds, but also to any case arising from the application of the provisions of the Tax Code or other tax laws that are administered by the BIR. In fact, the Court has affirmed the CTA's ""other matters"" jurisdiction over cases involving: (a) the determination of whether the right of the CIR to collect the validly assessed tax has prescribed;[35] (b) cases seeking the cancellation and withdrawal of a warrant of distraint and/or levy;[36] (c) cases seeking a determination of the validity of waivers of the statute of limitations as well as the proper availment of tax amnesty;[37] and (d) cases on the proper exercise of the CIR's power to compromise delinquent accounts and to grant an informer's reward.[38]

From the foregoing, it becomes evident that the determination of whether the CIR has properly exercised the powers granted to it by the Tax Code may likewise fall under the CTA's ""other matters"" jurisdiction. However, does this also apply to the exercise of a power that is purely discretionary on the part of the CIR, such as the power to abate or cancel taxes, penalties, or interests?

The Court answers in the affirmative.

It bears accentuating that the Court had already impliedly recognized the CTA's jurisdiction to review the CIR's denial of an application for abatement in Qatar Airways Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue,[39] albeit therein petitioner's case was ultimately dismissed for its failure to timely file its judicial petition before the CTA.

All the same, applicable laws and jurisprudence support the foregoing interpretation of the CTA's ""other matters"" jurisdiction.

The power to abate or cancel a tax liability is vested in the CIR under Section 204(B) of the Tax Code:
Section 204. Authority of the Commissioner to Compromise, Abate and Refund or Credit Taxes. – The Commissioner may –

. . . .

(B) Abate or cancel a tax liability, when:

(1) The tax or any portion thereof appears to be unjustly or excessively assessed; or

(2) The administration and collection costs involved do not justify the collection of the amount due.
The Court recognizes that this power to abate or cancel a tax liability is purely discretionary on the part of the CIR given that it is ""a power or right conferred upon them by law of acting officially, under certain circumstances, according to the dictates of their own judgments and consciences, uncontrolled by the judgments or consciences of others.""[40]

While the courts may generally not interfere in an administrative agency's exercise of a purely administrative or discretionary power, this rule admits of exceptions such as when ""the issuing authority has gone beyond its statutory authority, has exercised unconstitutional powers or has clearly acted arbitrarily and without regard to his duty or with grave abuse of discretion.""[41]

This flows from the reigning principle that the judicial power conferred by the 1987 Constitution on the Supreme Court and all other lower courts, including the CTA, necessarily carries with it the power to ""determine if any government branch or instrumentality has acted beyond the scope of its powers, such that there is grave abuse of discretion.""[42]

The Court has long settled that the CTA has the authority to issue writs of certiorari to review whether the acts or omissions of certain agencies are attended by grave abuse of discretion.[43] The Court has likewise declared that this authority is inherent in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction.[44]

Invariably, it is this very same rationale which the Court applied in PNOC v. Court of Appeals[45] to hold that the exercise of the CIR's discretionary power to enter into a compromise is subject to the CTA's power of judicial review. The Court pronounced that the ""[CIR] would have to exercise his discretion within the parameters set by the law, and in case he abuses his discretion, the CTA may correct such abuse if the matter is appealed to them.""[46]

By parity of reasoning, the exercise of the CIR's discretionary power to abate or cancel taxes, penalties, and interests, if attended by grave abuse of discretion, is properly appealable to the CTA under its ""other matters"" jurisdiction, as was done in this case.

Having resolved that the CTA correctly assumed jurisdiction over the case at bench, the Court delves into the second issue on whether the Notice of Denial was indeed issued with grave abuse of discretion. Specifically, in denying Pacific Hub's application, did the CIR exercise its power in an arbitrary or despotic manner to the point that it amounted to an evasion of a positive duty or a refusal to act in contemplation of law?[47]

To this, the Court again answers in the affirmative.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED. The November 8, 2019 Decision and the June 26, 2020 Resolution of the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc in CTA EB No. 1837 are AFFIRMED.

"G.R. No. 255466, November 27, 2024","BBB255466,* PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","In an Information, petitioner was charged with psychological violence under Section 5(i) of Republic Act No. 9262 committed against his common-law partner, CCC, committed as follows:
Criminal Case No. 12-CR-8989

That in or about the period from the year 2010 until June 2012, in the Municipality of xxxxxxxxxxx, Province of Benguet, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named [petitioner] who is the live-in partner of the private complainant [CCC], did then and there willfully, unlawfully and knowingly cause substantial emotional and psychological distress to his live-in partner by repeated physical and verbal abuse and by not engaging himself to a gainful employment in order to help in the support of their child or union with [CCC], to her great damage and prejudice.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[9]
In a separate Information, petitioner was charged with violation of Section 5(b) of Republic Act No. 7610, committed against his daughter, AAA. The accusatory portion of the Information states:
Criminal Case No. 12-CR-8990

That sometime in the month of March 2012, at xxxxxxxxxxx, Municipality of xxxxxxxxxxx, Province of Benguet, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named [petitioner], who is the biological father of the offended party, with grave abuse of authority, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously commit an act of sexual abuse against [his] daughter. AAA, a minor, who was seven (7) years old at the time of the commission of the crime, by letting her hold his penis while inserting his finger in her vagina against her will and consent which deeds debase, degrade and demean the intrinsic worth and dignity of the said AAA as a human being, to her great damage, prejudice and mental anguish.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[10]
Upon arraignment, petitioner entered pleas of ""Not Guilty"" to both charges.[11]

Trial ensued.[12]

Petitioner and CCC have been common-law partners since 2003. They have a child, AAA, who was born on xxxxxxxxxxx.[13] According to CCC, petitioner had been hurting her, both physically and verbally. At one point, he almost threw a liquefied petroleum gas [LPG] tank at her; he also slapped and chased her with a bolo when he would come home drunk. He even threatened to chop her body into pieces. One day, she left their residence and went to xxxxxxxxxxx, Benguet to work; she left petitioner with their daughter, AAA.[14]

In 2010, petitioner and AAA followed CCC in xxxxxxxxxxx, Benguet. There, she and petitioner agreed on AAAs custody. However, whenever AAA was in her custody, petitioner would often cause trouble in her boarding house. He would forcibly open the door of the boarding house, or utter abusive words.[15]

In 2012, petitioner went to CCCs boarding house to ask for money and convince her that they get back together; she refused. One day, AAA told CCC that petitioner sexually abused her; the first incident happened when she was about seven years old. According to AAA, every time petitioner got drunk, he would make her hold his penis and touch her vagina. Later, they went to the police station where CCC informed Police Officer II Dexter Gosgos (PO2 Gosgos) that petitioner was ""creating trouble"" in the boarding house. PO2 Gosgos then invited petitioner to the police station for investigation.[16]

Meanwhile, AAA narrated that when her parents separated, she and petitioner stayed in xxxxxxxxxxx, Benguet. In March 2012, petitioner touched her vagina while she was in bed. Sometimes, he would pull her hands and made her touch his penis. One time, petitioner slapped her when she did not reveal where her mother, CCC was staying.[17]

On June 12, 2012, Dr. Michelle Payagen (Dr. Payagen) conducted a physical examination on AAA and observed swelling on her right cheek. According to Dr. Payagen, the swelling could have been secondary to injury or caused by trauma by a blunt force.[18]

Despite the opportunity, petitioner failed to secure the services of a lawyer and present his own evidence.[19]","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] filed by BBB255466 (petitioner) which assails the Decision[2] dated March 3, 2020, and the Resolution[3] dated January 8, 2021, of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR No. 41234 that affirmed with modification as to the penalty the Decision[4] dated December 21, 2017, of Branch xxxxxxxxxxx, Regional Trial Court (RTC), xxxxxxxxxxx, Benguet in Criminal Case Nos. 12-CR-8989 and 12-CR-8990.

In Criminal Case No. 12-CR-8989, the CA found petitioner guilty of psychological violence committed against women and/or children under Section 5(i)[5] of Republic Act No. 9262.[6]

In Criminal Case No. 12-CR-8990, the CA found petitioner guilty of Acts of Lasciviousness under Article 336,[7] of the Revised Penal Code in relation to Article III, Section 5(b) of Republic Act No. 7610.[8]","The Petition is without merit.

At the outset, it is well-settled that only questions of law should be raised in petitions for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. The Court is not a trier of facts. It will not entertain questions of fact considering that the factual findings of lower courts are deemed final, binding, and conclusive when supported by substantial evidence.[31] Questions of fact include the review of the truthfulness or falsity of the parties' allegations, or the correctness of the lower court's appreciation of the evidence presented.[32]

In any case, all the arguments raised are a mere rehash of petitioner's arguments before the CA that had been carefully considered and found without merit. The Court finds no cogent reason to disturb the factual findings of the RTC and the CA.

DUREZA, IN HIS CAPACITY AS SECRETARY OF THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENTIAL ADVISER ON THE PEACE PROCESS; BANGSAMORO TRANSITION COMMISSION; AND MORO ISLAMIC LIBERATION FRONT, RESPONDENTS.","In the September 9, 2024 Decision, this Court denied the consolidated Petitions seeking to declare as unconstitutional the Bangsamoro Organic Law and prevent the conduct of a plebiscite to ratify it. Unanimously declaring the inclusion of the Province of Sulu in BARMM as unconstitutional, this Court upheld the validity of the remaining provisions of the statute.

The dispositive portion of the assailed Decision reads:
ACCORDINGLY, the application for the issuance of a temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction in G.R. Nos. 242255 and 243246, and the Motion for Inhibition in G.R. No. 243246 are DENIED for lack of merit.

The Petition in G.R. No. 242255 is PARTIALLY GRANTED. Republic Act No. 11054, in so far as it includes petitioner Province of Sulu in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, is declared VOID for being UNCONSTITUTIONAL. The Province of Sulu shall not be part of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.

The remaining provisions of Republic Act No. 11054, otherwise known as the Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, based on the challenges raised in these petitions, are NOT UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

This Decision is immediately executory.","The result of the plebiscite is clear. The people of Sulu voted against ratifying the Bangsamoro Organic Law. This Court cannot override the will of the people expressed through the votes cast. It cannot trivialize that reality.

The creation of an autonomous region must be based on the independent will of the people in each province or city, honoring their choice rather than imposing the collective decision of others. To treat the entire autonomous region as one geographic area not only overrides the right of each province and city for self-determination, but also undermines the distinct historical, cultural, and political characteristics that make them Bangsamoro.

This Court resolves the Motions for Partial Reconsideration seeking to reverse and set aside the September 9, 2024 En Banc Decision[1] in so far as it voids the inclusion of petitioner Province of Sulu in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) created by Republic Act No. 11054, also known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law.","The Court was not confronted with the proper interpretation of history. Rather, it was confronted with the results of a plebiscite that was a product of that history. It was a plebiscite that also made history.

In arriving at its conclusions, nowhere did this Court denigrate, diminish nor marginalize the contribution of the Tausug of Sulu. Rather, it recognizes their collective voice of self-determination expressed through the plebiscite.

Every revolution must eventually contend with being able to convince all its people of the political arrangements it wins. After all, the essence of every democratic uprising is to empower its people. Even revolutionaries must eventually respect the results of a free, fair, and honest plebiscite or election.

The claim that BARMM is not BARMM without Sulu oversimplifies the Bangsamoro identity to a single thread, overlooking the many voices that collectively define the region. The Bangsamoro Autonomous Region is a vibrant tapestry of diverse ethnic communities and indigenous peoples, each contributing to its unique identity. While the Province of Sulu has its place in the history of the Bangsamoro struggle, BARMM also represents the interests of other groups in the region. The exclusion of the Province of Sulu, based on its own people's vote, does not erase the Bangsamoro identity, but rather, reinforces the need for an autonomous region that respects the democratic choices of its diverse constituencies.

Not being part of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region does not reduce the identity of the Tausug as Bangsamoro as much as a Filipino's choice to reside abroad does not diminish their Filipino identity. It simply is a choice not to join the current political arrangement. Should the Tausugs in Sulu wish to rejoin, there are peaceful, legal processes allowed by the Constitution for them to do so.

As to claims that the Court decided without understanding the context of the people of Mindanao, we remind them:

It is this Supreme Court that has sought ways and means to recognize Shari'ah. It is this Supreme Court that visited the Province of Tawi-Tawi and paid respects to the first mosque established in our country, the Sheikh Karimul Makhdum Mosque in Tubig Indangan, Simunul. It is this Supreme Court that entered ground zero in the Islamic City of Marawi during the pandemic. It is also this Supreme Court that has taken over the special Shari'ah bar examinations, introducing reforms to start integrating Shari'ah practice into the legal profession. It is this Supreme Court that included Shari'ah and inclusivity of all in its goal to achieve access to justice as articulated in the Strategic Plan for Judicial Innovations 2022-2027.

The unanimous decision of this Court is a challenge to the leaders of the Bangsamoro. It is a challenge as well to those who insist in a dogmatic reading of what identity means for all peoples. Reforms must occur while accepting the dynamism of the Constitution. Lobbying for better laws, better administration in the autonomous region, better institutions, and further integration of Shari'ah into our legal system may cause a lot of debate but they can be done patiently and peacefully.

Insisting on a static interpretation of history is not the clear path to a just and lasting peace. Accepting the self-determined will of a people in a plebiscite required by the Constitution will.","ACCORDINGLY, the Motions for Partial Reconsideration of the following are DENIED with FINALITY for lack of merit:

"G.R. No. 263811, November 26, 2024","COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, PETITIONER, VS. FORT 1 GLOBAL CITY CENTER, INC., RESPONDENT.","For the taxable year 2009, the BIR issued a Preliminary Assessment Notice[6] (PAN) dated January 24, 2012, finding FGCCI liable for deficiency income tax, value-added tax (VAT), withholding tax (WT), and documentary stamp tax (DST). FGCCI contested these findings, but the BIR issued a Final Assessment Notice[7] (FAN) as a response. After FGCCI filed its protest to the FAN,[8] the BIR issued a Final Decision on Disputed Assessment[9] (FDDA) dated October 13, 2016, informing FGCCI that it is liable to pay deficiency taxes amounting to PHP 1,598,860,663.45 for the taxable year 2009.

On the other hand, for the taxable year 2012, the BIR issued a PAN[10] dated February 3, 2016, and a FAN[11] dated March 15, 2016, for deficiency income tax and VAT totaling PHP 134,099,378.74. FGCCI filed its protest to the FAN on April 1, 2016, but the BIR did not act on the protest.

Hence, FGCCI filed two separate Petitions for Review on Certiorari before the CTA to question: (a) the CIR's inaction to its protest for the taxable year 2012 and (b) the FDDA for the taxable year 2009. The two cases were eventually consolidated.[12]

FGCCI argued that the assessments were invalid because the notices were served to the wrong address. Specifically, the Letter of Authority (LOA), PAN, FAN, and FDDA for the taxable year 2009 were delivered to 30th Street, Bonifacio Blvd., Global City, Taguig,[13] while the LOA, PAN, and FAN for the taxable year 2012 were served at 32nd Street, comer Boni Avenue.[14] However, the principal address of FGCCI in its 2016 General Information Sheet (GIS) is Unit 2C-B, FPS Building, 1st Avenue, comer 30th Street, Global City, Taguig.[15] According to FGCCI, it got copies of the BIR notices because an uninterested third person received them and informed FGCCI. FGCCI added that the BIR notices were not served on persons authorized by FGCCI. In their testimony before the CTA, the Revenue Officers failed to identify the position or affiliation of the persons to whom the letters and assessments were served.

For his part, the CIR alleged that the LOA, PAN, and FAN for taxable years 2009 and 2012 were properly served to FGCCI, as evidenced by the ""stamped received"" annotation on BIR's copies.[16] Besides, even assuming that these documents were served to the wrong address and persons, FGCCI is deemed to have received them because it responded and duly protested the assessments.[17]","In this petition,[1] the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) seeks to reverse and set aside the Decision[2] dated November 10, 2021, and Resolution[3] dated October 7, 2022, of the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) En Banc in CTA EB No. 2233 that affirmed the CTA 2nd Division Decision[4] dated September 24, 2019 and Resolution[5] dated January 23, 2020 in CTA Case Nos. 9490 and 9503. The CTA cancelled the deficiency tax assessments issued by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) against Fort 1 Global City Center, Inc. (FGCCI) for taxable years 2009 and 2012 on the ground of void assessment as FGCCI did not receive the assessment notices.","Preliminarily, We discuss the procedural lapse that occurred in this case.
 
The CIR admits that it has filed the present petition out of time – one day after the deadline.[38] The late filing was due to heavy work and close proximity of due dates. Yet, a heavy workload is relative and often self-­serving.[39] A heavy workload, standing alone, is hardly a compelling or meritorious reason to allow extensions of time to file pleadings.[40] Besides, We have consistently held that the need to comply with reglementary periods to file appeals is an adjunct of the basic principle that the right to appeal is merely vested by statute. Thus, anyone who appeals must diligently comply with the governing rules.[41] This Court has not shied away from dismissing appeals and petitions non-observant of the Rules of Court.[42]

The rule, however, is not without exception. Procedural rules are merely designed to facilitate the proper adjudication of cases. If the rigid application of the rules of procedure tends to obstruct the dispensation of justice, they can be relaxed.[43]

After carefully reviewing the facts and law of the case and considering the amount of deficiency taxes involved, which, when collected, will devolve into the government's coffers, We deem it proper to take cognizance of the present case. We held in Thenamaris Philippines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals:[44]
[W]e recognized that although procedural rules ought to be strictly enforced by courts in order to impart stability in the legal system, we have, nonetheless, relaxed the rigid application of the rules of procedure in several cases to afford the parties the opportunity to fully ventilate their cases on the merits. This is because the ends of justice would be better served if the parties were given the chance to argue their causes and defenses. We are likewise constantly reminded that the general objective of procedure is to facilitate the application of justice to the opposing claims of the competing parties and always be guided by the principle that procedure must not hinder but, rather, promote the administration of justice.[45]
However, the Petition must still be denied. ","ACCORDINGLY, the petition is DISMISSED. The Court of Tax Appeals En Banc Decision dated November 10, 2021 and Resolution dated October 7, 2022 in Court of Tax Appeals En Banc No. 2233 are AFFIRMED. The deficiency tax assessments issued against Fort 1 Global City Center, Inc., for taxable years 2009 and 2012 are declared VOID and CANCELLED."

CONTRARY TO LAW.[5]
Upon arraignment, Scully and Alvarez pleaded not guilty to the charges.[6]

Pre-trial subsequently ensued. During the pre-trial, Scully and Alvarez admitted that they were the people named and charged in the Informations. However, they both denied their respective aliases. Additionally, the prosecution produced the certificates of live birth of the two minor victims, but the defense denied their minority, and remarked that the birth certificates were belatedly registered. Further, the defense denied that Scully and Alvarez were in xxxxxxxxxxxxxx during the alleged dates of the crimes.[7]

Trial on the merits commenced.

To establish Scully and Alvarez's guilt, the prosecution presented the two victims, AAA270174 and BBB270174, Social Worker Rosevic Alisbo (RSW Alisbo), Center Social Worker Katherine Callanta (CSW Callanta), Police Officer II Barcy Gaabucayan (PO2 Gaabucayan), Police Officer I Jennifer Husayan (PO1 Husayan), PO1 Madonna Dayo (PO1 Dayo), Dr. Sarah Pingol (Dr. Pingol), and Dr. Rosemarie Gunato (Dr. Gunato).

The records show that on September 19, 2014, AAA270174 and BBB270174 (collectively, girls) were in a mall in xxxxxxxxxxx when Alvarez approached them. She asked the victims if they knew a certain Analin, but they responded in the negative.[8]

AAA270174 and BBB270174 went to another mall. Alvarez followed them, and asked them if they were hungry, but the girls did not reply. Alvarez, however, still bought them hotdogs, which they ate. Afterwards, Alvarez coaxed the girls to come with her on the pretext that she will provide them with their needs and wants. Consequently, the girls eventually agreed. Thus, Alvarez immediately flagged down a taxi, which she and the girls boarded.[9]

Upon arriving at a house in xxxxxxx Subdivision, AAA270174 and BBB270174 saw an almost naked Scully busy on his laptop. Upon seeing them, Scully introduced himself to the girls, and asked for their names.[10]

Alvarez, however, immediately instructed them to undress. The girls initially refused, but Alvarez insisted that whoever was older should remove their clothes first. After much prodding, AAA270174 and BBB270174 reluctantly removed their dresses and their underwear. Alvarez then proceeded to feed the girls some snacks, and even bathed them. Afterwards, both Scully and Alvarez instructed AAA270174 and BBB270174 to remove their towels and spread their legs, while they took photos.[11]

On the evening of September 19, 2024, Scully gave AAA270174 and BBB270174 some biscuits and alcoholic beverages. The girls managed to drink several bottles each, making them drunk and disoriented.[12] BBB270174 even ended up vomiting.[13]

AAA270174 and BBB270174 promptly fell asleep. However, they woke up to discover that Scully and Alvarez were bounding and gagging them with the use of cloth and rope. The girls were then stripped naked with chains around their neck, while Scully and Alvarez also took photos of them. AAA270174 and BBB270174 were eventually untied, and Scully and Alvarez instructed them to watch a pornographic film.[14]

On September 20, 2014, Alvarez instructed AAA270174 and BBB270174 to dig a hole on the ground floor of the house with the use of a shovel, all while the girls were still naked with chains around their necks. This digging occurred every morning until the girls' escape on September 23, 2014.[15]

In the evening of the same day, AAA270174 and BBB270174 were again stripped naked by Scully and Alvarez, and they took pictures of the girls. Alvarez then tied BBB270174's hands and feet on the bed, in a position that spread her legs apart. AAA270174 was then told to pour oil all over her body. Alvarez then instructed AAA270174 to lick BBB270174's vagina. AAA270174 initially refused, but Alvarez pushed her. Scully likewise licked BBB270174's vagina. When BBB270174 was untied, AAA270174 was then instructed that it was her turn to be tied and bound, with her legs apart. Alvarez also instructed BBB270174 to lick AAA270174's vagina.[16]

Alvarez gave the girls further instructions to perform oral sex on Scully. Further, they were taught to perform sexy poses and ordered to spread their legs apart, while Scully and Alvarez recorded the explicit acts.[17]

After the ordeal, Scully and Alvarez had sex with each other in front of AAA270174 and BBB270174, while the girls recorded them. During their sexual intercourse, Scully directed AAA270174 to sit on his face, so he can lick her vagina while having sex with Alvarez. AAA270174 did as she was told and BBB270174 held the camera and took the video.[18]

On September 21, 2014, AAA270174 and BBB270174 were made to wear bras with foam and t-back panties. Alvarez applied make up on them and ordered them to dance while she took a video of them. She instructed them to spread their legs apart as she took photos of their genitalia. She also commanded them to turn around so that she could take photos of their buttocks. Scully likewise took their photos while he was naked.[19]

After the photoshoot, Scully and Alvarez instructed AAA270174 and BBB270174 to play a game using an eggplant tied to the chains around their necks and an egg. The tip of the chain was connected to the eggplant and the egg was on the floor. The girls were made to push the egg on the floor using the eggplant, and to push the egg towards the finish line. They had to push the egg for a distance of about three meters, while Scully and Alvarez were cheering and laughing.[20]

At night, AAA270174 and BBB270174 were made to watch pornography again. BBB270174, who was beside Scully and Alvarez on the bed, was ordered to suck Scully's penis. Scully then took BBB270174's hand and inserted it in Alvarez's vagina, while BBB270174 made a slow push and pull motion. Unsatisfied, Scully inserted BBB270174's entire arm and commanded her to speed up the push and pull motions. BBB270174 was then told to lick Alvarez's vagina, which she did despite her disgust. Scully then inserted his fingers into Alvarez's vagina.[21]

On September 22, 2014, AAA270174 and BBB270174 were again made to watch pornography while naked. This time, it was AAA270174 who was beside Scully and Alvarez. While on the bed, Scully began touching AAA270174, and inserted his thumb, and then his four fingers into the latter's vagina. AAA270174 cried and screamed for help, but to no avail because Alvarez pinned her down. Alvarez further instructed BBB270174 to hold AAA270174 down, which she obeyed out of fear. Thus, despite AAA270174's protests, Scully continued inserting his fingers in and out of her vagina while she sobbed. To lessen the noise, Alvarez took a pillow and placed it on AAA270174's face. The girls were then directed to perform oral sex on Scully's penis.[22]

Throughout these days, there were several instances when Scully and Alvarez had sex in front of AAA270174 and BBB270174. They often made the girls watch and even instructed them to take videos.[23]

On September 23, 2014, Scully and Alvarez placed the girls inside a room and left the house. Consequently, AAA270174 and BBB270174 were able to check the kitchen door. The girls realized that it was not locked. Thus, they were able to escape the house by carefully passing Scully and Alvarez's dog and then climbing the fence. The girls successfully escaped, and they were able to reach AAA270174's sister and father, who saw them wearing provocative clothing with chains around their neck. Thus, they were immediately brought to the police station.[24]

While at the police station, AAA270174 and BBB270174 were interviewed. They were able to pinpoint the house where they were held captive. Upon their arrival near the location of the house, the police officers waited for Scully and Alvarez's arrival. A taxi stopped near the house and the girls were able to positively identify Alvarez.[25] Immediately, PO2 Gaabucayan[26] and PO1 Husayan[27] arrested Alvarez.

The police then brought AAA270174 and BBB270174 to continue their interview with the assistance of social workers. The girls were then assisted by PO1 Dayo and brought to the xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Medical Center (xxxxxxxx) for medical examination.[28]

Dr. Fatmah B. Mangondato of the xxxxxx conducted the girls' medical examination and issued corresponding Living Case Reports. AAA270174's genital examination showed that there was ""6 o'clock and 9 o'clock erythematous hymenal laceration"" and there was redness and trauma on the vaginal hymen. BBB270174's genital examination, on the other hand, revealed ""erythamatous intact hymen,"" which means that there was redness in the tissue of her hymen, which was, however, intact.[29]

AAA270174 and BBB270174 underwent psychological counseling. Dr. Gonato, the psychologist who monitored the girls for several years, noted that both of them continued to show signs of trauma, such as forms of flashbacks, discontinued sleeping, loss of appetite, loss of interest in activities, fearfulness, and sadness.[30]","This Court resolves the Appeal[1] filed by Peter Gerald Scully a.k.a. ""Peter Russell"" a.k.a ""Peter Riddel"" (Scully) and Carme Ann Alvarez a.k.a. ""Honey Sweet"" a.k.a. ""Sweet Sweet"" (Alvarez) assailing the Decision[2] of the Court of Appeals (CA), which affirmed the Decision[3] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) that found them guilty beyond reasonable doubt of qualified trafficking in persons.

Scully and Alvarez were charged with the crimes of qualified trafficking of persons and five counts of rape by sexual assault. The cases were filed in 2014. However, the Hall of Justice in xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx was ravaged by fire. Thus, the records of the case had to be reconstituted. The accusatory portion of the reproduced Information reads:
[FC CRIMINAL CASE NO. 2014-471-R]","Preliminarily, accused-appellants bewail that the RTC violated their constitutional right to be heard when they were unable to present their defenses to the charges against them. Further, they cry foul over the fact that their lawyer was prohibited to present on the additional dates set by the RTC for the prosecution to present its witnesses. They also assail the fact that the prosecution was given a chance to conduct a marathon hearing on dates that were not agreed upon during the pre-trial, despite their manifestation that they do not have any legal representation willing to defend their cause.[37]

Accused-appellants attribute their failure to present their defense due to the negligence of their counsel and emphasize their constitutional right to competent and independent counsel during the trial. They argue that the actions of their previous counsels constituted such wanton, palpable, and gross negligence that resulted to the deprivation of their right to be heard and their right to a competent counsel.[38]

Time and again, jurisprudence has emphasized the general rule that a client is bound by the acts, even mistakes of his counsel in the realm of procedural technique. The exception to this rule is when the negligence of the counsel is so gross, reckless, and inexcusable that the client is deprived of their day in court.[39]

As correctly found by the CA, and as extensively discussed in the RTC Decision, the RTC was mindful of accused-appellants' right to due process and right to counsel. This Court takes note of the following excerpt from the RTC Decision, as echoed by the CA Decision:
To put the history of these cases in proper perspective, a narration of the factual events in respect of the hearings of these cases is imperative.

. . . .

When these cases were called on May 6, 2015, accused Carme Ann Alvarez was represented by Atty. Jonathan Hilarion Maagad of the Public Attorney's Office. Accused Scully, however, appeared without counsel, and he said that he had already hired lawyers but they were unable to appear on that day. The cases[,] therefore[,] were set for his arraignment on June 2, 2015.

Accused Alvarez was already arraigned prior to the fire on January 30, 2015 that burned the Hall of Justice of xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx including the records of the cases.

When these cases were called on June 2, 2015 for his arraignment, Scully said to the court that he had engaged the services of Attys. Boycillo and Gumahad[, but] said counsels[,] however[,] were not present in court. This court[,] thus[,] reset the arraignment on June 16, 2015, and informed Scully that if on said date he would still have no counsel, the court would appoint a counsel for him.

On June 16, 2015, Scully was arraigned in these six (6) cases with the assistance of Atty. Alejandro Jose C. Pallugna, and he pleaded not guilty to all of them. On said date[,] accused Alvarez was re-arraigned with the assistance of Atty. Maagad, and she pleaded not guilty to all the cases.

On June 24, 2015, Atty. Alejandrino Jose C. Pallugna, as counsel for Scully[,] filed [an] Urgent Motion to Declare the [a]ccused Peter Scully Not the Most Guilty of the Offenses Charged, and Qualified to be Discharged as a State Witness. The prosecution vehemently objected to the foregoing motion and Atty. Maagad, counsel for Alvarez, also opposed the motion. . . . This court denied Scully's motion in an [O]rder dated August 17, 2015[.]

. . . .

When the cases were called for [Pre-Trial Conference] on August 18, 2015, Atty. Pallugna as counsel for Scully, and Atty. Maagad as counsel for Alvarez manifested in open court that their clients wanted that the Judicial Affidavit Rule be applied in these cases. Because of these manifestations, the court reset the pre-trial conference and ordered the parties to submit the affidavits of the accused and their witnesses within the prescribed period. The pre-trial conference was [reset] on September 24, 2015.

On September 23, 2015, Atty. Pallugna filed [an] Urgent Motion for Production and Examination of Object Evidence from the Prosecution with Prayer for Extension of Time to File Judicial Affidavits of Defense Witnesses. Atty. Maagad also filed [a] Motion for [E]xtension to [F]ile [J]udicial [A]ffidavits of Alvarez. Considering these motions, the court [reset] the pre-trial conference on November 24, 2015.

When these cases were called on November 24, 2015, Atty. Maagad withdrew his appearance as counsel for Alvarez. Afterwards, Atty. Pallugna entered his appearance as counsel for Alvarez. Atty. Pallugna was now counsel for Scully and Alvarez. Atty. Pallugna then moved that the pre-trial conference be postponed on the ground that he [still had] to prepare the affidavits of Alvarez and her witnesses. The prosecution objected saying that the accused were engaging in dilatory tactics. This court, however, to avoid any charge of miscarriage of justice, granted the motion, and reset the pre-trial conference on December 8, 2015.

When these cases were called on December 8, 2015, this court received from Atty. Pallugna his motion to postpone the hearing moments before the cases were called. The ground was that Atty. Pallugna had a hearing in Branch 21, Santiago City, Isabela. The prosecution opposed the motion. The court issued an [O]rder dated December 8, 2015 requiring Atty. Pallugna to explain in writing why he should not be cited for contempt of court for his failure to appear at the pre-trial conference. The pre-trial conference was reset on December 16, 2015 and the two accused were ordered to hire another lawyer, and they were informed that the pre-trial would proceed with or without their counsels.

When these cases were called on December 16, 2015, Atty. Pallugna was present, but accused Scully and Alvarez were not present. Atty. Pallugna said that Scully was sick. With respect to Alvarez, there was no information why she was not present Atty. Pallugna moved that the pre-trial conference be postponed on the ground that accused Scully was sick. The public prosecutors objected because it was their impression that [the] accused were delaying the cases. To obviate any accusation that the accused were denied due process, the court granted the motion, but it required Scully to submit to the court a medical certificate showing that he was so sick that he could not appear at the hearing. . . . The pre-trial was then set on March 2, 2016.

. . . .

Before March 2, 2016, specifically on February 23, 2016, instead of filing the affidavits, Atty. Pallugna filed [a] Motion to Withdraw as Counsel for [defendant Peter Gerard Scully praying that he be allowed to withdraw as counsel for Scully and Alvarez on the ground of irreconcilable differences. When these case were called on March 2, 2016, this court asked Scully and Alvarez regarding the withdrawal of Atty. Pallugna, and they confirmed the same and they expressed their conformity. The prosecution manifested that the withdrawal of the counsel would delay the cases. This court, to avoid any complaint of denial of due process, allowed the two accused to hire another lawyer, and thus postponed the hearing. The court in its [O]rder issued on March 2, 2016 [and] granted Atty. Pallugna's motion to withdraw but warned the accused that if the new counsel of the accused would not be present at the hearing on May 11, 2016, the court would proceed with the pre-trial conference.

Before May 11, 2016, however, specifically on May 4, 2016, Atty. Pallugna, to the amazement of the court, filed [an] [E]ntry of Appearance as Collaborating Counsels for Accused Peter Gerald Scully and Carme Ann Alvarez. When these cases were called on May 11, 2016, Attys. Enrique Malicay and Ernesto Bongado, Jr. entered their appearances as counsels for Scully and Alvarez. On the other hand, Atty. Jerome Jarales entered his appearance as collaborating counsel for Alvarez. [Understandably], the court was confused. When Atty. Pallugna entered or re-entered his appearance as collaborating counsel for the two accused, the accused had no counsel yet, so with whom was Atty. Pallugna collaborating[.]

On June 10, 2016, Atty. Malicay filed [a] Motion to Withdraw praying that he be allowed to withdraw his appearance as counsel of Scully.

When these cases were called for pre-trial conference on June 27, 2016, accused Scully and Alvarez were present. Attys. Gumahad, Bongado, and Phillip Nelson Carpio entered their appearances as counsel for Scully and Alvarez. Accused [A]lvarez stated [in] open court that her counsels were the same as the counsels of Scully. Alvarez said that Atty. Jarales was not her counsel. She[,] therefore[,] was deemed to have terminated the services of Atty. Jarales. The pre-trial conference] was held. The [O]rder issued after the conference stated, among others, that the prosecution would call to the witness chair the two minor offended parties, namely, [BBB270174] and [AAA270174]. Also the prosecution and the defense agreed, upon the insistence of the new counsels of the accused, that the rule on judicial affidavit would no longer govern the trial of the cases. . . . The court then set the cases for trial for the reception of the prosecution's evidence. Several dates were agreed upon.

When these cases were called for the reception of its evidence on September 20, 2016, the prosecution called to the witness stand Rosevic Alisbo. When the direct examination was finished, it was already 12:00 o'clock noon[sic]. The defense moved that the trial be reset for the cross-examination of the witness because the cross would be long. The court reset the trial.

On October 2, 2016, Atty. Ernesto N. Bongado, Jr. filed [a] Motion to Withdraw Appearance as Counsel praying that he be relieved as one of the counsels for Scully and Alvarez.

When these cases were called on November 22, 2016, for the cross examination of prosecution witness Alisbo, another counsel, Atty. Bember Apepe entered his appearance as collaborating counsel of the two accused. The counsels of the two accused agreed that Atty. Apepe would be the lead counsel in the trial of these cases. The defense cross examined Alisbo, and after the examination, the counsels agreed to call these cases again on December 13, 2016, as previously agreed upon, for the continuation of prosecution's evidence.

When these cases were called on December 13, 2016, the prosecution . . . was ready to call to the witness chair one of the two minor offended parties, namely, [AAA270174]. The defense counsels were agitated and objected to the presentation of [AAA270174] because they claimed that the agreement was that the prosecution would call to the witness chair the other minor offended party, namely, [BBB270174]. The defense counsels argued that they were prepared for trial in respect of [BBB270174] but not [AAA270174]. If [AAA270174] would be allowed to testify, the defense counsels said that it would be a case of ""ambush"" as there were not prepared for trial with respect of [AAA270174]. . . . To [obviate] any complaint of railroading the trial and violation of due process, the court did not proceed with the trial, but the court set the cases for trial the following day, i. e., on October 4, 2016.

At today's trial, the minor offended party, [AAA270174], testified on direct examination. Accused Alvarez and Scully were present. The three counsels mentioned above, namely, Attys. Apepe, Gumahad, and Carpio, were present. The private offended party finished her direct testimony. The accused is warned that the trial scheduled after this date will proceed with or without their counsel. Place on record that the counsels of the accused stated that the termination of their services includes all cases involving the two accused. . . . However, as stated above, the court informed the counsels that they would continue as counsels for Scully and Alvarez until these two accused could hire another lawyer.

WHEREFORE, let these . . . cases be set for the cross-examination by the defense of witness, [AAA270174], on January 16, 2017 at 8:30 in the morning. The prosecution is ordered to present its other witnesses on January 17, 18, and 19, 2017 at 8:30 in the morning. Accused Scully and Alvarez are ordered to hire the services of another lawyer prior to the said dates. The accused and Attys. Apepe, Gumahad, and Carpio are informed in open court that the TSN of the direct testimony of [AAA270174] will be available before January 16, 2017, and they are ordered to obtain their copies of the TSN before said date so that they cannot use as an excuse for the postponement of the cross-examination the non-availability of the TSN. The parties are warned that the court will not anymore allow the postponement of the trial.

The dates agreed upon by the prosecution and the defense stated in the pre-trial order of this Court dated June 27, 2016 for the reception of prosecution's evidence shall remain as additional dates. Attys. Apepe, Gumahad, and Carpio are ordered to represent Scully and Alvarez and said lawyers are hereby reminded of their duties as lawyers. The accused are hereby informed that the trial of these six cases will proceed on January 16, 17, 18, and 19, 2017 even if they will not or cannot hire new lawyer or lawyers.

. . . .

[T]he other minor offended party, [BBB270174], was scheduled to testify on January 31, 2017. This date was agreed upon during the pre-trial conference on June 27, 2016, and was stated in the pre-trial order also dated June 27, 2016. The prosecution called to the witness stand [BBB270174]. After her direct examination, the court asked the two accused whether they want to cross-examine the witness. The[y] said that they wanted to cross-examine the witness, but they had no counsel. To give the accused time to look for lawyer so they could cross-examine the minor, this court scheduled the trial for the cross-examination of the minor on February 14, 2017[.]

. . . .

[W]hen these cases were called on February 14, 2017 for the cross-examination of [BBB270174] by the accused, Atty. Pallugna . . . entered his appearance as counsel of the two accused. The record shows that this is the third time that he entered and re-entered his appearance as counsel of the accused. Instead of conducting cross-examination of the minor witness, Atty. Pallugna orally moved to inhibit the presiding judge. The cross-examination was necessarily postponed. The motion has the effect of delaying the proceeding in these cases. The strategy to delay is not unobvious.

. . . .

Because the Motion for Reconsideration of the [O]rder denying the [M]otion for [I]nhibition was denied, the defense filed [a] Petition for Certiorari with the Court of Appeals on March 27, 2017. . . . and since there was no restraining order issued by the appellate court ten days after the Petition for Certiorari was filed, this court continued in the trial of these cases. These cases were then called for trial on April 18, 2017 for the purpose of the cross-examination of the minor offended party, [BBB270174], Atty. Pallugna filed motion for the postponement of the trial scheduled on the said date. This court in an order issued on the same day denied the motion and deemed the defense to have waived its right to cross-examine the minor offended party.

The prosecution then continued presenting its witnesses. It called to the witness chair PO1 Madona Dayo on May 23, 2017; PO1 Madona Lutian Dayo on May 30, 2017; Dr. Fatmah B. Mangondato, and SPO2 Elaine Sagario on June 20, 2017; and Rosemarie Gomato on June 27, 2017. Atty. Pallugna was present as counsel of Scully and Alvarez during these trials.

. . . .

This court then set these cases for the reception of the evidence for the defense on August 22, and 29, 2017 in an order dated June 27, 2017. Atty. Pallugna filed urgent motion for postponement of the trial on August 22, 2017, which was denied. Considering however that these cases were also scheduled for the reception of defense evidence on August 29, 2017 and September 5, 2017, this court scheduled these cases for trial on said dates with a warning that if Atty. Pallugna would be absent on said dates, this court would appoint a lawyer from the Public Attorney's Office to represent Scully and Alvarez. When these cases were called on August 29, 2017, Atty. Pallugna appeared in court but moved for the postponement of the trial on the ground that he was not prepared. This court denied the motion in the [O]rder dated August 29, 2017. When these cases were called on September 5, 2017, Atty. Pallugna was present, but he moved for the postponement of the trial on the ground stated in open court. The motion was denied in an [O]rder dated September 5, 2017. In the said [O]rder of September 5, 2017, the defense was deemed to have waived its right to adduce evidence, and it was ordered to submit its offer of exhibits within ten days. The records do not show that the defense filed its offer of exhibits.[40] (Emphasis supplied)
As can be inferred from the abovequoted portion of the RTC Decision, the defense caused several delays of the case for various reasons. In this case, the RTC need not have allowed the case to continually drag upon the defense's requests. As can be gleaned from the records, to avoid any charge of miscarriage of justice and denial of due process, the RTC liberally allowed accused-appellants and their counsels numerous postponements of the trial with sufficient appraisal of the schedule of hearing dates for their presentation of evidence. However, the hearings were repeatedly postponed at their instance. In view of the foregoing, the accused-appellants are deemed to have waived their right to present evidence, and the facts of this case do not constitute a deprivation of accused-appellant's constitutional rights.","ACCORDINGLY, the Appeal is DENIED. The March 30, 2022 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 02140-MIN is AFFIRMED. Accused-appellants Peter Gerald Scully a.k.a. ""Peter Russell"" a.k.a. ""Peter Riddel"" and Carme Ann Alvarez a.k.a. ""Honey Sweet"" a.k.a. ""Sweet Sweet"" are GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of qualified trafficking in persons under Section 4(a), in relation to Section 6(a), and penalized under Section 10(c) of Republic Act No. 9208, as amended by Republic Act No. 10364, and are SENTENCED to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and to each PAY a fine of PHP 5,000,000.00. Further, accused-appellants are ORDERED to PAY, jointly and severally, each of the minor victims, AAA270174 and BBB270174, PHP 500,000.00 as moral damages, and PHP 100,000.00 as exemplary damages, subject to a legal interest of 6% per annum from finality of this Decision until full payment."
"G.R. No. 251518, November 27, 2024","DEL MONTE LAND TRANSPORT BUS COMPANY, DON L. MORALES, AND EILEEN FLORES, PETITIONERS, VS. ROMEO M. JARANILLA, MARLON H. GUANTERO, AND JESUS B. DOMANAIS, RESPONDENTS.","Respondents filed consolidated complaints for illegal dismissal, full backwages, and reinstatement against petitioners. On November 25, 2013, Labor Arbiter Benedict G. Kato issued a Decision granting the complaints and ruled respondents were illegally dismissed. Petitioners appealed to the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC), which on April 23, 2014, reversed the Labor Arbiterâ€™s Decision and dismissed the complaints. Respondents moved for reconsideration; on October 31, 2014, the NLRC reinstated the Labor Arbiterâ€™s Decision. Petitioners filed a Petition for Certiorari with the Court of Appeals (CA) under CA-G.R. SP No. 138339. Pending resolution, respondents secured a Writ of Execution; petitioners partially paid judgment awards. On June 30, 2015, the CA granted petitionersâ€™ Petition for Certiorari, annulled the NLRCâ€™s October 31, 2014 Resolution, and reinstated the NLRCâ€™s April 23, 2014 Decision that respondents were legally dismissed. Respondents filed a Motion for Issuance of Alias Writ of Execution for reinstatement wages covering periods before and after the NLRCâ€™s reversal and reinstatement of the Labor Arbiter ruling. Labor Arbiter Irene Castro De Quiroz granted the motion on August 30, 2016, ordering reinstatement wages from November 25, 2013 to April 23, 2014, and from October 31, 2014 to June 30, 2015. Petitioners appealed to the NLRC, which on January 30, 2017, dismissed the appeal, affirming respondentsâ€™ entitlement to reinstatement wages for the specified periods. Petitionersâ€™ Motion for Reconsideration was denied. Petitioners filed a Petition for Certiorari with the CA, which on March 14, 2019, dismissed the petition and affirmed the NLRC decision.","The Supreme Court ruled that respondents are entitled to reinstatement wages for the entire period from November 25, 2013 (Labor Arbiter Decision) until June 30, 2015 (final reversal by the Court of Appeals). The Court modified the Labor Arbiter Order, NLRC, and CA rulings to include the period from April 23, 2014 to October 31, 2014 (when the NLRC had initially reversed the Labor Arbiter Decision but later reinstated it on reconsideration). The Court emphasized that the reinstatement aspect of the Labor Arbiterâ€™s Decision is immediately executory pending appeal, as supported by Article 229 of the Labor Code and relevant jurisprudence."," The instant petition is bereft of any merit.

In the instant petition, petitioners averred that the LA erred in granting the Motion for Issuance of Alias Writ of Execution considering that at the time of the filing thereof, respondents are no longer entitled to their accrued wages on account of the finality of the CA Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 138339, which declared respondents as legally dismissed.[32]

Petitioners likewise averred that they are entitled to restitution. They explained that while they admit that the LA's November 25, 2013 Decision is immediately executory, hence, respondents have the right to reinstatement, either actual or in payroll, such right ceased to have any legal effect when the NLRC reversed the LA Decision on April 23, 2014 They also insisted that the reinstatement by the NLRC of the LA Decision on reconsideration is no longer immediately executory. Accordingly, respondents are not entitled to reinstatement from October 31, 2014, when the NLRC reinstated the November 25, 2013 Decision of the LA until the same was reversed by the CA on June 30, 2015.[33]

The Court is not persuaded. ","ACCORDINGLY, in view of the foregoing premises, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED. The Court of Appeals Decision dated March 14, 2019, in CA-G.R. SP No. 151070 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. The Labor Arbiter's Order dated August 30, 2016 is MODIFIED in that respondents Romeo M. Jaranilla, Marlon H. Guantero, and Jesus B. Domanais are entitled to reinstatement wages from November 25, 2013 to June 30, 2015. Let an Alias Writ of Execution be ISSUED to such effect. "

OLASO III, LEA LIM-TIDMA, NERISSA S. OREJO, ZENAIDA CHIQUILLO, IVY OROLFO, RONNIE GOMEZ, AND GINA NUARIN, RESPONDENTS.","Spouses Kaw are the owners of a parcel of land located in Cagmanaba, Oas, Albay, with an area of 3,040 square meters designated as Lot F in Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-158628. The lot is covered by Tax Declaration No. 02-12-012-00000 with an assessed value of PHP 24,830.00. Spouses Kaw and Ivy Orolfo were dentists and colleagues. Orolfo introduced Spouses Kaw to the other respondents, who were interested in buying a portion of Lot F. In February 2014, Spouses Kaw, Orolfo, and respondents visited Lot F. Spouses Kaw informed respondents they were selling only the 2,000 square meter undetermined portion of Lot F (the subject property) for PHP 1,200,000.00. Respondents offered to purchase the subject property in two equal portions of 1,000 square meters at PHP 600,000.00 each, to be paid in two parts, with PHP 300,000.00 advance payment for each part and the balance payable in six months.

On March 10, 2014, the first Deed of Conditional Sale was executed between Spouses Kaw and Nodalo, Olaso III, Lim-Tidma, and Orejo, covering 1,000 square meters of the subject property for PHP 600,000.00. On March 29, 2014, a second Deed of Conditional Sale, with similar provisions, was executed between Spouses Kaw and Chiquillo, Orolfo, Gomez, and Nuarin. Spouses Kaw received PHP 265,000.00, while the remainder of PHP 35,000.00 was paid to Orolfo, who stated she acted as an agent and the PHP 35,000.00 was her commission.

The Deeds of Conditional Sale contained uniform provisions, including paragraph A, which allowed Spouses Kaw to unilaterally rescind the contracts if respondents violated any terms, and paragraph D, which prohibited respondents from assigning, transferring, conveying, or hypothecating their rights without prior written consent from Spouses Kaw.

In April 2014, Spouses Kaw visited the property and found cottages surrounded by a fence, concrete comfort room and irrigation pump, several cottage-like houses, a ""DIWATA IMACOTO BEACH RESORT"" signboard, and a destroyed padlock on Spouses Kaw's cottage. Spouses Kaw confronted Orolfo, who explained the fence was for protection.

Spouses Kaw filed a Complaint for Rescission of Contract with Prayer for Preliminary Injunction on September 29, 2015, docketed as Civil Case No. 2833 (Rescission Case). They alleged respondents violated the Deeds of Conditional Sale by converting the property into a beach resort and renting out cottages without prior written consent and by constructing permanent improvements, contrary to verbal agreements limiting improvements to temporary light materials.

Respondents denied violating the agreements and argued that operating a beach resort was not an assignment or transfer of rights and that there were no verbal agreements limiting improvements. They claimed Spouses Kaw were aware the property was for a beach resort business. Respondents counterclaimed for Spouses Kaw to accept payment of the balance price, execute deeds of absolute sale, surrender documents for title transfer, and pay moral damages and costs.

The Regional Trial Court (RTC) dismissed Spouses Kawâ€™s Complaint for Rescission for lack of merit. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the RTC decision with modification on the award of moral damages. Spouses Kaw filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari before the Supreme Court.","The Supreme Court denied the Petition for Review on Certiorari for lack of merit. The Court held that Spouses Kaw failed to establish valid grounds for rescission of the Deeds of Conditional Sale. The Court found that the Deeds of Conditional Sale were contracts to sell, not conditional sales, and rescission is only available for substantial and fundamental breaches, which Spouses Kaw failed to prove.","The Court ruled that the Complaint for Rescission filed by Spouses Kaw was properly dismissed for lack of merit. The Deeds of Conditional Sale are contracts to sell, and respondents did not commit fundamental breaches warranting rescission. The Parol Evidence Rule prevents reliance on alleged verbal agreements to alter written contracts.","WHEREFORE, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED. The Decision dated July 14,2021, and Resolution dated August 8, 2022, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 113795 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION in that:

The banana plant fell and struck Francisco De Los Santos, who was driving his motorcycle along the highway. Francisco fell from his motorcycle onto the cemented highway, suffered head injuries, and died on July 8, 1998, with the death certificate citing ""post-traumatic brain swelling"" and ""diffuse cerebral contusion"" as causes of death.

The heirs of Francisco filed a complaint for damages against Apolinario and Teresita, alleging negligence on Apolinarioâ€™s part for instructing Rico to cut the banana plant without taking necessary safety precautions. They claimed that the negligence of Rico and Apolinario was the proximate cause of Franciscoâ€™s injuries and death. The heirs sought damages for hospital and medical expenses, funeral expenses, loss of expected income as a member of the Sangguniang Bayan of Sta. Margarita, Samar, moral damages, exemplary damages, attorney's fees, and litigation expenses.

Elias Udjay testified that his son was near Apolinario and Rico during the incident. Edwin de los Santos, son of the deceased, testified about his fatherâ€™s membership in the Sangguniang Bayan. Rico, who was a witness but not a defendant, testified he was 15 years old at the time.

Teresita prayed for dismissal of the complaint against her, stating that Rico acted under Apolinarioâ€™s supervision. Apolinario denied liability, asserting he was not present at the time of the incident, was supervising another activity 10 meters away, and that the incident occurred on a Saturday during a community activity. He argued that if liable, only the teacher-in-charge should be held responsible and that Teresita should be liable for sending Rico without informing the school.

The trial court held Apolinario liable for damages, awarding PHP 428,880.00 for loss of earning capacity based on judicial notice of Franciscoâ€™s monthly salary as a Sangguniang Bayan member. The Court of Appeals affirmed negligence but deleted exemplary damages and attorneyâ€™s fees. Apolinarioâ€™s motion for reconsideration was denied, prompting this petition.","The Supreme Court affirmed the findings of the RTC and CA that the Deed of Sale was tampered with and is therefore void, and that Aquilino Ramos had no title or interest in the subject property to transfer ownership. The Court upheld the denial of petitionersâ€™ claim of ownership by prescription, noting their possession did not satisfy the requisites for extraordinary acquisitive prescription.

The Court noted procedural infirmities in the petitions, including lack of material dates and proof of service, and deficiencies in verification and certification of non-forum shopping. The Court also deleted the award of attorneyâ€™s fees based on prevailing jurisprudence, emphasizing that attorneyâ€™s fees are awarded only in specific instances under Article 2208 of the Civil Code.","The Court ruled that Apolinario is liable for damages due to negligence under quasi-delict for instructing and supervising the minor Rico who caused the injury and death of Francisco. Teresita is not liable as she was not a party and the child was under the schoolâ€™s custody. The award for loss of earning capacity was deleted due to lack of evidence, replaced with temperate damages. Other damages were affirmed.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is PARTLY GRANTED. The May 28, 2014 Decision and the June 24, 2015 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA G.R. CV No. 03433 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION.

Petitioner Gil Apolinario is ordered to pay respondent heirs of Francisco de los Santos the following: (a) PHP 250,000.00 as temperate damages; (b) PHP 50,000.00 as civil indemnity; (c) PHP 50,000.00 as moral damages; and (d) PHP 5,000.00 as litigation expenses. Interest at the rate of six percent per annum shall be imposed on all damages awarded from the finality of this Decision until fully paid.

PROSALITA BAGARES AND DANTON BAGARES, REPRESENTED BY PROSERFINA GALARRITA, RESPONDENTS.","Respondents alleged that on July 24, 1995, they purchased a 3,000-square meter parcel of land owned by the late Basilia Galarrita-Naguita, situated in Lanao, Alubijid, Misamis Oriental, identified as Lot No. 12020. This property was a portion of the 7,687-square meter landholdings of Basilia. Basilia also sold portions of Lot No. 12020 to the Local Government of Alubijid and to Prosalita. Subsequently, Aquilino Ramos filed a free patent application over the entire Lot No. 12020 before the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR). Respondents opposed the application, alleging that Aquilino tampered with the Deed of Sale he submitted by changing the lot number from 12019 to 12020. The Provincial Environment and Natural Resources Office (PENRO) denied the free patent filed by Aquilino.

Marilou, Benjamin, Elyer, and Lydia were buyers of portions of Lot No. 12020 from Aquilino. The dispute was brought to barangay conciliation but failed to settle. Petitioners argued their predecessor-in-interest did not tamper with the deed and maintained that after Aquilino bought the property, he and they lived on it until portions were sold.

The Regional Trial Court (RTC) ruled in favor of respondents, finding convincing proof that the Deed of Sale was tampered with. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the RTC decision, giving weight to the DENR findings and Aquilino's admission during barangay conciliation that he tampered with the deed. The CA also rejected petitionersâ€™ claim of ownership by prescription, ruling their adverse possession fell short of the requirements for extraordinary acquisitive prescription.

Petitioners filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari before the Supreme Court.","The Supreme Court affirmed the findings of the RTC and CA that the Deed of Sale was tampered with and is therefore void, and that Aquilino Ramos had no title or interest in the subject property to transfer ownership. The Court upheld the denial of petitionersâ€™ claim of ownership by prescription, noting their possession did not satisfy the requisites for extraordinary acquisitive prescription.","The Court denied the consolidated Petitions for Review on Certiorari. It ruled that the Deed of Sale is void due to tampering, petitioners failed to prove ownership by prescription, and procedural defects in the petitions warranted dismissal.

VS.
HARBOR STAR SHIPPING SERVICES, INC., RESPONDENT.","Harbor Star Shipping Services, Inc. (Harbor Star) is a domestic corporation engaged primarily in harbor assistance, towing services, salvage, repairs, dry dock, and related services to sea-going vessels. Captain Ramon R. Verga, Jr. (Verga) was a shareholder of Davao Tugboat and Allied Services, Inc. (DATASI) and Davtug Multi-Purpose Cooperative (DAVTUG), both operating in the same business sector as Harbor Star.

Between November 2006 and May 2008, Harbor Star sought to collaborate with DATASI despite being competitors, proposing various business arrangements including merger, partnership, and joint ventures. In the second half of 2008, Harbor Star persuaded Verga and two others to sell their shares in DATASI, with the understanding that after final audit and receipt of more than 50% of the agreed valuation, they would execute documents transferring their shares to Harbor Star.

From September 2008 to July 2009, Harbor Star made installment payments totaling PHP 4,000,000.00 to Verga. In 2012, Harbor Star discovered that Verga had divested his DATASI shares after receiving payments, making transfer impossible. Harbor Star filed a complaint on April 12, 2012, seeking the return of the PHP 4,000,000.00 paid.

Verga denied the existence of an oral contract to sell his DATASI and DAVTUG shares to Harbor Star. He alleged that the payments were incentives for his resignation from DATASI and DAVTUG, intended as a marketing strategy for Harbor Star. Verga also argued that Harbor Star lacked board approval for the transaction, violating Section 42 of the Corporation Code.

The Regional Trial Court (RTC) ruled in favor of Harbor Star, finding the oral contract valid and ordering Verga to return the PHP 4,000,000.00. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the RTC decision but reduced the attorneyâ€™s fees awarded to Harbor Star.","The Supreme Court denied Vergaâ€™s petition for review on certiorari for lack of merit. The Court agreed with the CA that the parties entered into an oral contract for the sale of Vergaâ€™s DATASI shares, partially executed by Harbor Starâ€™s payments. The Court found the contract was perfected by consent, and Vergaâ€™s divestment of his shares made performance impossible, justifying Harbor Starâ€™s claim for return of payments.

The Court rejected Vergaâ€™s argument on lack of board approval under Section 42 of the Corporation Code, ruling that since Harbor Star and DATASI are competitors in the same business, only board approval was necessary, which was duly obtained.

The Court upheld the award of attorneyâ€™s fees to Harbor Star, citing Article 2208 of the Civil Code, as Harbor Star was forced to litigate due to Vergaâ€™s refusal to comply with valid claims.

The Court modified the award of legal interest on the returned amount, correcting the period and rate applied by the CA based on prevailing jurisprudence.","The Court ruled that an oral contract of sale was valid and partially executed between Harbor Star and Verga for Vergaâ€™s DATASI shares. Vergaâ€™s failure to transfer shares after divesting them constituted breach, requiring return of payments. Board approval requirements were satisfied. Attorneyâ€™s fees awarded were justified. Legal interest on the monetary award was corrected.","The petition filed by Captain Ramon R. Verga, Jr. is DENIED. The Decision dated October 28, 2021, and Resolution dated June 6, 2022, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 109255 are AFFIRMED with modification on the award of legal interest."

IMELDA ROXAS-CRUZ, AND DAVID ANTHONY ROXAS, RESPONDENTS.","Antonio Roxas and Melania Roxas are the parents of Ferdinand, Manuel A. Roxas, Maria Rosario Roxas-Ureta, Alexander A. Roxas, Salome Roxas-Pantaleon, Paul Gerardo Roxas, Elaine Roxas-Gamboa, Ma. Imelda Roxas-Cruz, David Anthony Roxas, Conrado A. Roxas, and Jesus A. Roxas.

In 1970, Melaniaâ€™s cousin Felicisma Garcia, married to Alfonso Garcia, executed a Deed of Absolute Sale (DOAS) in favor of Ferdinand over a 500-square-meter parcel of land located at Loakan, Baguio City (the subject lot). Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-16657 was thereafter issued in Ferdinandâ€™s name. Melania built a house on the subject lot which the family used as a vacation house and residence of some of their children.

From 1990 to 1995, Melania rented out a portion of the subject property to Alfredo Sison. In 1991, Paul started residing on the subject property together with his family.

Antonio died on April 1, 1995. Subsequently, Ferdinand died on September 18, 2004, while Melania died on January 1, 2011.

On November 11, 2014, Manuel, Maria, Alexander, Salome, Paul, Elaine, Imelda, and David (the Heirs of Melania) filed a Complaint for declaration of nullity of the DOAS and cancellation of TCT No. T-16657. They alleged that Melania purchased the subject lot but placed it in Ferdinandâ€™s name to protect the interests of her children given the existence of Antonioâ€™s illegitimate children. Ferdinand was 19 years old and still studying at the time of the sale. The house Melania built is declared in her name. The Heirs of Melania filed the complaint because the Heirs of Ferdinand sought to take over the subject property after Melaniaâ€™s death.

The Heirs of Ferdinand countered that Ferdinand is the true owner of the subject lot. Antonio and Melania gave him the money to pay for the subject lot as they were overjoyed that he was about to graduate from college. Melania constructed the house with Ferdinandâ€™s permission. Ferdinand allowed Melania to rent out the property and keep the proceeds. Ferdinand also allowed Paul to reside on the subject property on the condition he would vacate upon request. When Ferdinand asked Paul to leave, Melania pleaded to allow Paul to stay while she was alive. Ferdinand paid the real property tax for the subject lot.

The Heirs of Ferdinand averred that in 1988, Antonio and Melania transferred their assets to their family corporation, Mel-Rox Realty Inc. After Antonioâ€™s death, Mel-Rox gave Antonioâ€™s illegitimate children their share in his inheritance, annotated on titles of properties registered under Mel-Rox. Mel-Rox paid Antonioâ€™s illegitimate children their claim on Antonioâ€™s estate.

After Ferdinand died, the Heirs of Ferdinand met with some Heirs of Melania regarding the subject property as it was Ferdinandâ€™s wish for them to take over and improve it. They wanted possession, but the Heirs of Melania said they could only do so after Melaniaâ€™s death. Even after Melaniaâ€™s death, Paul stayed on the property. Hence, they filed an ejectment case against him.

The Regional Trial Court (RTC) ruled in favor of the Heirs of Ferdinand, dismissing the complaint of the Heirs of Melania and ordering the payment of attorneyâ€™s fees.

The Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the RTC decision, ruling that Ferdinand was merely holding the subject lot in trust for Melania, cancelled TCT No. T-16657, and ordered issuance of a new title in Melaniaâ€™s name as part of her estate.

The Heirs of Ferdinand filed a Motion for Reconsideration which was denied, prompting the present Petition for Review on Certiorari.","The Supreme Court granted the Petition. The Court held that under Article 1448 of the Civil Code, when the price of a sale is paid by one person but the title is conveyed to another, a trust is presumed in favor of the former. However, if the title is conveyed to a child of the one paying the price, a disputable presumption arises that there is a gift in favor of the child.

Since Ferdinand is the child of Melania, and Melania paid the purchase price, the presumption is that Melania intended to donate the subject lot to Ferdinand. This presumption was not successfully overturned by the Heirs of Melania.

The Court found that Melaniaâ€™s acts of building a house on the lot, paying taxes, and allowing use by other siblings did not negate Ferdinandâ€™s ownership.

The Court agreed with the RTC that the complaint of the Heirs of Melania should be dismissed. However, the Court deleted the award of attorneyâ€™s fees for lack of factual and legal bases.","The Court ruled that Ferdinand was the true owner of the subject lot, and the presumption of donation under Article 1448 stands. The Heirs of Melania failed to prove that Ferdinand held the lot in trust for Melania.","The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals Decision dated February 13, 2020, and reinstated the RTC Decision dated January 19, 2017, dismissing the complaint filed by the Heirs of Melania. The award of attorneyâ€™s fees was deleted."

PACIFIC HUB CORPORATION, RESPONDENT.","From taxable years 2005 to 2006, Pacific Hub Corporation (Pacific Hub) filed its tax returns for withholding tax on compensation, expanded withholding tax, and value-added tax. However, it did not remit the full amounts declared to the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR). The total taxes declared amounted to PHP 30,985,617.52, but only PHP 15,505,386.41 was remitted, leaving a difference of PHP 15,480,231.11.

In 2008, Pacific Hub sent a letter to the BIR expressing willingness to pay the unremitted taxes for 2005 and 2006 but requested abatement of penalties, surcharges, and interests due to financial losses. Subsequently, in 2010, Pacific Hub filed an Application for Abatement or Cancellation of Tax, Penalties, and/or Interest and paid the basic deficiency tax of PHP 15,480,231.11.

Pacific Hub received a Notice of Denial dated January 10, 2014, rejecting its application for abatement. It also received a Warrant of Distraint and/or Levy dated September 12, 2014, enforcing collection of increments related to its deficiency withholding tax in the amount of PHP 13,792,867.56.

Pacific Hub filed a Petition for Review before the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) seeking to annul and set aside the Notice of Denial and the Warrant of Distraint and/or Levy, arguing these were irregularly issued and violated its right to due process.

The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) contended that the CTA lacked jurisdiction because there was no final decision on a disputed assessment and that the power to grant or deny abatement is discretionary and beyond the CTAâ€™s jurisdiction. The CIR also argued that the exercise of this power was not attended by grave abuse of discretion.

The CTA Third Division rendered a Decision annulling both the Notice of Denial and the Warrant of Distraint and/or Levy, holding it had jurisdiction under its ""other matters"" jurisdiction. The CTA found the Warrant void for lack of prior assessment and the Notice of Denial void for failure to state reasons, violating Revenue Regulations No. 13-2001. The CTA clarified that the cancellation of the Notice of Denial does not entitle Pacific Hub to abatement, which remains at the CIRâ€™s discretion.

The CIRâ€™s motion for reconsideration was denied. The CIR then filed a Petition for Review before the CTA En Banc.

The CTA En Banc affirmed the Third Divisionâ€™s rulings, holding that the CTA has jurisdiction to review the CIRâ€™s denial of abatement applications when attended by grave abuse of discretion. The Notice of Denial was void for failure to comply with regulatory requirements, and the Warrant was void for lack of prior assessment, violating due process.

The CIR sought reconsideration before the CTA En Banc, which was denied.","The Supreme Court denied the CIRâ€™s petition for certiorari, ruling that the CTA correctly assumed jurisdiction over the case under its ""other matters"" jurisdiction as provided by Section 7(a)(1) of Republic Act No. 1125, as amended by RA 9282.

The Court held that while the power to abate or cancel tax liabilities is discretionary under Section 204(B) of the Tax Code, the exercise of such power is reviewable by the CTA when attended by grave abuse of discretion.

The Court found that the CIRâ€™s denial of Pacific Hubâ€™s application was arbitrary and without due process, as it failed to state reasons as required by Revenue Regulations No. 13-2001.

The Court also ruled that the Warrant of Distraint and/or Levy was invalidly issued without a prior final assessment, violating Pacific Hubâ€™s right to due process.

The Court emphasized that the cancellation of the Notice of Denial and Warrant does not automatically grant Pacific Hubâ€™s application for abatement, which remains within the CIRâ€™s discretion.","The Court affirmed the CTA En Banc Decision and Resolution, holding that:

    The CTA has jurisdiction to review the CIRâ€™s denial of applications for abatement or cancellation of taxes, penalties, and interests under its ""other matters"" jurisdiction.

    The CIRâ€™s denial of Pacific Hubâ€™s application was issued with grave abuse of discretion for failure to comply with regulatory requirements.

    The Warrant of Distraint and/or Levy was void for being issued without a prior final assessment.

    The CIRâ€™s exercise of discretion is subject to judicial review when there is grave abuse of discretion.","The Supreme Court DENIED the Petition for Review on Certiorari filed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.

PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","Petitioner and CCC have been common-law partners since 2003 and have a child, AAA. In 2010, petitioner and AAA followed CCC to Benguet, where they agreed on AAAâ€™s custody. Petitioner often caused trouble in CCCâ€™s boarding house, forcibly opening doors and uttering abusive words. In 2012, petitioner went to CCCâ€™s boarding house to ask for money and to reconcile, which CCC refused. AAA disclosed to CCC that petitioner sexually abused her starting when she was seven years old. AAA narrated that petitioner, when drunk, made her hold his penis and touch her vagina. Petitioner also slapped AAA when she did not reveal CCCâ€™s whereabouts. A physical examination on AAA showed swelling on her right cheek, possibly caused by trauma.

Petitioner was charged with psychological violence under Section 5(i) of Republic Act No. 9262 against CCC, and with Acts of Lasciviousness under Article 336 of the Revised Penal Code in relation to Section 5(b) of Republic Act No. 7610 against AAA.

The Regional Trial Court (RTC) found petitioner guilty of the charges. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the conviction with modification as to the penalty. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court.","The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction of petitioner for psychological violence under Section 5(i) of Republic Act No. 9262 committed against CCC, and for Acts of Lasciviousness under Article 336 of the Revised Penal Code in relation to Section 5(b) of Republic Act No. 7610 committed against AAA. The Court held that the prosecution sufficiently established the elements of psychological violence and lascivious acts. The Court noted that the determination of mental anguish and suffering is a question of fact, which the Court of Appeals properly resolved. The Court also found that AAA was seven years old at the time of the sexual abuse, satisfying the age requirement under the law.

The Court imposed an indeterminate penalty for psychological violence and a penalty of 12 years and one day to 14 years imprisonment for Acts of Lasciviousness. The Court also imposed fines and awarded civil, moral, and exemplary damages to the victim.",The Court ruled that petitioner is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of psychological violence against CCC and Acts of Lasciviousness against AAA.

The Supreme Court ruled that the creation of an autonomous region must be based on the independent will of the people in each province or city, respecting their choice rather than imposing a collective decision. Treating the entire autonomous region as one geographic area overrides the right of each province and city for self-determination and undermines their distinct historical, cultural, and political characteristics.

The Court denied motions for partial reconsideration seeking to reverse the September 9, 2024 Decision that declared the inclusion of the Province of Sulu in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) as unconstitutional, while upholding the validity of the remaining provisions of the Bangsamoro Organic Law.

Petitioners and intervenors argued that excluding Sulu undermines the Bangsamoro identity and autonomy. Respondents contended that treating the former ARMM provinces and cities as one geographic area is valid under the Constitution and ARMM organic law.

The Court emphasized that the Constitution allows provinces, cities, and geographic areas to decide whether to be included in the autonomous region, and the ""No"" vote of Sulu was a clear expression of its rejection of inclusion in BARMM.

The Court applied the doctrine of operative fact, recognizing that acts performed in good faith under the assumption that Sulu was part of BARMM shall not be summarily nullified. It acknowledged the significant effects of Sulu's inclusion in BARMM prior to the ruling.

The Court reaffirmed respect for the democratic will of the people of Sulu and the importance of honoring their self-determination expressed through the plebiscite.","The Supreme Court denied the Motions for Partial Reconsideration with finality. It upheld the ruling that the inclusion of the Province of Sulu in BARMM is unconstitutional due to the failure to respect the independent will of its people as expressed in the plebiscite.

The Court clarified that the term ""geographic areas"" in the Constitution refers to smaller units than provinces or cities and does not justify treating the entire ARMM as a single voting unit.",The Court ruled that the inclusion of the Province of Sulu in BARMM without its consent violates the Constitution. The plebiscite results must be respected as an expression of the people's right to self-determination. The doctrine of operative fact applies to preserve acts done in good faith during the period of Sulu's inclusion in BARMM.,"The Court resolved the Motions for Partial Reconsideration seeking to reverse and set aside the September 9, 2024 Decision insofar as it voids the inclusion of the Province of Sulu in BARMM.

FORT 1 GLOBAL CITY CENTER, INC., RESPONDENT.","For the taxable year 2009, the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) issued a Preliminary Assessment Notice (PAN) dated January 24, 2012, finding Fort 1 Global City Center, Inc. (FGCCI) liable for deficiency income tax, value-added tax (VAT), withholding tax (WT), and documentary stamp tax (DST). FGCCI contested these findings, but the BIR issued a Final Assessment Notice (FAN) as a response. After FGCCI filed its protest to the FAN, the BIR issued a Final Decision on Disputed Assessment (FDDA) dated October 13, 2016, informing FGCCI that it is liable to pay deficiency taxes amounting to PHP 1,598,860,663.45 for the taxable year 2009.

For the taxable year 2012, the BIR issued a PAN dated February 3, 2016, and a FAN dated March 15, 2016, for deficiency income tax and VAT totaling PHP 134,099,378.74. FGCCI filed its protest to the FAN on April 1, 2016, but the BIR did not act on the protest.

FGCCI filed two separate Petitions for Review on Certiorari before the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) to question (a) the CIR's inaction on its protest for 2012 and (b) the FDDA for 2009. The two cases were consolidated.

FGCCI argued that the assessments were invalid because the notices were served to the wrong address. Specifically, the Letter of Authority (LOA), PAN, FAN, and FDDA for 2009 were delivered to 30th Street, Bonifacio Blvd., Global City, Taguig, while the LOA, PAN, and FAN for 2012 were served at 32nd Street, corner Boni Avenue. FGCCIâ€™s principal address in its 2016 General Information Sheet (GIS) was Unit 2C-B, FPS Building, 1st Avenue, corner 30th Street, Global City, Taguig. FGCCI claimed that the BIR notices were not served on persons authorized by FGCCI and that an uninterested third person received the notices.

The CIR alleged that the LOA, PAN, and FAN for both taxable years were properly served to FGCCI, as evidenced by the ""stamped received"" annotation on BIR's copies. Even assuming the documents were served to the wrong address or persons, FGCCI was deemed to have received them because it responded and protested the assessments.

The CTA Division ruled in favor of FGCCI, holding that under Revenue Regulation (RR) No. 12-99, the BIR must send notices by registered mail or personal service to the taxpayer or authorized representatives, indicating their name, signature, designation, authority, and date of receipt. The CTA found that the BIR failed to prove that the addresses to which the notices were sent were FGCCIâ€™s registered or known addresses, and the notices did not indicate the designation or authority of the persons who received them. The CTA emphasized that FGCCIâ€™s filing of protest does not cure the violation of due process.

The CTA Division denied the BIRâ€™s Motion for Reconsideration and cancelled the PAN and FAN for taxable years 2009 and 2012, including the FDDA for 2009.

On appeal, the CTA En Banc discussed that the GIS is not proper evidence of the taxpayerâ€™s registered address; the BIR Certificate of Registration is the proper basis. The CTA En Banc held that FGCCIâ€™s right to due process was not violated because FGCCI protested the assessments and did not present evidence of the uninterested third person who allegedly received the notices.

However, the CTA En Banc did not garner the required votes to reverse the CTA Division decision, thus affirming it by operation of law.

The CIR filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari with the Supreme Court, which was filed one day late. The CIR filed a Motion for Extension of Time, which was granted, but the petition was filed beyond the extended deadline. The CIR filed a Motion to Admit the petition out of time, citing heavy workload.

FGCCI opposed the Motion to Admit, arguing that heavy workload is not sufficient justification.","The Supreme Court took cognizance of the case despite the late filing, emphasizing that procedural rules should not obstruct justice. However, the Court agreed with the CTA Division that the tax assessments for taxable years 2009 and 2012 must be cancelled due to the BIRâ€™s failure to comply with proper service rules under Section 228 of the National Internal Revenue Code and relevant Revenue Regulations.

The Court ruled that FGCCIâ€™s filing of protests does not bar it from raising due process issues regarding improper service. The BIRâ€™s failure to indicate the authority or designation of persons receiving the notices violated due process, rendering the assessments void.

The Court noted that the CIRâ€™s claim that FGCCI received the notices through an uninterested third person was unsubstantiated.

The Court dissented in part, agreeing that the 2012 assessment is void but holding that the 2009 assessment is valid due to FGCCIâ€™s actual receipt and protest of the notices.","The Supreme Court affirmed the cancellation of the deficiency tax assessments for taxable years 2009 and 2012 due to improper service violating due process.

PETER GERALD SCULLY A.K.A. ""PETER RUSSELL"" A.K.A. ""PETER RIDDEL"" AND CARME ANN ALVAREZ A.K.A. ""HONEY SWEET"" A.K.A. ""SWEET SWEET"", ACCUSED-APPELLANTS.","Scully and Alvarez were charged with qualified trafficking of persons and five counts of rape by sexual assault. The cases were filed in 2014, but the Hall of Justice where the case was filed was destroyed by fire, necessitating the reconstitution of records. The accused admitted being the persons named in the Information but denied their aliases and the minority of the victims.

On September 19, 2014, Alvarez approached two minor girls, AAA270174 (12 years old) and BBB270174 (9 years old), at a mall and coaxed them to come with her under the pretext of providing for their needs. Alvarez and the girls took a taxi to a house where Scully was present. Alvarez instructed the girls to undress despite their initial refusal, bathed them, and took photos of them in compromising positions.

Over several days, the girls were given alcoholic beverages until intoxicated, bound and gagged with chains around their necks, stripped naked, and forced to perform sexual acts on each other and on Scully and Alvarez. The accused took photos and videos of these acts. The girls were also forced to watch pornography and perform sexual acts on Scully.

On September 23, 2014, the girls escaped when Scully and Alvarez left the house. They were found by family members and brought to the police, who conducted interviews and medical examinations. The medical reports showed evidence of sexual abuse and trauma.

The accused-appellants claimed their constitutional right to due process was violated as they were not allowed to present their defense fully, citing negligence of their counsel. They also denied the elements of qualified trafficking, arguing the acts were for their own lust and no pornographic materials involving the minors were produced.

The trial court and Court of Appeals found the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt, relying on the credible testimonies of the victims and witnesses, and medical evidence.","The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction of Scully and Alvarez for qualified trafficking in persons under Republic Act No. 9208, as amended. The Court found that the prosecution sufficiently proved all elements of the crime, including recruitment, harboring, and exploitation of minors for sexual purposes, accompanied by photographic and video evidence.

The Court held that the accused-appellants' denial and claims of due process violations were unavailing. The negligence of counsel did not amount to deprivation of the right to be heard. The testimonies of the minor victims were accorded full weight and credibility.

The Court sentenced the accused-appellants to life imprisonment and a fine of PHP 5,000,000.00 each. Moral and exemplary damages were also awarded.",The Court ruled that the accused-appellants were guilty beyond reasonable doubt of qualified trafficking in persons. The convictions and penalties imposed by the lower courts were affirmed.,The Supreme Court denied the appeal and affirmed the Decision of the Court of Appeals and the Regional Trial Court convicting Peter Gerald Scully and Carme Ann Alvarez of qualified trafficking in persons.
"G.R. No. 256649, November 26, 2024","ROMEO ILAO Y ARGENTE, PETITIONER,
VS.
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","Petitioner Romeo Ilao was charged with illegal possession of firearms in violation of Section 1 of Republic Act No. 8294. On April 12, 2007, police officers, with petitioner present, executed a search warrant at a house described as ""inside his house at Brgy. Binukawan, Bagac, Bataan,"" where firearms and ammunition were seized. Ilao was arrested and charged. The prosecution presented evidence including inventory of seized firearms and a certification from the Philippine National Police Firearms and Explosives Office that petitioner did not have a license to possess the firearms.

Petitioner argued that the search warrant was invalid because it failed to particularly describe the place to be searched, as there were many houses in the barangay and the warrant only stated ""inside his house at Brgy. Binukawan, Bagac, Bataan."" He also claimed he was not the owner or in possession of the house searched, citing testimony from the barangay chair that the house belonged to another person, Dodoy Canto. Petitioner maintained that he was only inside the house for a meeting.

The trial court found petitioner guilty beyond reasonable doubt. The Court of Appeals affirmed, noting the prosecution proved the two elements of illegal possession of firearms: existence of firearms and lack of license by petitioner. The appellate court was not convinced by petitionerâ€™s claim that he did not own the house, especially since he did not protest the search and arrest. The Court of Appeals also observed that petitioner filed and then withdrew a motion to avail of probation, which it considered an implied admission of guilt.

Petitioner moved for reconsideration, which was denied. He then filed a Petition for Review before the Supreme Court.","The Supreme Court ruled that search warrants must particularly describe the place to be searched, and only those places described may be searched. The description ""inside his house at Brgy. Binukawan, Bagac, Bataan"" was insufficient because the barangay has many houses and residents, making it impossible to identify the place with reasonable certainty. The Court noted that petitioner presented credible evidence negating ownership of the house searched, which prevailed over the bare testimonies of police officers.

Because the search warrant and its execution were defective, the Court ruled that all items seized are inadmissible as evidence. The Court emphasized that the determination of the place to be searched cannot be left to the discretion of the implementing police officers.

The Court affirmed the constitutional protection against unreasonable searches and seizures under Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution, which requires particularity in search warrants.","The Court ruled that the search warrant was invalid for failure to particularly describe the place to be searched, rendering the search illegal and the seized evidence inadmissible. The Court found that petitionerâ€™s evidence negating ownership of the searched house was credible and that the prosecution failed to prove lawful possession of the house.",The Supreme Court set aside the conviction of Romeo Ilao for illegal possession of firearms due to the invalid search warrant and illegal search. The Court ordered immediate implementation of this decision.
"A.C. No. 11478, November 26, 2024","A.C. No. 11478, November 26, 2024","Respondent Atty. Christopher S. Ruiz was found guilty of violating the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice in a Decision dated September 5, 2017. He was suspended from the practice of law for one year and perpetually disqualified from being commissioned as a notary public. The complaint arose from his notarization of a Notice of Loss/Affidavit of Loss and a Release of Mortgage in Cebu City without requiring competent evidence of identity of the supposed executors and without their consent or knowledge. The notarial register entries were improperly accomplished, with incomplete jurat and missing details such as competent evidence of identity, date, time, and type of notarial act. Respondent shifted blame to his secretary for errors in the notarial register.

The Court held that these acts constituted negligence and dishonesty, justifying the penalties imposed. Respondentâ€™s suspension from the practice of law started on October 9, 2017, and expired on October 9, 2018. His suspension was lifted on August 14, 2019, but his perpetual disqualification as notary public remained.

On August 11, 2022, respondent filed a Petition praying for recall of the perpetual disqualification order, claiming he has endured consequences beyond what was prescribed and demonstrated remorse through social and civic works. He attached certifications and photos of volunteer activities.

The Office of the Bar Confidant (OBC) recommended denying the petition, noting respondentâ€™s continued practice of law during suspension (as a legal consultant), his negligence, and shifting of blame to his secretary, which cast doubt on his fitness as a notary public.","The Supreme Court granted the Petition for recall of the perpetual disqualification. The Court applied the clemency guidelines set forth in NuÃ±ez v. Ricafort, which allow for judicial clemency after a period (usually five years) and upon showing remorse, compliance with prior disciplinary orders, and fitness to practice.

The Court found that respondentâ€™s period of disqualification (four years and ten months) was close enough to the five-year guideline and that he showed remorse and reformation, supported by certifications from the Integrated Bar of the Philippines, community organizations, and ecclesiastical groups. The Court emphasized a forward-looking approach focusing on redemption rather than solely on past infractions.

The Court noted that violations of notarial rules are serious offenses when attended by bad faith, but respondentâ€™s case involved negligence without bad faith.","The Court ruled that respondentâ€™s petition for recall of perpetual disqualification as a notary public has prima facie merit and granted the petition, allowing respondent to apply for commission as a notary public again.",The Court GRANTED the Petition of Atty. Christopher S. Ruiz to recall the order perpetually disqualifying him from being commissioned as a notary public.

VS.
COURT OF APPEALS AND PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENTS.","Joel Pancho Bigcas was a duly elected barangay kagawad and chair of the Council of Environment and Natural Resources of the Sangguniang Barangay of Lacson, Calinan, Davao City. Lorlene Gonzales applied for an earth moving permit with the City Environment and Natural Resources Office, which required a resolution from the barangay approving her application.

During the barangay session, Bigcas volunteered to verify information at City Hall regarding the certification issued by the City Planning Development Coordinator. He asked Lorlene for PHP 200.00 as fare money to expedite processing. Lorlene gave the amount, thinking it was a common barangay practice.

Later, the barangay denied Lorlene's application after Bigcas showed documents indicating the request was not viable as it was actually a quarry application. Lorlene asked the barangay chairperson if it was their practice to ask for money for expenses; the chairperson denied such practice.

Bigcas later tried to return the PHP 200.00 to Lorlene, who refused to receive it, insisting he did not ask for a loan but for money. Bigcas then approached Lorlene's sons to return the money, but they also refused.

Testimonies from Lorlene, her sons, and the barangay secretary corroborated these events. Bigcas admitted he accepted the money as a loan to end Lorlene's insistence and harassment but maintained he could not help expedite the application.

The Regional Trial Court convicted Bigcas of violating Section 3(c) of Republic Act No. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act) and sentenced him to suffer the indeterminate penalty of six years and one month to seven years imprisonment and perpetual disqualification from public office.

Bigcas appealed to the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the conviction. Bigcas filed a motion for reconsideration, which the Court of Appeals dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, noting that the Sandiganbayan has exclusive jurisdiction over cases involving RA 3019 violations.

Bigcas filed a Rule 65 petition for certiorari before the Supreme Court, seeking to nullify the Court of Appealsâ€™ dispositions and to have his appeal properly decided on the merits.","The Supreme Court ruled that a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 is the proper remedy against the Court of Appealsâ€™ dismissal of the appeal for lack of jurisdiction based on grave abuse of discretion.

The Court recognized the peculiar circumstances of the case, including the timely filing of the Notice of Appeal by Bigcas, the erroneous designation of the Court of Appeals as the appellate court by his counsel, and the trial courtâ€™s failure to transmit the records to the proper court (Sandiganbayan).

The Court emphasized that the liberty of the accused should not be prejudiced by the errors of counsel, the trial court, or the Court of Appeals. It cited precedents where the Court relaxed procedural rules in the interest of substantial justice, especially when the accusedâ€™s liberty is at stake.

The Court decided to resolve the case on the merits instead of remanding it, to avoid further delay, given that the case had been pending for over ten years.

The Court proceeded to review the evidence and found Bigcas guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Section 3(c) of RA 3019. The elements of the offense were established: Bigcas, a public officer, requested and received money from Lorlene in connection with her application for a government permit.",The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction of Joel Pancho Bigcas for violation of Section 3(c) of RA 3019. The Court imposed the penalty of imprisonment and perpetual disqualification from public office.,"The petition for certiorari is DENIED. The Decision of the Court of Appeals dated December 10, 2020, affirming the conviction of Bigcas, is AFFIRMED with finality."

SUGAR REGULATORY ADMINISTRATION, REPRESENTED BY ITS ADMINISTRATOR AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS, GOVERNANCE COMMISSION FOR GOVERNMENT OWNED AND CONTROLLED CORPORATIONS, REPRESENTED BY ITS CHAIRMAN AND BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS, AND DEPARTMENT OF BUDGET AND MANAGEMENT, REPRESENTED BY ITS DEPARTMENT SECRETARY, RESPONDENTS.","Petitioners are 75 former officials and employees of the Sugar Regulatory Administration (SRA) who availed of the Early Retirement Incentive Program (ERIP) offered under the SRAâ€™s Organizational Strengthening Rationalization Plan (RATPLAN), pursuant to Executive Order No. 203, series of 2016, and related laws and issuances. They were separated and retired effective August 1, 2016.

The SRAâ€™s RATPLAN was approved by the Governance Commission for GOCCs (GCG) under Memorandum Order No. 2016-05, which required the SRA to adopt and offer retirement and separation packages to affected personnel using incentives provided under EO No. 203. The SRA implemented the RATPLAN and invited employees to avail of the ERIP.

Despite their separation, petitionersâ€™ retirement benefits under the ERIP were withheld following a directive from the GCG pending the issuance of implementing guidelines required under EO No. 203. The Department of Budget and Management (DBM) also did not approve the supplemental budget for the ERIP benefits due to the absence of these guidelines.

Petitioners filed a complaint for illegal dismissal before the Civil Service Commission (CSC), alleging that the non-release of their ERIP benefits and their removal from the payroll constituted illegal dismissal. The CSC dismissed the complaint for lack of merit, ruling that petitioners voluntarily availed of the ERIP and were not illegally dismissed. The CSC declared that petitioners may file their claims with the proper forum and directed the SRA to facilitate payment of their ERIP benefits.

Petitioners followed up with letters requesting release of their benefits, but the SRA did not act. Some petitioners filed a complaint before the Office of the Ombudsman for non-compliance with the CSC decision.

The GCG clarified that the suspension of the ERIP implementation under EO No. 36, series of 2017, and its implementing rules, revoked the authority to release ERIP benefits. The GCG advised petitioners to raise their concerns with the Office of the President (OP).

Petitioners filed a Petition for Mandamus before the Supreme Court to compel the respondents to release their ERIP benefits pursuant to the CSC decision.","The Supreme Court took cognizance of the petition and noted the factual and legal background, including the suspension of the ERIP under EO No. 36, series of 2017, and the absence of implementing guidelines.

The Court recognized that petitioners have a clear and unmistakable right to their retirement benefits once they have separated from service under the ERIP. The respondents have a corresponding duty to release such benefits unless valid legal impediments exist.

The Court observed that the suspension of the ERIP and the absence of implementing guidelines created a legal impediment to the release of benefits, which respondents cited as justification for non-payment.

The Court emphasized that mandamus will lie only if petitionersâ€™ right is clear and the duty of respondents is ministerial and not dependent on the exercise of discretion.

The Court considered the CSCâ€™s ruling that petitioners were not illegally dismissed and that they may pursue their claims with the proper forum.","The Supreme Court ruled that while petitioners have a right to their ERIP benefits, the respondentsâ€™ failure to release these benefits is due to valid legal impediments, including the suspension of the ERIP and lack of implementing guidelines.

The Court held that mandamus is not the proper remedy to compel payment under these circumstances, as the respondentsâ€™ duty is not purely ministerial.","The Supreme Court DENIED the Petition for Mandamus filed by petitioners Dominador T. Villanueva, Jr., Edmundo L. Yasay, Edgardo M. Adalia, et al. The Court directed the parties to pursue their claims through the proper administrative and judicial remedies."

The Information alleged that from August 2014 to the present, the petitioner willfully committed acts likely to cause psychological abuse by leaving his wife to live with another woman, Melinda, and by neglecting to provide support for their two children, to the damage and prejudice of AAA260547.

At trial, the prosecution presented witnesses including AAA260547, the barangay captain Angelito Catubig, and CCC260547. AAA260547 testified about the petitionerâ€™s infidelity, his living with Melinda, and the emotional pain she suffered. The defense presented petitioner and CCC260547 as witnesses, with petitioner admitting to having a child with Melinda and ceasing support to AAA260547 and their children due to loss of trust.

The Regional Trial Court (RTC) found the petitioner guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Section 5(i) of RA 9262, sentencing him to an indeterminate penalty of four years and two months to eight years and one day imprisonment, a fine of PHP 100,000, and mandatory psychological counseling.

The petitioner appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA), arguing that the Information was defective for failing to allege that AAA260547 or their children suffered mental or emotional anguish, that the acts charged did not constitute psychological abuse, and that the prosecution failed to prove repeated marital infidelity.

The CA affirmed the RTC decision, finding that the petitionerâ€™s extra-marital affair caused mental and emotional anguish to AAA260547.

The petitioner filed a Petition for Review before the Supreme Court.","The Supreme Court granted the petition, ruling that the Information was defective because it failed to allege that AAA260547 or their children suffered mental or emotional anguish, an essential element of the offense. The Court held that the Information must specifically state the nature of the psychological abuse and the resulting mental or emotional anguish to inform the accused properly and allow preparation of defense.

The Court emphasized that allegations of â€œdamage and prejudiceâ€ are too general and do not satisfy the specificity required by law. The constitutional right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation requires a sufficient Information.

Accordingly, the Court reversed the conviction and ordered the immediate entry of judgment of acquittal.","The Court ruled that the Information was insufficient for failing to allege mental or emotional anguish suffered by the victim, thus violating the petitionerâ€™s right to due process. The conviction was reversed.","The Supreme Court GRANTED the Petition for Review and REVERSED and SET ASIDE the Decision of the Court of Appeals and the RTC, ordering the immediate entry of judgment of acquittal in favor of XXX260547."

The prosecution presented witnesses including the victim (AAA), his teacher (CCC), a psychologist (Ghia C. Dagondon), and a medical doctor (Dr. Arden O. Mangubat). The victim testified that Ryan twisted his arm, slapped his face, punched his head multiple times, pulled his hair, lifted and threw him to the ground, and threatened him and others with violence. The teacher and experts corroborated the victimâ€™s testimony, noting physical injuries and psychological trauma.

Ryan denied the charges, claiming he only intervened to separate his son and the victim during a fight and that he acted without intent to harm or demean the child.

The Regional Trial Court found Ryan guilty beyond reasonable doubt and sentenced him to an indeterminate penalty of 4 years, 9 months, and 11 days to 6 years, 8 months, and 1 day imprisonment, plus moral damages of PHP 20,000 with legal interest, and costs.

The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction, emphasizing the cruelty and excessive nature of Ryanâ€™s acts and the resulting trauma to the child.

Ryan filed a petition for review before the Supreme Court.","The Supreme Court denied the petition, ruling that the issue is factual and the lower courts properly found Ryan guilty. The Court emphasized that physical maltreatment and threats inflicted on a child, especially in public, are intrinsically cruel and excessive, impairing the childâ€™s dignity and right to a safe environment.

The Court distinguished this case from others where verbal remarks without physical abuse were involved, noting the severity of Ryanâ€™s acts.

She found Atty. Ma. Aurora Paredes Sore-Romanoâ€™s website, which detailed her expertise in family law and annulment proceedings and extensive practice. Impressed, Sucgang-Perez engaged her services and paid an acceptance fee of PHP 203,000.00 covering initial case study, drafting pleadings, psychological evaluation, and related services. Sucgang-Perez underwent psychological evaluation with Dr. Arnulfo V. Lopez, but later discovered that Dr. Lopezâ€™s professional fee was only partially paid by Atty. Sore-Romano despite prior agreement. Communication with Atty. Sore-Romano became difficult, with little to no updates on the case. Litigation support staff and other lawyers in the firm informed Sucgang-Perez of delays, disorganized pleadings, and that other clients had similar complaints. Sucgang-Perez demanded refund and termination of services. Atty. Sore-Romano eventually filed the petition, but it was dismissed due to procedural defects. Sucgang-Perez filed a complaint with the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP), alleging negligence, abandonment of case, failure to update client, improper handling of clientâ€™s money, and breach of professional duties.

Soloria charged respondent Alberto R. David, Utility Worker I, Municipal Circuit Trial Court, Alcala-Bautista, Alcala, Pangasinan with gross immorality, prejudicial conduct that gravely besmirches or taints the reputation of the service, and vulgar and unbecoming conduct under Sections 14(i), 14(1), and 16(a) of Rule 140 of the Rules of Court, as amended by A.M. No. 21-08-09-SC.

Soloria claimed that she started a relationship with David in 2017 while he was still legally married to his wife with whom he has a child. They decided to live together in 2018 and had a daughter. David became employed as a utility worker at the Municipal Circuit Trial Court, Alcala-Bautista. David became selfish and refused to give financial support to Soloria and their daughter except on the condition that she would pay him back. David's child with his wife could not read and write despite being 17 years old due to lack of educational support from David. David's wife provided financial support to her and her daughter. Soloria caught David womanizing in 2022 and later found out he was cohabiting with a second mistress. David's work allegedly suffered due to his womanizing; he was caught sleeping during office hours but his officemates did not complain because he was related to the presiding judge. Soloria left David in December 2022 after confirming his cohabitation with another woman since October 2022.

In his Comment dated February 17, 2023, David admitted he was legally married, that Soloria was not his wife, and that he had moved on to another mistress. He denied neglecting his children, claiming he raised his first child with family help. He denied failing to support his child with Soloria, despite her being ""difficult to talk to at times."" He admitted to taking a nap once during office hours. He denied being related to the presiding judge and said he only calls her ""auntie"" as a sign of respect. He and Soloria agreed to part ways amicably once he found someone else.

In her Reply dated February 20, 2023, Soloria maintained that David was not a good provider; the money he gave was insufficient even for groceries. David's child with his wife said David asked for reimbursement when asked for something. David's aunt took care of his child because he was inattentive. David's officemates expressed concern about his work performance, and David admitted to being called out for mistakes. Soloria felt slighted when David left her for another woman.

The Judicial Integrity Board â€“ Office of the Executive Director (JIB-OED), by Report and Recommendation dated January 24, 2024, found David guilty of gross immorality. The JIB-OED held that the charge was proved by substantial evidence. David did not deny being married and having an affair with Soloria, nor leaving Soloria for another mistress. The JIB-OED recommended dismissal from service with forfeiture of all benefits except accrued leave credits and perpetual disqualification from government service.

The Judicial Integrity Board (JIB), in its Report dated June 25, 2024, adopted and approved the JIB-OED's findings and recommendations.","The Supreme Court adopted and approved the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations of the JIB with modification. The Court emphasized its jurisdiction over administrative matters involving judicial employees and its power to discipline them motu proprio or through verified complaints.

The Court found David guilty of gross immorality for maintaining illicit relationships with at least two persons other than his legal spouse. Immoral acts are those violating basic norms of decency and morality, and gross immorality is reprehensible to a high degree. The Court stressed that employees of the Judiciary must maintain the highest standards of honesty, integrity, morality, and decency in both professional and private conduct.

David's failure to provide adequate support to his children was not proven. The Court found no basis to hold him administratively liable for neglect or failure to support.

Regarding allegations of tardiness and poor work performance, the Court found no proof of habitual tardiness but held David liable for sleeping during office hours, which constitutes vulgar and unbecoming conduct.

Under Rule 140 of the Rules of Court, gross immorality is punishable by dismissal from service, forfeiture of benefits except accrued leave credits, and perpetual disqualification from government service. The Court found aggravating circumstances and lack of remorse, justifying the maximum penalty.",The Court found Alberto R. David guilty of gross immorality and vulgar and unbecoming conduct. He is dismissed from service with forfeiture of all benefits except accrued leave credits and perpetually disqualified from re-employment in any government branch or instrumentality.,"The Supreme Court ordered the dismissal of Alberto R.

PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","The case arose from an Information dated July 4, 2016, charging the petitioners and Tomas Alburo Riveral with violation of Section 65(a)(2) of Republic Act No. 9184 (The Government Procurement Reform Act). The accused public officers, occupying various managerial positions in the Cebu Port Authority (CPA), were charged with willfully, unlawfully, and criminally delaying without justifiable cause the opening of bids for the procurement of Janitorial/Support Services for CY 2011 of CPA beyond the prescribed period by postponing the scheduled opening of bids from May 18, 2011, to June 9, 2011. The postponement was allegedly due to queries from media and port stakeholders, which under law may be raised only by prospective bidders before the deadline for submission of bids.

On April 27, 2011, CPA published the Invitation to Bid with a deadline of May 18, 2011. On May 18, 2011, CPA Commissioner Riveral requested postponement due to queries from media and port stakeholders, which was approved by CPA General Manager Villamor and transmitted to the CPA-BAC, which then postponed the bid opening. A Supplemental Bid Bulletin rescheduled the opening to June 9, 2011. The opening proceeded on June 9, 2011, except for one bidder whose bid was opened on June 24, 2011.

A complaint was filed before the Office of the Ombudsman, which found probable cause and filed the Information before the Sandiganbayan. Riveral and petitioners filed Motions to Quash; Riveralâ€™s was granted, petitionersâ€™ denied. Petitioners argued that Sandiganbayan lacked jurisdiction due to their salary grade and that the RTC had exclusive jurisdiction. The prosecutionâ€™s Motion for Partial Reconsideration was denied.","The Sandiganbayan ruled that Riveral merely requested postponement, which was approved by Villamor, and since Villamor was not indicted, Riveralâ€™s Information was quashed. The denial of petitionersâ€™ Motion to Quash was affirmed to allow trial to determine facts.","The Supreme Court held that the Sandiganbayan has jurisdiction over the petitioners as public officials under Section 4 of P.D. No. 1606, regardless of salary grade. The charge of delay without justifiable cause in the opening of bids suffices to establish jurisdiction in Sandiganbayan. The factual justification for postponement is a matter for trial, not for quashal. There was no grave abuse of discretion in denying the Motion to Quash.",The petition lacks merit. The Sandiganbayan did not commit grave abuse of discretion in denying the Motion to Quash filed by the petitioners.

The Court of Appeals (CA) found that the petitioners were buyers in bad faith due to irregularities in the chain of certificates of title (TCTs) involved, particularly the â€œlaunderingâ€ or questionable annotations and cancellations in the titles originating from the Spouses Ferreras to Pinpin and then to petitioners.

The Pinpin TCTs were found to have been improperly â€œlaundered,â€ with annotations disappearing to make the titles appear â€œclean,â€ despite originating from cancelled Spouses Ferreras TCTs due to a sham deed of sale executed by the deceased Spouses Ferreras in favor of Pinpin.

The Court noted suspicious annotations, questionable affidavits of loss, and irregular decisions purportedly issued by a certain RTC judge allowing issuance of duplicate titles. The presence of these annotations should have alerted petitioners to investigate further before dealing with the properties.

The Court discussed the principles of the Torrens system, particularly the â€œmirror,â€ â€œcurtain,â€ and â€œinsuranceâ€ doctrines, emphasizing that the Torrens certificate is a reflection of the register but the register itself must be inquired into, especially when suspicious circumstances exist.

The Court underscored that constructive notice applies to all registrations affecting the property and that persons dealing with registered land have a duty of diligent inquiry, especially when anomalies appear.

Petitionersâ€™ failure to inquire into the register and suspicious facts surrounding the titles and transactions negated their claim of good faith.","The Court affirmed the CAâ€™s finding that petitioners are not innocent purchasers for value entitled to protection under the Torrens system. The Court held that reliance solely on the face of the certificate of title without further inquiry, especially under suspicious circumstances, is insufficient.

The Court clarified the proper application of the Torrens system principles, emphasizing the need for inquiry into the register and the application of constructive notice.",The Court ruled that petitioners are buyers in bad faith and are not entitled to protection as innocent purchasers under the Torrens system.,The petition is denied. The petitionersâ€™ claim as buyers in good faith and for value is rejected due to their failure to exercise due diligence in investigating the chain of title and suspicious circumstances surrounding the subject properties.

VS.
MONICO BADILLO, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","In an Information dated September 17, 2008, Badillo was charged with murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code for stabbing Joseph Olbes on September 14, 2008, at Barangay San Juan, Irosin, Sorsogon. The prosecution presented witnesses Salvador Fernandez, Jomel Escasinas, and Marilou Olbes, who testified to witnessing or confirming the stabbing and the victimâ€™s death. A post-mortem examination confirmed death due to multiple stab wounds.

Badillo denied the charges and claimed an alibi, stating he was in Batuan, Masbate, assisting his daughter at the time of the stabbing. His alibi was supported by cousins Felipe Basig and Emilio Badillo, who testified that Badillo was at Emilioâ€™s house during the incident.

The Regional Trial Court (RTC) found Badillo guilty beyond reasonable doubt of murder, sentencing him to reclusion perpetua and awarding damages to the victimâ€™s heirs. The RTC credited the prosecution witnessesâ€™ positive identification and qualified the offense with treachery. The defense witnessesâ€™ testimonies were viewed with skepticism.

The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the conviction but downgraded the offense to homicide, ruling that treachery was not sufficiently proven.

Badillo filed a Notice of Appeal to the Supreme Court, which treated it as a petition for review on certiorari.","The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction for homicide. It gave great weight to the RTC and CAâ€™s factual findings, especially the credibility of prosecution witnesses. The Court rejected Badilloâ€™s claims of inconsistent testimonies and delayed reporting, holding these did not impair credibility. Denial and alibi were found insufficient to overcome positive identification, especially since Badillo failed to prove physical impossibility of presence at the crime scene.",Badillo was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of homicide. The Court affirmed the CA decision downgrading the offense from murder to homicide and modified the damages awarded.,"The Court denied the appeal and affirmed the Court of Appealsâ€™ Decision dated February 15, 2019, convicting Monico Badillo of homicide and sentencing him to an indeterminate penalty of six years and one day to fourteen years, eight months, and one day imprisonment, with damages awarded to the heirs of the victim."

VS.
OSCAR C. BORJA AND VENANCIO B. REGULADO, RESPONDENTS.","The controversy concerns the legality of Section 2 of Memorandum No. 2012-016 issued by the National Electrification Administration (NEA), which provides that electric cooperative officials who file their certificates of candidacy for public office shall be considered automatically resigned from their positions effective upon the start of the campaign period.

Respondents Borja and Regulado were incumbent members of the Board of Directors of Camarines Sur Electric Cooperative II (CASURECO II). Borja filed his certificate of candidacy for mayor, and Regulado for municipal councilor in the 2013 elections. They challenged the memorandum before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Naga City, seeking to declare Section 2 unconstitutional for contravening election laws and the will of the electorate.

The RTC granted a preliminary injunction in favor of Borja but not Regulado. The RTC later struck down Section 2 of Memorandum No. 2012-016, holding that it expanded the law and was void.

On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) dismissed the case as moot and academic due to the expiration of the officialsâ€™ terms but ruled that the memorandum was unconstitutional for contravening the NEAâ€™s charter under Presidential Decree No. 269.

The NEA filed a petition for certiorari before the Supreme Court to assert the validity of Section 2.","The Supreme Court affirmed that the case is moot and academic, but applied the exception for issues capable of repetition yet evading review, as the memorandumâ€™s limited duration and the possibility of recurrence satisfy the criteria.

The Court clarified that electric cooperatives are private, non-stock, non-profit membership corporations engaged in public service but are not government agencies or government-owned or controlled corporations (GOCCs). Their officers are private individuals elected from the membership and board.

The Court ruled that the ""ipso facto resignation"" rule under the Omnibus Election Code applies only to public appointive officials and employees of GOCCs, not to officers of electric cooperatives.

The Court further held that Section 2 of Memorandum No. 2012-016 unlawfully amended or expanded the law by deeming officers automatically resigned upon filing candidacy, exceeding NEAâ€™s authority.",The Court declared Section 2 of Memorandum No. 2012-016 unconstitutional and void for being ultra vires and inconsistent with the NEAâ€™s charter and election laws.,The petition is denied. The Court upheld the decision of the Court of Appeals declaring Section 2 of Memorandum No. 2012-016 unconstitutional and affirmed the dismissal of NEAâ€™s petition.
"G.R. No. 261627, November 13, 2024","GODOFREDO V. ARQUIZA, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","Petitioner Godofredo V. Arquiza was charged with libel under Article 353 of the Revised Penal Code, as penalized under Article 355. The libelous statements were contained in a Petition to Deny Due Course or Cancel the Certificate of Nomination of Party List Nominees filed before the COMELEC against Francisco G. Datol, Jr., a nominee of the Senior Citizen Party-List to Congress. The petition alleged that Datol had a string of criminal cases indicating a propensity to commit illegal acts and labeled him a fugitive from justice. Datol claimed these imputations were malicious, defamatory, and caused him dishonor and prejudice. The petition was filed in a quasi-judicial proceeding before the COMELEC. The Regional Trial Court (RTC) convicted Arquiza of libel, sentencing him to imprisonment and a fine, and awarding moral damages to Datol. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the conviction, rejecting the claim that the statements were privileged communications. Arquiza filed a petition for review before the Supreme Court, arguing that the statements were absolutely privileged as they were made in the course of quasi-judicial proceedings and that the burden was on Datol to prove the criminal cases were not against him but a namesake.","The Supreme Court ruled that absolute immunity from suit applies not only to statements made in judicial proceedings but also to those made in quasi-judicial proceedings and steps necessarily preliminary thereto, provided the proceedings afford procedural protections similar to judicial proceedings, the statements are relevant to the proceedings, and are communicated only to those with a duty to perform with respect to the document or legally required to be served. The Court applied a four-fold test to determine the applicability of absolute privilege in quasi-judicial proceedings. It found that the statements in the Petition to Deny Due Course satisfied these requirements and were therefore covered by absolute privilege.","The Supreme Court acquitted petitioner Godofredo V. Arquiza of the crime of libel, holding that his statements in the Petition to Deny Due Course were absolutely privileged communications made in the course of quasi-judicial proceedings before the COMELEC. The Court relaxed procedural rules to consider the petition on its merits despite some procedural defects.","Petitioner Godofredo V. Arquiza was acquitted of libel charges. The Court reversed the RTC and CA decisions convicting him, recognizing absolute privilege for statements made in quasi-judicial proceedings under the conditions outlined."

AGCAOILI, JR., AND ATTY. MARK S. OLIVEROS, RESPONDENTS.","This disciplinary action arose from allegations of irregular notarization of various documents involved in criminal complaints for plunder and violations of Republic Act No. 3019 and other laws, including malversation through falsification of documents. The documents were allegedly notarized by respondents Atty. Editha P. Talaboc, Atty. Delfin R. Agcaoili, Jr., and Atty. Mark S. Oliveros, or their names and notarial details were used without their knowledge or consent. The Office of the Ombudsman (OMB) found that the notarizations were irregular and recommended disciplinary action for violation of the rules on notarial practice, asserting that the respondents allowed the use of their notarial seals, stamps, and registers for a fee or retainer. The respondents denied the charges, with Atty. Agcaoili submitting an answer and averring that his notarial paraphernalia were kept securely and that forged signatures were made by others, including Ben Hur Luy. Atty. Talaboc failed to file a position paper despite several motions for extension, and Atty. Oliveros did not file any pleading or motion to contradict the charges. The Integrated Bar of the Philippines Commission on Bar Discipline (IBP-CBD) investigated and recommended findings of guilt for violation of the Notarial Rules. The respondents were accused of negligence in safekeeping their notarial details and failure to comply with IBP directives.","The Supreme Court reviewed the records and set aside the findings and recommendation of the IBP. The Court found that the OMB failed to discharge its burden of proof to show that respondents consented to the use of their signatures, notarial seals, and notarial registers in return for a fee. There was no sufficient proof that respondents received money or that their notarial registers were used knowingly by them. Deficiencies and irregularities in the notarial details cast doubt on the validity of the notarial commissions. The Court recognized that notaries are not immune from identity theft and that others could have used the respondents' names and requested notarial stamps and seals be made in their names without their knowledge. The Court noted that in previous cases, lawyers were penalized only when negligence was proven, such as allowing secretaries full access to notarial paraphernalia. The Court also noted that respondent Atty. Agcaoili was previously penalized in another case. However, the Court found that respondents Talaboc and Oliveros failed to comply with IBP directives, did not file answers, and did not attend mandatory conferences, which constitutes violation of Canon III, Section 2 of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability (CPRA).","The Court acquitted respondents of the charges of irregular notarization due to insufficient proof of their knowledge or consent to the alleged acts. However, the Court found respondents Atty. Talaboc and Atty. Oliveros guilty of violation of Canon III, Section 2 of the CPRA for their failure to comply with IBP directives and imposed penalties accordingly. Atty. Talaboc was suspended from the practice of law for six months due to this being her third instance of non-compliance, an aggravating circumstance. Atty. Oliveros was found guilty of the same violation but with mitigating circumstances as this was his first offense.","The Supreme Court set aside the IBP's findings of guilt for irregular notarization against respondents and acquitted them of administrative liability for such acts. The Court imposed a six-month suspension on respondent Atty. Editha P. Talaboc and a lesser penalty on respondent Atty. Mark S. Oliveros for their failure to comply with IBP directives during the disciplinary proceedings. The Court ordered the Office of the Court Administrator to remind judges to comply with rules on notarial practice and tasked Executive Judges and relevant bodies to investigate the circumstances surrounding the notarial services rendered in respondents' names. Copies of the decision were to be furnished to the Office of the Bar Confidant, the Integrated Bar of the Philippines, and the Office of the Court Administrator for guidance and information."
"G.R. No. 265223, November 13, 2024","NOE R. PAGARAO, JR. AND REBECCA CABALLA, PETITIONERS, VS. IMMACULADA T. TRINIDAD, RESPONDENT.","Respondent Immaculada T. Trinidad is the owner of a parcel of land in Cainta, Rizal, covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 616372. In February 2015, petitioners Noe R. Pagarao, Jr. and Rebecca Caballa occupied the property and constructed a modest structure used as their residence and place of business. In 2018, Trinidad discovered their occupation and verbally demanded they vacate. Pagarao and Caballa asked to continue possession and offered to purchase the property for PHP 2.5 million. Trinidad agreed, subject to a written contract to sell, and accepted a partial payment of PHP 300,000 as proof of intent. Later, Pagarao and Caballa refused to sign the contract to sell prepared by Trinidad. Trinidad then demanded they vacate via letter, which was ignored. On April 1, 2019, Trinidad filed a complaint for unlawful detainer before the Municipal Trial Court (MTC).

The MTC ruled in favor of Trinidad, finding that Pagarao and Caballa's possession was initially lawful based on the agreement to enter into a contract to sell but became unlawful upon their refusal to vacate when demanded. The Regional Trial Court (RTC) affirmed the MTC decision. Pagarao and Caballa filed a petition for review with the Court of Appeals (CA), which denied the petition, ruling that their possession ripened into lawful possession upon the agreement to purchase.

Pagarao and Caballa sought reconsideration, which was denied, and then filed a petition for review on certiorari before the Supreme Court. They argued that if their possession was unlawful from the beginning, unlawful detainer was not the proper remedy and the complaint should be dismissed.","The Supreme Court reviewed the case and ruled that unlawful detainer is a summary action to recover possession of real property and requires that the defendant's initial possession be lawful, either by contract or tolerance of the owner. If the initial possession was unlawful, the proper remedy is an action for forcible entry, not unlawful detainer. The Court emphasized that tolerance must be present from the start of possession; subsequent tolerance cannot convert an unlawful entry into lawful possession for purposes of unlawful detainer.

In this case, Trinidad disavowed knowledge of how Pagarao and Caballa initially entered the property, indicating no initial tolerance. The agreement to enter into a contract to sell did not transfer ownership or right to possess because ownership remains with the seller until full payment is made. Thus, Pagarao and Caballa's possession was unlawful from the start and only later tolerated by Trinidad.","The Supreme Court held that the courts a quo erred in ruling that unlawful detainer was the proper remedy. Since initial possession was unlawful, the complaint for unlawful detainer lacked cause of action. The Court reversed and set aside the decisions of the Court of Appeals, RTC, and MTC, and dismissed the complaint for unlawful detainer.","The complaint for unlawful detainer filed by Immaculada T. Trinidad against Noe R. Pagarao, Jr. and Rebecca Caballa was dismissed for lack of cause of action. The Supreme Court ruled that the proper remedy for Trinidad is an action for forcible entry, not unlawful detainer, given the unlawful nature of the initial possession by Pagarao and Caballa."
"G.R. No. 259992, November 11, 2024","DEPARTMENT OF BUDGET AND MANAGEMENT PROCUREMENT SERVICE, PETITIONER, VS. JAC AUTOMOBILE INTERNATIONAL PHILIPPINES, INC., RESPONDENT.","The Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) intended to procure 6-wheeler and 10-wheeler dump trucks as farm equipment and engaged the Department of Budget and Management - Procurement Service (DBM-PS) as its procurement agent through a Memorandum of Agreement. The DBM-PS posted invitations to bid for two public bidding projects: PB No. 14-122 for 61 units of 6-wheeler dump trucks with an approved budget of PHP 274,500,000.00, and PB No. 15-018-2 for 29 units of 6-wheeler dump trucks and 40 units of 10-wheeler dump trucks with approved budgets of PHP 130,500,000.00 and PHP 220,000,000.00 respectively. Respondent JAC Automobile International Philippines, Inc. participated in the bidding alongside other joint ventures (JV of Ad Lib-Hubei-Muli-Lift, China Dong Feng Motor Distributors, Inc., JV of Autocirculo Corporation and Man Automotive Concessionaires Corporation).

The Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) conducted pre-qualification and post-qualification evaluations. Respondentâ€™s bid was found to be the lowest calculated responsive bid after other bidders were post-disqualified for various deficiencies such as differences in signatures, lack of documentary support, failure to establish proof of completed contracts, and failure to comply with manufacturer certification requirements. Consequently, on July 24, 2015, the BAC issued Notices of Lowest Calculated Responsive Bid to respondent for both bidding projects.

On September 4, 2015, Executive Director Jose Tomas C. Syquia (ED Syquia), acting as Head of the Procuring Entity (HOPE), issued Notices of Cancellation for PB Nos. 14-122 and 15-018-2 (Lot No. 1), stating that the projects were not economically and financially feasible, reasoning that the government would spend more due to procedural deficiencies rather than technical capability. Despite this, ED Syquia issued a Notice of Award in favor of respondent for PB No. 15-018-2 (Lot No. 2) on September 7, 2015, which respondent accepted.

Respondent filed a complaint against petitioner alleging grave abuse of discretion in issuing the Notices of Cancellation, arguing that there was no significant change in economic conditions, no determination that the projects were unnecessary, and no showing that funding was withheld or reduced.

The Regional Trial Court (RTC) denied respondentâ€™s motions for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction but eventually ruled on April 5, 2018, that ED Syquia acted with grave abuse of discretion in issuing the Notices of Cancellation. The RTC declared the cancellations null and void and ordered the DBM-PS to proceed with awarding the contract to respondent. The RTC also ruled that ED Syquia should have declared a failure of bidding under the proper procedure instead of issuing cancellation notices.

Petitioner appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA), which on July 23, 2021, affirmed the RTC decision, holding that ED Syquia was the HOPE, that the grounds for cancellation did not fall under the justifiable grounds under the 2009 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of Republic Act No. 9184, and that issuing the cancellation notices without proper grounds constituted grave abuse of discretion causing unfairness and injustice to respondent. The CA denied petitionerâ€™s motion for reconsideration on March 23, 2022.

Petitioner filed a petition for certiorari before the Supreme Court.","The Supreme Court agreed with the RTC and CA that ED Syquia, as HOPE, had the authority to issue the Notices of Cancellation but acted with grave abuse of discretion because he failed to clearly show the existence of justifiable grounds under Article XI, Section 41 of Republic Act No. 9184 and its 2009 Revised IRR. The Court emphasized that the discretion to accept or reject bids is vested in government agencies but must be exercised with explanation and justification.

The Court found that ED Syquiaâ€™s grounds for cancellation-(1) that the BAC failed to exhaust clarification procedures during post-qualification, and (2) that the projects were not economically and financially viable because the government would spend more-were unsupported by evidence. The BAC had complied with required procedures and properly disqualified other bidders. ED Syquiaâ€™s conclusion was a sweeping statement without explanation or proof.

The Court also clarified that while the HOPE may declare failure of bidding, the proper procedure under the circumstances was not followed. However, the main issue was the lack of justifiable grounds for cancellation.","The Court agreed that resort to certiorari was proper since the notices of cancellation were issued by the HOPE, not the BAC, making the protest mechanism ineffective.","The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals and Regional Trial Court decisions declaring the Notices of Cancellation issued by ED Syquia null and void for grave abuse of discretion. The Court ordered the Department of Budget and Management Procurement Service to proceed with awarding the contracts to JAC Automobile International Philippines, Inc. The petition for certiorari filed by the Department of Budget and Management Procurement Service was denied."
"G.R. No. 233909, June 5, 2018","ERNESTO M. TELLEZ AND JOVINO M. TELLEZ, REPRESENTED BY MELANIA T. MAGPALE, PETITIONERS, VS. SPOUSES JOSE JOSON AND JOVITA JOSON, RESPONDENTS.","Vivencio Lorenzo was the original owner of a 6.3465-hectare parcel of agricultural land in Dumani, Carranglan, Nueva Ecija, covered by Original Certificate of Title No. P-1912. After the effectivity of Presidential Decree No. 27, the land was placed under the Operation Land Transfer Program for distribution to qualified tenant-farmers. Demetrio Tellez was identified as a qualified beneficiary of his tenanted portion of Vivencio's property. Demetrioâ€™s successors-in-interest, petitioners Ernesto and Jovino Tellez, were issued four emancipation patents on July 15, 1988 covering their respective tenanted portions.

Two cases arose concerning the subject property. In Civil Case No. C-38, Vivencio sued Jovino, and the Regional Trial Court (RTC) upheld the validity and binding effect of an Amicable Settlement executed by Jovino on September 17, 1992, wherein Jovino surrendered tenancy rights over the subject property to Vivencio for monetary consideration (First RTC Decision). In Civil Case No. C-83, Vivencio sued Ernesto and others for recovery of possession, and the RTC ordered them to vacate the property in Vivencio's favor based on Jovinoâ€™s surrender (Second RTC Decision). The Tellezesâ€™ motion to reopen the case was denied, and the Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the finality of the Second RTC Decision.

Ernesto and Jovino then filed a complaint for recovery of possession and injunction against spouses Jose and Jovita Joson (Vivencioâ€™s heirs) before the Provincial Agrarian Reform Adjudicator (PARAD), asserting ownership by virtue of their emancipation patents. PARAD dismissed the complaint citing res judicata based on the RTC decisions. The Tellezes elevated the case to the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB), which reversed PARAD and ruled that Ernesto and Jovino are rightful owners with incontrovertible possession rights. The DARAB held that Jovinoâ€™s surrender through the Amicable Settlement violated Section 27 of RA No. 6657 and DAR Administrative Order 08-95, which prohibit transfer of lands awarded to farmer-beneficiaries within 10 years. However, the DARAB ruled Jovino could not revert to farmer-beneficiary status due to the violation and ordered the transfer of Jovinoâ€™s tenanted portion to the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) for availability to other qualified beneficiaries.

Spouses Joson filed a Petition for Review under Rule 43 before the CA. The CA reversed and set aside the DARAB ruling, holding that res judicata barred the petitionersâ€™ complaint because the First and Second RTC Decisions had attained finality declaring spouses Joson as having the better right of possession. Petitionersâ€™ motion for reconsideration was denied by the CA.","The Supreme Court found the petition meritorious. It held that the principle of res judicata requires a final judgment on the merits by a court with jurisdiction, with identity of parties, subject matter, and causes of action. The Court explained the doctrineâ€™s two concepts: bar by prior judgment and conclusiveness of judgment. The Court was not convinced that res judicata barred the petitionersâ€™ complaint because the Amicable Settlement, which formed the basis of the RTC decisions, was null and void for violating Section 27 of RA No. 6657 and DAR AO 08-95 prohibiting transfer of lands awarded to farmer-beneficiaries within 10 years. Therefore, the First RTC Decision upholding the Amicable Settlement was void and could not bar the petitionersâ€™ claims.

The Court set aside the DARAB order for transfer proceedings regarding Jovinoâ€™s tenanted portion. It clarified that the invalidity of the Amicable Settlement does not prejudice spouses Josonâ€™s right to recover the money paid to Jovino in a separate action.","The Supreme Court ruled in favor of petitioners Ernesto and Jovino Tellez. It declared that the Amicable Settlement executed by Jovino surrendering tenancy rights was null and void for violating agrarian laws. Consequently, the prior RTC decisions based on the Amicable Settlement cannot bar the petitionersâ€™ claim by res judicata. The Court set aside the CA ruling that dismissed petitionersâ€™ complaint and the DARABâ€™s order for transfer action. The Court emphasized the protection of farmer-beneficiariesâ€™ rights under PD 27 and RA 6657.",The petition was granted. The Court reversed the CA decision that dismissed the complaint on grounds of res judicata and set aside the DARAB order for transfer proceedings. The Amicable Settlement was declared void for violating agrarian reform laws. The petitionersâ€™ rights as farmer-beneficiaries with valid emancipation patents were upheld. The ruling preserves petitionersâ€™ right to possession of their tenanted portions and invalidates the prior surrender to Vivencio. The Court allowed spouses Joson to seek recovery of monetary consideration paid to Jovino in a separate case.
"G.R. No. 272145, November 11, 2024","METROPOLITAN BANK AND TRUST COMPANY [FORMERLY ASIAN BANK CORPORATION], PETITIONER, VS. SPOUSES RODOLFO ANTONINO AND ROSA MARINA ANTONINO, RESPONDENTS.","From August 21, 1996 to January 20, 1997, spouses Rodolfo and Rosa Marina Antonino successively obtained 12 loans by way of credit accommodation from Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company (Metrobank), evidenced by corresponding Promissory Notes. To secure the PHP 16,000,000.00 loan obtained on October 9, 1996 (covered by Promissory Note No. RR-1096-6822), the Antoninos executed a Real Estate Mortgage (REM) over their 1,167 square-meter property in Ayala Alabang, Muntinlupa.

The other credit accommodations were secured by a Continuing Pledge Agreement with the Antoninosâ€™ 42,375 Philippine Commercial and International Bank (PCIB) shares of stocks, which were subsequently increased via amendments to cover increased credit accommodations and additional pledged shares, with total pledged shares valued at more than PHP 38,000,000.00.

The Antoninos defaulted on their loans, prompting Metrobank to foreclose the REM. At the public auction sale of the mortgaged property, Metrobank emerged as the winning bidder with a bid of PHP 25,674,000.00. The foreclosure sale proceeds were applied to the expenses of the sale and to the Antoninosâ€™ unsecured outstanding obligations to Metrobank, purportedly by virtue of the dragnet clause contained in the REM contract.

Metrobank filed a Complaint against the Antoninos for the payment of the balance of PHP 12,386,356.00 on the October 9, 1996 loan, which had ballooned to PHP 18,626,917.86 due to interests and penalties at the time of foreclosure. The Complaint attached a Statement of Account showing that the claim was limited to the balance of the October 9, 1996 loan, as the other three obligations had been satisfied by the foreclosure sale proceeds.

In defense, the Antoninos admitted obtaining 12 different and independent loans. They argued that Metrobank erred in applying the foreclosure sale proceeds to pay off other loan obligations under Promissory Note Nos. 0996-6664, 0896-6605, and 1096-6835, asserting that the REM was limited to securing only the October 9, 1996 loan. They also claimed that the foreclosure sale proceeds were more than enough to satisfy the October 9, 1996 loan, and that the other loans had been fully settled from the proceeds of the sale of their pledged PCIB shares of stock.

The Antoninos further alleged that Metrobank fraudulently sold their pledged PCIB shares without their written authorization and at a price lower than market value, accusing Metrobank of forging their signatures on the authorization letter used for the sale.

By way of counterclaim, the Antoninos prayed for accounting and reimbursement of the proceeds from the sale of the pledged PCIB shares and other reliefs.","The Regional Trial Court (RTC) limited its ruling to the issue concerning the REM and its application solely to the October 9, 1996 loan, refraining from ruling on the counterclaim regarding the PCIB shares. The RTC denied the Antoninosâ€™ claim for moral and exemplary damages but awarded attorneyâ€™s fees.

The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the RTC decision but dismissed the Antoninosâ€™ appeal due to failure to file an appellantsâ€™ brief.

The Supreme Court was tasked with resolving whether the REMâ€™s application was limited only to the October 9, 1996 loan.","The Supreme Court held that the REM contract was limited in its application to securing the October 9, 1996 loan only. The Court explained that while the REM contained a dragnet clause intending to cover future obligations, the contract and the promissory notes were contracts of adhesion, limiting the Antoninosâ€™ role to affixing signatures without negotiation.

The Court found that the other loans were secured by the Continuing Pledge Agreement, not the REM, and that Metrobank erroneously applied the foreclosure sale proceeds of the REM to other loan obligations not covered by the REM.

Regarding the imposition of legal interest on the balance of the foreclosure sale proceeds, the Court found Metrobank obligated to return the excess amount with proper interest.

As to the Antoninosâ€™ counterclaim for accounting and reimbursement of the proceeds from the sale of the pledged PCIB shares, the Court ruled that this involved questions of fact beyond its review power in a Rule 45 petition.","The Supreme Court denied the petitions, affirming that the REM was limited to securing only the October 9, 1996 loan. Metrobank erred in applying the foreclosure sale proceeds to other loan obligations not secured by the REM. The Antoninos were entitled to the return of any excess proceeds with legal interest. The Court refrained from ruling on the counterclaim concerning the alleged illegal sale of pledged shares due to factual issues outside its jurisdiction in the present appeal."

(SMFI) in Mariveles, Bataan. In 2008, they were absorbed by Hua Tong Far East Inc. but continued their assignments at SMFI's B-MEG Plant 1. On June 18, 2019, SMFI informed Hua Tong it would not renew their business relationship after the agreement's expiration at year-end, leading to the dismissal of Fajardo et al. on December 31, 2019.

On January 19, 2021, Fajardo et al. filed a case for illegal dismissal with the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC), claiming SMFI was their real employer and Hua Tong a labor-only contractor, seeking reinstatement, back wages, regularization, and other claims.

On October 25, 2021, the Labor Arbiter dismissed their complaint, declaring SMFI and Hua Tong engaged in legitimate toll feedmilling excluded from Department Order No. 174 coverage or, alternatively, Hua Tong as a legitimate contractor. The complaint for illegal dismissal was dismissed for lack of employer-employee relationship. However, Hua Tong was ordered to pay separation pay and nominal damages to petitioners. The Labor Arbiter also awarded attorneyâ€™s fees and denied other money claims.

Fajardo et al. appealed to the NLRC, which on July 21, 2022, denied the appeal and affirmed the Labor Arbiter's decision. Their motion for reconsideration was denied on September 30, 2022, with receipt on October 11, 2022, starting the 60-day period to file a certiorari petition with the Court of Appeals (CA).

Abot, who failed to prepare the petition despite prior assurances and payment. They sought an additional 30 days until January 10, 2023, to file the petition, which they eventually filed through new counsel on January 10, 2023.

The CA denied the Motion for Extension of Time on January 16, 2023, reasoning petitioners did not exert enough effort to secure new counsel or meet the deadline, resulting in dismissal of their petition. Their Motion for Reconsideration was denied on May 26, 2023.","The Supreme Court granted the petition for certiorari, finding merit in petitionersâ€™ claim that their former counsel abandoned them without notice after receiving payment, constituting a compelling circumstance justifying extension of time. The Court held that strict application of rules should not frustrate justice, especially for minimum wage workers unfamiliar with procedural intricacies who relied in good faith on their counsel. The Court emphasized the balance between speedy disposition and the right to be heard.",The Court reversed and set aside the CA resolutions denying the Motion for Extension of Time and dismissing the petition. The case was reinstated with instructions for the CA to process and resolve the petition with deliberate dispatch. The Court also referred Atty. Geneses R. Abot to the Commission on Bar Discipline for investigation of possible administrative liability for abandonment of clients.,"The petition for review on certiorari was granted. The CA resolutions dated January 16, 2023, and May 26, 2023, were reversed and set aside. The petition for certiorari was reinstated for further proceedings. The Court directed investigation into the former counselâ€™s alleged abandonment."
"G.R. No. 270870, November 11, 2024","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. XXX270870 AND YYY270870, ACCUSED-APPELLANTS.","The accused-appellants, XXX270870 and YYY270870, along with a John Doe, were charged with four counts of qualified trafficking in persons under Section 4(a), in relation to Section 6(a) of Republic Act No. 9208, as amended by RA No. 10364. The victim, AAA270870, was a minor girl born on January 22, 2002, who was exploited and sexually abused by the accused through a series of incidents starting December 2013 when she was 11 years old.

The prosecution presented testimonies from AAA270870 and her sister BBB270870, including sworn statements and certificates of live birth. The victim recounted four separate incidents where XXX270870 and YYY270870 conspired to recruit, hire, and deliver her to foreign men for sexual exploitation and prostitution for money. The incidents involved taking photographs under false pretenses, delivering AAA270870 to a foreigner named Tom and another named Charles, forcing sexual acts, and making the victim and other children drink a white-colored liquid. The accused derived profits from these acts, and the victim was threatened and instructed not to disclose the abuse.

The defense denied the allegations, with XXX270870 and her daughters testifying that they knew the victimâ€™s family and denied involvement in trafficking or sexual exploitation. YYY270870 also denied knowledge of the charges and the victim.","The trial court found the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of qualified trafficking in persons. The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction and increased the award of moral damages to PHP 500,000.00 with 6% legal interest per annum.","The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, holding that all elements of qualified trafficking were proven. The Court emphasized that the trial court is in the best position to assess witness credibility and that the victimâ€™s behavior and delay in reporting did not diminish her credibility. The Court imposed the penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of PHP 2,000,000.00 on each accused-appellant. All monetary awards shall earn legal interest at 6% per annum from the finality of the decision until full payment.","ACCORDINGLY, the appeal is DISMISSED. The Decision dated October 11, 2021 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 13004 is AFFIRMED."
