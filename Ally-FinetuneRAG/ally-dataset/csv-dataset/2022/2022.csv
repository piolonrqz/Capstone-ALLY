"G.R. No. 241837, January 05, 2022","REYMUNDO MASIL Y AVIAR, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","In an Information dated July 12, 2010, petitioner, along with a certain Wilfredo Santiago y Bontiago * (Wilfredo), was charged with the offense of Fencing, the accusatory portion of which reads: That on or about the 10th day of July, 2007 in Caloocan City, Metro Manila and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring, confederating and mutually helping one another, with accused Wilfredo Santiago y Bontiago, have in his possession one (1) unit of utility vehicle with Plate Number NYE-443 worth Php400,000.00 and acting as seller, sell and delivered to Reymundo Masil y Aviar, owner of AE Junkshop the following spare parts of said vehicle as follows: 4-D-5 Php5,000.00 Injection pump 8,000.00 Fan Blade Rocker Arm 4,000.00 Air Breaker 500.00 xxxxxxxxxxxx Php17,500.00 owned by NIMFA ESTEBAN y NICOLAS, in the amount of Php17,500.00 said accused knowing that said vehicle is of dubious origin or has been derived from proceeds of the crime of carnapping, to the damage and prejudice of the latter. CONTRARY TO LAW. [6] When arraigned, both petitioner and co-accused Wilfredo pleaded not guilty to the offense charged in the Information. [7] Trial ensued. According to the prosecution, Nimfa N. Esteban (Nimfa) manages a passenger jeepney with Plate Number NYE-443 owned by her sister, Elizabeth Eustaquio. On July 4, 2010, she hired Eugene Labramonte (Eugene) as driver. On the scheduled date, Eugene took the jeepney from her residence to take passengers from Baclaran to Blumentritt. They agreed that the return of the jeepney will be at 10:00 p.m. However, Eugene failed to return the jeepney at the agreed time. Nimfa looked for Eugene but to no avail. The next day, she reported the theft of the jeepney to the Philippine National Police (PNP) Anti-Carnapping Unit in Caloocan City. She also went to the Highway Patrol Group, PNP Headquarters, Camp Crame, Quezon City to report the incident. [8] On July 9, 2010, Nimfa received a call from a concerned citizen telling her that a vehicle was seen being dismantled in Brgy. 180, Caloocan City. The report led to the apprehension of Wilfredo, who was caught in the act of dismantling the jeepney at a junk shop in Little Baguio, Caloocan City. [9] When confronted by the police officers, Wilfredo denied knowing Eugene but admitted that the other parts of the dismantled jeepney had already been sold to a junk shop owned by petitioner. [10] Meanwhile, a barangay tanod tipped off Police Officer II Cesar Garcia (PO2 Garcia) that Eugene was detained in the barangay hall. Thereat, PO2 Garcia apprehended Eugene. Based on Eugene's admission, he sold the missing jeepney parts to AE Junk Shop owned by petitioner. [11] With Wilfredo, the police officers proceeded to petitioner's junk shop where they saw and recovered the dismantled parts of the jeepney previously marked by Nimfa's husband, to wit: ""the D-5, injection pump, fan blade, rocker arm, and air breather."" [12] As the stolen items were recovered from the possession of petitioner, the police officers charged petitioner and Wilfredo with violation of PD 1612. On the other hand, petitioner denied knowing Wilfredo. He argued that he came to know his co-accused and the complainants only on July 11, 2010 at the police station. Nevertheless, he admitted that he was engaged in a junk shop business since June 2010; and he had been purchasing motor vehicle parts. [13]","In the Judgment [14] dated June 2, 2017, the RTC found petitioner and Wilfredo guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the offense charged. It sentenced them to suffer the indeterminate penalty of five (5) years and three (3) months of prision correccional in its maximum period, as minimum, to six (6) years and eight (8) months of prision mayor in its minimum period, as maximum. [15] The RTC found that the prosecution successfully established the presence of all the elements of the offense of Fencing. It gave more weight to the testimony of the prosecution witnesses over the unsubstantiated denials of petitioner and Wilfredo. [17] Aggrieved, petitioner appealed to the CA. The CA Ruling In the Decision [18] dated June 13, 2018, the CA affirmed petitioner's conviction. It held that the storage of the dismantled parts of the jeepney in petitioner's junk shop manifested intent to gain on the part of petitioner who was engaged in the junk shop business. [19]","The Court's Ruling Fencing is defined under Section 2 of PD 1612 as ""as the act of any person who, with intent to gain for himself or for another, shall buy, receive, possess, keep, acquire, conceal, sell or dispose of, or shall buy and sell, or in any manner deal in any article, item, object or anything of value which he knows, or should be known to him, to have been derived from the proceeds of the crime of robbery or theft."" [22] The following are the essential elements of the crime of fencing: (a) a crime of robbery or theft has been committed; (b) the accused, who is not a principal or an accomplice in the commission of the crime of robbery or theft, buys, receives, possesses, keeps, acquires, conceals, sells or disposes, or buys and sells, or in any manner deals in any article, item, object or anything of value, which has been derived from the proceeds of the crime of robbery or theft; (c) the accused knew or should have known that the said article, item, object or anything of value has been derived from the proceeds of the crime of robbery or theft; and (d) there is, on the part of the accused, an intent to gain for oneself or for another. [23] The prosecution established the requisite quantum of evidence in proving beyond reasonable doubt all the elements of the offense of Fencing. First , the evidence of the prosecution shows that, on July 4, 2010, the jeepney vehicle owned by Nimfa's sister was stolen by its driver who, in a separate case, was convicted of Qualified Theft. [24] Later, the police officers saw the lost jeepney being dismantled or cannibalized by petitioner's co-accused, Wilfredo. [25] Through the confession of Wilfredo, the police officers went to the junk shop of petitioner where they saw and recovered some of the dismantled parts of the jeepney. [26] The police officers were able to identify the dismantled parts through the markings placed thereon by Nimfa's husband. [27] Second , petitioner never denied the fact that the missing parts of the lost jeepney were recovered from his junk shop, AE Junk Shop, in Caloocan City. He likewise admitted that he bought the dismantled parts from his co-accused, Wilfredo. He asserted that it was his wife who was first invited to the police station; but later on, he agreed to be held in her place and asserted that he was innocent of the charge. [28] Still the Court has consistently ruled in a number of cases that denial is a weak defense which cannot prevail over positive identification. [29] Third , circumstances exist to forewarn a reasonable vigilant buyer that the object of the sale may have been derived from the proceeds of robbery or theft. Such circumstance may include the time and place of the sale, the nature and condition of the goods sold, and the legality of source. [30] Petitioner knew or should have known that the articles, items, objects or anything of value had been derived from the proceeds of the crime of robbery or theft. The term ""should have known"" denotes that a person of reasonable prudence and intelligence ought to ascertain a fact in performance of his duty to another or govern his conduct upon the assumption that such fact exists. [31] Petitioner, a junk shop owner since 2010, ought to have known the requisites and the protocols in buying or selling motor vehicle parts. Specifically, Section 6 of PD 1612 requires stores, establishments, or entities dealing in the buying and selling of any good, article, item, object or anything else of value obtained from an unlicensed dealer or supplier thereof to secure the necessary clearance or permit from the station commander of the Integrated National Police [32] in the town or city where that store, establishment or entity is located before offering the item for sale to the public. [33] Lamentably for petitioner, he failed to adduce evidence that in buying from Wilfredo, he asked for any proof of ownership of the jeepney parts. Had petitioner done so, his experience from the business would have given him doubt as to the legitimate ownership or source thereof. Finally , fencing is malum prohibitum . Consequently, PD 1612 creates a prima facie presumption of fencing from evidence of possession by the accused of any good, article, item, object, or anything of value, which has been the subject of robbery or theft; and prescribes a higher penalty based on the value of the property. [34] In short, the law does not require proof of purchase of the stolen articles, as mere possession thereof is enough to give rise to a presumption of fencing. [35] In the end, the Court finds no reason to deviate from the factual findings of the RTC, as affirmed by the CA, considering that there is no indication that it overlooked, misunderstood, or misapplied the surrounding facts and circumstances of the case. In fact, the RTC was in the best position to assess and determine the credibility of the witnesses presented by both parties; hence, due deference should be accorded to it. [36]","WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED. The Decision dated June 13, 2018 and the Resolution dated August 17, 2018 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 40074 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION in that petitioner is sentenced to suffer the indeterminate penalty of six (6) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day of prision mayor in its minimum period, as minimum, to eight (8) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day of prision mayor in its medium period, as maximum.

Agustin then executed an Affidavit of Adverse Claim[13] which caused the inscription of Entry No. 28508[14] on TCT No. 2556.[15] However, the adverse claim was canceled together with TCT No. 2556 upon the issuance of TCT No. 20066 to Dionisio Torrevillas (Torrevillas) and Esperanza Larrazabal as purchasers of Lot No. 9194.[16]","The Court found the petition devoid of merit. A notarized instrument has in its favor the presumption of regularity. The sale between Esperanza Lopez and her children, as sellers, and Agustin, as buyer, was executed and notarized before Notary Public Demosthenes Tugonon. The respondents presented the notarized Deed of Absolute Sale, which enjoys the presumption of regularity, requiring clear and convincing evidence to overcome it. Petitioners failed to present any evidence beyond bare denial to prove their claim that they never executed a deed of sale. Furthermore, respondents' undisputed possession of the subject property since 1969 is convincing evidence of the sale's existence. Consequently, petitioners failed to discharge the burden of proving that the claim (the notarized deed) casting a cloud on their title was invalid or inoperative, thus failing the second indispensable requisite for an action to quiet title to prosper.","WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED. The Decision dated January 24, 2019 and the Resolution dated November 5, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 04771 are AFFIRMED. SO ORDERED.","Petition DENIED.

Conqueror, on the other hand, is a service cooperative engaged in performing specific jobs which require special services to different clientele. On June 8, 2015, respondents Joey Balingbing, Ernesto Quing, Ariel Velasquez, Elvin John Fernandez, and Lean Dennis Osena, for themselves and on behalf of 149 other employees including respondents, filed a Sama Samang Sinumpaang Reklamong Salaysay para sa Complaint for Inspection against Sagara and Conqueror for alleged violation of labor laws, particularly DOLE Department Order No. (DO) 18-A, Series of 2011 (18-A-11). According to respondents, Conqueror was a mere labor-only contractor and that Sagara was their true employer for the following reasons: (1) Conqueror was not registered with the DOLE; (2) it had no substantial capital or investment in the form of tools or equipment; and (3) it was Sagara which exercised control and supervision over them. Respondents prayed that they be declared as regular employees of Sagara and be entitled to the benefits enjoyed by its regular employees according to their existing Collective Bargaining Agreement. Acting on the Complaint for Inspection, the Compliance Officers of DOLE Region IV-A (DOLE Compliance Officers) visited the plant of Sagara and noted NON-COMPLIANCE WITH D.O. 18-A UNDER SECTION 9. NON-COMPLIANCE WITH D.O. 18-A UNDER SECTION 6 (SUPERVISION & CONTROL). In the Order dated October 6, 2015, the DOLE Regional Director dismissed the Complaint for Inspection of respondents and found Sagara and Conqueror compliant with DO 18-A-11. In the Resolution dated May 16, 2016, the Secretary of DOLE affirmed the ruling of the DOLE Regional Director holding that Conqueror proved the following: (1) it met the substantial capital to operate as a legitimate labor contractor; and (2) it exercised control and supervision over the means and methods of respondents' work. In the Decision dated June 28, 2019, the CA reversed and set aside the Decision of the Secretary of DOLE and held that the labor officials committed grave abuse of discretion when they found Conqueror as a legitimate job contractor. According to the CA, Conqueror is a mere labor-only contractor and Sagara was the actual employer of respondents. Aggrieved, Sagara moved for reconsideration of the Decision dated June 28, 2019, but the CA denied it on October 29, 2019. Hence, the instant consolidated petitions.","Taking into consideration the surrounding circumstances of the case and applying the four-fold test, the Regional Director and the Secretary of DOLE aptly determined that Conqueror was a legitimate job contractor and, consequently, the employer of respondents. The factual findings of the Regional Director and the Secretary of DOLE, who are deemed to have acquired expertise in matters within their respective jurisdiction, are generally accorded not only respect but even finality. They bind the Court when supported by substantial evidence.","The issues to be resolved by the Court are as follows: Whether respondents performed activities which were directly necessary to the line of business of Sagara; Whether Conqueror is a legitimate job contractor; and Whether respondents were employees of Conqueror or Sagara. Ruling of the Court While the CA noted in its assailed Decision that Conqueror is a duly registered independent service contractor with a substantial capital of more than P3,000,000.00, it nonetheless ruled that the functions outsourced to it by Sagara were necessary and desirable in the latter's line of business. To be considered as a labor-only contractor, the lack of substantial capital of the contractor must concur with the fact that the employees' work directly relates to the main business of the principal. . . Primarily, Conqueror is presumed to have complied with all the requirements of a legitimate job contractor considering the Certificates of Registration issued to it by the DOLE. At any rate, Conqueror has a substantial capital of more than P3,000,000.00 with working premises at Unit 2807 Makati Corporate Office, City Land, Pasong Tamo Tower, Chino Roces Ave., Makati City. Having substantial capital and work premises of its own, Conqueror cannot be considered as a labor-only contractor by the alleged fact that respondents performed activities directly related to the main business of Sagara. To be considered a labor-only contractor, the lack of substantial capital or investment must concur with the fact that the work of the employees is directly related to the main business of the principal, which is not the case herein. This is shown by the use of the conjunction 'and' in Article 106 of the Labor Code and Section 5(i) of DO 18-02... Taking into consideration the surrounding circumstances of the case and applying the four-fold test, the Regional Director and the Secretary of DOLE aptly determined that Conqueror was a legitimate job contractor and, consequently, the employer of respondents.","the consolidated petitions are GRANTED. The Decision dated June 28, 2019 and the Resolution dated October 29, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 148896 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

"G.R. No. 243765, January 05, 2022","MALATE CONSTRUCTION DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION * AND GIOVANNI OLIVARES, PETITIONERS, VS. EXTRAORDINARY REALTY AGENTS & BROKERS COOPERATIVE, RESPONDENT.","MCDC, a domestic corporation, and its President Olivares, entered into a Marketing Agreement in July 2003 with ERABCO, a realty broker cooperative. ERABCO undertook to promote and sell MCDC's properties in Mahogany Villas, Laguna, and was entitled to a nine percent (9%) commission based on sales, payable in tranches upon fulfillment of specific conditions related to buyer submission of documents and release of take-out proceeds (especially for Pag-IBIG accounts). In 2005 and 2006, MCDC refused to pay ERABCO's commissions, leading ERABCO to file a complaint for sum of money with damages demanding the payment of P4,962,935.77 plus damages and attorney's fees. MCDC and Olivares denied the allegations, claiming ERABCO received a higher commission than lawfully due.","The Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila, Branch 47, rendered a Decision on October 21, 2013, awarding broker's commission and attorney's fees in favor of ERABCO. The RTC found that ERABCO sold 202 units, generating total sales of P140,461,655.56, and thus was entitled to a 9% commission of P12,641,549.00. Holding that MCDC had already paid P8,571,629.12, the RTC ordered MCDC and Olivares to solidarily pay the remaining balance of P4,069,919.88 plus legal interest and P50,000.00 attorney's fees. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the RTC's ruling in a Decision dated May 10, 2018, but modified the interest rates, holding that MCDC's subsequent act of 'buying back' units after loan proceeds were released did not absolve MCDC from paying the commission.","The Court held that the Marketing Agreement is the law between the parties and ERABCO fulfilled its burden of proof by complying with its obligations, making MCDC liable for the unpaid commission balance of P4,069,919.88. MCDC waived its right to question the admissibility of photocopies under the best evidence rule by failing to interpose a timely objection during the offer of evidence and by previously admitting the existence, genuineness, and due execution of the documents during pre-trial. The subsequent 'buy-back' of 44 units by MCDC does not negate its obligation to pay the commission as the sale transactions were completed upon the release of the take-out loan proceeds. However, the Court ruled that Giovanni Olivares, as a corporate officer, cannot be held personally and solidarily liable for MCDC's obligations because ERABCO failed to clearly and convincingly prove his bad faith or intentional wrongdoing, a requisite for piercing the veil of corporate fiction.","WHEREFORE, premises considered, the May 10, 2018 Decision and December 17, 2018 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 103092 are MODIFIED by DELETING Giovanni Olivares' personal liability. Malate Construction Development Corporation is hereby ORDERED TO PAY Extraordinary Realty Agents & Brokers Cooperative the amount of P4,069,919.88, with legal interest of twelve percent (12%) per annum reckoned from the filing of the complaint until June 30, 2013, and six percent (6%) per annum from July 1, 2013 until full satisfaction. The total amount due shall earn a legal interest of six percent (6%) per annum from the finality of this Decision until full satisfaction. SO ORDERED."
"A.C. No. 11439, January 04, 2022","BATAAN SHIPYARD AND ENGINEERING COMPANY INC., COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. ANTHONY JAY B. CONSUNJI, RESPONDENT.","BASECO is a stock corporation engaged in the leasing of real properties for pier and port operations, ship docking, provisioning and cargo handling. Meanwhile, Atty. Consunji was the legal counsel of BASECO from 2005-2011. According to the complaint, Atty. Consunji received several cash advances purportedly as payment for professional fees and taxes due to the government from BASECO in the total amount of P20,593,781.42. BASECO avers that Atty. Consunji failed to liquidate or account for the advanced professional fees and taxes he received. Likewise, he failed to render the professional services he was supposed to provide which include the titling of unregistered lands and reconstitution of lost titles in the Engineering Island. Further, he did not issue Official Receipts to BASECO with respect to the professional fees paid to him. BASECO sent a Demand Letter to Atty. Consunji asking him for accounting, liquidation and refund or reimbursement of the cash advances he received. However, Atty. Consunji failed to heed from its demand, leading to the filing of the instant administrative complaint. In his Comment, Atty. Consunji denies the charges against him. He argues that all the cash advances he received were liquidated and well accounted for. He submitted all the liquidation documents to the Finance Department of BASECO. He also cited the Ombudsman Resolution in OMB-C-C-13-0429 acquitting him of the charge of plunder and violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019 for lack of substantial proof to support the charges against him, and argued that he tried to obtain the records from the Finance Department of BASECO however, all the documents and records were seized by the PCGG on June 23, 2011. The IBP, through the Commission on Bar Discipline (CBD), recommended the dismissal of the administrative complaint against Atty. Consunji for lack of merit, finding that BASECO failed to establish the irregularities through substantial evidence, a recommendation which was approved and adopted by the IBP Board of Governors (BOG), subject to a P5,000.00 fine for failure to comply with the mandatory hearing requirement.","The Court finds that Atty. Consunji violated Rule 16.01, Canon 16, and Rules 18.01 and 18.03, Canon 18 of the Code of Professional Responsibility. Hence, the Court reverses the findings and recommendation of the IBP and holds Atty. Consunji administratively liable.","The Court holds that the complainant was able to prove by substantial evidence that Atty. Consunji committed acts in violation of his duties and obligations as a member of the Bar under the CPR. Violation of Rule 16.01, Canon 16 of the CPR: Atty. Consunji failed to provide evidence to show that he has already accounted for and liquidated the cash advances he received from BASECO. His explanation (that receipts were submitted to the Finance Department, which were later seized by the PCGG) is general, lacks substantiation, and is inadequate because he failed to retain copies of receipts or utilize legal remedies to compel the production of the alleged records. Violation of Rules 18.01 and 18.03 of Canon 18: Atty. Consunji was remiss in fulfilling his obligation to his client. He received P4,350,000.00 and P2,730,000.00 for the titling and reconstitution services, respectively, but failed to complete the engagements. His fees were exorbitant considering BASECO successfully secured the reconstitution later for only P200,000.00 using another lawyer. The act of receiving money as acceptance fee for legal services in handling complainant's case and subsequently failing to render such services is a clear violation of Canon 18 of the CPR.","WHEREFORE, premises considered, respondent Atty. Anthony Jay B. Consunji is found GUILTY of violation of Rule 16.01, Canon 16, and Rule 18.01 and Rule 18.03, Canon 18 of the Code of Professional Responsibility. For reasons above-stated, he is DISBARRED from the practice of law and his name is ORDERED STRICKEN OFF from the Roll of Attorneys. Further, he is ORDERED to Return to Bataan Shipyard and Engineering Company Inc. the amount of P12,312,781.42 intended for the payment of certain taxes to the Province of Bataan and the Bureau of Internal Revenue, the amounts of P3,150,000.00 and P2,530,000.00 as excess legal fees he received from the latter for his failure to complete his engagements which shall earn interest of six percent (6%) per annum from the finality of this Decision until full payment. He is further DIRECTED to submit proof of payment to the Court within ten (10) days from his full payment.

"A.M. No. P-12-3091 [Formerly OCA IPI No. 10-3426-P], January 04, 2022","CLERK OF COURT YVONNE Q. RIVERA, COMPLAINANT, VS. REX J. GEROCHE, CASH CLERK III, MUNICIPAL TRIAL COURT IN CITIES, KABANKALAN CITY, NEGROS OCCIDENTAL, RESPONDENT.","This administrative case stemmed from the Complaint-Affidavit [2] filed before the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) on June 28, 2010, by Yvonne Q. Rivera (complainant) , Clerk of Court IV, Municipal Trial Court in Cities (MTCC) , Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental, against Rex J. Geroche (respondent) , Cash Clerk III of the same MTCC, for malversation, falsification of documents, and gross dishonesty committed in the performance of his duties. In the complaint-affidavit, complainant alleged that respondent was appointed to his position on December 15, 2006. His duties included the issuance of official receipts, deposit of collections, deposit and withdrawal of cash bonds, maintenance of books of accounts, and preparation and transmittal of monthly reports concerning the Judiciary Development Fund (JDF) , Legal Research Fund (LRF) , and Fiduciary Fund (FF) . However, in February 2010, respondent stopped reporting for work after being instructed by complainant to submit the reports for the JDF, Special Allowance for the Judiciary (SAJ) , Mediation Fund, LRF, and FF to the State Auditor... Complainant examined respondent's files, and found out that reports and documents were missing... Later, respondent presented himself and admitted to complainant and the Presiding Judge that he had misappropriated office funds. Sometime thereafter, complainant received a letter from the Court directing her to explain the failure to submit monthly reports for the JDF, SAJ, FF, and General Fund from August 2009 to June 2010. Complainant was surprised to receive such letter considering that she had already signed the reports and believed that these had already been transmitted to Manila... upon further investigation, complainant discovered that the collections covered by the reports were actually not deposited... The OCA directed respondent to comment on the complaint, but instead of filing his comment, respondent informed the OCA that he had already resigned effective August 23, 2010, and that he would no longer submit a comment. [4] On September 3, 2012, the OCA submitted its report recommending respondent's dismissal from the service with forfeiture of all retirement benefits except accrued leave credits for gross dishonesty. [5] On February 20, 2013, the Court directed the OCA to conduct a financial audit of the books of accounts of complainant and to withhold all cash benefits due her... On June 1, 2016, the Court... directed complainant to explain why the FF withdrawals amounting to P784,477.00 were not supported by documents and why there was failure to deposit collections amounting to P76,690.60. Meanwhile, complainant compulsorily retired on November 29, 2016. On August 24, 2020, complainant filed a motion for the early resolution... She also alleged that upon learning of the remaining undocumented withdrawals of respondent, she immediately made deposits in the total amount of P263,650.00 for the purpose of having her retirement benefits processed... A review of the documents shows that respondent x x x, who was in charge of the collections and deposits of the judiciary funds, incurred the following shortages which were restituted by [complainant]: [Table showing Total Shortages of PHP 340,340.00]. The OCA reiterated its initial finding that respondent's actions placed his honesty and integrity in serious doubt and that his resignation did not render the administrative case moot and academic. [15] As to complainant, the OCA observed that although she had no participation in the unauthorized withdrawals of the MTCC's funds, she was remiss in the discharge of her functions as Clerk of Court when she failed to closely supervise the financial transactions of the court... As such, the OCA found complainant guilty of simple neglect of duty and recommended the penalty of fine in the amount of P10,000.00...","The Court is in accord with the findings and recommendations of the OCA as regards complainant, and also finds respondent guilty of grave misconduct pursuant to prevailing jurisprudence. Both respondent and complainant are administratively liable for the missing court funds. ... A. Respondent is guilty of serious dishonesty and grave misconduct. ... B. Complainant is liable for simple neglect of duty.","The Court is in accord with the findings and recommendations of the OCA as regards complainant, and also finds respondent guilty of grave misconduct pursuant to prevailing jurisprudence. Both respondent and complainant are administratively liable for the missing court funds. ... A. Respondent is guilty of serious dishonesty and grave misconduct. ... B. Complainant is liable for simple neglect of duty. ... In imposing the appropriate penalties against respondent and complainant, the Court takes into account the recent amendments to, and the application of, Rule 140 of the Rules of Court regarding disciplinary proceedings of lower court personnel. ... The penalty to be imposed against respondent is based on the URACCS; a claim of resignation will not prevent the imposition of appropriate penalty. ... Similar with Flores, the application of Rule 140 will be more prejudicial to herein respondent as he will be meted with separate penalties for the two administrative offenses. Accordingly, for his dishonesty and serious misconduct, respondent shall suffer the penalty of dismissal with the corresponding accessory penalties under the URACCS. ... The Court still deems it proper to impose the penalty of dismissal against him. It bears emphasis that the precipitate resignation of a government employee shall not render moot the administrative case against him, and will not preclude the finding of any administrative liability to which he shall be answerable. ... The penalty of fine against complainant is based on Rule 140. Simple neglect of duty under Rule 140 is classified as a less serious charge punishable with suspension... or a fine of not less than P35,000.00 but not exceeding P100,000.00. In view of complainant's compulsory retirement, a fine will be the appropriate penalty. ... Thus, a fine of P10,000.00 against complainant, as recommended by the OCA, will be appropriate and likewise commensurate to the clean record that she had in her 30 years of service.","WHEREFORE, the Court finds respondent Rex J. Geroche, former Cash Clerk III, Municipal Trial Court in Cities, Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental, GUILTY of Serious Dishonesty and Grave Misconduct. He is hereby DISMISSED from the service, with forfeiture of retirement benefits, cancellation of eligibility, perpetual disqualification from holding public office, and barred from taking civil service examinations. The monetary value of his earned leave credits, withheld salaries, bonuses and allowances, if any, shall be applied to the total amount of his shortages paid by Yvonne Q. Rivera, former Clerk of Court IV, Municipal Trial Court in Cities, Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental, which is P340,340.00. Let a Hold Departure Order be ISSUED against respondent Geroche. Yvonne Q. Rivera, former Clerk of Court IV, Municipal Trial Court in Cities, Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental, is found GUILTY of Simple Neglect of Duty and is hereby FINED in the amount of P10,000.00 to be paid to the Court within 30 days from notice. She is cleared from her financial accountabilities considering that all the shortages incurred in the handling of the judiciary funds as far as the subject court is concerned have been fully restituted... In the light of this pronouncement, she is now ALLOWED to process her retirement papers. The Clerk of Court of the Municipal Trial Court in Cities, Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental, is hereby DIRECTED to: REFUND complainant Rivera the amount of P263,650.00, representing the amount she paid for the undocumented withdrawals if the same be later found to have been returned to their claimants/bondsmen; OPEN an account for the Sheriffs Trust Fund collections... and WITHDRAW the Sheriffs Trust Fund collections deposited to the Fiduciary Fund LBP SA No. 1171-0001-53 and TRANSFER them to the account to be opened for the Sheriffs Trust Fund. The Presiding Judge of the Municipal Trial Court in Cities, Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental, is AUTHORIZED to withdraw the Sheriffs Trust Fund pursuant to OCA Circular No. 99-2014 dated July 31, 2014, and is further DIRECTED to MONITOR all financial transactions of the court in strict adherence to the issuances of this Court on the proper handling of all Judiciary funds. The Office of Administrative Services, Office of the Court Administrator, is DIRECTED to: COMPUTE the balance of earned leave credits of respondent Geroche... The Finance Division, Financial Management Office, Office of the Court Administrator, is DIRECTED to: COMPUTE the monetary value of the earned leave credits and unpaid salaries and bonuses, if any, of respondent Geroche... APPLY the proceeds to the cash accountabilities incurred by respondent Geroche in the Fiduciary Fund of the Municipal Trial Court in Cities, Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental, amounting to P321,693.00... In the event that the said proceeds are insufficient to cover cash accountabilities, respondent Geroche is ORDERED to RESTITUTE the remaining balance within 30 days upon receipt of notice. The Legal Office, Office of the Court Administrator, is hereby DIRECTED to FILE the appropriate criminal and civil actions against respondent Geroche. SO ORDERED."
"A.C. No. 10897, January 04, 2022","TONY PETER PARTSCH, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. REYNALDO A. VITORILLO, RESPONDENT.","In March 2012, Partsch, a Swiss national, desired to purchase a piece of beachfront real property located in Bayabas, Cagayan de Oro. Atty. Vitorillo claimed ownership over 800 square meters of the said beachfront lot (subject property), representing that 100 square meters were titled under his name, and the remaining 700 square meters were pending registration, expected in three months. Atty. Vitorillo offered to sell the property for P2,500,000.00. On April 4, 2012, Partsch tendered P250,000.00 as partial payment, but no deed of absolute sale was executed. When Partsch followed up in July 2012, Atty. Vitorillo gave excuses, stating the 700-square-meter portion was compensation for legal services and under litigation, rescheduling the delivery of documents to September 2012. In September 2012, Atty. Vitorillo claimed the case was not yet done and advised Partsch to just possess and fence the property, which Partsch refused. On November 24, 2012, Atty. Vitorillo informed Partsch he was no longer selling the subject property, rejected the demand for reimbursement of the down payment plus interests, and promised a deed of rescission and a promissory note, which never materialized. After formal demand, Atty. Vitorillo suggested proceeding with the original sale if Partsch paid the balance in full, which Partsch declined. Mediation failed, with Atty. Vitorillo intimidating Partsch. Two years later, the reimbursement remained unpaid, leading Partsch to file this disbarment complaint on September 1, 2015. Atty. Vitorillo admitted entering a contract to sell but denied promising delivery within three months, stating Partsch knew the property was under litigation. He held himself responsible for returning the P250,000.00 but not the interest claimed. Partsch maintained that Atty. Vitorillo had never furnished a written contract and had committed fraud by misrepresenting absolute ownership and advising a foreigner (Partsch) on owning beach property.","The Court finds Atty. Vitorillo guilty of deceitful conduct proscribed by Canon 1, Rule 1.01 of the CPR. In the contract to sell that Atty. Vitorillo himself submitted before the Court, Atty. Vitorillo expressly named himself as the seller and absolute owner of the subject property. The verity of such contractual status rests upon a single fact – that Atty. Vitorillo held absolute ownership over the entire 800-square-meter subject property at the time he offered it for sale to Partsch. The facts at hand reveal that he did not. Atty. Vitorillo failed to show the factual bases of his absolute ownership, i.e., deeds of transfer or certificates of title, and the litigated main lot that included the subject property was still unregistered in the names of Atty. Vitorillo's clients. Furthermore, only 700 square meters were clearly assigned to Atty. Vitorillo in the Deed of Partition and Assignment. The Court is inclined to view Atty. Vitorillo's claims of ownership over the 800-square-meter subject property as specious. There is proof that Atty. Vitorillo truly misrepresented himself as the subject property's owner to Partsch. In so doing, Atty. Vitorillo demeaned the integrity of legal processes and tarnished the image of impartiality of the courts, per Canon 7, Rule 7.03 of the CPR. Despite knowing the prohibition against foreign ownership of Philippine private lands, Atty. Vitorillo still marketed the subject property for sale to Partsch, a Swiss national, and advised Partsch to proceed with fencing the property without acceptable guarantee of title, violating Canon 1, Rule 1.02.","WHEREFORE, respondent Atty. Reynaldo A. Vitorillo is found GUILTY of deceitful conduct, gross misconduct, violation of Canons 1 and 7, Rules 1.01, 1.02, and 7.03 of the Code of Professional Responsibility, and violation of the Lawyer's Oath. Respondent Atty. Reynaldo A. Vitorillo is SUSPENDED for three years, effective upon receipt of this Decision. Atty. Vitorillo is STERNLY WARNED that a repetition of the same or a similar act shall be dealt with more severely. Respondent Atty. Reynaldo A. Vitorillo is DIRECTED to immediately file a Manifestation to the Court that his suspension has started, copy furnished all courts and quasi-judicial bodies where he has entered his appearance as counsel.","Respondent Atty. Reynaldo A. Vitorillo is found GUILTY of deceitful conduct, gross misconduct, violation of Canons 1 and 7, Rules 1.01, 1.02, and 7.03 of the Code of Professional Responsibility, and violation of the Lawyer's Oath.

"A.C. No. 10511, January 04, 2022","MILAGROS MELAD-ONG, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. PLACIDO M. SABBAN, RESPONDENT.","The controversy began on November 22, 1984, when complainant's father, Jose Melad (Jose), filed a civil suit [1] against Concepcion Tuyuan (Concepcion) for Reconveyance, Reivindication and Annulment of Instrument with Damages for the illegal transfer of title of a 272,045-square meter property originally owned by Fe Tuyuan, which was now covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-52533. Jose was represented by Atty. Simeon Agustin, while Concepcion was represented by Atty. Hilarion L. Aquino. On May 31, 1985, respondent, on behalf of his clients Rita Maguigad-Baquiran, Teodorico Maguigad, Estelita Maguigad Dalupang, Alberto Maguigad, Rogelio Maguigad, Edna Maguigad Managelot, and Totoy Maguigad (collectively, Maguigads), filed a Complaint in Intervention [4] on Civil Case No. 3413. On January 26, 1995, Jose passed away and was substituted by his surviving heirs (Heirs of Jose), including complainant. In May 1995, Concepcion executed a Deed of Confirmation of Attorney's Fees [5] in favor of Atty. Benito Sabban (respondent’s father) and transferred to him 10 hectares of the land. This led to illegal retention grants by DAR to Concepcion, Atty. Benito, and respondent, despite the ongoing litigation. In February 2008, respondent drafted a Compromise Agreement [8] which was granted by RTC Branch 2 of Tuguegarao, Cagayan on April 1, 2008. Respondent acted as counsel for both the intervenors (Maguigads) and the defendant (Concepcion) in this agreement. On the same date, Concepcion executed two Deeds of Absolute Sale, transferring 70,000 sq. m. (part of her retained area) to respondent, his mother and siblings. When the Heirs of Jose later applied for retention, they discovered the illegal retentions made in 1995. Subsequently, respondent negotiated the sale of about 130,000 sq. m. of the land to Camella Homes, part of which encroached upon the area claimed by the plaintiffs and intervenors. On July 17, 2014, complainant filed this disbarment case against respondent, alleging unlawful conduct in acquiring interest in litigated property, conflict of interest, execution of falsities in the compromise agreement, and failure to disclose illegal retentions. The IBP-CBD recommended suspension for one year, but the IBP-BOG initially adopted this finding, then reversed itself upon reconsideration, dismissing the case on the limited ground that complainant failed to prove respondent was responsible for the alleged loss of property, based on a limited scope agreed upon during a clarificatory hearing.","The Court reverses the findings of the IBP-BOG and finds respondent administratively liable for violating Canons 1, 15 and 17, and Rules 1.01, 10.01 and 15.03 of the CPR and Article 1491 of the Civil Code.","The Court rules that respondent violated Rule 15.03 of Canon 15 and Canon 17 in relation to Rule 1.01 of Canon 1 of the CPR by representing conflicting interests (acting as counsel for both the intervenors Maguigads and defendant Concepcion in the Compromise Agreement, and later filing a Motion for Reconsideration on behalf of Concepcion against his former clients, the Maguigads). Respondent also violated Article 1491 of the Civil Code by acquiring a portion of the contested property from Concepcion on the same day the Compromise Agreement was judicially approved, and by illegally retaining two hectares of the land subject of the litigation while the case was still pending. Furthermore, respondent violated Rule 10.01 of the CPR for committing falsehood and misleading the Court by failing to disclose to his clients and the RTC the illegal retentions granted to Atty. Benito, Concepcion, and himself, leading the parties to approve a prejudicial Compromise Agreement.","GUILTY of violating Rule 1.01, Rule 10.01, Rule 15.03, and Canon 17 of the Code of Professional Responsibility, and Article 1491 of the Civil Code of the Philippines and SUSPENDS him from the practice of law for two (2) years effective from the date of his receipt of this Decision, with a STERN WARNING that his commission of similar offenses will be dealt with more severely."
"G.R. No. 240337, January 04, 2022","FRANCIS O. MORALES PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES RESPONDENT.","On June 5, 2013, an information was filed against Francis O. Morales (petitioner) for the crime of Reckless Imprudence Resulting in Damage to Property and Multiple Physical Injuries. The accusatory portion of the information reads: That on or about 14th day of May, 2013, in the City of Angeles, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, being then the driver of a Mitsubishi Delica Van with Plate No. XKZ-528 owned and driven by Francis O. Morales, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously drive and operate the said vehicle along Sto. Rosario St. corner San Jose St., Brgy. San Jose, Angeles City, in a careless, reckless and imprudent manner and in utter disregard of traffic laws, rules, and regulations and without taking the necessary precaution and care to avoid accident, thereby causing such recklessness and imprudence to hit and bump a Isuzu Jitney with Plate No. CWR-138 owned by a certain Noel F. Garcia a resident of 333 Dela Paz Norte, CSFP and driven by Rico M. Mendoza as a result thereof, the driver of said Isuzu Jitney with Plate No. CWR-138 sustained serious physical injuries and the three (3) other passengers namely: Lailani Mendoza, Myrna Cunanan and Albert Vital sustained slight physical injuries, likewise said Isuzu Jitney with Plate No. CWR-138 incurred damages in the estimated amount of THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PESOS (P350,000.00), Philippine Currency to the prejudice of said complainant. ALL CONTRARY TO LAW. (Emphasis supplied) Petitioner pleaded not guilty to the offense charged. Thereafter, trial ensued. The prosecution presented three witnesses, namely Rico Mendoza (Rico), Leilani Mendoza[7] (Leilani), and Myrna Cunanan (Myrna). The defense presented petitioner as its sole witness.[8] The witnesses for the prosecution alleged that on May 15, 2013 at around 3:00 a.m., Rico, Leilani, and Myrna, together with Albert Vital (Albert; collectively, private complainants), were on board a passenger jeepney with Plate No. CWR-138. Rico was driving the jeepney. They came from Maimpis and were traversing the road of Sto. Rosario Street, Angeles City on their way to Angeles City Market. They were on the right lane. Meanwhile, the Delica van driven by petitioner with Plate No. XKZ-528 was on the opposite lane going to San Fernando. Petitioner suddenly overtook the vehicle in front of him, causing him to occupy the lane of the jeepney. Rico tried to avoid the collision to no avail as petitioner was driving in a fast speed. Petitioner bumped the jeepney resulting in physical injuries to the passengers and driver as well as extensive damage to the jeepney amounting to P350,000.00. Rico suffered a deep laceration in the forehead and a cervical strain. He underwent suturing and hospitalization in the amount of P14,345.00. Leilani sustained skin and soft tissue avaltion, posterior lateral aspect right forearm and sprain ankle, costing her hospitalization expenses in the amount of P34,763.50. Myra suffered multiple physical injury and incurred damages in the amount of P3,045.00. Albert incurred hospitalization expenses in the amount of P2,895.80.[9] Petitioner countered that after a night of merry making, he and his friends decided to go to a gotohan in Angeles City at the midnight of May 15, 2013. He rode his Delica van with his 13-year-old son. They stayed at the gotohan until 3:00 a.m. On their way home, they passed Sto. Rosario Street bound for San Fernando City. They occupied the inner lane of the road going to San Fernando. The right side of the jeepney driven by Rico suddenly hit the Delica van. Petitioner and his son were injured and brought to the Sacred Heart Medical Center. The Delica van also sustained extensive damages.[10]","WHEREFORE, the motion is DENIED. Our Resolution dated September 21, 2020 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION in that: (1) petitioner is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of reckless imprudence resulting in multiple slight physical injuries and damage to property, and is sentenced to suffer the penalty of public censure for each of the resulting slight physical injuries committed to private complainants Rico Mendoza, Leilani Mendoza, and Myrna Cunanan, and to pay a fine in the amount of P150,000.00 as penalty for the resulting damage to property; (2) petitioner is ORDERED to pay temperate damages in the amount of P8,000.00 to Spouses Rico and Leilani Mendoza and P2,000.00 to Myrna Cunanan; (3) petitioner is ORDERED to pay Noel G. Garcia or his authorized representative temperate damages in the amount of P150,000.00; (4) all monetary awards shall earn six percent (6%) interest per annum from the finality of this Resolution until fully paid. SO ORDERED.","We affirm petitioner's conviction but modify the penalty imposed. We rule that Ivler v. Hon. Judge Modesto-San Pedro is a good law, notwithstanding the few stray cases that allowed the ""complexing"" of the effects of a single quasi-offense. Forbidding the application of Article 48 of the RPC to quasi-offenses and their resultant acts/effects preserves the conceptual distinction between quasi-crimes and intentional felonies under the RPC. We thus declare that People v. De los Santos is abandoned. Article 48 does not apply to quasi-offenses under Article 365 because reckless imprudence is a distinct crime and not a mere way of committing a crime. The prosecution was able to establish the elements of reckless imprudence beyond reasonable doubt, as petitioner was driving on the wrong side of the road in violation of Section 41 of R.A. No. 4136. The reckless act of petitioner resulted in slight physical injuries to Rico, Leilani, and Myrna. Pursuant to the sixth paragraph of Article 365, the proper penalty for reckless imprudence resulting in slight physical injuries is public censure (the penalty next lower in degree to arresto menor), which shall be imposed for each slight physical injury committed. With respect to the resulting damage to property, petitioner should pay a fine in the amount of P150,000.00 conformably with the third paragraph of Article 365. Temperate damages for lost income (P8,000.00 to Spouses Rico and Leilani, P2,000.00 to Myrna) and damage to property (P150,000.00 to Noel G. Garcia) are also awarded.",GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of reckless imprudence resulting in multiple slight physical injuries and damage to property

"G.R. No. 239878, February 28, 2022","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PETITIONER, VS. THE HONORABLE SANDIGANBAYAN (FIFTH DIVISION), ALFONSO SERVANA CASURRA, LEONARDO LUIB EDERA, JR., JOCELYN ELEAZAR MONTEROS, MARIA SEPARA GEOTINA, ARMANDO MAPA ELUMBA, CARLO REYNALDO FAROLAN LOZADA, JR., AND ROSEMARIE V. PALACIO, RESPONDENTS.","This case arose from a complaint filed by Task Force Abono, Field Investigation Office (Task Force) of the Office of the Ombudsman (OMB) against respondents local government officials of Surigao City: Casurra is the city mayor, Edera is the city treasurer, Monteros is the city accountant, Geotina is the city engineer and a member of the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC), Elumba is the city general services officer and a BAC member, and Lozada is the city legal officer and a BAC member. Respondent Rosemarie V. Palacio (Palacio) is a private individual who is the proprietress of Rosa ""Mia"" Trading. The task force alleged that in early 2004, the Department of Budget and Management Office issued a special allotment order amounting to P723,000,000.00 for the implementation of the Farm Inputs and Farm Implements Program of the Department of Agriculture. Out of the amount, the City Government of Surigao, Surigao del Norte received P5,000,000.00. Thus, the city, through respondents, entered into a contract with Palacio and Rosa ""Mia"" Trading for the purchase of 3,332 kilograms of Elements 15-15-30+T.E. Foliar Fertilizer for P1,500 per kilogram, or a total amount of 4,998,000.00. This was allegedly done without the requisite public bidding under the procurement law. The city paid Rosa ""Mia"" Trading in two tranches. Subsequently, the Commission on Audit (COA) post-audited the transaction. It was discovered that there is a variance between the cost of fertilizers procured and the cost of fertilizers locally canvassed resulting to an overpricing. As a result, the COA issued on June 14, 2006 a Notice of Disallowance (NOD), which was subsequently amended on March 19, 2007. Thereafter, on July 4, 2011, Task Force Abono filed the Complaint against respondents for violation of Section 3(e) and (g) of RA 3019, Sections 10, 18, and 21 of RA 9184, otherwise known as the ""Government Procurement Reform Act,"" and its Implementing Rules and Regulations, as well as administrative charges. The OMB issued a resolution dated October 5, 2016 finding probable cause for the filing of an Information for violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019. This was approved by the Ombudsman on March 22, 2017. On September 11, 2017, an Information dated May 2, 2017 was filed before the Sandiganbayan charging respondents with violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019. Then on September 22, 2017, respondent Monteros filed a motion to quash information/dismiss the case and a motion (A) to quash/hold in abeyance the release of the warrant of arrest; and (B) to defer arraignment and other proceedings. Monteros claimed that her right to speedy disposition of cases was violated because of the length of time that had passed from the COA investigation in 2006 to the filing of the Information before the Sandiganbayan in 2017. There was inordinate delay of 11 years and three months on the part of the OMB. This delay, according to Monteros, divested the OMB of the authority to file the case against her; the instant Information therefore is void, and the anti-graft court has no jurisdiction over the offense charged. Monteros subsequently moved to hold the release of the warrant of arrest and to defer arraignment and other proceedings as a consequence of the pendency of the question on the Sandiganbayan’s jurisdiction. On September 25, 2017, respondents Casurra, Edera, Geotina, and Elumba filed their omnibus motion to quash information and to defer arraignment. Respondent Lozada subsequently manifested that he adopts this motion. Like Monteros, respondents claimed that there was inordinate delay from the fact-finding phase up to the filing of the Information. To note, records show that respondent Palacio did not file a similar motion. On October 19, 2017, the Office of the Special Prosecutor filed its consolidated comment/opposition to the motions filed by accused. The prosecution countered that the delay in this case is reasonable. Delay becomes inordinate if there are arbitrary, vexatious, and oppressive actions or inactions that are attendant to the proceedings within the context of the particular circumstances attendant thereto. The prosecution stressed that the instant case is part of the controversial ""Fertilizer Fund Scam"" that involved high ranking officials of the government and various non-governmental organizations; investigation the case thus requires diligence, thoroughness, and necessarily, time.","In its November 27, 2017 Resolution, the Sandiganbayan granted the motions of respondents and dismissed the criminal case against them. The anti-graft court confirmed that more than 11 years have passed from the COA's issuance of the NOD until the filing of the Information. It held that the delay is not reasonable. The prosecution's excuse that the many layers of review and the meticulous scrutiny that the case necessitates time, failed to convince. No other plausible reason was provided to explain the delay of more than 11 years. Also, the delay cannot be attributed to the accused as they have timely filed their affidavits and supporting documents with the OMB. The anti-graft court added that the delay caused prejudice and anxiety to the accused. Resultantly, respondents are acquitted. The prosecution moved for reconsideration. In its April 18, 2018 Resolution, the Sandiganbayan denied the motion. It added that respondents (being retired from service and dependent on their pensions) suffered from public humiliation and embarrassment due to this criminal complaint that dragged on for many years. The court likewise reiterated that the prosecution failed to show that the delay was attributable to respondents. Further, the Sandiganbayan in its September 7, 2018 Resolution dismissed the criminal case as regards Palacio as well.","The petition has no merit. The Court finds that the Sandiganbayan did not commit grave abuse of discretion in dismissing the criminal cases. The Court, applying the guidelines in Cagang v. Sandiganbayan, finds that there is a violation of respondents' right to speedy disposition of cases. The Sandiganbayan erred in including the period for fact-finding in its determination of the period relevant to inordinate delay. However, considering the period of preliminary investigation alone (six years, two months, and seven days), the delay was unreasonable, and the prosecution failed to justify it, having only cited institutional delay and complexity without proving specific reasons relevant to this case. Respondents suffered prejudice (anxiety, public humiliation, and impairment of defense) due to the protracted period of uncertainty. The right was timely invoked by filing a motion for reconsideration before the OMB and subsequent motions to quash before the Sandiganbayan. Considering all the foregoing, respondents' right to speedy disposition of cases was undoubtedly infringed. The Sandiganbayan therefore did not commit grave abuse of discretion in dismissing the criminal case against them.","WHEREFORE, the petition is DISMISSED. The November 27, 2017 Resolution and April 18, 2018 Resolution of the Sandiganbayan in Criminal Case No. SB-17-CRM-1669 are hereby AFFIRMED."

Vito Rapal (Rapal) was the former mayor of Corella. Sometime in 2009, Corella conducted a public bidding for the rehabilitation and improvement of its municipal waterworks system project. Philkonstrak emerged as the winning bidder. Subsequently, Corella, through then Mayor Rapal, entered into a contract agreement (contract) with Philkonstrak for the rehabilitation and improvement of the municipal waterworks system for a total amount of P15,997,732.63. Pursuant to the contract, Philkonstrak procured the materials, equipment, and the labor force for the mobilization of the construction works. As of December 2009, Philkonstrak accomplished more than 50% of the work essential for the project for which Philkonstrak expended the amount of P8,233,000.00. When Corella, through Tocmo, refused to pay and denied liability, Philkonstrak was forced to suspend its construction works. Consequently, Philkonstrak sent Corella, through Tocmo, a formal demand letter to pay for the actual expenses incurred by Philkonstrak. Philkonstrak also sent a demand letter to Rapal. Tocmo, in his reply, denied liability and questioned the validity of the contract. He averred that Rapal had no authority to enter into such contract during his term as mayor of Corella. On April 28, 2011, Philkonstrak filed before the CIAC a complaint for collection of sum of money against Corella and Rapal, as Rapal was the mayor at the time the contract was signed and whose signature appeared thereon. Rapal filed his answer, admitting the material allegations of the complaint and averring that he was authorized to enter into the contract with Philkonstrak for the rehabilitation/improvement of the waterworks system of Corella in accordance with Municipal Ordinance No. 2010-02. Corella filed its answer, denying the material allegations of the complaint. It asserted that the contract is not binding because Municipal Ordinance No. 2010-02 was in violation of Article 107(g) of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of Republic Act No. (RA) 7160 otherwise known as the 'Local Government Code of 1991.' The CIAC issued a Decision finding the contract between Philkonstrak and Corella to be valid. The CIAC ordered Corella to pay Philkonstrak the total amount of P12,844,650.00, which includes claims for unpaid billings, delivered but uninstalled materials, and accrued interest. The CIAC exonerated Rapal. Corella filed a motion for correction of final award dated November 21, 2011, which the CIAC denied as a prohibited pleading. Corella appealed to the CA through a petition for review. The CA dismissed Corella's petition for review, finding no cogent reason to reverse and set aside the October 27, 2011 CIAC Decision. Corella then filed this petition for review on certiorari before the Supreme Court.","The petition is granted in part. The contract between Philkonstrak and Corella is not valid and binding. However, Corella is obliged to pay Philkonstrak on the basis of the principle of quantum meruit.","The CIAC Decision rendered in favor of Philkonstrak had already attained finality since Corella's Motion for Correction of Final Award did not toll the period to appeal given that it did not raise the accepted grounds stated in Section 17.1 of the CIAC Rules therefor. The Motion for Correction only questioned the final award based on the quantum meruit principle, and thus, was properly considered by the CIAC as a motion for reconsideration, a prohibited pleading. The CA nor this Court may not anymore step in to modify or correct a quasi-judicial agency's decision that has already been deemed final and executory. However, the Contract Agreement between the Municipality of Corella and Philkonstrak Development Corporation is declared NULL and VOID because the underlying appropriation ordinance (Municipal Ordinance No. 2010-02) was null and void for failing to obtain the required affirmative vote of a majority of all the sanggunian members. Despite the invalidity of the contract, the principle of quantum meruit is applicable in this case. The Court has held in the past that recovery on the basis of quantum meruit is allowed despite the invalidity or absence of a written contract between a contractor and a government agency. Corella cannot be unjustly enriched and allowed to retain the benefits of the services rendered by Philkonstrak without properly paying for it. To deny Philkonstrak compensation for more than 50% of the services it already rendered, services which clearly benefited Corella, would be the height of injustice.","WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED IN PART. The Contract Agreement between the Municipality of Corella and Philkonstrak Development Corporation is declared NULL and VOID. The January 30, 2015 Decision and June 9, 2015 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP. No. 06516 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Based on the principle of quantum meruit, the Court hereby renders judgment as follows: (a) The Municipality of Corella is hereby ordered to pay Philkonstrak Development Corporation: (i) The amount of P8,233,000.00, representing the value of work done and materials supplied for the rehabilitation and improvement of the waterworks system of the Municipality of Corella; (ii) The amount of P4,000,000.00 representing the value of materials needed for the rehabilitation and improvement of the waterworks system of the Municipality of Corella which Philkonstrak Development Corporation had purchased and delivered but were not installed due to the repudiation of the Contract Agreement by the Municipality of Corella. (b) The Municipality of Corella is hereby ordered to pay Philkonstrak accrued legal interest from the time the CIAC Decision became final on October 27, 2011, at the rate of 12% per annum, until June 30, 2013. From July 1, 2013 until full payment of the amount is made, the accrued legal interest shall be 6% per annum. The total of the foregoing amount shall earn interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from finality of the Decision until full payment. (c) Philkonstrak Development Corporation shall pay two-thirds (2/3), and the Municipality of Corella shall pay one-third (1/3), of the cost of arbitration... Thus, the Municipality of Corella shall reimburse the amount advanced by Philkonstrak Development Corporation in the amount of P87,721.76, representing one-third of the total arbitration fees. SO ORDERED."

NORA, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","On August 6, 2011, a confidential informant notified Police Officer (PO) 3 Lendro Tutor about the illegal drug activities of Nora and her co-accused in Davao City, leading to a buy-bust operation where PO3 Tutor was the designated poseur buyer using a marked P1,000.00 bill. The co-accused handed the marked money to Nora, who took out one elongated transparent plastic sachet containing what appeared to be shabu and discreetly gave it to PO3 Tutor. After Nora's arrest, PO3 Tutor recovered one big plastic sachet containing shabu weighing 1.0923 grams and forty (40) pieces of elongated sachets containing shabu weighing 3.5437 grams, along with P10,150.00 cash. Due to safety concerns, the marking of the seized items and the inventory were done at the police station; the inventory was conducted only on August 8, 2011, two days after the seizure, but in the presence of required witnesses (media, DOJ, elected public official). The specimens tested positive for methamphetamine hydrochloride. Nora denied the charges, claiming arbitrary arrest while shopping and that a body search at the station yielded nothing. The Regional Trial Court (RTC) found Nora guilty of violation of Sections 5 and 11 of RA 9165. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the RTC ruling but modified the penalty for Illegal Possession (Criminal Case No. 70,389-11). Nora appealed, contending that the elements of the crimes were not established and that the chain of custody was broken.","the appeal is hereby GRANTED. The assailed August 16, 2018 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 01746-MIN is REVERSED and SET ASIDE.","The Supreme Court ruled that the prosecution failed to establish the very corpus delicti of the crimes charged and an unbroken chain of custody. Although the elements of the crimes were prima facie met, the integrity and identity of the dangerous drugs were not established beyond reasonable doubt. The prosecution failed to establish the first, third, and fourth links in the chain of custody. Regarding the first link, PO3 Tutor failed to immediately mark the sachets at the place of apprehension and did not provide details on how the one sachet subject of the sale and the forty recovered sachets were segregated or identified. Regarding the third and fourth links, there were no informative details on how the seized drugs were handled and preserved by PO1 Marron (receiving officer) before transmittal to PSI Fabian (forensic chemist), and how PSI Fabian kept the items before presentation in court. Moreover, the police operatives failed to comply with Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 (old law), as the inventory was conducted two days after the seizure (August 8, 2011 vs. August 6, 2011), and the police failed to adequately explain this procedural deviation and the steps they took to preserve the integrity of the seized items during the delay. Consequently, the failure to prove the identity of the corpus delicti beyond reasonable doubt warrants acquittal.","Accused-appellant Zoraida Mariano a.k.a. Nora is ACQUITTED for failure of the prosecution to prove her guilt beyond reasonable doubt. She is ordered immediately RELEASED from detention, unless she is confined for any other lawful cause."
"G.R. No. 219495, February 28, 2022","REYNALDO P. CABATAN, PETITIONER, VS. SOUTHEAST ASIA SHIPPING CORP./ ATTY. ROMEO DALUSONG AND/OR MARITIME MANAGEMENT SERVICES, RESPONDENTS.","Petitioner Reynaldo P. Cabatan (Cabatan) was employed as an oiler by Southeast Asia Shipping Corp. (SEASCORP) on behalf of its principal, Maritime Management Services (Maritime Management) from 2006 to 2010.[6] Before deployment, he underwent his Pre-Employment Medical Examination (PEME) and was certified to be fit for sea duty.[7] On January 30, 2010, he boarded M/V BP Pioneer under a three month contract.[8] On March 29, 2010, while Cabatan was on his 12-hour duty, the spare parts assigned to one of the generators he was tasked to repair were delivered. He carried the spare parts along with a heavy connecting rod. At that point, the vessel, which had a restricted alley, suddenly swayed due to the big waves. This caused Cabatan to bend and nearly fall to his knees. Then, he felt excruciating pain in his scrotal/inguinal area. Despite feeling pain and numbness in his left leg all the way down, he continued to carry the parts and repaired the generator until he was relieved by another oiler.[9] After his duty, Cabatan went to his cabin and took a pain reliever. Shortly after, he went to the ship's clinic to have himself checked by the doctor on board. In the Report of Illness[10] by the ship's doctor, the latter advised him to rest until further observation since it may just be due to tiredness. Furthermore, the doctor ruled out hernia and trauma.[11] On May 19, 2010, Cabatan was re-examined by the doctor. He still felt pain during prolonged standing or while walking, with numbness of his lower extremity. However, the doctor concluded that this was normal considering his age and was just advised to take pain relievers.[12] Upon expiration of his contract on May 25, 2010, Cabatan disembarked the vessel at the port of Takoradi, Ghana and was repatriated back to the Philippines. Believing that the pain in his scrotal/inguinal area was normal and, as the doctor had advised, he took a complete rest for about a month.[13] Eventually, SEASCORP called him for possible deployment. He was sent to Merita Diagnostic Clinic (Merita), the company-accredited clinic, for his PEME. During his examination, Cabatan informed the doctor about the injury sustained while on board. Thus, the doctor asked him to get an x-ray of his scrotal/inguinal area and lumbar spine.[14] On July 2, 2010, Merita reported the following findings/recommendations regarding Cabatan's examination: NOTED: PERINEAL PAIN (WHILE WALKING) EXTENDING TO MEDIAL ASPECT OF BOTH THIGH *LUMBO SACRAL X-RAY RESULT: RETROLESTHESES L2 OVER L3 OSTEODEGENERATIVE CHANGES LS SACRALIZATION OF L5 ORTHOPAEDIC SURGEON ASSESSMENT: TO CONSIDER NERVE ROOT COMPRESSION FOR EMG NCV OF LOWER EXTREMITIES AND MRI OF LUMBOSACRAL OTHER REMARKS: GENITALS (+) PENILE IMPLANT RULE OUT BULGING MASS – CLEARED BY SURGEON HYPERTENSION CONTROLLED WITH MAINTENANCE: MICARDS PLUS 40 MG ONCE DAILY [15] On July 30, 2010, Cabatan also underwent Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the Lumbo-Sacral Spine. The findings were as follows: Central canal and bilateral neural foraminal stenosis, L4-L5 and L5-S1, secondary to posterior disc protrusion, ligamentum flaval thickening and facet arthropathy. Disc bulging, L2-L3 and L3-L4. Lumbar osteophytes with disc desiccations. Posterior annular tears, L4-L5 and L5-S1. Grade I spondylolisthesis, L4/L5. Subcutaneous cyst, left posterior wall of lumbar spine. x x x x [16] He also underwent EMG NCV which yielded the following results: Interpretation: Today's electrodiagnostic examination revealed findings compatible with a mild chronic lumbar radiculopathy involving the L4-5 and L5-S1 spinal roots. Kindly correlate clinically. x x x x [17] Cabatan further consulted Dr. Detabali of the De los Santos Hospital who advised him to have L4-S1 Laminectomy and L4-L5 Instrumented Posterolateral Fusion. Due to the costly price of the procedures, Cabatan asked for financial assistance from SEASCORP through its crewing manager, Mr. Aguinaldo, considering that he sustained his injury during his employment. Mr. Aguinaldo promised to relay the request to its principal, Maritime Management, but the request was left unheeded.[18] On August 26, 2010, Cabatan also consulted Dr. David M. Cabatan, Jr. (Dr. Cabatan), an orthopedic and spine surgeon, who made the following findings: DIAGNOSIS: SPINAL STENOSIS L4-L5 AND L5-S1 GRADE 1 SPONDYLOLISTHESIS, L4-L5 Mr. Reynaldo P. Cabatan is a 54 year old male, seaman, who first consulted the undersigned on August 20, 2010. He complained of greatly diminished standing and walking tolerance secondary to low back pain radiating down the lower extremities of about 6 months duration. This was left sided worse than right and was aggravated by 15 minutes of standing or walking. There was accompanying numbness and paresthesias of the lower extremities. On physical examination, Mr. Cabatan walked into the office bent forward and with a limp. There was reproduction of his pain with low back extension and left lateral flexion. He was able to walk on tiptoe and on heels without any difficulty. Trendelenburg test was negative. Nerve root tension signs were absent and Patrick's test was negative. Manual muscle testing revealed no more deficits. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbosacral spine revealed a grade 1 spondylolisthesis at L4-L5 causing moderate to severe spinal stenosis. There also were spondylotic changes at L5-S1 and L2-L3 causing mild to moderate stenosis. Mr. Cabatan has been advised surgical decompression of this spinal stenosis as symptoms have become quite disabling. The planned procedure as a laminectomy from L4-S1 and posterolateral instrumented fusion at L4-L5 due to the spondylisthesis. Risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed. He is to have a medical and cardiac clearance prior to the surgery. x x x x [19] Dr. Cabatan also estimated the total surgery cost amounting to P473,000.00.[20] On March 1, 2011, Cabatan filed a complaint[21] against the respondents for permanent and total disability benefits.[22] On the other hand, respondents maintained that during Cabatan's last employment contract, he underwent PEME and was certified fit for sea duty.[23] Upon completion of his contract on May 25, 2010, Cabatan disembarked the vessel. When he arrived in Manila, Cabatan did not report to the manning agency for the mandatory post-employment medical examination, nor request for medical assistance for any injury or illness.[24] After almost a year following the termination of his contract, Cabatan suddenly filed a complaint against respondents before the NLRC and claimed for total and permanent disability benefits, moral and exemplary damages, and attorney's fees.[25]","This petition for review on certiorari[1] seeks to annul and set aside the January 23, 2015 Decision[2] and July 20, 2015 Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 126155, which affirmed the April 26, 2012 Decision[4] and June 18, 2012 Resolution[5] of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) in NLRC LAC No. (OFW-M) 10-000897-11.","It is undisputed that Cabatan's employment contract with SEASCORP executed on January 30, 2010 is governed by the 2000 Amended Standard Terms and Conditions Governing the Overseas Employment of Filipino Seafarers On-Board Ocean-Going Ships (2000 POEA-SEC). Paragraph 3, Section 20 (B) thereof regarding disability benefits provides: B. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS FOR INJURY OR ILLNESS. — The liabilities of the employer when the seafarer suffers work-related injury or illness during the term of his contract are as follows: x x x x 3. Upon sign-off from the vessel for medical treatment, the seafarer is entitled to sickness allowance equivalent to his basic wage until he is declared fit to work by the company-designated physician or the degree of permanent disability has been assessed by the company-designated physician but in no case shall it exceed one hundred twenty (120) days. For this purpose, the seafarer shall submit himself to a post-employment medical examination by a company-designated physician within three working days upon his return except when he is physically incapacitated to do so, in which case, a written notice to the agency within the same period is deemed as compliance. Failure of the seafarer to comply with the mandatory reporting requirement shall result in his forfeiture of the right to claim the above benefits. (Emphasis supplied) x x x x Thus, in order to claim compensability under the forgoing section, it is required that the seafarer must have: (1) suffered a work-related illness or injury during the term of his contract; and (2) submitted himself to a mandatory post-employment medical examination within three (3) working days upon his arrival. ... Based on the foregoing, Cabatan's claim for disability benefits and other monetary awards prayed for by him must be denied. It is evident that Cabatan was repatriated due to the expiration of his contract. Regardless of the cause of his repatriation, he was required to submit himself to a post-employment medical examination by the company-designated physician within three working days upon his return in order to ascertain if he was really suffering from a work-related injury or illness. Cabatan may only be excused from such requirement if he was physically incapacitated to do so. However, such is not the case at bar. Moreover, in the complementary case of Maunlad Trans Inc. v. Isidro, [54] We held: While the facts, as found by the CA and the NLRC, point to the existence of a knee injury which respondent suffered in 2009, during the term of his employment contract and while on board the vessel, such knee injury was not the ailment complained of by respondent upon repatriation to the Philippines. x x x [55] Here, Cabatan complained of pain in the scrotal/inguinal area while on board which is why the initial diagnosis by the ship doctor was epididymorchitis. Aside from his bare assertion, there is nothing on record to show that he felt pain or numbness on his lower extremities while on board or that the ship doctor concluded that he contracted spondylolisthesis. It was only on July 2010 or after his repatriation that the said findings were made by a doctor, which is well-beyond the three-day mandatory reporting period. While this Court commiserates with petitioner's plight, non-compliance with the requirements set forth in Section 20 (B), paragraph (3) of the 2000 POEA-SEC renders it difficult to ascertain if his injury or illness was work-related.","WHEREFORE, the instant Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED for lack of merit.

Contrary to law.

Version of the Prosecution: Accused-appellant was employed as a stay-in family driver. The first incident (Criminal Case No. 07-146) transpired on August 23, 2006. AAA, 14, was awakened when accused-appellant entered her room. He covered her mouth, kissed her, mashed her breasts, and inserted his finger in her vagina. He threatened to kill her and her family if she told anyone. The second incident (Criminal Case No. 07-147) happened on August 26, 2006. Accused-appellant again entered her room, covered her mouth, kissed her breasts, removed her clothes, and inserted his penis into AAA's vagina for about five to 10 minutes, despite her resistance. He again threatened her. The third incident (Criminal Case No. 06-809) occurred on September 2, 2006. Accused-appellant again entered her room, locked the door, kissed her, mashed her breasts, and inserted his finger in her vagina. The nursemaid, CCC, noticed the door locked and accused-appellant missing. When CCC knocked repeatedly, AAA opened the door, and CCC saw accused-appellant sitting on the side of BBB's bed (AAA's sister). Accused-appellant claimed he was just patting BBB to sleep. PSI Marianne Ebdane conducted a medical examination on AAA and found deep healed lacerations at the five and seven o'clock positions on AAA's hymen, showing clear evidence of blunt penetrating trauma to the hymen.

Version of the Defense: Accused-appellant denied the charges. For the first and second incidents (August 23 and 26, 2006), he claimed he was sleeping inside his quarters. As to the third incident (September 2, 2006), he admitted being inside AAA's room but denied molesting her, explaining that he returned to her room to check her condition because she had an asthma attack the night before and asked him not to tell anyone or leave her.","On appeal [2] is the March 30, 2017 Decision [3] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R.

[The Supreme Court] WHEREFORE, the appeal is DISMISSED. The March 30, 2017 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-H.C. No. 07147 is hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATIONS.","There is no merit in the appeal. The Court affirms accused-appellant's conviction on all charges. The RTC was correct in finding AAA a credible witness. Her account was corroborated by the medico-legal report issued by PSI Ebdane, stating that AAA's vagina suffered deep healed lacerations... which show clear evidence of blunt penetrating trauma. The accused-appellant's defense of denial is feeble and cannot prevail over the positive identification by the victim. The Court likewise finds that the other contentions raised by accused-appellant (such as non-presentation of other witnesses or the victim's behavior) do not cast reasonable doubt on his guilt.

However, the Court deems it necessary to correct the nomenclature of the crimes charged and to impose the proper penalties, applying RA 7610 because AAA was 14 years old. Following People v. Tulagan, the two counts of Rape through sexual assault (Criminal Case Nos. 06-809 and 07-146) are reclassified to ""Lascivious Conduct under Section 5(b) of RA 7610."" The imposable penalty is reclusion temporal in its medium period to reclusion perpetua. The one count of Rape through sexual intercourse (Criminal Case No. 07-147) is reclassified to ""Rape under Article 266-A (1) in relation to Article 266-B of the RPC"" or Simple Rape, with the penalty of reclusion perpetua. The civil indemnities and damages are also modified to conform with Tulagan and People v. Jugueta, and the fines imposed by the appellate court are deleted for lack of legal basis.","The Court finds accused-appellant XXX guilty beyond reasonable doubt, as follows:

Version of the Prosecution: At around 2:00 p.m. of December 3, 2013, a confidential informant (CI) reported to the Bambang City Police Station that Vinluan[9] is engaged in the illegal sale of marijuana leaves and fruit tops.[10] Thus, Police Chief Inspector Rafael Pagalilauan, in coordination with the Nueva Vizcaya Police Provincial Office-Intelligence Section, organized a team to conduct a buy-bust operation.[11] The team was composed of Senior Police Officer (SPO) 1 Erwin Bautista (SPO1 Bautista), Police Officer (PO) 2 Robert Ngaloy (PO2 Ngaloy), PO2 Darwin Damaso (PO2 Damaso), and PO1 Marlon Cammayo (PO1 Cammayo), who was designated as poseur-buyer.[12] PO1 Cammayo then marked the buy-bust money consisting of five P100.00 peso bills with his initials ""MBC.""[13] The operation was coordinated with the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency.[14] Thereafter, the CI called Vinluan and informed him that his (CI) friend was interested in buying marijuana worth P500.00.[15] Vinluan thus instructed the CI to meet him in his residence in Purok 1, Barangay Banggot, Bambang, Nueva Vizcaya.[16] The team proceeded to the target area; the CI and PO1 Cammayo rode the CI's tricycle.[17] They parked adjacent to the house of Vinluan, while the other team members positioned themselves at a nearby basketball court.[18] Vinluan then approached the CI, who in turn introduced PO1 Cammayo as his friend who wants to buy marijuana.[19] The sale took place through the simultaneous exchange of the money and the drugs between Vinluan and PO1 Cammayo — PO1 Cammayo gave the five P100.00 bills while Vinluan gave four transparent plastic sachets containing dried leaves.[20] After the exchange, PO1 Cammayo gave the pre-arranged signal by removing his cap.[21] Vinluan was alarmed so he attempted to flee inside his house; but SPO1 Bautista and PO2 Ngaloy caught up and was able to apprehend him.[22] The seized items were marked at the place of the incident in the presence of Vinluan.[23] PO1 Cammayo marked the four sachets with ""MBC1,"" ""MBC2,"" ""MBC3,"" ""MBC4.""[24] Meanwhile, PO2 Damaso called for barangay officials.[25] Upon arrival of barangay kagawads Virgilio Hernandez (Hernandez) and Norma Laguisma (Laguisma), an inventory of the items was prepared.[26] PO2 Damaso also frisked Vinluan.[27] Photographs of the seized items, the marked money, and Vinluan were also taken.[28] Thereafter, they went to the police station. PO2 Damaso prepared a request for laboratory examination.[29] PO1 Cammayo then delivered the seized items to the forensic laboratory.[30] Police Senior Inspector James Bad-e (PSI Bad-e) conducted the qualitative examination. The seized items tested positive for the presence of marijuana.[31] After which, PSI Bad-e placed the items in a plastic bag that he sealed with a masking tape, and turned it over to the evidence custodian.[32] Version of the Defense: Vinluan denied the accusation and claimed that the drugs were planted. He averred that at that time, he was just at home watching television, when he heard someone outside call out ""Apo.""[33] When he opened the door to check who was calling him; he saw Jimboy (the CI) accompanied by someone unknown to him wearing a black hat.[34] Vinluan claimed that the two individuals asked him if he had marijuana, to which he answered in the negative.[35] The duo then left. After a while, Jimboy called for Vinluan again.[36] When Vinluan opened the door, he saw Jimboy this time accompanied by SPO2 Pascual, PO2 Ngaloy, PO2 Damaso, and the unknown person wearing a black hat.[37] Suddenly, the group barged into his house.[38] Vinluan claimed that the unknown person pointed a gun at him, while PO2 Ngaloy and SPO2 Pascual grabbed and handcuffed him.[39] He was then dragged toward the back of the house.[40] Vinluan asserted that SPO2 Pascual placed a P500.00 bill in his hands; he had no choice but to hold the money as he was hit with a gun on his right side when he refused to do so.[41] Thereafter, PO2 Damaso frisked him.[42] Vinluan added that while they were waiting for the barangay officials, PO2 Damaso brought out a bag of marijuana,[43] and threatened him with ""salvage"" if he would not admit that the drugs were his.[44] The defense also presented Florita Vinluan (Florita), Vinluan's stepmother. Florita recalled that at that time, she was in a hut near Vinluan's house when she saw three (3) men onboard a tricycle alight in front of the house.[45] Upon seeing Vinluan, one of the men pointed a gun at him and uttered ""That's him.""[46] The group cornered Vinluan and dragged him to the back of the house.[47] Florita interfered and asked the police officer to lower his gun as Vinluan was unarmed.[48]","The Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 37, Bambang, Nueva Vizcaya in Criminal Case No. 3438, found accused-appellant Marnel Vinluan y Liclican guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs under Section 5, Article II of Republic Act No. (RA) 9165 and imposed the penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.00. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the RTC Decision in its August 17, 2016 Decision in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 07360.","The appeal has merit. The Supreme Court found that while the elements of Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs were present, the apprehending officers failed to observe the rule on chain of custody, specifically the three-witness requirement under Section 21 of RA 9165 (media, DOJ, and elected public official). Only two elected public officials (barangay kagawads) were present during the inventory and photography. The prosecution failed to acknowledge this procedural lapse or provide justifiable grounds for the non-compliance, thereby failing to satisfy the saving clause requirements. This unjustified non-compliance produced a gap in the chain of custody, adversely affecting the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items, meaning the identity of the corpus delicti was not established. Thus, the prosecution failed to overcome the burden of proving Vinluan's guilt beyond reasonable doubt.","WHEREFORE, the appeal is GRANTED. The August 17, 2016 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 07360 is REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Accused-appellant Marnel Vinluan y Liclican is ACQUITTED for failure of the prosecution to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. He is ordered immediately RELEASED from detention, unless he is confined for any other lawful cause."
"G.R. No. 207159, February 28, 2022","REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, PETITIONER, VS. HEIRS OF EDUARDO BOOC, MERCEDES BOOC, AURELIA BOOC, PEDRO BOOC, FLORENTINO BOOC, AND FELICIANA BOOC, * RESPONDENTS.","Subject of the controversy are three lots located in Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu known as: (a) Lot No. 4749 with a lot area of 2,813 square meters; (b) Lot No. 4765 with a lot area of 5,507 square meters; and (c) Lot No. 4777 with a lot area of 6,973 square meters. [4] On July 9, 1998, respondents filed a petition for reconstitution [5] of OCT of Lot Nos. 4749, 4765, and 4777 alleging that sometime in 1930, the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu rendered three January 20, 1930 Decisions [6] declaring the late Eduardo Booc, Mercedes Booc, Aurelia Booc, Pedro Booc and Florentino Booc (collectively, the Boocs) as the registered owners of Lot Nos. 4749, 4765, and 4777. As a result thereof, in 1934, Decree Nos. 531394, 531367, and 531382 were separately issued by the CFI-Cebu directing the registration of the subject lots in the name of the Boocs. [7] OCTs were thereafter allegedly issued to the Boocs relative to the subject lots. Unfortunately, the OCTs were lost or destroyed during the World War II as evidenced by the Certification [8] dated June 26, 1998 issued by the Register of Deeds of Lapu-Lapu City. Respondents exerted diligent efforts to recover the certificates of title but still failed to find the same. [9] Respondents further averred that the certificates of title were still in force at the time they were lost or destroyed. Also, no co-owner's, mortgagee's, or lessee's duplicate certificates of title were issued. [10] Respondents likewise alleged that the lots adjoining the subject lots are as follows: [11] Lot No. 4749: North – Lot 4736 owned by Nemesio Fernandez of Buaya, Lapu-Lapu City; East – Lot 4748 owned by Eusebio Pino of Buaya, Lapu-Lapu City; South – Lot 4750 owned by Hilarion Fernandez of Buaya, Lapu-Lapu City; and West – Lot 4735 owned by Jorge Linao of Buaya, Lapu-Lapu City. x x x x Lot No. 4765: Northeast – Lot 4764 owned by Juan Inot of Buaya, Lapu-Lapu City; North West – Lot 4757 owned by Juan Booc of Buaya, Lapu-Lapu City; Southeast – Lot 4766 owned by Miguel Linao of Buaya, Lapu-Lapu City; South West – Lot 4755 owned by Calixto Inot of Buaya, Lapu-Lapu City; and Lot 4769 owned by Lazaro Cabuco of Buaya, Lapu-Lapu City; West – Lot 4756 owned by Santiago Fernandez of Buaya, Lapu-Lapu City. x x x x Lot No. 4777: East – Lot 4779 owned by Laureana Talingting of Buaya, Lapu-Lapu City; South – Lot 4780 owned by Bonifacio Malingin of Buaya, Lapu-Lapu City; West – Lot 4776 owned by Joaquin Patalinghug of Buaya, Lapu-Lapu City; North – Lot 4775 owned by Sotera Catagcatag of Buaya, Lapu-Lapu City. [12] At present, Lot No. 4749 is in the material possession of the Mactan Export Processing Zone Authority (MEPZA). [13] On the other hand, the Mactan International Airport Authority (MIAA) possesses Lot Nos. 4765 and 4777. [14] In support of their petition for reconstitution, respondents presented the following pieces of evidence: Certified true copy of the January 20, 1930 Decision of the CFI Cebu awarding to the Boocs Lot No. 4749; [15] Certified true copy of the January 20, 1930 Decision of the CFI Cebu awarding to the Boocs Lot No. 4765; [16] Certified true copy of the January 20, 1930 Decision of the CFI Cebu awarding to the Boocs Lot Nos. 4777 and 4765; [17] Certified true copy of Decree No. 531367 issued by the CFI-Cebu dated June 1, 1934 declaring the Boocs as the owners of Lot No. 4749; [18] Certified true copy of Decree No. 531382 issued by the CFI-Cebu dated June 2, 1934 declaring the Boocs as the owners of Lot No. 4765; [19] Certified true copy of Decree No. 531394 issued by the CFI-Cebu dated May 1, 1934 declaring the Boocs as the owners of Lot No. 4777; [20] Certification by the Registry of Deeds of Lapu-Lapu City dated June 26, 1998; Certified true copies of the respective technical description of Lot Nos. 4749, 4765, and 4777; [21] June 18, 1998 Certification from the Clerk of Court of RTC of Lapu-Lapu City stating that no application for reconstitution of original certificates of title for the subject lots was filed before the said trial court; [22] Certifications from Branch Clerks of Court of Branch Nos. 27, 53 and 54 of RTC of Lapu-Lapu City which similarly stated that no application for reconstitution of original certificates of title for the subject lots was filed before the said trial court; [23] and Sketch plans for the subject lands. [24] In its Amended Order [25] dated February 18, 2000, the RTC: (a) set the initial hearing of the case; (b) directed the Branch Clerk of Court to cause the publication of the Notice of Hearing in the three successive issues of the Official Gazette; and (c) ordered the posting of the copies thereof at the Capitol Building of Cebu City and the place where the subject lots were located. The RTC further ordered the Branch Clerk of Court to furnish the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), the Register of Deeds-Cebu, the Bureau of Lands, and the Land Registration Authority (LRA), copies of the RTC Amended Order. Subsequently, the OSG entered its appearance and deputized the City Prosecutor of Lapu-Lapu City to appear for the State. [26] Pursuant to the aforementioned order, an Amended Notice of Hearing [27] was issued on the same date. The initial hearing was thereafter conducted wherein respondents established the jurisdictional facts. The RTC initially entered an order of general default when no opposition to the petition for reconstitution was filed, and scheduled the initial presentation of respondent's evidence on August 29, 2000. However, it did not push through when the Mactan-Cebu International Airport Authority (MCIAA) filed its opposition. [28] In its opposition, [29] MCIAA asserted that the government, through the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA), owned the subject lots. The CAA bought the said lots from Julian Cuizon (Julian), Modesta Cuizon (Modesta), and Paulino Cuizon (Paulino), as evidenced by three Deeds of Absolute Sale dated September 5, 1957, [30] April 4, 1958, [31] and July 16, 1958. [32] Since then, the government has been in continuous, uninterrupted, and adverse possession of the subject lots which it declared for taxation purposes under Tax Declaration Nos. 00357, 00371, and 00086. [33] The ownership of the subject lots were then transferred to MCIAA pursuant to Republic Act No. (RA) 6985. [34] Respondents filed their reply [35] to the opposition, averring that Julian, Modesta, and Paulino, were not the legal heirs of the Boocs; hence, they cannot sell the subject lots. MCIAA was a possessor in bad faith since it grossly neglected its duty to determine who were the actual owners of the subject lots before purchasing the same. Respondents also insisted that since the subject lots are covered by Torrens certificates of title, the action relative thereto is imprescriptible. [36] MCIAA then filed its rejoinder asserting that respondents are not real parties-in-interest in the case because they are not the registered owners of the subject lots. MCIAA also sought the dismissal of the petition for reconstitution on the ground that it was prematurely filed. MCIAA reasoned that there is still a need to resolve the issue of ownership which could only be ventilated in an ordinary court action and not before a cadastral court. [37] In its February 19, 2003 Order, [38] the RTC dismissed MCIAA's opposition on the ground that respondents, being the heirs of the Boocs, and MCIAA, claiming ownership over the subject lots, are both real parties-in-interest in the petition for reconstitution under RA 26, [39] which only determines if the re-issuance of a title is proper. [40] During the trial, respondents presented their sole witness, Ismael Limalima (Ismael), son-in-law of the heirs of Eduardo Booc, who identified the pieces of documentary evidence. During his cross-examination, Ismael averred that sometime in 1976, respondents were surprised to find out that another person had occupied the land of Eduardo. [41] They then searched for the duplicate copy of the OCT but did not find it. [42] Believing it was lost, Ismael claimed that they went to the municipal hall of Lapu-Lapu City afterwards. [43] In a Report [44] dated April 17, 2009 submitted to the RTC, the LRA states: (1) The present petition seeks the reconstitution of Original Certificates of Title Nos. N.A., allegedly lost or destroyed and supposedly covering Lot Nos. 4749, 4765 and 4777 of the Cadastral Survey of Opon, situated in the Municipality of Opon, Province of Cebu, on the basis of Decree Nos. 531394, 531382 and 531367. (2) From Book No. 8 of the ""Record Book of Cadastral Lots"" on file at the Cadastral Decree Section, this Authority, it appears that Decree Nos. 531367, 531382 and 531394 were issued to Lot Nos. 4749, 4765 and 4777 on June 1, 1934, June 2, 1934 and May 31, 1934, respectively, all of Opon Cadastre, in Cadastral Case No. 20, GLRO Cad. Record No. 1004. As per copies of said decrees on file at the Vault Section, Docket Division, this Authority, it appears that it were issed in favor of Eduardo, Mercedes, Aurelio, Pedro, Florentino and Feliciana, all surnained Booc. (3) The technical descriptions of Lot Nos. 4749, 4765 and 4777 of the Cadastral Survey of Opon, appearing on Decree Nos. 531367, 531382 and 531394 has been examined and found correct after examination and due computation. Said technical descriptions when plotted in the Municipal Index Sheet No. 7323, do not appear to overlap previously plotted/decreed properties in the area. x x x x","In its Decision [46] dated November 19, 2008, the RTC held that respondents sufficiently proved that the OCTs of the subject lots were issued in the name of the Boocs and that these were lost or destroyed during the war. Thus, reconstitution of the same is in order. The fallo of the RTC Decision reads: WHEREFORE, viewed in the light of the foregoing facts and circumstances, reconstitution is hereby granted. The Register of Deeds of Lapu-Lapu City is hereby directed to reconstitute the original certificate of title of Lots Nos. 4749, 4765, and 4777, of Opon Cadastre, upon payment of the corresponding fees in the name of the decreed owners, namely: Eduardo Booc, Mercedes Booc, Aurelia Booc, Pedro Booc, Florentino Booc and Feliciana Booc based on the Index of Decrees, sketch plans, technical descriptions and Report of the Land Registration Authority, subject to the following conditions: 1. A first lien in favor of the National Government to guarantee the payment of the special taxes assessed pursuant to Section 18 of Act 2259, as amended; and, 2. A lien in favor of E. Bunagan Surveying Co. to guarantee the payment of the costs of cadastral survey and monumenting pursuant to Act 3327, as amended, unless the same has previously been cancelled; and provided further, that no certificate of title covering the same parcel of land exists in the office of the Register of Deeds concerned. The Register of Deeds of Lapu-lapu City is hereby directed to deliver the title thereof to the decreed owners or their successors-in-interest. SO ORDERED. Petitioner Republic of the Philippines then appealed [47] to the CA arguing that the RTC erred in granting the petition mainly because the numbers of the purported OCTs of the subject lots were not identified. Hence, respondents failed to prove that the said certificates exist and were in force at the time they were allegedly lost or destroyed. [48] Ruling of the Court of Appeals: In its April 24, 2013 Decision, [49] the CA ruled that the failure to mention the numbers of the lost OCTs of Lot Nos. 4749, 4765 and 4777 is not a fatal defect to the reconstitution thereof. The CA held that the existence of the decisions and decrees awarding the subject lots to the Boocs, and the Register of Deeds' certification stating that the OCT was lost or destroyed, are sufficient to warrant the reconstitution of the purported lost or destroyed certificates of title. The dispositive portion of the CA Decision reads: WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant appeal is DENIED without prejudice to the determination of the issue of ownership of Lot Nos. 4749, 4765, and 4777 in a separate proceeding. The Decision of Branch 27, Regional Trial Court, 7th Judicial Region, Lapu-lapu City dated November 19, 2008 is AFFIRMED. SO ORDERED. [50] Undaunted, petitioner filed this petition for review on certiorari . [51]","The RTC failed to acquire jurisdiction over the petition for reconstitution due to procedural infirmities. RA 26, otherwise known as ""Special Procedure for Reconstitution of Lost or Destroyed Torrens Certificate of Title,"" on judicial reconstitution of a certificate of title, governs the restoration of a lost or destroyed certificate of title in its original form and condition. The trial court can only acquire jurisdiction over a petition for reconstitution if the mandatory requirements and procedures laid down in RA 26 have been strictly complied with. In the case at bench, the petition for reconstitution did not comply with the requirements laid down in Section 12 of RA 26. Although respondents stated in their petition that MEPZA possesses Lot No. 4749 while the MIAA occuppies Lot Nos. 4765 and 4777, they failed to indicate their present addresses. Despite being aware that the subject lots are in the material possession of the MIAA and MEPZA, respondents did not stipulate if a building or improvements which do not belong to the Boocs are erected in the subject lots, and the nature thereof. They also did not state the encumbrances affecting the property, which are the deeds of absolute sale executed in 1957 and 1958 in favor MCIAA. Verily, the petition for reconstitution is fatally defective due to the presence of severe infirmities. Not only did respondents violate Section 12 of RA 26, they likewise did not strictly adhere to the procedures on notice of hearing laid down in Section 13 of the said law.

Lot Nos. 4749, 4765 & 4777 are situated in the Barrio Buaya, Lapu-Lapu City and bounded by the properties of the last Fifteen (15) aforementioned persons. WITNESS THE HONORABLE RUMOLDO R. FERNANDEZ, Presiding Judge of this Court, this 18th day of February 2000 at Lapu-Lapu City, Philippines. (sgd) ATTY. NANCY C. ARRIESGADO Branch Clerk of Court A close scrutiny of the amended notice shows that it did not indicate the number of the lost of destroyed OCTs. Consequently, the failure to identify the exact title number ""defeats the purpose of the twin notice and publication requirements since persons who have interest in the property or who may otherwise be affected by the reconstitution of the supposed title thereto would not be able to readily identify the said property or could even be misled by the vague or uncertain title reference."" The amended notice also failed to indicate the following in violation of the in rem character of the reconstitution proceedings and the mandatory nature of the requirements under RA 26: (a) the names of MEPZA and MIAA who are the occupants and possessors of the subject lots; (b) the area and the boundaries of the subject lots; and (c) the date on which all persons having any interest therein must appear and file their claim or objections to the petition. Undoubtedly, the RTC did not acquire jurisdiction over private respondents' petition due to these fatal defects in gross violation of Sections 12 and 13 of RA 26. As a result thereof, its proceedings, as well as those of the CA, are null and void. Besides, even if respondents complied with the procedural rules under RA 26, still, the petition for reconstitution should have been denied. There is insufficient evidence showing that OCTs of the subject lots in the name of the Boocs exist. Respondents failed to present any competent evidence, private or official, indicating the number of the purported OCTs of the subject lots is a fatal defect which warrants the dismissal of their petition for reconstitution. Respondents' non-submission of an affidavit of loss further casts doubt if the certificates of title of the subject lots in the name of the Boocs exist. Moreover, respondents are guilty of laches. Here, respondents only filed the petition for reconstitution 12 years after they first discovered that the titles were allegedly lost or destroyed.","WHEREFORE, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is hereby GRANTED. The April 24, 2013 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 03247 is REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The petition for reconstitution filed by the respondents before the Regional Trial Court, Branch 27 of Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu docketed as Cadastral Case No. 20, is DISMISSED."
"G.R. No. 257276, February 28, 2022","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. XXX [1] ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","Accused-appellant was charged with Qualified Rape for having sexual intercourse with AAA, a minor 7 years old, on August 8, 2009, aggravated by relationship, the accused being the uncle of the victim because accused is the brother of the victim's father. AAA testified that accused-appellant summoned her to his room, undressed her and himself, inserted his penis inside her vagina (causing pain, which made him stop), and subsequently ordered her to suck his penis under threat of death. The victim’s mother, BBB, saw accused-appellant kissing AAA and AAA holding accused-appellant's penis through the window. AAA immediately informed her mother of the sexual abuse and threat. Dr. Florence J. Curbilla discovered an abrasion on the labia majora and an old healed incomplete hymenal laceration. Accused-appellant denied the rape, claiming he was sleeping in his house adjacent to AAA's house at the time of the incident, and noted that the only possible motive against him is a land dispute, although he claimed to be very close to the victim's parents.","On February 20, 2019, the RTC, Branch 7 of xxxxxxxxxxx, convicted accused-appellant of Qualified Rape. The RTC sentenced him to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua without eligibility for parole and to pay the private offended party 'AAA' P100,000.00 as civil indemnity, P100,000.00 as moral damages and P100,000.00 as exemplary damages. In its November 25, 2020 Decision, the CA modified the designation of the crime committed from Qualified Rape to Statutory Rape, finding that while AAA's minority and the elements of Statutory Rape were established, the allegation of relationship in the Information was insufficient under prevailing jurisprudence. The CA affirmed the conviction but sentenced XXX to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua, and to pay AAA the amounts of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages and P75,000.00 as exemplary damages.","The Court finds no cogent reason to disturb the findings of the courts a quo that the elements of Statutory Rape were duly established, based on AAA's straightforward and positive testimony corroborated by BBB's testimony and the medico-legal certificate. However, contrary to the finding of the CA, the Court held that the special qualifying circumstance of relationship was sufficiently alleged in the Information. The allegation that 'the accused being the uncle of victim because accused is the brother of the victim's father' is specific enough to satisfy the special qualifying circumstance of relationship, even without the specific allegation that the relationship was within the third civil degree. Hence, accused-appellant is properly guilty of Qualified Rape.","the appeal is DISMISSED. The November 25, 2020 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CEB CR. HC. No. 03295 is hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION that accused-appellant XXX is found GUILTY of Qualified Rape and sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua without eligibility for parole. He is ordered to pay AAA (i) P100,000.00 as civil indemnity, (ii) P100,000.00 as moral damages, and (iii) P100,000.00 as exemplary damages. Interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum shall be imposed on the aggregate amount of the monetary awards computed from the finality of this Decision until full payment."

Subsequently, Paje et al. filed a Motion for the Issuance of a Writ of Execution against Spic N' Span for the remaining balance of P3,858,785.30 (inclusive of nominal damages). Spic N' Span filed a Motion to Quash Partial Writ of Execution, arguing that the quitclaim in favor of Swift, a solidary debtor, benefited Spic N' Span pursuant to Article 1217 of the Civil Code, thereby extinguishing the entire obligation. The labor arbiter granted the Motion to Quash, which was affirmed by the National Labor Relations Commission and the Court of Appeals.","WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Petition is GRANTED. The Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 128429 are REVERSED AND SET ASIDE. The labor arbiter's Order dated April 18, 2011, which quashed the partial writ of execution, is NULLIFIED.","The Court ruled in favor of the petitioners. The Quitclaim and Release plainly and explicitly reads that petitioners 'release and discharge Swift. . . from any and all claims[,]' meaning the quitclaim was meant to release Swift only, and not respondent. To construe the quitclaim as a complete discharge of respondent's obligation as well would not constitute a fair and reasonable settlement, as the consideration received (P3,588,785.30, or half the debt) is unconscionably low. The solidary nature of the liability of Swift (principal employer) and Spic N' Span (labor-only contractor) does not allow Spic N' Span to escape liability. Pursuant to Article 1216 of the Civil Code, the demand made against one of the solidary debtors will not be an obstacle to those that may be subsequently directed against the other, so long as the debt has not been fully collected. Since the total award of P7,177,570.60 due petitioners had not been fully satisfied, Swift's partial payment and release will not bar petitioners from collecting the remaining balance of the obligation from respondent.","Respondent Spic N' Span Service Corporation is directed to pay petitioners Gloria Paje, Lolita Gomez, Miriam Catacutan, Estrella Zapata, Gloria Sumang, Juanita Julieta Dingal, Myra Amante, and Fe Bernardo the amount of P3,858,785.30. The total amount is subject to legal interest at the rate of 6% per annum to be computed from the finality of this Decision until full payment."
"A.C. No. 13131, February 23, 2022","HOME GUARANTY CORPORATION, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. LAMBERTO T. TAGAYUNA, ATTY. JOSE A. GANGAN, ATTY. ELMAR A. PANOPIO, AND ATTY. RENATO DE PANO, JR., RESPONDENTS.","On November 5, 2015, HGC filed a complaint for disbarment before the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP), alleging that respondents violated the conflict of interest rule as provided in Canon 15, as well as for failure and refusal to account for the funds and properties of their client HGC when due or upon demand as provided in Canon 16. Respondents are partners of Soliven, Tagayuna, Gangan, Panopio & De Pano Law Firm (Law Firm). HGC engaged E.S.P. Collection Agency (ESP), represented by Atty. Panopio jointly with the Law Firm, through a Collection Retainership Agreement starting in 2003, which HGC claimed was renewed annually until termination on October 23, 2013. HGC claimed that respondents refused to return the documents, specifically 53 owner's duplicate copies of transfer certificates of title and other various documents, endorsed to the Law Firm. On the allegation of conflict of interest, HGC claimed that Atty. Tagayuna (one of the partners of ESP and the Law Firm) was also the president of Blue Star Construction and Development Corporation (BSCDC) which initiated an arbitration case against it before the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission in 2012 while the Collection Retainership Agreement was still subsisting. For their defense, respondents claimed the Collection Retainership Agreement expired on December 31, 2011, before the arbitration case was filed on May 16, 2012, and that they exercised a retaining lien against the remaining records in custody for P846,212.39 in unpaid fees. During the mandatory conference, HGC manifested it would no longer pursue the case against Atty. De Pano (who resigned in 2011) and Atty. Gangan (who passed away). The IBP BOG ultimately recommended dismissal of the case against all respondents, setting aside the CBD's recommendation of suspension for Attys. Tagayuna and Panopio.","The Court partially adopts the findings and recommendation of the IBP BOG. The administrative complaint against respondents Atty. Gangan and Atty. De Pano is dismissed. However, the administrative complaint against respondents Atty. Tagayuna and Atty. Panopio is partly meritorious; the Court thus imposes the penalty of reprimand.","The Court finds that respondents did not violate the conflict of interest rule under the three tests. Respondents did not represent conflicting interests as the Law Firm did not represent BSCDC as counsel in the arbitration case, and Atty. Tagayuna merely signed as president. Furthermore, the Law Firm was engaged for collection purposes only, unrelated to the arbitration case, and the professional relationship had expired before the arbitration case was filed. However, the charge of unlawful withholding of documents (Canon 16) is found partly meritorious. While the documents were eventually returned to HGC during the pendency of the case, respondents improperly exercised their right to retain HGC's documents as lien at the time of the filing of the complaint. The Court held that there was no proof that HGC consented to the application of its property to satisfy the unpaid legal fees, which is essential because a lawyer cannot unilaterally appropriate his client's property. The complaints against Atty. Gangan (due to death) and Atty. De Pano (due to resignation from the Law Firm before the alleged violations occurred) are dismissed.","The administrative complaint as against respondents Atty. Renato De Pano, Jr. and Atty. Jose A. Gangan is DISMISSED. The Court finds respondents Atty. Lamberto T. Tagayuna and Atty. Elmar A. Panopio GUILTY of violating Rules 16.01 and 16.03 of Canon 16 of the Code of Professional Responsibility. They are REPRIMANDED with a STERN WARNING that a repetition of a similar offense shall merit a heavier penalty."
"G.R. No. 247824, February 23, 2022","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. ORLANDO PADILLA AND DANILO PADILLA, ACCUSED-APPELLANTS.","On appeal[1] is the November 13, 2018 Decision[2] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA G.R. CR-HC No. 09380, affirming the Decision[3] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 67, Bauang, La Union, in Criminal Case No. 3988-BG which found accused-appellants Orlando Padilla (Orlando) and Danilo Padilla (Danilo) (collectively, accused-appellants) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder. An Information[4] dated June 18, 2010 was filed against Danilo[5] and Orlando for the murder of Rhandy Padin (Rhandy). The accusatory portion reads: That on or about the 29th day of March, 2010 in the Municipality of Naguilian, Province of La Union, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring, confederating and mutually helping one-another, with intent to kill and with abuse of superior strength, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and stab one [RHANDY] PADIN with the use of a knife and a big stone, hitting and inflicting upon the latter fatal injuries, which, caused his instantaneous death, to the damage and prejudice of the heirs of [RHANDY] PADIN. CONTRARY TO LAW.[7] Danilo was apprehended and committed to the Bauang, La Union district, jail on August 16, 2010. He pleaded ""not guilty"" to the crime charged and trial ensued.[8] On November 4, 2013, Orlando was subsequently apprehended. He also pleaded ""not guilty"" to the charge.[9] Version of the Prosecution: The prosecution's eyewitness, tricycle driver Antonio, testified that on March 29, 2010, he drove accused-appellants to Agoo, and later they went to an establishment called ""inuman"" in Naguilian where they met Rhandy. Antonio later drove Rhandy's companion home, and subsequently, Rhandy, Antonio, Danilo and Orlando returned to the inuman. Afterwards, Danilo told Antonio to bring them all to Bagulin. When they reached Upper Bimmotbot, Antonio noticed that his three passengers were fighting inside the tricycle. Antonio immediately stopped, at which point, the brothers pulled Rhandy out. Danilo boxed Rhandy while Orlando aided by choking the former. Danilo then returned to the tricycle and took out the knife kept at the backseat which was usually used by Antonio in cutting rubber. Antonio saw Orlando choking and restraining Rhandy while Danilo was in front of Rhandy with a knife. When Rhandy was able to get a hold of the knife, Orlando stepped on Rhandy's hand, retrieved it and returned the same to Danilo. Attempting to fully wound Rhandy, Danilo repeatedly stabbed the latter but was not able to mortally wound him as the knife was already bent. Danilo thus got a hold of a stone and hit it against Rhandy's head.[24] Danilo and Orlando, with the help of Antonio, pitched Rhandy into the ravine. Danilo got a bigger stone and dropped it into the ravine and hit Rhandy. Thereafter, Antonio, Danilo and Orlando all left together.[25] Dr. Daciego declared that the cause of death of Rhandy was by a blunt traumatic head injury. Version of the Defense: Danilo testified that Antonio became angry at Rhandy for refusing to buy drinks. Antonio stopped the tricycle, alighted and pulled out Rhandy by the collar. Danilo tried to pacify the two but in the process, he and Rhandy fell down on the ground with Rhandy on top of him. They ended boxing each other. Antonio then returned to his tricycle and took out a knife hidden in the backrest, Antonio went behind Rhandy and stabbed him. Antonio demanded Orlando to help him push Rhandy's body into the ravine and the two finished the deed. Antonio then searched for a big stone and dropped the same into the ravine where Rhandy lay. Orlando, on the other hand, denied any participation in the assault and killing of Rhandy, insisting he ran away when Antonio declared his intention to kill Rhandy.","After trial on the merits, the RTC rendered a Decision[36] finding Danilo and Orlando guilty of Murder, with abuse of superior strength and conspiracy having attended the crime. The RTC disposed the case in this wise: WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered finding the accused Orlando Padilla and Danilo Padilla alias ""PANDAN"" GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of MURDER and are hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA without eligibility of Parole. The accused are further ordered to pay jointly and severally the heirs of Rhandy Padin: death indemnity of Seventy-Five Thousand Pesos (Php 75,000.00), Philippine Currency; moral damages of One Hundred Thousand Pesos (Php 100,000.00), Philippine Currency; exemplary damages of Fifty Thousand Pesos (Php50,000.00), Philippine Currency plus the cost of suit. The CA, finding no reversible error in the assailed Decision, upheld the RTC's judgment of conviction. However, it modified the grant of damages, by awarding the following to the victim's heirs: P100,000.00 as death indemnity and P100,000.00 exemplary damages with the prevailing interest rate. WHEREFORE, premises considered, the appeal is DENIED. The Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Bauang, La Union, Branch 67 in CR Case No. 3988-BG is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION in that the amount of death indemnity and exemplary damages is increased to P100,000.00 each.","The appeal is dismissed. A careful review of the records of the case reveals that the conduct of the accused-appellants before, during and after the commission of the crime, together with that of Antonio's, showed conspiracy on their part, and that they all had an equal hand in the killing of Rhandy. Analyzing the two versions of the parties, it is readily apparent that they all ganged up on him; they brought the victim at a detour, fought and mortally wounded him; participated in the disposing of the body; and went home together after the gruesome incident and not reporting the incident to the authorities. These circumstances were all geared towards the accomplishment of the same unlawful object, indicating closeness of personal association and a concurrence of sentiment. Therefore, regardless of which version this Court appreciates, it is conclusive from the admitted individual acts of the assailants that conspiracy among them existed. It thus becomes inconsequential to prove who delivered the death blow considering conspiracy was implied from their actions thereby making the act of one, the act of all. This Court fully agrees with the findings of the CA that indeed abuse of superior strength was present in the commission of the crime. The evidence gathered shows that the victim was unarmed when he was attacked by accused-appellants, who were not only superior in number but had access to, and in fact used, a weapon in form of a knife. Moreover, it was established that when the victim was already defenseless and weak from the stab wound and the mauling, he was unnecessarily hit with a big stone that ensured his death. Thus, the fact that the victim was outnumbered without means to put up a defense as he was taken to a place where rescue would be close to impossible and the fact that accused-appellants and Antonio used weapons out of proportion to the defense available to the victim, i.e. a knife and a big stone, fully establish the qualifying aggravating circumstance of abuse of superior strength. Applying the foregoing to the case at bar, considering that no other aggravating circumstance was present in the killing apart from the qualifying circumstance of abuse of superior strength, the penalty of reclusion perpetua as the lesser penalty is warranted. The awards of civil indemnity, moral damages and exemplary damages should be reverted to P75,000.00 respectively.","WHEREFORE, the appeal is DISMISSED. The November 13, 2018 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA G.R. CR-HC No. 09380 finding accused-appellants Orlando Padilla and Danilo Padilla GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATIONS in that the phrase ""without eligibility of parole"" is DELETED and accused-appellants are ordered to PAY the heirs of Rhandy Padin the following: 1) Civil indemnity in the amount of P75,000.00; 2) Actual damages in the amount of P 53,800.00; 3) Moral Damages in the amount of P75,000.00; and 4) Exemplary damages in the amount of P75,000.00 All damages awarded shall earn interest at the rate of six percent (6%) interest per annum from the date of finality of this Decision until full payment."

WILLRUSS ORTEGA,* ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","On March 18, 2014, the Office of the City Prosecutor of Laoag filed two cases against Ortega after preliminary investigation. The Information in Criminal Case No. 15891 charged Ortega with violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165, viz.: That on or about the 20th day of February, 2014, in the City of Laoag, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused, did then and there willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously sell and deliver to a police poseur buyer, One (1) small heat sealed transparent plastic sachet containing methamphetamine hydrochloride commonly known as ""shabu"", a dangerous drug, weighing 0.1083 grams (sic), including plastic sachet, without any license or authority to sell the same, in violation of the aforecited law. CONTRARY TO LAW. On the other hand, the Information in Criminal Case No. 15892 charged Ortega with violation of Section 11, Article II of RA 9165, which alleges: That on or about the 20th day of February 2014, in the City of Laoag, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused, did then and there willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously have in his possession, control and custody methamphetamine hydrochloride commonly known as ""shabu"" a dangerous drug, weighing 0.69 grams (sic), including plastic sachets, without any permit, license, or authority to do so. CONTRARY TO LAW. Upon his arraignment on April 2, 2014, Ortega pleaded ""not guilty"" to both charges. Version of the Prosecution: On February 20, 2014, at around 8:30 p.m., PO2 Lawrence Ganir (PO2 Ganir) received information from an asset that Ortega was looking for prospective buyers of shabu. A buy-bust operation was formed, with PO2 Ramon Christopher Diego (PO2 Diego) as poseur buyer. Ortega arrived and sold PO2 Diego a plastic sachet containing a white crystalline substance, receiving the P1,000.00-bill marked money. Upon the pre-arranged signal, back-up operatives arrived. PO2 Ventura handcuffed Ortega and informed him of his rights, then conducted a body search, recovering one leather coin purse containing six plastic sachets of white crystalline substance. The team transferred the scene to the police station where they photographed, marked, and inventoried the confiscated items in the presence of Ortega and Barangay Captain Andres. The forensic chemist, PI Amiely Ann Luis Navarro, found the items positive for shabu. Version of the Defense: Ortega vehemently denied the accusations. He testified that he was at home taking care of his children when his live-in partner texted him to go to St. Joseph Pharmacy to bring P7,000.00. While walking along Basa Street, a vehicle stopped, and three individuals (later identified as PO2 Ganir, PO2 Ventura, and PO2 Diego) got off. PO2 Ganir handcuffed him and brought him to the Laoag City Police Station where he was searched and his belongings confiscated. His live-in partner corroborated his denial, stating she saw him being forcibly taken.","Assailed in this ordinary appeal is the November 9, 2017 Decision of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA G.R. CR-HC No. 08591, which affirmed in toto the August 19, 2016 Decision of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 13, Laoag City, in Criminal Case Nos. 15891 and 15892, finding accused-appellant Willruss Ortega (Ortega) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Sections 5 and 11, Article II of Republic Act No. (RA) 9165, otherwise known as the ""Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002.""","This Court finds that Ortega's acquittal is proper because the prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt the integrity of the seized drugs, given that the police officers did not strictly comply with requirements laid down under Section 21 of RA 9165. The crime was committed on February 20, 2014, requiring the presence of three witnesses (media, DOJ representative, and elected public official). A perusal of the records showed that only the barangay official, Andres, was present during the inventory. Further, the Inventory /Confiscation Receipt was not signed by Ortega or by his counsel or representative, and the prosecution admitted there was no proof that Ortega and the required witness/es were furnished a copy of the document. The prosecution failed to adduce any explanation or justification as to why the police officers deviated from the procedure under Section 21. Additionally, the stipulation to dispense with the testimony of forensic chemist PI Navarro did not fully cover the necessary pieces of information (that the forensic chemist received the seized article as marked, properly sealed, and intact; that he resealed it after examination; and that he placed his own marking on the same). This created a huge gap in the chain of custody, tainting the integrity of the seized drugs. Since proof beyond reasonable doubt was not established, the acquittal of Ortega must follow as a matter of course.","WHEREFORE, the appeal is hereby GRANTED. The November 9, 2017 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 08591 is REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Accused-appellant Willruss Ortega is ACQUITTED of the crimes charged against him and is ordered to be immediately RELEASED from detention, unless he is confined for some other lawful cause."
"G.R. No. 217097, February 23, 2022","ROLANDO UY Y SAYAN ALIAS ""NONOY,"" PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","On May 28, 2004, an Information was filed charging petitioner Rolando Uy y Sayan alias ""Nonoy"" with violation of Section 11, Article II of RA 9165 (Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs) for allegedly possessing 248 grams of marijuana flowering tops on April 6, 2004, in San Fernando, Bukidnon. Version of the Prosecution: On April 6, 2004, PNP members set up a mobile checkpoint pursuant to COMELEC Resolution No. 6446 (gun ban). Police flagged down petitioner who failed to produce the Certificate of Registration (CR) and Official Receipt (OR) of his motorcycle, making the officers suspicious. They asked him to open the tools compartment, where they found five bundles of marijuana wrapped in a cellophane. A subsequent search of the compartment under the driver's seat yielded several more bundles of marijuana. Petitioner was brought to the police station, and the specimen tested positive for marijuana. Petitioner also tested positive for drug use. Version of the Defense: Petitioner denied the allegations, stating that his motorcycle had a flat tire, and while changing it, armed persons searched his bag against his will, finding nothing illegal. He admitted not having the documents but argued the warrantless search was illegal. He was arrested, brought to the station, and alleged physical coercion and a demand for money. The Regional Trial Court (RTC) found petitioner guilty, holding that the warrantless search was justified as incidental to a lawful arrest. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the conviction but modified the penalty, noting that petitioner waived the right to question the legality of the arrest by actively participating in the trial, but struck down the finding regarding drug use due to the unconstitutionality of Section 36(f) of RA 9165 (as ruled in Social Justice Society (SJS) v. Dangerous Drugs Board).","The petition is GRANTED. The August 8, 2014 Decision and February 9, 2015 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

The Court found there was a total lack of compliance, specifically noting that an inventory report was not accomplished, and the required presence of the insulating witnesses (a representative from the media, the Department of Justice, and an elected public official) was absent. This serious lapse in procedure resulted in ""Serious uncertainty [hanging] over the identity and integrity of the corpus delicti introduced into evidence by the prosecution,"" thus warranting the acquittal of the petitioner.","ACQUITTED of the crime charged against him and ordered immediately RELEASED from custody, unless he is being held for some other lawful cause."
"G.R. No. 231042, February 23, 2022","ARTURO O. MIÑAO, PETITIONER, VS. OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSMAN (MINDANAO), RESPONDENT.","The instant case stemmed from a letter-complaint dated October 14, 2005 from Aurelio Cadavedo (Cadavedo) pertaining to the alleged anomalous purchase of guardrails and guardrail posts worth P5,500,000.00 sometime in 2004 made by the 1st Engineering District of the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) in Sta. Isabel, Dipolog City. The audit team of the Commission on Audit Regional Office No. IX (COA-IX) submitted an audit investigation report (AIR) dated October 5, 2006, alleging that the 1st Engineering of DPWH in Sta. Isabel, Dipolog City: (1) resorted to splitting of contracts by awarding 11 purchase orders worth P500,000.00 each to AUF Enterprises without public bidding; (2) purchased overpriced guardrails and guardrail posts from AUF Enterprises; and (3) left guardrails and guardrail posts at the project site resulting in wastage of government resources in the amount of P40,110.00. Petitioner Arturo O. Miñao (OIC District Engineer) and his co-respondents denied the allegations, claiming that the main project was split into 11 projects of P500,000.00 each under the Special Allotment Release Order (SARO) issued by the Department of Budget and Management (DBM), and thus, should be governed by the old procurement law, not RA 9184. The OMB-Mindanao found petitioner liable for Grave Misconduct, Gross Neglect of Duty, Serious Dishonesty, and Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of Service, imposing the penalty of dismissal from government service. The Court of Appeals affirmed the OMB findings.","The Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R.

Miñao together with Manolito G. Abapo, and Clemente A. Tabiliran, administratively liable for Grave Misconduct, Gross Neglect of Duty, Serious Dishonesty, and Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of Service, and imposing on them the penalty of dismissal from government service.","The Supreme Court ruled that RA 9184 was the governing law at the time of procurement initiation (July 12, 2004). The Court affirmed the findings that petitioner committed splitting of government contracts, which is expressly prohibited under Section 54.1 of the IRR of RA 9184, because the implementation of the SARO necessitated only one procurement contract for identical materials from a single supplier, making the execution of 11 separate contracts highly erroneous and clearly done to circumvent the requirements of competitive public bidding. Petitioner’s reliance on the DBM SARO as a directive to split the contracts and his defense of unfamiliarity with RA 9184 were rejected. The Court affirmed the administrative findings of Grave Misconduct, Gross Neglect of Duty, Serious Dishonesty and Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service based on substantial evidence.","WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED.

Subsequently, on May 2, 2007, PBCOM filed an Amended Annual Income Tax Return for the same year, reflecting a net loss of P903,582,307.00, and a creditable tax withheld for the fourth quarter of 2006 in the amount of P24,716,655.00. PBCOM also indicated in the said income tax return its intention to apply for the issuance of a TCC for its excess/unutilized CWT for the year 2006 in the amount of P24,716,655.00. After almost two years, on April 3, 2009, PBCOM filed with the BIR its letter requesting the issuance of a TCC for the excess CWT covering the year 2006 in the amount of P24,716,655.00. On April 15, 2009, PBCOM filed a petition for review with the CTA, praying for the issuance of a TCC in the amount of P24,716,655.00, representing its excess/unutilized CWT for the year 2006. PBCOM also alleged that it was filing the said petition with the CTA due to the inaction of the CIR on the former's claim for a TCC. In its answer, the CIR essentially argued that PBCOM's claim for the issuance of a TCC is in the nature of a refund and is thus subject to administrative examination by the BIR, and that PBCOM failed to fully comply with the requirements provided in Revenue Regulations 6-86 and jurisprudence.","On October 7, 2013, the CTA en banc rendered the assailed Decision, denying the CIR's petition for lack of merit and affirming the CTA Third Division's Decision and Resolution in toto.

The Assailed Decision dated June 6, 2012 and Assailed Resolution dated August 28, 2012 are both AFFIRMED in toto. SO ORDERED.","We deny the CIR's petition for lack of merit. The failure in proving an administrative claim for a CWT refund/credit does not preclude the judicial claim of the same. We agree with the CTA en banc's ruling that the failure of PBCOM to comply with the requirements of its administrative claim for CWT refund/credit does not preclude its judicial claim. ... Since the claim for tax refund/credit was litigated anew before the CTA, the latter's decision should be solely based on the evidence formally presented before it, notwithstanding any pieces of evidence that may have been submitted (or not submitted) to the CIR. Thus, what is vital in the determination of a judicial claim for a tax credit/refund of CWT is the evidence presented before the CTA, regardless of the body of evidence found in the administrative claim. ... PBCOM is entitled to a tax credit/refund of its CWT in the amount of P4,624,554.63. ... PBCOM complied with the last two requirements as to the amount of P4,624,554.63 which is the amount both verified by the CTA to have been included in the former's General Ledger and Annual Income Tax Return for taxable year 2006, and supported by the required Certificates of Creditable Tax Withheld at Source (BIR Form No. 2307).","WHEREFORE, the petition is hereby DENIED for lack of merit.

"G.R. No. 207606, February 16, 2022","OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSMAN, PETITIONER, VS. TEODORA T. HERMOSURA, RESPONDENT.","Private Complainant, Brenda Ortiz (Ortiz), is a businesswoman engaged in the lending business while Teodora Hermosura a.k.a. Teodora Cornelio (respondent), was employed as a Computer Operator II at the University of Makati (UMAK) until her optional retirement was approved on June 15, 2008.[5] In 2005, the respondent initially borrowed P10,000.00 from Ortiz. The loan was renewed several times and the respondent was able to pay on time, thus, the two became friends, and Ortiz eventually engaged the respondent as an agent in her lending business.[6] As Ortiz's agent, the respondent was to extend loans or loan accommodation to their clients at an agreed interest rate. It was also the respondent's task to look for borrowers, determine their credit standing and the amount to be lent to each of them. As part of their process, the respondent: receives the money from Ortiz in trust with the obligation to deliver them to the borrowers, collects the installments or payments from the borrowers, and finally remits the same to Ortiz. As her compensation, the respondent receives from Ortiz a commission equivalent to five percent (5%) of the total loan collected. This process worked for them for quite some time, until in 2007, when the respondent started to fail in remitting her collections.[7] Ortiz tried to contact the respondent but to no avail. Ortiz only got hold of the respondent's new phone number from an employee of UMAK. Ortiz and the respondent then met in person at a restaurant in Pasay City, where the respondent allegedly admitted that she spent the unremitted collection for her personal needs. However, she promised Ortiz that she would repay her. Subsequent to their meeting, the respondent could no longer be contacted.[8] Through her counsel, Ortiz sent two demand letters to the respondent, warning her of the institution of legal action should she fail to return Ortiz's money in the amount of over P40,000,000.00.[9] Despite the foregoing, the respondent still failed to remit her collections. Consequently, Ortiz filed an administrative complaint for dishonesty against the respondent. In her counter-affidavit, the respondent denied the material allegations in the complaint. She repudiated the contract of agency between her and Ortiz, and claimed that they had a business venture where she was the industrial partner and Ortiz was the capitalist. She professed that she experienced difficulties in collecting from their borrowers due to the high interest rates imposed on the loans. Also, the university/companies imposed strict policies on salary deduction which made it difficult for her to collect from the borrowers. In another counter-affidavit, she maintained that she already remitted the sum of P65,693,770.00 to Ortiz.[10]","On January 29, 2010, the Ombudsman rendered a Decision[11] which found the respondent guilty of dishonesty. As she had already retired from government service, she is meted the penalties of cancellation of eligibility, forfeiture of retirement benefits and the perpetual disqualification for reemployment in the government service. On October 23, 2012, the CA promulgated its Decision[17] reversing the judgment of the Ombudsman. The CA ruled that the respondent could not be held administratively liable, given that there is no proof that she availed of optional retirement to prevent the filing of an administrative complaint against her. In conclusion, the CA disposed of the case as follows: WHEREFORE, premises considered, the assailed Decision and Order of the honorable public respondent, finding petitioner Teodora T. Hermosura, guilty of Dishonesty, are hereby ANNULLED and SET ASIDE. SO ORDERED.[20]","The Supreme Court ruled that Respondent can still be held administratively liable as her retirement was voluntary. Her voluntary separation from the government service, in addition to her knowledge that a complaint would most likely be filed against her at anytime (after Ortiz's counsel sent demand letters), bolsters the Ombudsman's position that the respondent attempted to forestall the filing of an administrative case against her by availing of optional retirement. Thus, the ruling in Office of the Ombudsman v. Andutan, Jr. (where resignation was forced) does not apply. The Court found the respondent administratively guilty of simple dishonesty only, as the dishonest act did not cause serious damage or grave prejudice to the government, nor was it committed in relation to or in connection with her duties (Computer Operator II). Simple dishonesty is punishable by suspension of one month and one day to six months for the first offense.","WHEREFORE, the Decision dated October 23, 2012 and the Resolution dated May 23, 2013 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 118223 are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Respondent Teodora T. Hermosura a.k.a. Teodora Cornelio is hereby found GUILTY of simple dishonesty and is FINED in an amount equivalent to her salary for six (6) months to be deducted from her retirement benefits. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 252226, February 16, 2022","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. ROMMEL DELA CRUZ Y MENDOZA, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","The case stemmed from two (2) Informations filed before the RTC, the accusatory portions of which state: Criminal Case No. L-10160: ""That sometime in the morning of February 10, 2012 in xxxxxxxxxxx Pangasinan, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above named accused, an adult taking advantage of the vulnerability of AAA, a 14 year old minor child (DOB-August 25, 1998), did, then and there willfully and unlawfully coerce and influence the said minor child to indulge into a sexual intercourse with him inside the bedroom of the residential house of his grandmother to the prejudice and damage of the said minor child.

Criminal Case No. L-10161: ""That sometime in the morning of October 18, 2013 in xxxxxxxxxxx Pangasinan and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above named accused, an adult taking advantage of the vulnerability of AAA, a 15 year old minor child (DOB-August 25, 1998), did, then and there willfully and unlawfully coerce and influence the said minor child to indulge into a sexual intercourse with him inside the bedroom of the residential house of his grandmother and damage of the said minor child. Contrary to Sec. 5(b), Art. III of R.A. 7610 (Anti-Child Abuse Act)."" The prosecution narrated that on February 10, 2012, accused-appellant held AAA's hand, brought her to the house of his grandmother, pulled her towards a room, took off her uniform, pushed her towards the bed, and inserted his penis into AAA's vagina. Out of fear, AAA did not tell anyone about the incident. The second incident occurred on October 18, 2013, where accused-appellant again brought her to his grandmother's house, pulled her towards a room, undressed her, went on top of her, and inserted his penis into her vagina. AAA tried to resist by slapping and pushing him away, but she failed. Accused-appellant admitted that he had sexual intercourse with AAA, but denied that he forced her, claiming AAA was his girlfriend.","Before the Court is an appeal seeking the reversal of the Decision dated December 11, 2019 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR HC No. 11874 which affirmed the Decision dated August 7, 2018 of Branch 68, Regional Trial Court (RTC), xxxxxxxxxxx, Pangasinan that found Rommel dela Cruz y Mendoza (accused-appellant) guilty of two (2) counts of Sexual Abuse under Section 5(b), Article III of Republic Act No. (RA) 7610 in Criminal Case Nos. L-10160 and L-10161.","The appeal has no merit. The RTC and the CA were correct in their assessment of the testimonies of AAA and her mother. On the basis of AAA's testimony, the RTC and the CA uniformly found that accused-appellant had carnal knowledge of AAA against her will or without her consent. However, there is a need to fix the error in the nomenclature of accused-appellant's crime. Accused-appellant should be held criminally liable for two (2) counts of Rape under paragraph 1(a), Article 266-A, in relation to Article 266-B, of the Revised Penal Code. The Court cannot sustain the RTC's pronouncement that the prosecution had established accused-appellant's criminal liability under Section 5(b), Article III of RA 7610 because AAA cannot be deemed to be a child 'exploited in prostitution and other sexual abuse;' hence, the second element is patently lacking in the case. Instead, the prosecution's evidence clearly established the elements under paragraph 1, Article 266-A of the RPC, as amended by RA 8353. The circumstance applicable in the case is paragraph 1(a) [Rape through force, threat, or intimidation]. The 'sweetheart theory' is rejected as the accused-appellant failed to provide substantial independent proof, and the victim's resistance belied consent. Accused-appellant may properly be convicted of Rape without violating his due process rights and the right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusations against him, as the allegations in the Informations sufficiently mentioned and charged accused-appellant with carnal knowledge of AAA, a minor, by willfully and unlawfully coercing the latter to have sexual intercourse with him.","WHEREFORE, the appeal is DISMISSED. The Decision dated December 11, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR HC No. 11874 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION in that accused-appellant Rommel dela Cruz y Mendoza is found GUILTY of two (2) counts of Rape under paragraph 1(a), Article 266-A, in relation to Article 266-B, of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 8353. He is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua and is ORDERED to pay the victim, AAA, the following amounts: (1) P75,000.00 as civil indemnity; (2) P75,000.00 as moral damages; and (3) P75,000.00 as exemplary damages for each count.

"G.R. No. 253428, February 16, 2022","GUERRERO ESTATE DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. LEVISTE & GUERRERO REALTY CORPORATION AND THE HEIRS OF CONRAD C. LEVISTE, AS REPRESENTED BY LAURO S. LEVISTE II, RESPONDENTS.","Guillerma Santos was the registered owner of a parcel of land in Parañaque City. After her death, her heirs formed Guerrero Estate Development Corporation (GEDCOR). GEDCOR eventually acquired a parcel of land (the subject property, 1,506 square meters, TCT No. (103259) 23998). GEDCOR entered into a Joint Venture Contract with Conrad Leviste (Conrad) on June 2, 1987, to construct a warehouse on the subject property. The parties agreed to form a corporation (Leviste & Guerrero Realty Corporation or LGRC) where GEDCOR would hold 45% and Conrad 55%. Conrad completed the warehouse and formed LGRC on August 3, 1988. From 1988, 45% of the rental income was remitted to GEDCOR. Claiming Conrad had been adequately compensated, GEDCOR sent letters in 2006 and 2009 seeking termination and turnover of possession. LGRC stopped remitting GEDCOR's 45% share starting June 2009. The total unremitted share amounted to P2,596,041.09 as of September 1, 2011. GEDCOR filed a Complaint for Fixing of Period under Article 1197 of the Civil Code, Collection of Sum of Money and/or Accounting against Conrad and LGRC before the RTC (Civil Case No. 12-003). The RTC granted GEDCOR's Motion to Deposit Rentals in Court (Deposit Order) on February 19, 2018, directing the deposit of P5,936,461.65 (45% share from June 1, 2009 to September 30, 2015) plus subsequent monthly 45% shares. Conrad and LGRC filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which the RTC denied on September 6, 2018. Respondents then filed a Petition for Certiorari before the CA.","In the Decision dated June 26, 2019, the CA granted the petition and reversed and set aside the RTC Orders dated February 19, 2018 and September 6, 2018. The CA ruled that respondents sufficiently established grave abuse of discretion on the part of the RTC, finding that the Deposit Order was akin to the provisional remedy of preliminary attachment without strict compliance and amounted to a prejudgment of the case.","The Court finds the petition meritorious. Branch 274, RTC, Parañaque City, correctly exercised its jurisdiction over GEDCOR’s complaint as the case does not involve an intra-corporate controversy; GEDCOR is not a stockholder of LGRC, and there is no claim for advance dividend entitlement. The CA erred in finding grave abuse of discretion on the part of the RTC in issuing the Deposit Order. The provisional remedy of deposit exists pursuant to the general and inherent power of the courts under Sections 5(g) and 6, Rule 135 of the Rules of Court, to amend and control its process and orders so as to make them conformable to law and justice and to employ all auxiliary writs necessary to carry its jurisdiction into effect. The Deposit Order falls under the category where the party-depositor regularly receives money or other property from a non-party during the pendency of the case, and the court deems it proper to place such money or other property in *custodia legis* pending final determination of the party truly entitled to the same. The Deposit Order is merely provisional and preservatory in character and is not intended to be an adjudication on the merits of the main case. By issuing the Deposit Order, the RTC is merely holding in *custodia legis* the amount corresponding to 45% of the rental income to ensure that it can enforce the rights of the parties after adjudication.","WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated June 26, 2019 and the Resolution dated August 24, 2020 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 157982 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

No. 8353[6] were filed against XXX. The accusatory portion of each Information reads as follows: Criminal Case No. 158506: That sometime in 2009, in the City of x x x xx x x xxxx ,Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, being then the biological father of complainant AAA, a minor 13 years old, by means of force, violence, and intimidation with lewd designs and intent to gratify his sexual desire, did, then and there willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously have sexual intercourse with said minor complainant, against her will and consent, to her damage and prejudice. CONTRARY TO LAW. Criminal Case No. 158507: That sometime in October 2011, in the City of x x x xx x x xxxx , Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, being then the biological father of complainant AAA, a minor 15 years old, by means of force, violence, and intimidation with lewd designs and intent to gratify his sexual desire, did, then and there willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously had sexual intercourse with said minor complainant, against her will and consent, to her damage and prejudice. CONTRARY TO LAW. Criminal Case No. 158508: That on or about the 06th day of March 2012 in the City of x x x xx x x xxxx , Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, being then the biological father of complainant AAA a minor 15 years old, by means of force, violence, and intimidation with lewd designs and intent to gratify his sexual desire, did, then and there willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously force said minor complainant to perform fellatio, then her father had sexual intercourse with her, against complainant AAA's will and consent, to her damage and prejudice. CONTRARY TO LAW. [7] When arraigned, XXX pleaded not guilty to the charges. AAA was born on March 17, 1996. She is the daughter of XXX. AAA related that XXX started raping her when she was thirteen (13) years old. He would rape her three or four times every week. She did not report the incidents, out of fear that he would kill her. Sometime in 2009, when AAA was thirteen (13) years old, XXX woke her up from her nap. He pulled her and removed her shorts and panty. AAA resisted, but XXX prevailed upon her. Then, XXX inserted his penis into her vagina. After the dastardly act, AAA went to the comfort room and saw blood gush out from her vagina. She was in pain. She informed her mother BBB that she has a wound in her vagina. However, XXX dismissed her claim, and said that her menstrual period had started. Again, on March 6, 2012, when AAA was fifteen (15) years old, XXX tried to have sexual intercourse with her. However, AAA refused his advances. This angered XXX who shouted invectives at her. He wanted to insert his penis into her mouth but when the latter refused, he pulled her hair and forced her to open her mouth. After inserting his penis into AAA's mouth, he then inserted his penis into her anus. Then, on March 7, 2012, XXX again approached AAA to have sex with her but she refused as she was in pain due to her swollen ""pwerta."" XXX kicked her. Fed up, AAA left their house and stayed with her classmate. She texted her mother to meet her on March 9, 2012. During the meeting, AAA told her mother everything that XXX had done to her. Thereafter, AAA and her mother went to the hospital, where AAA's cervix was operated on. She was confined for five (5) days. Upon recovering, AAA went to the police station to file a complaint against XXX. On the other hand, XXX vehemently denied the charges leveled against him. He claimed that AAA concocted the charges out of spite, because he disciplined her after he saw her naked with a boy at their house sometime in March 2009.","The CA affirmed XXX's conviction in its October 2, 2019 Decision. It stated that the prosecution established all the elements of qualified rape by carnal knowledge and qualified rape by sexual assault. It found AAA's testimony to be credible, positive, and straightforward, and rejected XXX's denial as unworthy of credence. As for Criminal Case No. 158508 (qualified rape by sexual assault), the CA conceded that the prosecution erroneously charged XXX with two separate crimes. However, it stressed that XXX may no longer question the defective Information, considering that he failed to timely contest it and even actively participated during the trial. The CA clarified that XXX was rightly convicted of qualified rape by sexual assault, not pursuant to the variance doctrine, but rather, due to his failure to question the duplicitous Information before the trial. Moreover, the CA stated that there was no violation of XXX's right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him considering that all the elements constituting the crimes charged were sufficiently set forth in the Information. Finally, the CA modified the amount of damages awarded in Criminal Case No. 158508, by increasing the award of civil indemnity, moral damages and exemplary damages from P30,000.00 each to P100,000.00.","The appeal is denied for lack of merit. XXX is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Qualified Rape in Criminal Case No. 158506. Verily, XXX is liable for qualified rape. He forcibly inserted his penis into AAA's vagina, despite her protests. AAA's minority at the time of the rape incident, as well as her relationship with XXX, were established through her Certificate of Live Birth. XXX is guilty of Lascivious Conduct under Section 5(b), Article III of R.A. No. 7610 in Criminal Case No. 158508. The Court clarified in People v. Tulagan that if the victim of rape by sexual assault is 12 years old and below 18 years old, the proper crime should be lascivious conduct under Section 5(b), Article III of R.A. No. 7610. Certainly, XXX's act of forcibly inserting his penis into AAA's mouth constitutes lascivious conduct, punishable under Section 5(b), Article III of R.A. No. 7610. XXX waived his right to question the Information in Criminal Case No. 158508, which was duplicitous (charging two distinct offenses), because he failed to timely interpose an objection before entering his plea, pursuant to Section 3, Rule 120 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure, allowing conviction of as many offenses as are charged and proved. The alleged lacuna in AAA's Medical Certificate, and her failure to immediately report the incident do not tarnish her credibility, as a medical examination is not indispensable in a prosecution for rape, and rational reaction cannot be expected from a minor confronted with a traumatic experience. XXX’s denial cannot overcome the positive declaration of the child-victim.","WHEREFORE, premises considered, the appeal is DENIED for lack of merit. The assailed October 2, 2019 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 12277 is hereby AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATION that in Criminal Case No. 158508, XXX is declared GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of Lascivious Conduct under Section 5(b), Article III of Republic Act No. 7610, and is sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua. He is ORDERED to PAY the victim AAA, (i) P75,000.00 as civil indemnity; (ii) P75,000.00 as moral damages; (iii) P75,000.00 as exemplary damages; and (iv) a fine of P15,000.00.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[7] The prosecution alleged that at around 2:30 in the morning of June 14, 2016, officers of the City Anti-Illegal Drug Special Operations Team (CAIDSOT) successfully conducted a buy-bust operation against Pulgado at the Caltex Station in front of a 7/11 Convenience Store along Arthur Street, West Bajac-Bajac, Olongapo City, during which, one (1) heat-sealed transparent plastic sachet containing 0.108 gram of white crystalline substance was recovered from him by Police Officer 3 Sherwin Tan (PO3 Tan). After Pulgado's arrest, Police Officer 2 Rexyboy Jugatan (PO2 Jugatan) frisked him and recovered four (4) more heat-sealed transparent plastic sachets containing a combined weight of 0.519 gram of the same substance from his possession. The police officers then brought Pulgado to the police station in Brgy. Barretto, Olongapo City, and thereat, PO3 Tan and PO2 Jugatan placed their initials on the seized items and turned them over to Police Officer 2 Benedick C. Sarmiento (PO2 Sarmiento) for marking, inventory, and photography in the presence of Pulgado, members of the CAIDSOT, Barangay Kagawad Dave Antonio (Brgy. Kgd. Antonio), and media representative Jeffrey B. Valdez of Brigada Siete. Thereafter, the seized items were taken to the Philippine National Police Crime Laboratory where, after examination by Police Senior Inspector Maria Cecilia G. Tang (PSI Tang), their contents tested positive for methamphetamine hydrochloride or shabu, a dangerous drug.[8] Thereafter, PSI Tang turned over the specimens to the prosecution office for safekeeping until their presentation during trial.[9] In defense, Pulgado denied the charges against him, as well as the ownership of the items purportedly seized from him. He claimed that on the day of the alleged incident, at around 7:00 in the evening, he was on his way home from the public market when he was arrested for allegedly stealing at the Caltex Station.[10]","In a Decision[11] dated October 25, 2017, the RTC found Pulgado guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crimes charged, and accordingly, sentenced him to suffer the following penalties: (a) in Criminal Case No. 2016-996, for the crime of Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs, the penalty of life imprisonment and to pay a fine in the amount of P500,000.00 plus costs without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency; and (b) in Criminal Case No. 2016-997, for the crime of Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs, the penalty of imprisonment for the indeterminate period of twelve (12) years and one (1) day, as minimum, to fourteen (14) years and eight (8) months, as maximum, and to pay a fine in the amount of P300,000.00 plus costs, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency.[12] [...] However, in a Decision[17] dated Jun 16, 2020, the CA affirmed the RTC ruling with modification, sentencing Pulgado to suffer the following penalties: (a) for the crime of Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs, the penalty of life imprisonment without eligibility for parole and to pay a fine in the amount of P500,000.00; and (b) for the crime of Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs, the penalty of imprisonment for a period of twelve (12) years and one (1) day, as minimum, to fourteen (14) years and eight (8) months, as maximum, and to pay a fine in the amount of P300,000.00.[18]","The appeal is meritorious. In cases for Illegal Sale and/or Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs under RA 9165,[21] it is essential that the identity of the dangerous drug be established with moral certainty... To establish the identity of the dangerous drugs with moral certainty, the prosecution must be able to account for each link in the chain of custody from the moment the drugs are seized up to their presentation in court as evidence of the crime.[24] [...] In this case, there appears to be a deviation from the chain of custody rule as records show that the marking of the items purportedly seized from Pulgado was performed only at the police station. Notably, while the failure of the apprehending team to strictly comply with the immediate marking requirement would not ipso facto render the seizure and custody over the items as void, it is nevertheless incumbent upon the prosecution to account for such deviation by presenting a justifiable reason therefor. Here, the prosecution did not duly explain such deviation, and merely insisted that the apprehending team complied with the marking requirement by conducting the same at the police station. [...] In view of the aforementioned unjustified non-compliance with the chain of custody rule, the Court is constrained to conclude that the integrity and evidentiary value of the drugs purportedly seized from Pulgado were compromised, thereby warranting his acquittal.","WHEREFORE, the appeal is GRANTED.

"G.R. No. 252861, February 15, 2022","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. ALEXANDER OLPINDO Y REYES, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","On October 6, 2008, accused-appellant Alexander Olpindo y Reyes was charged with the crime of rape in relation to R.A. No. 7610, for allegedly having carnal knowledge or sexual intercourse with AAA, a 14 year-old minor, by means of force, violence and intimidation, on or about February 27, 2008, in San Jose City. Accused-appellant was eventually apprehended on December 4, 2012, after evading arrest, and pleaded not guilty.

Version of the Prosecution: On February 27, 2008, AAA, then 14 years old, and her sister, BBB, were stopped by accused-appellant (driving a tricycle) and his sister, Mary Ann Olpindo. Accused-appellant and Mary Ann forced AAA aboard the tricycle. Mary Ann got off, and accused-appellant drove AAA to an uninhabited place in Barangay X. He tied her hands with rope, slammed her to the floor, removed her clothes, and inserted his penis into her vagina. AAA felt pain and cried. She reported the incident to her aunt the following day. A Medico-Legal Report was prepared by Dr. Janine Duran.

Version of the Defense: Accused-appellant claimed he and AAA were in a relationship for about five months and had previously had consensual sexual intercourse multiple times. He claimed AAA's grandmother, who opposed their relationship, forced AAA to file the charge. He denied using force and claimed he simply dropped AAA off near her house on the night of the incident.

Ruling of the RTC: The RTC found accused-appellant GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape and sentenced him to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua, and ordered him to pay AAA P50,000.00 as civil indemnity, P50,000.00 as moral damages, and P30,000.00 as exemplary damages.

CA Ruling: The CA affirmed the RTC Decision, giving credence to AAA’s testimony coupled with medical findings. However, the CA noted that the RTC erroneously elevated the case *motu proprio* for automatic review because the imposed penalty was *reclusion perpetua* and not death, and Olpindo failed to file a notice of appeal, rendering the RTC decision final. Nonetheless, the CA reviewed the records due to the gravity of the crime but dismissed the appeal without modifying the damages, reiterating the finality of the RTC decision.","The Court AFFIRMS with MODIFICATION the findings of fact and conclusions of law of the Court of Appeals in its November 22, 2019 Decision in CA-G.R. CR HC No. 08984.","The Court dismisses the appeal in form but finds it proper to exercise its prerogative to relax the technical rules of procedure in the interests of justice, particularly the right of the accused to life and liberty, excusing the non-filing of a notice of appeal because the RTC erroneously ordered the records forwarded to the CA for automatic review within the reglementary period. The Court found no reversible error in the conviction, ruling that the prosecution duly proved all the elements of rape by sexual intercourse (carnal knowledge confirmed by victim's testimony and corroborating medico-legal findings; use of force and intimidation established by AAA's narration). The defenses of denial, alibi, and the 'sweetheart theory' were weak, uncorroborated, and overcome by the victim's categorical testimony, and accused-appellant's four-year flight was highly indicative of his guilt. The Court modified the amount of damages pursuant to *People v. Jugueta*.","Accused-appellant Alexander Olpindo y Reyes is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of Rape punishable under Article 266-A, paragraph 1(a) of the Revised Penal Code and is hereby SENTENCED to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua. Further, he is ORDERED to PAY AAA civil indemnity in the amount of P75,000.00, moral damages in the amount of P75,000.00 and exemplary damages in the amount of P75,000.00, with interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the finality of this Decision until full payment."

When Angelique Pearl got unexpectedly pregnant at age 20 (Mark 21), she was hesitant to marry, but Mark insisted. After their wedding on January 3, 2009, Angelique Pearl discovered Mark's lies regarding his education (he needed several more years to finish college) and his father's occupation (security guard, not working for a certain company as claimed). Mark was lazy, extravagant, relied on her for financial support, and eventually left her and their son, Malique Antonio (born April 4, 2009), several times whenever he got upset. Their married life was marred by quarrels and violence, including one incident where Mark hit her in the face, breaking her jaw. Johnson C. Tiu, Angelique Pearl's uncle, corroborated her testimony regarding their turbulent relationship, Mark's lack of responsibility, and the physical abuse. Dr. Jay Madelon Castillo-Carcereny, a psychiatrist, diagnosed Angelique Pearl with ""borderline personality disorder"" and Mark with ""narcissistic personality disorder"" based on interviews, psychological tests, and information gathered from Angelique Pearl and her father. Dr. Castillo-Carcereny found the conditions to be ""grave, permanent and incurable."" Mark failed to present evidence. The Regional Trial Court – Branch 260, Parañaque City granted the petition for declaration of nullity.","Through its assailed Decision dated January 30, 2018, the Court of Appeals affirmed the grant of the petition for declaration of nullity of marriage, holding that from the totality of evidence presented, the trial court correctly determined that Angelique Pearl and Mark were both suffering from psychological incapacity characterized by gravity, juridical antecedence, and incurability. The Court of Appeals found that the assessment and professional opinion of Dr. Castillo-Carcereny conformed with the factual milieu of the case and the evidence presented by Angelique Pearl. The Court of Appeals subsequently denied the OSG's motion for reconsideration dated April 11, 2019.","The Supreme Court, applying Article 36 of the Family Code as clarified in Tan-Andal v. Andal, affirmed the uniform findings of the lower courts. The Court ruled that the Republic failed to provide compelling reason to deviate from the findings. The totality of evidence presented clearly and convincingly established the psychological incapacity of both Angelique Pearl and Mark, satisfying the criteria of juridical antecedence (their dysfunctional personality structures were manifest even before marriage), gravity (their constant fighting, cursing, and physical violence were not mere mild characterological peculiarities), and incurability (their respective personality structures are so incompatible and antagonistic that the only result of the union would be the inevitable breakdown of the marriage). The Court also held that the expert opinion of Dr. Castillo-Carcereny was admissible despite the lack of personal examination of Mark, as the information gathered was ""of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field.""","ACCORDINGLY, the petition is DENIED. The Decision dated January 30, 2018 and Resolution dated April 11, 2019 in CA-G.R. CV No. 107744 are AFFIRMED. The marriage between Angelique Pearl O. Claur and Mark A. Claur is declared VOID on ground of their psychological incapacity. Accordingly, their property relation as husband and wife is DISSOLVED. SO ORDERED."
"UDK-16915, February 15, 2022","JOSEPH ROBLE PEÑAS PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, REPRESENTED BY THE CAMPAIGN FINANCE UNIT RESPONDENT.","On November 28, 2009, petitioner filed his certificate of candidacy for Mayor of Digos City, Davao Del Sur for the 2010 National and Local Elections (NLE). He ran under the banner of the Nationalist People's Coalition (NPC). For the 2010 NLE, Digos City had a total of 93,801 registered voters. On June 7, 2010, in compliance with COMELEC Resolution No. 8944, petitioner filed with respondent COMELEC his Statement of Contributions and Expenditures (SOCE) where he declared his total election campaign expenditures in the amount of P600,000.00. By Letter dated October 1, 2014, respondent's Campaign Finance Unit informed petitioner that under Section 13 of RA 7166, a candidate who belongs to a political party is only allowed to spend three pesos (P3.00) for every registered voter in the constituency where he or she seeks to be elected. Hence, petitioner was allowed to spend up to P281,403.00 only for his election campaign. By spending P600,000.00 for his election campaign, as reported in his SOCE, petitioner clearly exceeded the expenditure limit allowed by law. Petitioner was given ten (10) days from receipt of the letter to submit his written explanation why no charges should be filed against him for election overspending. On October 29, 2014, petitioner submitted an Affidavit of Correction/Explanation to the COMELEC Law Department. He explained that he failed in good faith to specify the breakdown of his expenses in his SOCE. Petitioner clarified that of his reported P600,000.00 total campaign expenditures, P112,924.10 was spent for the printing of sample ballots and P245,000.00, for lawyer's fees. These items, he claimed, should not have been included in the computation of expenses incurred by a candidate conformably with Section 8 of COMELEC Resolution No. 8944 for the May 10, 2010 NLE, and Section 3, Rule 4 of COMELEC Resolution No. 9476 for the 2013 NLE. Had these amounts been deducted from the P600,000.00 expenditure he earlier reported, his expenses would have only totaled P241,574.01 for his election campaign, well within the expenditure limit prescribed by law. On November 6, 2014, the COMELEC Campaign Finance Unit filed a formal complaint against petitioner for alleged violation of Section 100 in relation to Section 262 of the OEC, as amended by RA 7166, for election overspending. On February 9, 2015, petitioner submitted his Counter-Affidavit dated January 26, 2015 where he essentially averred that the expenses for the printing of sample ballots and payment for the legal services of Atty. Diones were NPC political party expenses and not his own personal expenditure as mayoralty candidate, thus, should have been excluded from the computation of his expenditures during the 2010 campaign period. This is in accordance with Section 102(i) and (k) of the OEC which categorically state that the expenses for engagement of legal services and printing of sample ballots, respectively, are excluded from the computation of campaign expenses. The exclusion of these items would bring his total campaign expenditure to P241,574.01 only, well within the allowed expenditure limit of P281,403.00 for Digos City.","Resolution No. 18-0665 dated November 5, 2018, finding probable cause to hold petitioner for trial and consequently ordering the filing of an Information against him for violation of Section 100 of B.P. Blg. 881, otherwise known as the Omnibus Election Code (OEC), as amended by R.A. No. 7166, in relation to Section 262 of the same Code; and Resolution No. 20-0121-33 dated December 9, 2020, denying his motion for reconsideration.","The Supreme Court granted the petition, ruling that the COMELEC acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction when it recommended the filing of an Information against petitioner despite the inordinate and oppressive delay of about six (6) years which attended the conduct of preliminary investigation, thereby violating his constitutional right to a speedy disposition of his case.","The petition is GRANTED. Resolution No. 18-0665 dated November 5, 2018 and Resolution No. 20-0121-33 dated December 9, 2020 are NULLIFIED for having been rendered with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. The formal complaint against petitioner, Joseph Roble Peñas for alleged violation of Section 100 in relation to Section 262 of the OEC, as amended by RA 7166, for election overspending is DISMISSED."
"A.M. No. RTJ-11-2289 (Formerly OCA IPI No. 11-3656-RTJ), February 15, 2022","IN RE: ANONYMOUS LETTER DATED AUGUST 12, 2010, COMPLAINING AGAINST JUDGE OFELIA T. PINTO, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, BRANCH 60, ANGELES CITY, PAMPANGA.","In an anonymous letter-complaint dated August 12, 2010 filed before the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA), petitioner was charged with Dishonesty, violation of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, Gross Misconduct in violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct, and Knowingly Rendering an Unjust Judgment. The charge was based on her act of granting the motion to reopen Criminal Case No. 91-937 filed by the convicted accused (at large) despite the finality of the decision in said case. While agreeing with the OCA's findings, the Court, in a Decision dated October 2, 2012, modified the recommended penalty from suspension to dismissal from service, with forfeiture of all retirement benefits, except accrued leave credits, and with prejudice to reemployment in government service, and held petitioner guilty of Gross Ignorance of the Law for violating Section 24, Rule 119 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure. This dismissal was influenced by her previous administrative liabilities in Pineda v. Pinto and Marcos v. Pinto. Seven (7) years after her dismissal, petitioner filed a letter appealing for judicial clemency on June 12, 2019, which was denied on July 28, 2020. She filed another Petition for Judicial Clemency dated August 1, 2020, which was noted without action. Shortly thereafter, she filed the present Plea for Partial Judicial Clemency dated July 28, 2021, seeking the 'restor[ation] or reinstate[ment] [of her] retirement benefits, considering her financial situation and the difficulty of surviving in [the] pandemic,' citing her age (75), deteriorating health (Type II Diabetes Mellitus and Hypertension), her husband's condition (cerebrovascular accident), and submitting numerous certifications and testimonials proving her genuine remorse and active participation in social and religious activities in her community.","All told, the Court finds that the instant petition has prima facie merit. Consequently, the Court refers the present petition to the OCA, which is directed to, within ninety (90) calendar days from notice of this Resolution: (a) conduct the requisite fact-finding in order to verify the details and the authenticity of the statements in and evidence attached to the clemency petition; and (b) submit its fact-finding report to the Court.","The Court applied the refined guidelines for judicial clemency established in Re: Allegations Made under Oath at the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee Hearing Held on September 26, 2013 Against Associate Justice Gregory S. Ong, Sandiganbayan (Re: Ong) and Nuñez v. Ricafort (Ricafort), which require a five (5)-year minimum period before dismissal or disbarment can be the subject of any kind of clemency, and mandates the referral of cases demonstrating prima facie merit to a fact-finding commission. The Court found that the five (5)-year minimum period was complied with, as petitioner was dismissed in 2012. Furthermore, the Court found a prima facie showing of genuine remorse and repentance by petitioner, noting her acceptance of her mistakes, expression of regret, and subsequent actions detailed in her certifications from various community and religious organizations, as well as her advanced age, deteriorating health, and economic difficulties, which are factors considered in granting judicial clemency.","WHEREFORE, the Court, finding prima facie merit in the instant Plea for Partial Judicial Clemency, resolves to REFER the case to the Office of the Court Administrator, which is DIRECTED to, within ninety (90) calendar days from notice of this Resolution, conduct the requisite fact-finding and submit its report thereon in accordance with this Resolution."
"A.C. No. 8111, February 15, 2022","ADELITA S. VILLAMOR, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. ELY GALLAND A. JUMAO-AS, RESPONDENT.","On December 9, 2020, the Court suspended Atty. Jumao-as from the practice of law for two years for violating Canon 15, Rule 15.03 of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR), which provides:
Canon 15 — A lawyer shall observe candor, fairness and loyalty in all his dealings and transactions with his client.
x x x x
Rule 15.03 — A lawyer shall not represent conflicting interests except by written consent of all concerned given after a full disclosure of the facts.
Atty. Jumao-as was found to have represented conflicting interests by committing the following acts: he facilitated the incorporation of AEV Villamor Credit, Inc. (AEV), complainant Adelita S. Villamor (Villamor)'s lending company; he persuaded Villamor to borrow money from one Debbie Yu (Yu) to beef up AEV's capital; he left AEV to join 3 E's Debt Equity Grant Co. (3 E's), a lending company owned by Yu; he incited a diaspora of AEV's collectors to join 3 E's; he told AEV's collectors to remit their collections to 3 E's since Villamor owed Yu; and he even sent a demand letter to Villamor, for and in behalf of Yu, demanding that Villamor pay the amount she owed Yu.
Atty. Jumao-as now moves to reduce his penalty, either to a stern warning or a two-month suspension. Humbly admitting to his faults, he prays that this Court consider the reasons quoted hereunder for the mitigation of his administrative punishment:
I was a new lawyer at that time and I fall short of my professional judgment;
Long before the promulgation of this case, I already realized my mistake during the mediation stage of my case x x x. I quickly offered to pay the debts of [Villamor] and I paid her debt [to Yu] x x x I also brokered the reconciliation of complainant with [her] general manager;
Even though the Affidavit of Desistance cannot dismiss the administrative case, I pray that it will be considered as a mitigating factor x x x;
The bounced checks of the complainant did not reach to court because I personally settled her obligations;
In the spirit of compassion especially during this time of pandemic where the means of living is difficult to meet, I plead for consideration to shorten my suspension.","The Court treats Atty. Jumao-as' Motion to Reduce Penalty as a motion for reconsideration, and grants the same and accordingly reduces the penalty originally meted to Atty. Jumao-as.","His speedy initiative to make amends and take responsibility of the entire debt of Villamor to Yu in the amount of P650,000.00 is by all means remarkable. He also expended extraordinary efforts to straighten out the corporate scuffles involving him and complainant Villamor and they have resumed their business dealings in good terms. Grave though his transgressions may have been, the sincerity of Atty. Jumao-as' remorse is reflected in his words and actions, which impresses this Court. . . All told, the Court finds good reason in jurisprudence and in fact to reconsider its previous administrative sentence of suspension for two years upon Atty. Jumao-as. He shall remain suspended from the practice of law, but for the shorter period of one year.","ACCORDINGLY, respondent Atty. Ely Galland A. Jumao-as' Motion to Reduce Penalty is TREATED as a Motion for Reconsideration and the same is GRANTED IN PART. The Court's December 9, 2020 Decision in this case is MODIFIED, in that respondent is SUSPENDED from the practice of law for the reduced period of one year and WARNED that a repetition of the same or similar acts will be dealt with more severely."

No. RTJ-14-2372 (Formerly OCA IPI No. 11-3736-RTJ), February 15, 2022] HOME DEVELOPMENT MUTUAL FUND, REPRESENTED BY ATTY. JOSE ROBERTO F. PO, COMPLAINANT, VS. ROLANDO G. MISLANG, PRESIDING JUDGE, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT OF PASIG CITY, BRANCH 167, RESPONDENT.","In 2010, the Department of Justice (DOJ) conducted a preliminary investigation against Delfin S. Lee (Lee) and other officers of Globe Asiatique Realty Holdings Corporation (Globe Asiatique) for the alleged fraudulent loans taken out by Globe Asiatique's agents, on behalf of fake borrowers, from the Pag-IBIG Fund/Home Development Mutual Fund (HDMF), which caused the latter damages in the amount of P6.5-billion, docketed as NPS Docket No. XVI-INV-10J-00319 (1st DOJ case). The NBI Anti-Graft Division also recommended the filing of criminal charges against Lee and the others for syndicated estafa constituting economic sabotage, which was later docketed as NPS Docket No. XVI-INV-10L-00363 before the DOJ (2nd DOJ case). Meanwhile, Lee and Globe Asiatique filed a Complaint for specific performance and damages against the HDMF before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Makati City (specific performance case)... Eventually, Lee filed a petition for injunction with application for a temporary restraining order (TRO) before the RTC of Pasig City (injunction case), seeking the suspension of the proceedings in the 2nd DOJ case on the ground that the issues raised in the specific performance case posed a prejudicial question thereto. Petitioner, as handling judge, granted the prayer for TRO in an Order dated August 16, 2011. On August 25, 2011, Lee filed an amended petition to likewise enjoin the DOJ from filing an Information with respect to the 1st DOJ case. The DOJ's opposition notwithstanding, petitioner, on August 26, 2011, granted a TRO in favor of Lee enjoining the conduct of the 1st DOJ case. Averring that petitioner's actions in the injunction case were constitutive of Gross Ignorance of the Law, both the HDMF and the DOJ filed the instant administrative disciplinary complaints against petitioner. In the meantime, petitioner converted the August 26, 2011 TRO to a writ of preliminary injunction (WPI) in an Order dated September 5, 2011. In a Decision dated July 26, 2016, the Court found petitioner guilty of Gross Ignorance of the Law... Consequently, owing to petitioner's repeated infractions and refusal to correct his ways, the Court imposed the penalty of dismissal from service with forfeiture of retirement benefits, except leave credits, and with prejudice to reemployment in any branch or instrumentality of the government, including government-owned and controlled corporations. Subsequent to the promulgation of the July 26, 2016 Decision, petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration, as well as second, third, and fourth motions for reconsideration. The first three were denied, while the last one was noted without action. However, petitioner nevertheless filed several motions to resolve his fourth motion for reconsideration, the latest of which was received by the Court only on June 14, 2021. Overall, petitioner maintained his innocence, and alternatively, posited that the penalty of dismissal was not commensurate to the offense committed. Notably, petitioner likewise filed a letter-request dated January 31, 2019 with the Office of the President, seeking the Executive's assistance with regard to the Court's continued inaction on his fourth motion for reconsideration. He also filed a letter-request to the Court En Banc dated June 3, 2021 again reiterating his appeal that the merits of his case be revisited. In both the foregoing letters, petitioner stressed that his administrative cases were politically/personally motivated by then Chief Justice Maria Lourdes P. A. Sereno, then Secretary of Justice Leila M. De Lima, and Deputy Court Administrator (DCA) Raul B. Villanueva. A little over three (3) months later, or on September 22, 2021, petitioner filed the instant Petition for Judicial Clemency, praying that he be allowed to retire with full benefits and that his disqualification from reemployment in any branch or instrumentality of the government, including government-owned and controlled corporations, be lifted, citing a long and satisfactory track record of government service both in the Executive and Judicial departments, mounting indebtedness, and ailing conditions requiring continuous medical maintenance in his plea for clemency.","In this case, while the petition complied with the five (5)-year minimum period set in Re: Ong, it nonetheless failed to demonstrate a prima facie case warranting the grant of judicial clemency. The Court found that there is a lack of prima facie showing of petitioner's genuine repentance and remorse for his past infractions. Records show that not up until recently, petitioner was still insistent upon his innocence and the unfairness of his dismissal. His most recent assertion of innocence, as seen in his letter-request to the Court En Banc dated June 3, 2021, was made only three (3) months prior to the filing of the instant petition. Worse, he even sought the intervention of the President in a matter that is wholly within the discretion of the Judiciary. It was only in this present petition filed last September 22, 2021 that petitioner openly admitted that he was remorseful for his misdeeds and has accepted the Court's verdict of dismissal against him. Furthermore, the supporting Certificate from the Lord's Vineyard Covenant Community, attesting to his alleged socio-civic legal services, was generally worded and lacked any specific details, failing to meet the requirement for specific proof of reformation.","For a clemency plea to prosper, there must be a convincing showing of genuine repentance and remorse for one's past infractions. As the Court sees it, the lack of remorse of petitioner throughout the years negates a prima facie finding that he had genuinely repented for his ways. His bare statement in the petition that he 'expressed his heartfelt apology and remorse for [his] misdeeds' leaves much to be desired as it appears that he had only accepted the Court's ruling to dismiss him in the present petition filed a few months ago. When there is no showing of genuine remorse or that the petitioner has sufficiently reformed his ways, the Court must temper its grant of mercy with the greater interest of the public.","WHEREFORE, the instant Petition for Judicial Clemency dated September 8, 2021 is hereby DENIED."
"G.R. Nos. 214336-37, February 15, 2022","QUIRINO M. LIBUNAO, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","At the heart of the present controversy is the Countrywide Development Fund (CDF) allocated to accused Constantino H. Navarro, Jr., then Surigao Del Norte First District representative. The COA conducted a special review and discovered that P13,832,569.00 of said CDF was used to purchase, on different occasions, assorted medicines, shabu testing kits, nebulizing machines, sporting materials, rice paddy plows (araro), blackboard erasers, chalks, and notebooks from various suppliers through direct contracting, in violation of Section 3 of Executive Order (E.O.) No. 302 resulting in an overpricing of the items purchased amounting to P2,863,689.36. The Office of the Ombudsman criminally charged, among others, Quirino M. Libunao (Regional Director of the DILG-Caraga) before the Sandiganbayan in Criminal Case Nos. 27803 and 27805 for violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019. In Criminal Case No. 27803, Libunao approved the purchase of P2,000,000.00 assorted medicine from San Marino. In Criminal Case No. 27805, he approved the purchase of P900,000.00 araro tools from Revelstone. Libunao testified that he signed the documents relying on his subordinates who assured him that the same were in order. The Sandiganbayan found Libunao guilty beyond reasonable doubt for acting in evident bad faith and manifest partiality in giving unwarranted benefits to the accused suppliers when they resorted to direct contracting, instead of public bidding.","On January 16, 2014, the Sandiganbayan found that the prosecution successfully proved with moral certainty that public officers, Libunao and Derecho gave unwarranted benefits to Revelstone, San Marino, Mt. Bethel, and E.G. Trading when they resorted to direct contracting, instead of public bidding. Thus, with respect to Libunao in Criminal Case Nos. 27803 and 27805, the Sandiganbayan disposed as follows: 7. In Criminal Case No. 27803, accused QUIRINO M. LIBUNAO is found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019, and pursuant to Section 9 thereof, is hereby sentenced to suffer the indeterminate penalty of imprisonment of six (6) years and one (1) month as minimum up to ten (10) years as maximum, with perpetual disqualification from holding public office. . . 9.

"G.R. No. 214071, February 15, 2022","REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, REPRESENTED BY THE ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING COUNCIL, PETITIONER, VS. HON. ANTONIO M. EUGENIO, JR., AS THE FORMER PRESIDING JUDGE OF BRANCH 24, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, CITY OF MANILA; HON. LYLIHA L. ABELLA-AQUINO, AS ACTING PRESIDING JUDGE OF BRANCH 24, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, CITY OF MANILA; THE ESTATE OF TERESITA ROJO CORPUS; AND TERESITA GOMEZ, RESPONDENTS.","This case stemmed from Civil Case No. 03-107324, a money laundering case filed before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila (RTC-Manila) by petitioner, represented by the Anti-Money Laundering Council (AMLC), against Conrado Ariola, Jr. and his conspirators (Ariola, et al.). The AMLC argued before the RTC-Manila that Ariola, et al. violated Sections 8.1, 26.1, and 26.3 of the Securities Regulation Code[4] by soliciting investments from the general public without the necessary secondary licenses to do so.[5] The AMLC prayed that the assets of Ariola, et al. be forfeited in favor of the government. During the civil forfeiture proceedings before the RTC-Manila, AMLC offered into evidence the testimonies of Teresita Corpus (Corpus) and Teresita Gomez (Gomez) (collectively, private respondents). Private respondents testified that Ariola, et al. induced them to invest large amounts of money with Five Vision Consultancy, Inc. (Five Vision), which was owned by Ariola, et al. They also filed a related case for collection of sum of money directly against Ariola, et al. before the RTC of Makati City (RTC-Makati).[6] Branch 132 of the RTC-Makati ruled that Corpus and Gomez invested P4,720,000.00 and P11,799,000.00 in Five Vision, respectively.[7] Subsequently, in a Decision[8] dated January 11, 2011, Branch 24 of the RTC-Manila in the civil forfeiture proceedings granted AMLC's Complaint and declared Ariola, et al.'s bank accounts forfeited in favor of the government. After receipt of the RTC-Manila's order of forfeiture, private respondents jointly filed a pleading captioned ""Second Verified Petition""[9] dated February 8, 2011. This was in compliance with Section 35 of A.M. No. 05-11-04-SC[10] (the Rules on Civil Forfeiture) which states: Sec. 35. Notice to File Claims. - Where the court has issued an order of forfeiture of the monetary instrument or property in a civil forfeiture petition for any money laundering offense defined under Section 4 of Republic Act No. 9160, as amended, any person who has not been impleaded nor intervened claiming an interest therein may apply, by verified petition, for a declaration that the same legitimately belongs to him and for segregation or exclusion of the monetary instrument or property corresponding thereto. The verified petition shall be filed with the court which rendered the order of forfeiture within fifteen days from the date of finality of the order of forfeiture, in default of which the said order shall be executory and bar all other claims.[11] (Emphasis supplied) In their Second Verified Petition, private respondents prayed that a portion of the funds forfeited in favor of the government be released to them equivalent to the amounts that they were induced to invest in Ariola, et al.'s fraudulent investment scheme. They also prayed that they be allowed to litigate in forma pauperis, alleging that they were both jobless and without sufficient means to support their families, let alone to pay the filing and docket fees. The RTC-Manila issued an Order dated February 18, 2011, directing the AMLC to file within 15 days its Comment on the Second Verified Petition.[12] Instead of filing a Comment or Opposition, the AMLC filed a Manifestation and Motion[13] dated February 21, 2011. Citing Sections 36[14] and 37[15] of the Rules on Civil Forfeiture, the AMLC posited that its deadline to file a Comment should be suspended until after the RTC-Manila has ruled on the sufficiency in form and substance of the Second Verified Petition and resolved the motion to litigate in forma pauperis.[16] The RTC-Manila subsequently issued an Order[17] dated March 21, 2011 setting for hearing the motion to litigate as pauper litigants, and noting but without making any explicit ruling on the AMLC's Manifestation and Motion. On May 23, 2011, the RTC-Manila issued an Order[18] allowing private respondents to litigate as pauper litigants and exempting them from paying the docket and filing fees. Several months later, on September 21, 2011, private respondents moved for the issuance of an order approving their claim in their Second Verified Petition,[19] pointing out that the AMLC had not filed any comment thereon and that their claims were not contested, since the AMLC adopted their testimonies as evidence during the civil forfeiture proceedings. The AMLC opposed[20] this motion. It argued that its 15 days to file a comment/opposition should commence only after the RTC-Manila has ruled that the Second Verified Petition was sufficient in form and substance. It also said that the fact that private respondents were presented as witnesses by the AMLC before the civil forfeiture proceedings did not automatically result in an admission of their respective claims against the forfeited assets. After a further exchange of pleadings, the RTC-Manila eventually issued an Order[21] dated January 31, 2012 (Assailed Order) granting private respondents' motion for issuance of an order approving an uncontested claim. The RTC-Manila noted that prior to the Second Verified Petition and while the forfeiture proceedings were still pending, private respondents filed an earlier ""Verified Petition"" which the RTC-Manila ordered AMLC to comment on in an Order dated July 27, 2006.[22] Hence, AMLC had already been given two opportunities to oppose private respondents' claims, since it was ordered to respond to both the first and second Verified Petitions. It also pointed out that Section 37 of the Rules on Civil Forfeiture does not require that a separate order explicitly declaring the petition filed by claimants as sufficient in form and substance be issued before directing the AMLC to comment thereon. Finally, the RTC-Manila found it unfair that the AMLC would contest private respondents' claims after using their testimonies as evidence in its favor during the civil forfeiture proceedings. Upon motion of private respondents, the RTC-Manila issued an Order[23] dated August 17, 2012 correcting the amounts awarded to the two claimants. Subsequently, the RTC-Manila denied AMLC's motion for reconsideration for lack of merit.[24] AMLC filed a Petition for Certiorari[25] with the CA assailing the RTC-Manila's Orders. Considering that the RTC-Manila subsequently issued another Order[26] on January 11, 2013 directing the issuance of a writ of execution of its Assailed Order, the AMLC applied for,[27] and was granted by the CA, a temporary restraining order and a writ of preliminary injunction, which were issued by the CA on March 21, 2013[28] and June 2, 2013,[29] respectively.[30] In its Assailed Decision, the CA ruled that the RTC-Manila did not act with grave abuse of discretion in issuing its Assailed Order. Interpreting Section 37 of the Rules on Civil Forfeiture, the CA concluded that it was not necessary for the RTC-Manila to issue a separate Order finding that private respondents' Second Verified Petition was sufficient in form and substance; its Order directing the AMLC to file a Comment to the said petition is notice enough that the petition was found acceptable. The AMLC cannot compel the RTC-Manila to issue an Order which is not required by the Rules on Civil Forfeiture. According to the CA, the AMLC's Manifestation and Motion should be considered a motion to extend its time to file a comment, which it is not entitled to as a matter of right. In its Resolution[31] dated August 28, 2014, the CA denied the AMLC's motion for reconsideration for alleging no new matters of substance which could justify the reversal of the Assailed Decision. Hence, this Petition. Before the Court, the AMLC introduces a new argument: that the Second Verified Petition was premature. It cites Section 35 of the Rules on Civil Forfeiture which states: Sec. 35. Notice to File Claims. - Where the court has issued an order of forfeiture of the monetary instrument or property in a civil forfeiture petition for any money laundering offense defined under Section 4 of Republic Act No. 9160, as amended, any person who has not been impleaded nor intervened claiming an interest therein may apply, by verified petition, for a declaration that the same legitimately belongs to him and for segregation or exclusion of the monetary instrument or property corresponding thereto. The verified petition shall be filed with the court which rendered the order of forfeiture within fifteen days from the date of finality of the order of forfeiture, in default of which the said order shall be executory and bar all other claims. (Emphasis supplied) In relation to the above provision, the AMLC notes that private respondents received a copy of the RTC-Manila's order of forfeiture on January 31, 2011, and said order would have attained finality 15 days later or on February 15, 2011, if Ariola, et al. did not file a motion for reconsideration or appeal.[32] Private respondents' Second Verified Petition was, however, dated February 8, 2011; hence, it was premature. The AMLC further argues that the issue of prematurity is jurisdictional, and may be raised at any time, even for the first time on petition for review before the Court. Aside from this, the AMLC also reiterates its arguments before the CA: that it was deprived of due process because the RTC-Manila declared private respondents' claims as uncontested without comment from the AMLC, and that said claims were contested and needed to be heard and supported by evidence. For their part, private respondents argue that the AMLC availed of the wrong remedy when it filed a petition for certiorari before the CA. They point out that the AMLC should have appealed from the RTC-Manila's Decision pursuant to the Rules on Civil Forfeiture. They also point out that the AMLC's prematurity argument was raised for the first time before the Court, and that it is erroneous because Section 35 of the Rules on Civil Forfeiture merely prescribes a deadline for filing a claim, not a prohibition on filing prior to finality of the order of forfeiture. They also echo the CA's ruling that the Rules on Civil Forfeiture do not require the RTC to issue a separate order finding the petition sufficient in form and substance. Finally, they emphasize that the AMLC judicially admitted their claims when it used their testimonies as evidence before the RTC-Manila. On August 6, 2019, counsel for Corpus filed a Notice of Death[33] informing the Court that she passed away last January 19, 2018 and that upon her death, a petition for the probate of her Holographic Will with an application for appointment of an administrator had been filed and pending before the RTC of Pasig City, Branch 71 (RTC-Pasig).[34] On August 14, 2019, the Court, via a Resolution,[35] required said counsel to inform the Court of the duly appointed administrator/administratrix of the estate of Corpus so that s/he could be substituted for the deceased. On December 2, 2020, because no such notification had been filed, the Court resolved to require counsel to show cause why he should not be disciplinarily dealt with or held in contempt, and to comply with the Court's Resolution dated August 14, 2019, within 10 days from notice.[36] On January 26, 2021, Atty. Mark Anthony B. Ploteña (Atty. Ploteña) filed a Motion for Substitution[37] informing the Court that he had been appointed as the Special Administrator of the Estate of Teresita Tirol Rojo (the maiden name of Corpus).[38] Attached thereto were original copies of the Letters of Special Administration[39] issued by the Clerk of Court of the RTC-Pasig, and Atty. Ploteña's Oath of Office.[40] On March 8, 2021, private respondents, through Atty. Ploteña, also filed a Manifestation and Compliance[41] with the Court's Resolution dated December 2, 2020, praying that the Court refrain from holding him in contempt. The Court hereby finds that Atty. Ploteña has duly complied with the Court's directives and substitution as prayed for is proper.","The Court found no merit in the instant Petition. Although the AMLC availed of the wrong remedy (certiorari instead of appeal) in challenging the RTC Order, the CA was correct in exercising leniency and resolving the matter on the merits, given that the case involved significant sums fraudulently obtained from victims of a large-scale investment scam. The Court held that the AMLC was not denied due process, having been given two separate opportunities to contest private respondents' claims but failing to do so through its own fault and lackadaisical attitude. Furthermore, the Court rejected the AMLC's argument that the Second Verified Petition was prematurely filed, holding that Section 35 of the Rules on Civil Forfeiture does not prohibit early filing but merely sets a deadline. The Court emphasized that AMLC failed to offer any substantive arguments against private respondents' entitlement to their claims, relying only on procedural technicalities.","The Court finds no merit in the instant Petition. There is indeed merit in private respondents' argument that the AMLC should have appealed from the RTC-Manila's Assailed Order instead of filing a petition for certiorari. Appeal under Section 42 is available as a remedy for any final orders of the RTC as regards any claims against the forfeited assets. x x x Nevertheless, the acceptance of a petition for certiorari, as well as the grant of due course thereto is, generally, addressed to the sound discretion of the court. The provisions of the Rules of Court, which are technical rules, may be relaxed in certain exceptional situations. x x x The AMLC was not deprived of due process. A perusal of the records would reveal that it was given two separate opportunities to contest private respondents' claims, since the RTC-Manila directed it to file a comment on both the first and Second Verified Petitions. In both instances, the AMLC failed to file a comment as directed. The AMLC is also mistaken in expecting that the RTC-Manila should have issued a separate and explicit order declaring private respondents' petition as sufficient in form and substance. As pointed out by the CA, Section 35 of the Rules on Civil Forfeiture does not require the RTC to issue such an order. There is no merit in the AMLC's argument that the Second Verified Petition was prematurely filed. Section 35 does not explicitly prohibit the filing of a claimant's verified petition earlier than the finality of the order of forfeiture. x x x to equate this period to an absolute prohibition against early filing — as proposed by the AMLC — seems neither practical nor logical. The 15-day period prescribed by Section 35 should not be read in a way that will unduly impair a claimant's chance to assert his or her claim against the forfeited assets.","WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court RESOLVES to: NOTE the Manifestation and Compliance dated March 5, 2021 filed by private respondents through counsel, Atty. Mark Anthony B. Ploteña; GRANT the Motion for Substitution dated January 22, 2021 of Atty. Mark Anthony B. Ploteña and SUBSTITUTE the Estate of Teresita Rojo Corpus for private respondent Teresita Corpus; and DENY the Anti-Money Laundering Council's Petition for Review on Certiorari with Prayer for the Issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order. The Decision dated January 27, 2014 and Resolution dated August 28, 2014 of the Court of Appeals Former Eleventh Division in CA-G.R. SP No. 127303 are hereby AFFIRMED. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 230502, February 15, 2022","LUISITO C. REYES, PETITIONER, VS. JEBSENS MARITIME, INC. AND ALFA SHIP & CREW MANAGEMENT GMBH, RESPONDENTS.","Petitioner was hired by Alfa as Second Officer on September 16, 2013, through its local manning agent, Jebsens. His employment was covered by a standard employment contract for a period of six months with the vessel MV Pacific Fantasy, which was later renamed as MV Voge Fantasy. Halfway through his contract, on December 26, 2013, he allegedly figured in an accident while on board the vessel. He slipped and fell, hitting his buttocks on the floor while releasing the tug line of the ship. He felt pain in his lumbar area, but he continued to work. His lower back pain, however, persisted. On March 21, 2014, he was brought to a hospital in Sweden. Radiographs and CT scan of his lumbar spine revealed a L1 vertebra fracture. He was declared unfit to work and was repatriated on March 29, 2014. On April 2, 2014, he underwent an x-ray of his lumbar spine with UPMC Philippines (UPMC), the result of which showed a 'compression deformity of the L1 vertebral body.' On April 21, 2014, MRI revealed: (1) mild to moderate chronic compression fracture of the L1 vertebra body; (2) non-specific signal abnormality involving the posterior aspects of the T12-L1 invertebral disc; and (3) minimal L1-L2 and L4-L5 disc bulge. On July 14, 2014, or 108 days from petitioner's repatriation, the company-designated physician issued a final medical report with the following findings: Final Diagnosis: healed Compression fracture, L1 secondary to Osteoporosis and s/p 2 sets of physical therapy (6 sessions each); Recommendation: maximal medical improvement, fit to work for the condition referred, case closure. Petitioner was unsatisfied and sought opinions from Dr. Manuel Fidel Magtira (July 23, 2014) and Dr. Noel Trinidad (October 21, 2014), who both declared him permanently unfit in any capacity for further sea duties. Respondents denied that petitioner suffered an injury due to an accident, claiming his contract finished March 19, 2014, and his illness was degenerative (secondary to osteoporosis). The Labor Arbiter (LA) rendered a Decision dismissing petitioner's complaint for lack of merit, ruling petitioner failed to prove by substantial evidence that he suffered a work-related injury. The NLRC affirmed the LA. Petitioner sought relief before the CA. The CA affirmed the resolutions of the NLRC. The CA held that while petitioner's assertion of an accident was not substantiated (thus CBA was inapplicable), his injury was work-related under the POEA-SEC due to the disputable presumption, but he was not entitled to benefits because he failed to observe the third-doctor referral provision. Petitioner filed the present petition raising, briefly, the following arguments: Petitioner requested for referral to a third doctor and that it was respondents who failed to abide by such requirement; There were serious doubts marring the findings of the company-designated physician; Despite the finding of three (3) injuries, the company-designated physician assessed only one of those injuries; and Petitioner has substantially proven by evidence that he suffered injury as a result of an accident.","The petition is partly meritorious. x x x The CA, on the other hand, disagreed with the labor tribunals and came up with a contrary finding that petitioner's illness or injury was, in fact, work-related. x x x records show that respondents failed to dispute the presumption of work-relatedness of petitioner's injury. x x x Petitioner's work included, among others: the assisting in cargo handling and operations; handling of the vessel, in docking, anchoring, piloting en route, in close quarters and open sea conditions; assisting in mooring and unmooring of the vessel in port and at off-shore locations; and the testing of equipment. The CA correctly observed that the examinations, procedures, and diagnosis have amply proven petitioner's work-related injury. x x x The conflicting findings called for the referral to a third doctor jointly agreed upon by the parties and whose findings shall be final and binding upon them. x x x the Minutes of the Single Entry Approach (SENA) revealed that petitioner provided Jebsens with the second doctor's certificate and relevant CBA provision. Also, contrary to the CA's findings, petitioner expressly proposed the referral to a third doctor. It was respondents who refused this, claiming through their counsel, that they had not been given authority to refer the case to a third doctor. x x x Respondents clearly failed to abide by the mandatory referral procedure under the law. As a result, the findings of the company-designated physician cannot be automatically deemed conclusive and binding. x x x We give greater weight and credence on the medical report of petitioner's physician, Dr. Magtira, that the former is deemed permanently disabled and unfit for any sea duties. x x x is petitioner entitled to total and permanent disability benefits under the alleged CBA provision he invoked? We rule in the negative. Petitioner failed to prove the fact of accident, either by documentary or testimonial evidence. The CBA provision, therefore, cannot apply here. Nonetheless, petitioner is not without any recourse as the POEA-SEC also governs his employment contract. As the Court gives credence to the assessment of petitioner's physicians of choice, he is entitled to the maximum total and permanent disability benefit of $60,000.00 provided under the POEA-SEC. x x x We deem it proper to award attorney's fees in favor of petitioner at ten percent (10%) of the total monetary awards following Art. 2208 of the New Civil Code.","WHEREFORE, the petition is PARTIALLY GRANTED. The November 16, 2016 Decision and March 9, 2017 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 142799, which affirmed the June 18, 2015 and July 30, 2015 Resolutions of the National Labor Relations Commission, are REVERSED and SET ASIDE.","Respondents are jointly and severally liable to PAY Luisito C. Reyes the following: 1) Permanent and total disability benefit in the amount of US$60,000.00, or its peso equivalent at the time of payment; and, 2) Attorney's fees at the rate of ten percent (10%) of the total monetary award. Respondents are likewise liable for legal interest at six percent (6%) per annum of the foregoing monetary awards computed from the finality of this Decision until full satisfaction."
"G.R. No. 202029, February 15, 2022","ISABELO CABALHIN, PETITIONER, VS. SPOUSES BONIFACIO LANSUELA AND ISIDRA LANSUELA, * RESPONDENTS.","The present controversy involves a parcel of agricultural land (irrigated riceland) situated in Barangay Dacutan, Municipality of Esperanza, Province of Agusan del Sur, with an area of 34,661 square meters. Said property is registered in the name of Isidoro Cabalhin (Isidoro) under Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. P-2133 issued on September 3, 1958. Isidoro passed away in 1974. On May 31, 2002, Isabelo Cabalhin (petitioner) filed a Complaint for Recovery of Possession with Preliminary and/or Temporary Restraining Order against the spouses Bonifacio Lansuela and Isidra Lansuela (respondents). Petitioner alleged that he was in actual, public, continuous, peaceful and adverse possession of the subject land, having inherited the same from his father, Isidoro. He claimed that in June 1993, while he was visiting relatives, Bonifacio, by means of force, intimidation, stealth, and strategy, entered the property. Upon returning in 1997, petitioner demanded respondents vacate, but Bonifacio claimed to have bought the land from Isidoro. Petitioner could not recall any such conveyance, noting his father gave him OCT No. P-2133 one year before his demise. Respondents countered that since May 1988, they had been in peaceful possession. They narrated that the property was already sold by Isidoro to Enrique Perales (Perales) under a Deed of Sale dated June 20, 1968. The heirs of Perales sold the same to Teodoro Estorion (Estorion) by virtue of a Deed of Extrajudicial Partition with Simultaneous Sale dated August 31, 1973. Under a Deed of Sale dated January 24, 1979, Estorion sold the property to Segros Manaay (Manaay) who, in turn, sold it to Bonifacio under a Deed of Absolute Sale dated May 9, 1988. Respondents had also been paying the real estate taxes due on the land.","The Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the November 28, 2007 Decision of the Regional Trial Court (RTC). It held that an unrecorded deed of sale is binding between the parties and their privies because actual notice is equivalent to registration, stressing that registration is not a mode of acquiring ownership. The CA noted that the four deeds of sale were notarized documents. The CA further faulted petitioner for failing to discharge his burden of showing that the land possessed by respondents is the very same property that belongs to him, and that the sales embodied in the series of documents presented by the respondents were bogus.","The petition is meritorious. The Court ruled that ownership is acquired only upon actual or constructive delivery (tradition). While execution of a public instrument (Art. 1498) is equivalent to delivery, this creates only a prima facie presumption, which is negated by the failure of the vendee to take actual possession. The execution of a public instrument does not result in constructive delivery if the vendor does not have actual possession of the thing sold. In this case, respondents' vendor, Manaay, was not in possession of either the land or the title, thus he could not effect constructive delivery to respondents. There being no actual or constructive delivery, respondents did not acquire ownership. Furthermore, the unexplained failure of the purported vendees to register the sales for over 30 years and their failure to take possession is contrary to the usual practice of conscientious purchasers of real property. The petitioner was in possession of both the land and the title all through those years.","WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED. The July 20, 2011 Decision and May 8, 2012 Resolution of the Court of Appeals, Cagayan de Oro City in CA-G.R. CV No. 01914-MIN are hereby SET ASIDE. The November 28, 2007 Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Bayugan City, Agusan del Sur, Branch 7, in Civil Case No. 669, is hereby REINSTATED with MODIFICATION that the awards of damages and litigation costs are DELETED."
"G.R. No. 214933, February 15, 2022","REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, REPRESENTED BY THE BUREAU OF INTERNAL REVENUE, PETITIONER, VS. FIRST GAS POWER CORPORATION, RESPONDENT.","On October 24, 2002, First Gas received a Letter of Authority from the petitioner authorizing the BIR representative to examine the book of accounts and other accounting records of First Gas for all revenue taxes for the taxable years 2000 and 2001.[4] On September 30, 2003, First Gas received a Notice to Taxpayer from petitioner requesting it to appear for an informal conference on October 15, 2003.[5] Thereafter, on March 11, 2004, First Gas received Preliminary Assessment Notices (PAN) dated December 15, 2003 and January 28, 2004, wherein it was assessed for the following deficiency taxes and penalties for the taxable years 2000 and 2001: a. Deficiency Income Tax for 2000 - P84,571,959.65 b. Deficiency Income Tax for 2001 - P97,999,363.41 c. Late Payment Penalties for 2001 - P4,670,630.18.[6] On April 6, 2004, First Gas filed its Preliminary Reply to the PAN.[7] Then on September 6, 2004, it received Final Assessment Notices (FAN) and Formal Letters of Demand all dated July 19, 2004, wherein it was assessed for the following deficiency taxes and penalties for the taxable years 2000 and 2001: a. Deficiency Income Tax for 2000  P37,099,915.29 b. Deficiency Income Tax for 2001  P82,365,799.90 c. Late Payment Penalties for 2001  P4,670,630.18.[8] For the calendar year ending December 31, 2000, First Gas was assessed deficiency income tax for its unreported income on pre-income tax holiday sale of electricity to Meralco and Siemens, as well as for its alleged unreported interest income from foreign investments and dollar loan proceeds realized prior to commercial operations.[9] For the calendar year ending in December 31, 2001, First Gas was also assessed deficiency income tax for its disallowed interest expense from dollar deposits in foreign banks and its disallowed compensation expense.[10] Further, First Gas was assessed penalties for the calendar year ending December 31,2001 due to the late payment of withholding tax on interest on foreign loans and the late payment of excise tax on natural gas.[11] Meanwhile, the record shows that First Gas, represented by Nestor H. Vasay, and the BIR, represented by Celia C. King executed three (3) Waivers of the Defense of Prescription under the Statue of Limitations, the summary of which are as follows: Waiver Date of Waiver Period Extended Person Who Signed the Waiver First[12] April 12, 2004 June 15, 2004 Celia C. King Second[13] June 14, 2004 August 15, 2004 Celia C. King Third[14] August 13, 2004 October 15, 2004 Celia C. King On October 5, 2004, First Gas filed a Letter of Protest before respondent which was not acted upon.[15] Thus, on June 30, 2005, it filed a Petition for Review before the CTA to assail the FAN and Formal Letters of Demand, all dated July 19, 2004.[16] In a Decision[17] dated September 24, 2012, the CTA Third Division granted the petition of First Gas... The BIR moved for the reconsideration... which was denied... This prompted the BIR to file a Petition for Review with the CTA En Banc. Then, in a Decision[20] dated May 12, 2014, the CTA En Banc denied the petition, disposing as follows: WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Petition for Review is hereby DISMISSED for lack of merit. The Decision and Resolution of the Third Division of this Court in CTA Case No. 7281 dated September 24, 2012 and December 13, 2012, respectively, are hereby AFFIRMED. No pronouncement as to costs.","In sum, the CTA did not err in cancelling the FAN and the Formal Letters of Demand, all dated July 19, 2004. They are all invalid assessments because the period of petitioner to issue the same for taxable year 2000 has already prescribed, and the assessments for taxable year 2001 did not contain a definite due date for payment by respondent.","The Court agrees with the CTA that the Waivers were defective; thus, petitioner's period to issue the FAN and the Formal Letter of Demand for taxable year 2000 has already prescribed. The Court agrees with the CTA that the Waivers are defective because the date of acceptance by petitioner is not indicated therein. ... the failure to indicate the date of acceptance by petitioner in the First Waiver means that the same is defective, and therefore, the original three-year prescriptive period to assess the deficiency income tax of respondent for the taxable year 2000 was never extended. Consequently, the two (2) subsequent waivers were also invalid because the original period was not extended and had already lapsed on April 16, 2004, and there was no period to extend anymore. ... As regards the validity of the FAN and the Formal Letter of Demand for taxable year 2001, this Court also agrees with the ruling of the CTA that the same were not valid because they failed to indicate a definite due date for payment. ... the due date in each of the FAN was left blank. Clearly, the FAN did not contain a definite due date and actual demand to pay. Accordingly, the FAN and the Formal Letter of Demand for taxable year 2001 are not valid assessments.","WHEREFORE, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED. The assailed Decision of the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc dated May 12, 2014 in CTA EB No. 972 is AFFIRMED. Accordingly, the following are hereby CANCELLED and WITHDRAWN: Final Assessment Notice and Formal Letter of Demand for deficiency income tax for Calendar Year ended December 31, 2000 in the total amount of P37,099,915.29 inclusive of surcharge, interest and compromise penalties; Final Assessment Notice and Formal Letter of Demand for deficiency income tax for Calendar Year ended December 31, 2001 in the total amount of P82,365,799.90 inclusive of surcharge, interest and compromise penalties; and Final Assessment Notice and Formal Letter of Demand for penalties assessment for Calendar Year ended December 31, 2001 in the total amount of P4,670,630.18 inclusive of surcharge, interest and compromise penalties.

"G.R. No. 244374, February 15, 2022","PUREGOLD PRICE CLUB, INC., PETITIONER, VS. COURT OF APPEALS AND RENATO M. CRUZ, JR., RESPONDENTS.","On January 16, 2013, Puregold Price Club, Inc. (PPCI) hired Renato M. Cruz, Jr. (Renato) as a probationary store head. On July 16, 2013, PPCI appointed Renato as store officer/manager at Puregold Extra Ampid (Puregold Extra) in San Mateo, Rizal. Renato's tasks include the activation of the Intruder Alarm System (IAS) located in the treasury office of the branch before store closure and its deactivation upon store opening. On March 16, 2015 at 1:23 a.m., the IAS sounded an intruder alarm and sent messages to Renato and two other officers but none of them arrived. At 2:35 a.m., the alarm sounded for the second time and message alerts were sent, and again, no one answered. At around 5:13 a.m., Renato arrived, inspected the store, deactivated the alarm, and took four (4) plastic pails in stock for his personal use, explaining he merely borrowed them due to a scheduled water interruption. On June 16, 2015, PPCI served Renato a notice of termination for gross and serious omission to do vital management duty and responsibility, serious and willful breach of trust, abuse of position, and stealing. Renato filed a request for assistance under the Single Entry Approach (SEnA) Program, and subsequently filed a complaint for illegal dismissal before the Labor Arbiter (LA). The LA rendered a decision on May 31, 2016 based solely on Renato's position paper, holding Renato was illegally dismissed and ordering PPCI to pay back wages and separation pay. PPCI moved to annul the LA's decision on July 18, 2016, claiming lack of jurisdiction due to improper service of summons. The LA noted the motions without action, directing PPCI to appeal to the NLRC. PPCI filed a petition to annul the LA's Decision and Order before the NLRC. On September 8, 2016, the Fourth Division of the NLRC remanded the case for further proceedings for failure of the LA to acquire jurisdiction over PPCI due to improper service of summons. The NLRC denied Renato's reconsideration on October 28, 2016. On March 13, 2017, Renato elevated the case through a petition for certiorari before the Court of Appeals (CA) docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 149917. Renato insisted that he received the NLRC Resolution denying his motion for reconsideration on January 12, 2017, making his petition timely. On February 13, 2019, PPCI received the CA's Resolution denying the motion for reconsideration and has fifteen (15) days or until February 28, 2019 to file a petition for review. On February 19, 2019, PPCI moved for an additional period of thirty (30) days from February 28, 2019 or until March 30, 2019 within which to file a petition for review. Also, PPCI paid the docket and other lawful fees and the deposit for costs. On March 15, 2019, however, PCCI filed a petition for certiorari.","On August 24, 2018, the CA held that there was substantial compliance with the rules on service of summons and that PPCI failed to establish any fraud, which supposedly prevented it from appearing before the LA proceedings. The CA also ratiocinated that PPCI owned and operated Puregold Extra. Relatively, it would be absurd for Puregold Extra not to inform PPCI about Renato's complaint for illegal dismissal. Lastly, the CA ruled that PPCI cannot us technicalities to escape the negative consequences of an adverse decision, viz.: WHEREFORE, the foregoing considered, the instant Petition for Certiorari is GRANTED. The Resolutions dated 08 September 2016 and 28 October 2016 of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) in LER Case No. 08-216-16 (NLRC NCR Case No. 04-04239-16) are ANNULLED and SET ASIDE. Accordingly, We declare that the Decision dated 31 May 2016 of the Labor Arbiter in NLRC NCR Case No. 04-04239-16 had already become FINAL and EXECUTORY. SO ORDERED. On September 6, 2018, PPCI moved for reconsideration. On January 29, 2019, the CA denied PPCI's motion.","Anent the merits of the case, the Court agrees with PPCI's argument that the CA erred in giving due course to Renato's petition for certiorari for being filed out of time. As the Rule now stands, petitions for certiorari must be filed strictly within sixty (60) days from notice of judgment or from the order denying a motion for reconsideration. Contrary to Renato's theory, the reglementary period to avail the remedy of certiorari must be reckoned on December 29, 2016 or the date his counsel received the NLRC Resolution denying the motion for reconsideration, and not on January 12, 2017 when he allegedly received the assailed resolution. Renato had sixty (60) days counted from the date his counsel received on December 29, 2016 the NLRC Resolution denying the motion for reconsideration or until February 27, 2017 within which to avail a petition for certiorari. Renato filed his petition for certiorari before the CA only on March 13, 2017 or fourteen (14) days beyond the reglementary period. Notably, Renato neither moved for an extension of time nor presented any exceptional or meritorious circumstance to exempt him from the strict application of the 60-day period rule. All told, the CA should have dismissed outright Renato's petition for certiorari for being time-barred. The CA should not have delved into the issues concerning the propriety of the NLRC Resolutions dated September 8, 2016 and October 28, 2016 which remanded the case to the LA for further proceedings. Suffice it to say that these resolutions perfunctorily become final and executory absent a timely petition for certiorari. Otherwise, there will be no end to litigation, and this will set to naught the main role of courts of justice to assist in the enforcement of the rule of law and the maintenance of peace and order by settling justiciable controversies with finality.","FOR THESE REASONS, the petition is GRANTED. The Court of Appeals' Decision dated August 24, 2018 in CA-G.R. SP No. 149917 is REVERSED.

By June 22, 1993, when the complaint for recovery of Lot 1087 was filed with the RTC, the ultimate and all-encompassing prescriptive period of 31 years had already lapsed. It no longer matters whatever respondents' cause of action was - contract or constructive trust arising from a mistake or even fraud. The super prescriptive period has set in. ... the failure to observe the proper form prescribed by Article 1358 does not render the acts or contracts invalid. ... the Contrata must be upheld in toto to affirm the validity of petitioners' ownership including of course possession of the whole of Lot 1087.","ACCORDINGLY, the petition is GRANTED and the Decision dated February 29, 2016 and Resolution dated December 20, 2016 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

"A.M. No. 18-07-142-RTC, February 15, 2022","RE: REPORTS ON THE ERAFFLE PROCEDURE IN THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, MANILA","The instant administrative matter has its origin from reports regarding delays in the conduct of electronic raffle (eRaffle) and the distribution of cases in the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila.

The Antecedents

In 2013, the Court launched an automated case management information system called the eCourt for trial courts.
[1]
The eCourt is a computer-based system used to organize and control case workflow from filing to implementation. It is used to capture basic case information as they are filed, and it ensures that basic case data is entered only once to avoid the repetition of administrative processes. Simply put, the assigning or docketing and raffling of cases to judges are all done electronically through the eCourt system.
[2]
The eCourt system was first piloted in the RTC and Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC) of Quezon City where the caseloads are among the highest in the country.
[3]
Hence, there is now a shift in these eCourts from the manual raffle, which was done using a roulette or bingo
tambiolo
, as provided under A.M. No. 03-8-02-SC,
[4]
or the Guidelines on the Selection and Designation of Executive Judges and Defining their Powers, Prerogatives and Duties, to the eRaffle of cases using the eCourt software. Under the system, the docketing of cases shall be done immediately and the raffle thereof to the different eCourt branches shall be in real-time.
[5]
In 2016, an additional of 120 eCourts were set up in the cities of Manila, Pasig, and Mandaluyong. Consequently, the judges and court personnel of the RTC Manila underwent eCourt training from June 19, 2017 to July 7, 2017. On July 3, 2017, or before their training officially concluded, the Office of the Clerk of Court (OCC) of the RTC Manila started encoding cases using the eCourt system with the assistance of the American Bar Association Rule of Law Initiative (ABA ROLI) trainers and/or representatives as well as the Court's personnel from the Management Information Systems Office.
[6]
Subsequently, the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) received reports of persistent delays in the conduct of eRaffle and distribution of cases in the RTC Manila.
[7]
Thus, the OCA sent an Audit Team to investigate the matter in January 2018. It also instructed Assistant Court Administrator Atty. Maria Regina Adoracion Filomena M. Ignacio (ACA Ignacio) to conduct a dialogue with the RTC Manila judges and officials of the OCC.
[8]
On January 10, 2018, the Audit Team went to the RTC Manila and observed the procedure undertaken by the OCC from the filing of cases and encoding of data required by the eCourt system up to the actual eraffle of cases. The Audit Team learned that the cases filed for the day were simultaneously raffled in the afternoon through a formal raffle proceeding, and it noted the delay of several days before the cases were forwarded to the branches to which they were raffled.
[9]
Thereafter, the OCA directed then RTC Manila Executive Judge Reynaldo A. Alhambra (Judge Alhambra) to do away with the simultaneous raffle of cases every afternoon and instead focus on the immediate encoding and eraffle of cases.
[10]
On May 2, 2018, the Audit Team went back to the RTC Manila to again monitor the conduct of eRaffle therein. It found a backlog of 300 cases set to be raffled, which tally even increased to 423 cases by May 25, 2018. In addition, the Audit Team found that criminal cases with motions for consolidation were first referred to judge Alhambra, as then the Executive Judge, for evaluation before raffle, and the inclusion of these cases in the eRaffle was done only after the motion for consolidation was granted or denied.
[11]
On June 28, 2018, ACA Ignacio met with Judge Alhambra and Judge Andy S. De Vera, then the Executive Judge of the MeTC Manila, and learned that the latter had zero cases pending raffle while the RTC had 29 cases still not raffled. Judge Alhambra explained that the RTC OCC was having difficulty in using the eCourt system due to the influx of drug cases filed every day, internet connectivity issues, and lack of personnel to encode case details in the system. ACA Ignacio then requested Judge Alhambra to reduce the number of cases pending raffle, to aim for a zero backlog, and to submit a status report on the conduct of eRaffle twice a day.
[12]
On July 2, 2018, ACA Ignacio held a dialogue with the following: 32 RTC Manila judges; Atty. Jennifer H. Dela Cruz-Buendia (Atty. Dela Cruz-Buendia), the Clerk of Court (COC); Atty. Clemente M. Clemente (now Judge Clemente), then the Assistant COC; and other OCC staff. During the meeting, some judges voiced out their complaints on the delay in the eRaffle of cases and transmittal of records which also caused a lag in the issuance of commitment orders, as well as Judge Alhambra's action on the bail applications in several criminal cases that were already raffled to their branches.
[13]
Upon the recommendation of the OCA, the Court
En Banc
issued the Resolutions dated July 17, 2018
[14]
and July 24, 2018
[15]
as follows:
Resolution dated July 17, 2018
(a) RELIEVE Judge Reynaldo A. Alhambra, Branch 53, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Manila, as Executive Judge; and
(b) DESIGNATE the following judges as new Executive and Vice Executive Judges of the RTC, Manila:
(i) Judge Thelma B. Medina, Branch 32, as Executive Judge;
(ii) Judge Marivic B. Umali, Branch 20, as 1
st
Vice Executive Judge;
(iii) Judge Virgilio V. Macaraig, Branch 37, as 2
nd
Vice-Executive Judge; and
(iv) Judge Jose Lorenzo R. Dela Rosa, Branch 4, as 3
rd
Vice-Executive Judge.
[16]
Resolution dated July 24, 2018
(a) PREVENTIVELY SUSPEND Atty. Jennifer H. Dela Cruz Buendia, Clerk of Court, and Atty. Clemente M. Clemente, Assistant Clerk of Court, both of the Office of the Clerk of Court (OCC), Regional Trial Court, Manila, for ninety (90) days pending the completion of a more comprehensive investigation;
(b) DESIGNATE Atty. Marilou M. Anigan, Judicial Supervisor, OCA, as Officer-in-Charge of the OCC, RTC, Manila; and
(c) DESIGNATE Atty. Abegail P. Layson, Branch Clerk of Court, Branch 32, as Acting Assistant Clerk of Court of the OCC, RTC, Manila.
[17]
Pending investigation, Judge Clemente was appointed Presiding Judge of Branch 127, MeTC, Makati City.
[18]
Pursuant to the Court's directive to investigate the delay in the eRaffle of cases, the OCA sent an Audit Team to conduct a spot audit of randomly-selected courts focusing on cases filed from January to July 2018, which included the RTC Manila.
[19]
The Report on the Results of the Spot Audit

The Audit Team reported that the audited RTC Manila branches took an average of 4.95 days before commitment orders were issued, but this could not be considered as a delay because courts are given 10 days within which to determine probable cause and issue commitment orders for the transfer of the accused to a jail facility.
[20]
It also found that it took an average of 5.76 days for the OCC to eraffle the cases, which is contrary to the objective of real-time raffling of cases under the eCourt system.
[21]
The Audit Team then observed that upon the assumption of office of Judge Thelma B. Medina (Judge Medina) as the new Executive Judge, Atty. Marilou M. Anigan (Atty. Anigan) as the Officer-in-Charge, and Atty. Abegail P. Layson (Atty. Layson) as the Acting Assistant COC, the eRaffle and distribution of cases to the RTC Manila branches in real
-time were achieved within the following month.
[22]
With respect to the procedure on the applications for bail and corporate surety bonds in the OCC, the Audit Team found that Judge Alhambra had issued several memoranda on the submission of reports on surety companies with outstanding obligations. It likewise noted that Atty. Dela Cruz-Buendia submitted to the Docket and Clearance Division, Legal Office, OCA, monthly reports from March to June 2018, which were based on orders directing the forfeiture of bonds and writ of execution issued by the Presiding Judge and the Branch Clerk of Court of the concerned branches. The Audit Team also learned that some branches referred the order of forfeiture of bonds to the OCC while the others executed their own orders through their sheriffs. It thus concluded that there was no uniform procedure in the implementation of the orders of forfeiture of bonds and writs of execution in the RTC Manila.
[23]
Lastly, the Audit Team discovered that Judge Alhambra indeed approved bail bond applications in some criminal cases which were already raffled to other branches.
[24]
In the Resolution
[25]
dated November 13, 2018, the Court, acting upon the recommendations of the OCA, resolved to:
(a) DIRECT Judge Reynaldo A. Alhambra, Branch 53, RTC, Manila, to EXPLAIN, within ten (10) days from notice hereof, why he acted on bail applications in the following cases that were already assigned to other branches during the time that he was the Executive Judge:
(i) Criminal Case Nos. R-MNL-17-03158; 18-01506, 18-03117; and 18-00248, already raffled to Branch 13;
(ii) Criminal Case Nos. R-MNL-18-05110-CR; 18-05118-CR; 18-05017-CR; and 18-05580-CR, already raffled to Branch 18; and
(iii) Criminal Case Nos. R-MNL-18-00396; 18-00487; 18-00393; 18-06043; and 18-00394, already raffled to Branch 31;
(b) DIRECT Judge Reynaldo Alhambra, Atty. [Jennifer H.] Dela Cruz-Buendia, and Judge Clemente M. Clemente, in his capacity as then Assistant Clerk of Court, Office of the Clerk of Court, RTC, Manila, to EXPLAIN, within ten (10) days from notice hereof, why they failed to address the problem of delay in the eRaffle of cases in the RTC, Manila, from the time of its launch in July 2017 until July 30, 2018;
(c) DIRECT Judge Clemente and Atty. Dela Cruz-Buendia to EXPLAIN, within ten (10) days from notice, why they failed to set up a uniform system in the execution of Order of Forfeiture of Bonds and in giving of clearance to bonding companies[.]
[26]
Comment of Judge Alhambra

Judge Alhambra asserted that he was not remiss in overseeing the functions of the OCC under Atty. Dela Cruz-Buendia. He countered that he had devised ways to address the problem of delay in the eRaffle of cases, such as: (1) assigning more OCC personnel to assist in the encoding of case data before their raffle; (2) the use of USB
[27]
flash drives to store the encoded data, which were later transferred to the computers set up for the purpose of the eCourt system; (3) requiring Atty. Dela Cruz-Buendia to submit a weekly update on the implementation of the eRaffle of cases; and (4) reminding the various RTC branches to back-encode the cases in their dockets.
[28]
Further, Judge Alhambra intimated that notwithstanding the new setup, there was still a delay in the eRaffle of cases due to: (a) the limited number of existing eCourt ports; (b) the lack of expertise of some personnel; (c) the slow internet connection, especially when all the RTC branches were simultaneously utilizing the system for the back-encoding of their old cases not yet included in the eRaffle; (d) the work suspensions due to unforeseen events and holidays; (e) the voluminous number of drug cases filed; and (f) the eRaffle system itself, which disallowed the consolidation of more than 15 cases thereby causing an additional delay on how to raffle the cases exceeding the limit.
[29]
With respect to his action on the bail applications in some criminal cases, Judge Alhambra argued that as the Executive Judge, he was authorized to resolve motions to post bail if the criminal case had yet to be raffled to a particular branch pursuant to the Manual for Executive Judges.
[30]
Thus, he explained that he only acted on the subject criminal cases, which were not yet raffled at the time, as he needed to act expeditiously on motions submitted for his action so that the public would have a positive impression that the RTC Manila delays no man for money or malice.
[31]
Comment of Atty. Dela Cruz-Buendia

Meanwhile, Atty. Dela Cruz-Buendia alleged, among others, that during the first few months of the implementation of the eCourt system, the eRaffle was only conducted once a day, usually between 2:30 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. She pointed out that the ABA ROLI trainers were present in many instances when the eRaffle of cases was conducted, but they never called the attention of the OCC regarding the procedure it adopted.
[32]
She also asserted that the eCourt system itself was not perfect as the ABA ROLI was not able to anticipate the problems that the OCC encountered in its implementation, and the ABA ROLI personnel, too, was scarcely available in the court to handle queries and to provide solutions.
[33]
Atty. Dela Cruz-Buendia insisted that the cause of delay in the eRaffle of cases are: (1) the long holidays and inclement weather; (2) the slow internet connection; (3) no control as to how many cases were filed by the Office of the City Prosecutor; (4) the sheer volume of cases filed; (5) the lack of additional ports; and (6) no assistance coming from the ABA ROLI.
[34]
As to the system regarding the execution of orders of forfeiture of bonds and the issuance of bail bonds and clearances, Atty. Dela Cruz-Buendia explained as follows:
First
, the writs of execution against the bonds issued by the RTC branches were, in most cases, implemented by the branch sheriff, who reported directly to the court where the writ was issued; and that the OCC was not furnished or notified of these issuances, or of the action taken by the branch sheriff. In fact, there were branches that had their own list of blacklisted bonding companies only known to them. Thus, she can only report on the pending liability of surety companies if the OCC is furnished with a copy of the writs of execution issued against them;
[35]
and
Second
, there is no occasion that a surety company will be issued clearance if there is a pending liability appearing on the OCC files. However, it has been observed that several surety companies have been allowed accreditation by the OCA even before a clearance is issued by the OCC. Hence, when the list of the accredited bonding companies was issued and their office furnished copies by the OCA, such list became its guide as to which bonding companies are of good standing.
[36]
Comment of Judge Clemente

For his part, Judge Clemente admitted that there was indeed a delay in the eRaffle of cases on multiple occasions,
[37]
but he asserted that such delay was due to extraneous factors
[38]
including: (a) the unfamiliarity of court personnel to the new eCourt system and how to use and troubleshoot it; (b) the insufficient work stations and slow internet connection that affected the encoding process; (c) the multiple times when the eCourt system slowed down or completely shut down because of the simultaneous use thereof by the OCC and the other RTC branches for the back-encoding of previous cases; and (d) the work suspensions due to natural conditions or holidays.
[39]
Judge Clemente maintained that he and the OCC tried their best to find solutions to the problems in the implementation of the eCourt system. Nevertheless, he extended his apologies if any of his actions directly contributed to the delays in the eRaffle of cases in the RTC Manila.
[40]
The OCA’s Report and Recommendation

At the outset, the OCA noted that Judge Alhambra, Atty. Dela Cruz-Buendia, and Judge Clemente (collectively, respondents), who all had a direct part in the raffle of cases, failed not only to comply with the mandate to fully implement the eCourt system
[41]
but also to address the serious delay in the eRaffle of cases in the RTC Manila.
[42]
The OCA pointed to the backlog of 520 cases pending raffle for the month of July 2018, which then steadily declined upon the assumption of office of Atty. Anigan and Atty. Layson as the Officer-in-Charge and the Acting Assistant COC, respectively, until the OCC achieved the real-time eRaffle of cases about a month later.
[43]
The OCA considered respondents' repeated failure to implement a real-time raffle of cases for a period of more than one year to be a blatant relegation of their duties and functions as administrative officers of the court.
[44]
It also observed that even the simple act of indicating the time when the document was received, which is a very basic rule in the receipt of the documents as required under Section 4 of A.M. No. 03-8-02-SC, was not followed.
[45]
Moreover, the OCA found that Judge Alhambra inappropriately acted on the bail applications in Criminal Case Nos. R-MNL-17-03158-CR, 18-03117-CR, 18-05110-CR, 18-05017-CR, 18-05580-CR, 18-00396-CR, 18-00487-CR, 18-00393-CR, 18-06043-CR, and 18-00394-CR considering that the cases had already been raffled to various branches of the RTC Manila when he took cognizance of the applications in his capacity as the Executive Judge.
[46]
In this regard, the OCA noted that Judge Alhambra, in the guise of expeditiously resolving such applications for bail, had wantonly disregarded the rules and order of preference set forth in the Manual for Executive Judges and plainly stepped into the jurisdiction of his fellow RTC judges.
[47]
As for Atty. Dela Cruz-Buendia, the OCA noted that she, too, had failed to set up a uniform system in the OCC for the execution of orders of forfeiture of bonds and in giving clearances to surety companies with pending obligations.
[48]
It pointed out that Atty. Dela Cruz-Buendia's failure to accurately report the status of surety companies resulted in prejudice not only to the court users but also to the judiciary as a whole.
[49]
Thus, the OCA deemed respondents administratively liable for their individual actions as follows:
For Judge Alhambra, the OCA found him guilty of: (a) Simple Neglect of Duty for his failure to observe the procedure in the conduct of eRaffle; and (b) Grave Misconduct for inappropriately acting on bail applications in criminal cases that had already been raffled to other branches.
[50]
In the case of Atty. Dela Cruz-Buendia, the OCA found her guilty of Gross Neglect of Duty on two counts: (a) for failing to observe the procedure for the eRaffle in the RTC Manila, which resulted in the persistent delay in the raffle of cases therein; and (b) for issuing four certifications of no pending obligation and/or liability to four surety companies found to have outstanding obligations in the RTC Manila.
[51]
Finally, as regards Judge Clemente, the OCA found him guilty of Simple Neglect of Duty for his failure to observe the procedure in the conduct of eRaffle and to address the problem of delay in the raffle of cases in the RTC Manila.
[52]
However, as then the Assistant COC, the OCA noted that his administrative liability is only secondary to his superiors given that he was under the supervision of both Judge Alhambra and Atty. Dela Cruz-Buendia at the time.
[53]
The OCA recommended the imposition of the following penalties, to wit:
IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, we respectfully recommend for the consideration of the Honorable Court that:
(1) Presiding Judge Reynaldo A. Alhambra, Branch 53, RTC, Manila, be found GUILTY of Simple Neglect of Duty and Grave Misconduct, and be meted the following penalties:
(a) FINE in the amount of Ten Thousand Pesos (Php10,000.00) for Simple Neglect of Duty; and
(b) FINE in the amount equivalent to his one (1) month salary for Grave Misconduct, with a stern warning that a repetition of the same or similar act shall be dealt with more severely; and
(2) Atty. Jennifer H. Dela Cruz-Buendia, Clerk of Court, RTC, Manila, be found GUILTY of two (2) counts of Gross Neglect of Duty and be meted [out] the penalty of DISMISSAL FROM THE SERVICE, with forfeiture of all retirement benefits except accrued leave benefits, and with prejudice to re-employment in the government, including government-owned or controlled corporations; and
(3) Presiding Judge Clemente M. Clemente, Branch 127, Metropolitan Trial Court, Makati City, in his capacity as then Assistant Clerk of Court, RTC, Manila, be found GUILTY of Simple Neglect of Duty and be meted the penalty of FINE in the amount equivalent to his one (1) month salary with a stern warning that a repetition of the same or similar act shall be dealt with more severely.
[54]","The Court's Ruling It cannot be denied that there was indeed a delay in the eRaffle of cases in the RTC Manila for the months of July 2017 to July 2018 or during its transition period from the manual raffle of cases to the implementation of the eCourt system. Nevertheless, after careful consideration, the Court does not find the actions of Judge Alhambra, Atty. Dela Cruz-Buendia, and Judge Clemente to be tantamount to neglect of duty, whether it be simple or gross in nature, as to warrant the imposition of any administrative sanction on their parts for such delay.","In the case, the Court sees no indication that the actions of respondents, in relation to the implementation of the eCourt system and the consequent delay in the eRaffle of cases, are a result of carelessness and indifference or a flagrant and palpable breach of their respective duties as the Executive Judge, the Clerk of Court, and then the Assistant Clerk of Court of the RTC Manila, respectively.
Though it is true that the delay in the eRaffle of cases in the RTC Manila was not sufficiently addressed by respondents, the Court cannot disregard outright the following solutions they devised in order to remedy the issue:
For his part, Judge Alhambra conducted personal visits to the OCC to observe how the eRaffle was being implemented and held meetings with Atty. Dela Cruz-Buendia to address the backlog of cases for raffle. To this end, some OCC personnel were pulled out of their regular duties and reassigned to assist in the encoding of data for the eRaffle of cases. Judge Alhambra also required the OCC to provide him with a weekly update on the implementation of the eRaffle of cases.
[59]
In addition, Judge Alhambra likewise visited various RTC Manila branches, met with the judges and staff therein to obtain information regarding their implementation of the eCourt system, and reminded them to back-encode the cases in their dockets.
[60]
Lastly, he directed the OCC to add encoders and to use USB flash drives to store data to be encoded in the system, in addition to desktop computers.
[61]
The directives were then implemented by Atty. Dela Cruz-Buendia and Judge Clemente in the OCC to ease the backlog of cases for eRaffle.
Similarly, the Court, too, cannot just overlook the various reasons that
contributed
to the delay in the eRaffle of cases cited by respondents, which the OCA apparently failed to take into account in determining their administrative liabilities:
a)
the limited number of computers set up for the purpose of implementing the eCourt system;
b)
the lack of expertise of court personnel in using and troubleshooting the eCourt software;
c)
the slow internet connection;
d)
the slow down or complete shut down of the eCourt system due to the simultaneous use thereof by the OCC and the other RTC branches for the back-encoding of previous cases;
e)
the work suspensions due to unforeseen events and holidays; and
f)
the voluminous number of drug cases filed in the RTC Manila.
While the reasons do not completely justify the delay in the eRaffle of cases in the RTC Manila, the fact that respondents did their best to solve the issues in the new eCourt system is enough to
exonerate
them from any administrative liability in relation thereto. After all, the eCourt system is still in its
early stages of implementation
even now, which means that the problems that the RTC Manila encountered
during
its transition period
are not only to be
expected
, but also, in a way, are
welcomed
so that solutions can be formulated early on before the system goes live in all courts nationwide. More importantly, there is no evidence presented that respondents' actions were tainted with bad faith.
In this regard, the OCA itself pointed out that persons with active participation in the raffle of cases, such as herein respondents, are tasked
to devise a new process
to achieve the objectives of the eCourt system.
[62]
This shows that as of the moment, there is
no fixed procedure
in implementing the eRaffle of cases, particularly in the method and time of raffle. In fact, the pertinent guideline for eRaffle per OCA Circular No. 57-2013 only provides that the cases shall be immediately docketed and the raffle thereof shall be done ""in real-time.""
[63]
As the OCA observed, this rendered nugatory the existing procedure for manual raffle under A.M. No. 03-8-02-SC, which, in effect, gave the eCourts, like the RTC Manila, limited discretion as to the implementation of the eRaffle of cases in their jurisdictions.
Notably, the eRaffle in the case was conducted
once
on a
daily basis
,
[64]
though it appears that the delay at the outset was largely due to the fact that 172 cases scheduled for manual raffle had to first be encoded,
[65]
coupled with the influx of new cases that needed to be raffled ""in real-time"" under the eCourt system. Viewed from this perspective, the backlog in the eRaffle of cases hardly seems unreasonable considering, among others, the lack of expertise of the RTC Manila's court personnel in using the eCourt software as well as the other hardware and technical issues that they encountered at the time.
Hence, it would be quite unfair for the Court to penalize respondents for formulating their own procedure for the eRaffle, given that they were mandated to do so in the first place.
The Court likewise cannot assign administrative liability on the part of respondents for the backlog in the eRaffle of cases simply because of the improvements in the implementation of the eCourt system upon the assumption of office of Atty. Anigan and Atty. Layson as Officer-in-Charge and Assistant Clerk of Court of the OCC, respectively.
It bears noting that the problems faced by respondents in the eRaffle of cases were
no longer novel
by the time Atty. Anigan and Atty. Layson took over. The OCC staff, too, by then, had a year of experience in using and troubleshooting the new eCourt software. In other words, the conclusion reached by the OCA that Atty. Anigan and Atty. Layson would have done a better job than respondents is
purely speculative
at this point. The peculiar situation of the RTC Manila during its transition period from the manual raffle to the eCourt system clearly played a huge role in how the eRaffle of cases therein turned out to be under respondents' leadership.
In finding respondents administratively liable, the OCA cited as a judicial precedent the case of
Ferrer, Jr. v. Judge Dating
[66]
(
Ferrer, Jr
.) wherein the respondent judge was found guilty of Simple Neglect of Duty for his failure to adhere to the provisions of A.M. No. 03-8-02-SC, specifically on the conduct of raffle of cases.
The circumstances in
Ferrer, Jr
., however, are vastly different from those in the present case. In particular,
Ferrer, Jr.
involved the manual raffle of cases, and the respondent judge therein undoubtedly violated A.M. No. 03-8-02-SC since
he purposely delayed the raffle of cases
for unjustifiable reasons,
i.e
., there was supposedly no urgency to conduct a raffle and the number of cases was not sufficient for a raffle – meaning, there was
no raffle conducted at all
, in blatant violation of the
required procedure
under Section 2, Chapter V of A.M. No. 03-8-02-SC. Here, the delay in the eRaffle of cases was clearly
unintentional and without bad faith
on the part of respondents and, as earlier mentioned, they did try to solve the issues they faced in order to better implement the eCourt system.
In view of the foregoing reasons, the Court exonerates respondents from any administrative liability for the delay in the eRaffle of cases in the RTC Manila during its first year of implementation of the eCourt system, or in the months of July 2017 to July 2018.
It is also for the above-mentioned reasons that the Court
cannot
hold Judge Alhambra accountable for acting on the bail applications in several criminal cases in the RTC Manila in his capacity as the Executive Judge.
A review of the records clearly shows that Judge Alhambra only acted upon those bail applications in criminal cases
which had yet to be raffled
. In other words, he acted on these matters
as a necessary consequence of the delay in the eRaffle of cases
in the RTC Manila. Though it is true that in some instances, Judge Alhambra appears to have acted on bail applications on the same day that the criminal cases were eraffled, he sufficiently explained that he resolved those motions before the cases were actually raffled to a particular branch.
Under the circumstances, Judge Alhambra cannot be deemed to have acted inappropriately when he resolved the bail applications in criminal cases that were still pending eraffle in the OCC. After all, Executive Judges are given the power to grant bail when the application is filed
before
the criminal case is raffled, or in this case, eraffled, to a particular branch.
[67]
In this regard, the OCA justified its recommendation to find Judge Alhambra guilty of Grave Misconduct for acting on these bail applications as follows:
x x x As such, for all intents and purposes, once filed with the OCC, it is presumed that the case details were encoded and case numbers were generated.
Therefore, for all intents and purposes under the eRaffle, the said cases were already considered raffled to a particular branch
. Clearly, Judge Alhambra, as Executive Judge, should have realized the impropriety of taking cognizance of those bail applications. For this, we construe his acts as deliberate violations of the rules on bail.
[68]
(Italics supplied)
The Court strongly disagrees. To be sure, an Executive Judge in any multi-branch eCourt should
not
be prevented from acting on a pending bail application under the
mere presumption
that the criminal case should have already been encoded and eraffled in real-time to a particular branch that can resolve the motion. To hold otherwise would result in an absurd situation where a bail application cannot be acted upon because the criminal case was ""considered"" to have already been assigned to a branch, when, in reality, it was still actually pending eraffle with the OCC.
Besides, to be held administratively liable for Grave Misconduct, it must be sufficiently shown that there was an
intentional
wrong doing or
deliberate
violation of a rule of law or standard of behavior involving any of the additional elements of corruption, willful intent to violate the law, and/or a flagrant disregard of an established rule.
[69]
To reiterate, Judge Alhambra only acted on bail applications in criminal cases that were still pending raffle, which means that he neither disregarded the rules and order of preference on who must resolve motions for bail nor overstepped into the jurisdiction of his fellow RTC judges. Simply put, Judge Alhambra acted within the bounds of his authority as the Executive Judge under the Manual of Executive Judges on the guidelines concerning bail.
As earlier explained in detail, the delay in the eRaffle of cases in the RTC Manila is not a result of respondents' neglect of duty. In the same way, the Court cannot penalize Judge Alhambra for exercising his authority to expeditiously act on bail applications in criminal cases whose eRaffle had been unintentionally delayed.
The Court now discusses the alleged irregularities in the processing of bailbonds, forfeiture of bonds, and issuances of clearances to bonding companies in the RTC Manila.
Section E(1) paragraph 1.3.5 (j.2) of The 2002 Revised Manual for Clerks of Court
[70]
provides the reportorial requirements for judgments of forfeiture and writs of execution on bail and/or judicial bonds as well as for bonding companies with outstanding obligations,
viz
.:
All Branch Clerks of Court shall furnish the Clerk of Court a copy of all judgments of forfeiture and writs of execution, including subsequent orders/proceedings relative thereto. The Clerk of Court shall keep a separate file of such orders for his ready reference.
The Clerk of Court shall submit to the Office of the Court Administrator a quarterly report of all bonding companies with outstanding obligations, the amount executed together with the judgment of forfeiture and writ of execution, and subsequent motions/orders relative thereto.
In addition, Item IV of A.M. No. 04-7-02-SC,
[71]
or the Proposed Guidelines on Corporate Surety Bonds, also mandates Clerks of Court to submit to the Docket and Clearance Division of the OCA a
monthly
report on surety companies with outstanding obligations,
viz
.:
The Clerks of Courts of all concerned courts shall submit to the Docket and Clearance Division, Legal Office, OCA, a monthly report on surety companies with outstanding obligations on or before the 10th day of the succeeding month (SB Form No. 06-2004, Annex ""B""). The report shall specify the name of the surety company, the amount of bond, bond number, the case, number, case title, name of the accused or party in a case, date of order of forfeiture and status or action taken thereon, attaching in support thereto, the following:
1. Judgment of forfeiture with the corresponding writ of execution;
2. Subsequent motions/orders relative thereto; and
3. Sheriff's Return.
Thus, as a matter of procedure, the reports on the status of surety companies begin with the Branch Clerks of Court, who are tasked to furnish the Clerk of Court with copies of judgments of forfeiture and writs of execution on surety bonds. Thereafter, the Clerk of Court must, in turn, submit two reports to the OCA which are: (1) a
monthly report
on surety companies with outstanding obligations on or before the 10
th
day of the succeeding month pursuant to the Guidelines on Corporate Surety Bonds; and (2) a
quarterly report
of all bonding companies with outstanding obligations in accordance with The 2002 Revised Manual for Clerks of Court.
The importance of these reports cannot be understated as they later become the bases for the OCA's action on applications for accreditation filed by surety companies pursuant to Item II(A)(A.8)
[72]
of the Guidelines on Corporate Surety Bonds.
In the case, the records show that Atty. Dela Cruz-Buendia issued certifications that the following surety companies had no pending obligation and/or liability for the period February 1, 2018 to July 31, 2018: (a) Travellers Insurance Surety Corporation; (b) Commonwealth Insurance Company; (c) Milestone Guaranty and Assurance Corp.; and (d) Alpha Insurance & Surety Co., Inc. However, as the OCA observed, the four surety companies had, in fact, been issued judgments of forfeiture and writs of execution during the same period per the sworn reports of the RTC Manila's Branch Clerks of Court.
[73]
In her defense, Atty. Dela Cruz-Buendia explained that the OCC is guided by the list issued by the Supreme Court as to which bonding companies are in good standing.
[74]
The Court, however, finds this excuse unacceptable. After all, as the Clerk of Court, it is Atty. Dela Cruz-Buendia's duty to report to the OCA which surety companies had outstanding obligations with the RTC Manila branches. This presupposes that she had competent knowledge of the surety companies transacting in the RTC Manila that are in good standing. Thus, she
cannot
evade accountability for issuing the above-mentioned certifications to surety companies with pending obligations, which effectively enabled the latter to continue transacting with the RTC Manila, when their respective certifications of accreditation and authority should have been suspended or cancelled instead.
Based on these considerations, there is no question that Atty. Dela Cruz-Buendia had failed in her duty to
accurately
report the standing of surety companies in the RTC Manila. Even so, this failure appears to be a product of
mere inadvertence
and is
not
willful and intentional on her part. Thus, the Court finds Atty. Dela Cruz-Buendia guilty of Simple Neglect of Duty as her apparent carelessness or indifference in discharging her duty resulted in the issuance of certifications of no pending obligation and/or liability to
delinquent
surety companies.
[75]
Notably, Atty. Dela Cruz-Buendia has previously been held administratively liable for Simple Neglect of Duly or Simple Negligence on two separate occasions: the
first
was in the 2006 case of
Sy v. Esponilla
,
[76]
wherein she was meted out with the penalty of a fine of P1,000.00 for having failed to verify the authenticity and origin of a court order pertaining to the withdrawal of deposits; and the
second
was in the 2010 case of
Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas v. Lanzanas
[77]
in which the Court suspended her for a period of three months for having failed to check the veracity of the documents presented to her in relation to the release of funds. In both cases, Atty. Dela Cruz-Buendia was sternly warned that a repetition of the same or similar infraction shall be dealt with more severely.
Under Section 50(D), Rule 10 of the 2017 Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service,
[78]
Simple Neglect of Duty is classified as a
less grave offense
that is punishable by suspension from office for a period of one (1) month and one (1) day to six (6) months for the
first offense
and dismissal from the service on the
second offense
.
As the law dictates, the penalty of dismissal from the service is imposed when the administrative offense of Simple Neglect of Duty is committed more than once. However, despite Atty. Dela Cruz-Buendia's previous violations, significant factors attending the case call for the Court to reduce the penalty to be imposed.
In several administrative cases,
[79]
the Court has refrained from imposing the actual penalties after considering certain mitigating factors, including, among others, respondent's length of service, acknowledgment of infractions and feeling of remorse, family circumstances, humanitarian and equitable considerations, and advanced age.
[80]
In the present case, the Court similarly takes into consideration the following mitigating factors: (1) Atty. Dela Cruz-Buendia's 34 years of service in the government; (2) her advanced age of 60 years old; (3) the absence of any indication of malice or some ulterior motive behind her actions; and (4) humanitarian considerations in relation to the adverse economic effects of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 to the country. ""Indeed, while the Court is duty-bound to sternly wield a corrective hand to discipline errant employees and weed out those who are undesirable, it also has the discretion to temper the harshness of its judgment with mercy.""
[81]
Thus, in view of the aforementioned significant mitigating factors, the Court resolves to impose the penalty of
reprimand
with a
stern warning
that a repetition of the same or similar act will be dealt with more severely.","WHEREFORE
, the Court finds Atty. Jennifer H. Dela Cruz-Buendia, Clerk of Court, Regional Trial Court, Manila,
GUILTY
of Simple Neglect of Duty for issuing certifications of no pending obligation and/or liability to delinquent surety companies. She is hereby
REPRIMANDED
with a
STERN WARNING
that a repetition of the same or similar act will be dealt with more severely.

CHARLIE MITICH AND JAMES L. KENNEDY, TRUSTEE OF THE BANKRUPTCY ESTATE OF CHARLES B. MITICH a.k.a. CHARLIE MITICH, RESPONDENTS.","On April 7, 1998, Mitich, et al. filed before the Regional Trial Court – Manila a civil case for recognition and enforcement of foreign judgment against Mercantile docketed Civil Case No. 98-88259 and entitled Bankruptcy Estate of Charles B. Mitich a.k.a. Charlie Mitich and James L. Kennedy, Trustee of the Bankruptcy Estate of Charles B. Mitich a.k.a. Charlie Mitich v. Mercantile Insurance Company, Inc. It got raffled to Branch 10. Mitich, et al. essentially alleged: Charles B. Mitich (Mitich) was the owner and operator of a teen club in San Diego, California, United States of America (USA) called Club Tronix. On March 30, 1991, a gunfight erupted in the parking lot of Club Tronix which claimed the life of a patron – a young man named Theodros Zewdalem (Zewdalem). On March 13, 1992, the estate and heirs of Zewdalem filed a wrongful death action before the San Diego Superior Court against Mitich, doing business as Club Tronix. At that time, Mitich and Club Tronix had a comprehensive general liability insurance policy issued by Mercantile. Mitich thus made a tender of defense to Mercantile which, in turn, hired US attorney Jay Kopelowitz (Kopelowitz) to represent him. Mercantile's broker paid Kopelowitz's legal fees, but only until July 1992. Hence, Mitich proceeded with the trial before the San Diego Superior Court sans Mercantile's assistance. On May 28, 1993, the San Diego Superior Court ruled in favor of the Zewdalems and awarded USD$285,500.00 in their favor. On February 18, 1994, both Mitich, et al. and the Zewdalems filed a Complaint before the Superior Court of the State of California, USA (California Court) against Mercantile for insurance bad faith. By Default Judgment dated July 21, 1994, the California Court ruled in favor of Mitich and awarded $1,135,929.14 in his favor. The judgment was personally served on Mercantile on October 13, 1994, but Mercantile did not file an appeal. Mercantile filed a motion to dismiss the Philippine case, arguing the Default Judgment was void due to invalid extraterritorial service of summons and defective certifications against forum shopping. The RTC denied the motion and subsequently declared Mercantile in default for failure to file an answer. Mercantile repeatedly questioned these rulings up to the Supreme Court, but the default order was ultimately affirmed via G.R. No. 185564. Meanwhile, Mitich, et al. presented evidence ex parte in Civil Case No. 98-88259.","By Decision dated July 25, 2014, trial court ruled in favor of Mitich, et al., thus: WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered enforcing the foreign judgment against the defendant and ordering the defendant to pay to the plaintiff the sum of U.S. $1,135,929.14 or its equivalent in Philippine Peso, amounting to Php42,710,935.66 with interest at ten percent (10%) per annum from the date of entry of judgment by the California Court on July 22, 1994, together with interest until fully paid and ordering the defendant to pay plaintiff the amount of Php200,000.00 as and for attorney's fees, expenses of litigation and costs of suit. On appeal, Mercantile faulted the trial court for ruling that the Default Judgment dated July 21, 1994 was valid and regular considering that the California Court allegedly did not acquire jurisdiction over its person. More, the trial court seriously erred in effecting a change of date of the Default Judgment from July 21, 1992 to July 21, 1994. Finally, there was no basis for the award of legal interest, attorney's fees, and costs of suit. By Decision dated November 27, 2017 in CA-G.R. CV No. 104238, the Court of Appeals affirmed in the main but deleted the award of interest and attorney's fees.","The courts below did not err in ordering the enforcement of the Default Judgment rendered by the California Court. Mitich, et al. complied with Sections 24 and 25, Rule 132 of the Rules of Evidence, proving the existence and authenticity of the Default Judgement. The handwritten year ""1992"" was a mere clerical error. The California Court validly acquired jurisdiction over Mercantile, as valid services of summons were made on three (3) occasions in accordance with the California Code of Civil Procedure. We simply see no cogent reason to depart from our ruling in Mercantile Insurance Co., Inc. v. Yi. Mitich, et al. are not entitled to post-judgment interest. The Default judgment does not contain the rate and manner by which the monetary award would earn interest. We cannot substitute the discretion which should have been exercised by the California Court with our own. We find the award of ten percent (10%) legal interest per annum iniquitous and unconscionable considering that the California Court already awarded moral damages (i.e., emotional distress) of $250,000.00 and punitive damages of $500,000.00. Post-judgment interests were never meant to drive a litigant to the ground. Mitich, et al. are entitled to attorney's fees. Article 2208 of the Civil Code provides that attorney's fees may be recovered when the defendant's act or omission has compelled the plaintiff to incur expenses to protect his interest.","ACCORDINGLY, the Decision dated November 27, 2017 and Resolution dated March 12, 2018 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 104238 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. MERCANTILE INSURANCE COMPANY, INC. is also REQUIRED to pay the ESTATE OF CHARLES B. MITICH a.k.a. CHARLIE MITICH and JAMES L. KENNEDY, TRUSTEE OF THE BANKRUPTCY ESTATE OF CHARLES B. MITICH a.k.a. CHARLIE MITICH P500,000.00 as temperate damages and P200,000.00 as attorney's fees. This amount shall earn six percent (6%) legal interest per annum from finality of this Decision until fully paid."

JOHN FRANCOIS OJEDA, RESPONDENTS.","On November 10, 2015, Paolo Anthony De Jesus (petitioner) filed a Complaint ""For Damages under Articles 1170 and 1173 of the New Civil Code of the Philippines"" against Dr. Romeo F. Uyloan (Dr. Uyloan), Dr. John Francois Ojeda (Dr. Ojeda) and the Asian Hospital and Medical Center (AHMC). On September 13, 2010, petitioner underwent an abdomino-pelvic sonogram. Dr. Uyloan diagnosed petitioner with Cholelithiasis, a condition where there is a presence of stones in the gall bladder. Dr. Uyloan advised petitioner to undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy to remove the gallstones. The operation was done on September 15, 2010, with Dr. Uyloan as attending physician and principal surgeon, and Dr. Ojeda as assisting surgeon. Petitioner alleged that instead of the expected laparoscopic procedure, the doctors performed an open cholecystectomy without his approval or consent. During the operation, he lost a lot of blood. Upon discharge, he experienced vomiting and unbearable pain, and continuous bile leak in his colostomy bag. Subsequent tests revealed that the common bile duct, instead of the cystic duct, was cut and clipped, causing bile leakage, necessitating another operation on November 19, 2010, to rectify the first operation. For the alleged negligent acts, petitioner sought damages based on the doctors' breach of their professional duties under their ""medical contract."" Dr. Uyloan, AHMC, and Dr. Ojeda moved to dismiss the case based on prescription, arguing that the action was based on quasi-delict (Art. 1146), which had a four-year prescriptive period, and had already lapsed since the operation occurred on September 15, 2010, and the complaint was filed on November 10, 2015. The RTC denied the motions to dismiss, but the CA reversed the RTC, ordering the dismissal of the complaint on the ground of prescription.","In its assailed decision, the CA reversed the RTC and ordered the dismissal of the complaint. It held that petitioner's cause of action is indisputably based on medical negligence for which the applicable period of prescription is four years, pursuant to Art. 1146 of the Civil Code. However, the complaint was filed only on November 10, 2015, which is more than five years from the date the cause of action accrued, on September 15, 2010, when Dr. Uyloan and Dr. Ojeda performed the botched operation on his gallbladder. Hence, the trial court gravely abused its discretion in not ruling that petitioner's action was already time-barred.","The Court held that a mere reference to an implied contract between the physician and the patient in general is insufficient for pleading a cause of action under the contract theory of professional malpractice. An action for medical malpractice based on contract must allege an express promise to provide medical treatment or achieve a specific result, which was absent in the petitioner's complaint. The Court ruled that the cause of action is one for medical malpractice or medical negligence, which is a particular form of negligence falling under quasi-delict (Art. 2176 of the Civil Code). Since the cause of action accrued on September 15, 2010, the four-year prescriptive period under Art. 1146 of the Civil Code applies. The filing of the case against said physicians on November 10, 2015, is already barred by prescription. Petitioner's attempt to present a hybrid tort and contract claim arising from the negligent acts of his physicians thus fails.","WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED. The June 16, 2017 Decision and October 11, 2017 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 148192 are hereby AFFIRMED. SO ORDERED."

[4]
Antecedents In November 2010, the PCSO-LPDO granted certain monetary benefits to its personnel. Upon audit, however, the Audit Team Leader assigned to the PCSO-LPDO issued the following NDs:

Claiming inadvertence and that the disallowed benefits had supposedly been approved by the Office of the President
post facto
, PCSO sought reconsideration. COA Assistant Commissioner Elizabeth Zosa (Assistant Commissioner Zosa) granted PCSO's request and ordered the COA Regional Director to take cognizance of the appeal. The Regional Director, nevertheless, affirmed the validity of the NDs. Undaunted, petitioners filed a petition for review before the COA Proper.
[6]","On 07 April 2017, the COA Proper dismissed the petition for review for being filed out of time. Upon motion, however, the COA Proper granted reconsideration and went on to resolve the case on the merits.
[7]
In its assailed Decision, the COA Proper affirmed the disallowance. It held that Republic Act No. (RA) 1169,
[8]
or the PCSO Charter, does not give absolute authority to the PCSO Board of Directors (PCSO Board) to fix the salaries and other monetary benefits of PCSO's officials and employees. This power is always subjected to the ""pertinent civil service and compensation laws,"" and PCSO has the duty to follow these laws relating to disbursement of public funds.
[9]
It was also ruled that petitioners cannot rely on the alleged
post facto
approval given by the Office of the President through the letter dated 19 May 2011 of then Executive Secretary Paquito N. Ochoa, Jr. (Executive Secretary Ochoa). The COA Proper explained that the letter is not an omnibus approval of all past grants and should not be taken as a ratification of benefits granted in violation of compensation laws. The COA Proper also noted that the Supreme Court already held that said
post facto
approval was invalid.
[10]
Further, the COA Proper explained that petitioners did not acquire vested rights over the benefits as there were no evidence that they were part of the employees' compensation for a reasonable length of time. Nonetheless, the COA Proper ruled that the employee-recipients need not return what they received in good faith, leaving the approving/certifying officers liable for the total disallowed amount.
[11]","The Petition lacks merit. The Court accords respect and finality to the decisions of administrative authorities, like the COA, in deference to their presumed expertise in the laws they are entrusted to enforce. It is only when the COA has acted without or in excess of jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, that the Court entertains a petition questioning its rulings. Abuse of discretion is present when there is an evasion of a positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law, or to act in contemplation of law, as when the judgment rendered is not based on law and evidence but on caprice, whim, and despotism. [13]...The Board of Directors of PCSO has no unrestricted authority to fix the monetary benefits of PCSO’s employees and officials. ... The disallowed Weekly Draw Allowance, Staple Food Allowance, Cost of Living Allowance (COLA), and Medicine Allowance are already deemed integrated into the new standardized salary rate and should each require presidential approvals for their separate grant. ... The PCSO’s grant of Christmas Bonus exceeded the amount authorized by the relevant law, rules, and regulations, while the grant of Hazard Duty Pay did not meet the requirements set forth by the DBM ... The disallowance of the subject benefits did not diminish the existing benefits enjoyed by the concerned employees. ... Notwithstanding the deletion of good faith as a defense, the COA Proper’s exoneration of the payees here on the ground of good faith must be upheld. Their absolution was no longer raised as an issue here, and therefore, already attained finality. [36]...The approving and certifying officers were grossly negligent in failing to observe the clear and unequivocal provisions of laws and rules applicable to the disbursement of the disallowed benefits. ...

For this purpose, the City of Manila and Metro Laundry executed an Extension Contract of Services[6] with the same terms and conditions as in the previous contract. The controversy spawned when OMMC further retained Metro Laundry's services from April 1, 2011 to December 2011, and Metro Laundry was not compensated due to the City of Manila's lack of funds for fiscal years 2011 and 2012.[7] No written contract was executed for this extension,[8] but the OMMC issued a Certificate of Acceptance[9] and Certificate of Use[10] showing that Metro Laundry rendered actual services. Metro Laundry's efforts to collect its receivables from OMMC eventually resulted in the inclusion of its claim, amounting to P1,851,814.45, in the City of Manila's budget for 2013 under the OMMC's ""Prior Year's Obligations.""[11] The City Budget Office, Office of the City Accountant, and City Treasurer's Office issued a Certificate of Availability of Funds[12] dated July 31, 2013 for this purpose. As well, OMMC issued a Justification[13] ""to validate [its] unpaid account incurred for the laundry services rendered by [Metro Laundry] for the year 2011, amounting to x x x (P1,851,814.45)[,]”[14] and to explain that its failure to pay was due to the lack of funds for the episodic increase of housed patients,[15] which translated to more hospital linens used. Subsequently, the Office of the City Legal Officer also issued a Justification for the Payment on Quantum Meruit[16] dated December 3, 2013, affirming OMMC's outstanding obligation to Metro Laundry in the amount of P1,851,814.45. However, the obligation remained unsettled. Thus, through a 2nd Indorsement[17] dated July 24, 2014 addressed to OMMC, the Office of the City Legal Officer requested anew that the amount be included in the OMMC budget for 2015. Acting upon this request, Dr. Arsenio L. Pascual III, then OIC Hospital Director, issued a 3rd Indorsement[18] dated September 3, 2014, informing the City Budget Office that the claim was included in the OMMC's budget proposal for 2015. Corresponding disbursement vouchers[19] were then issued, but still, the allocated funds were not released. Instead, the City Accountant referred the matter to the City Auditor for assessment and recommendation through a 1st Indorsement[20] dated August 24, 2015. In a Letter[21] dated October 29, 2015, the Supervising Auditor affirmed the previous recommendations to pay OMMC's P1,851,814.45-worth obligation to Metro Laundry despite lack of written contract and prior appropriation on the basis of quantum meruit. However, the claim was recommended to be filed directly to the COA Proper.[22] For this reason, the Office of the City Accountant issued a Certification[23] dated January 21, 2016 stating that ""based on x x x records and documents submitted to [its] Office by Metro Laundry for services rendered at [OMMC], the unpaid claim for the period April 01-December 31, 2011 amounts to P1,629,926.25.""[24] Metro Laundry sought correction of the amount, but to no avail.[25] Hence, despite discrepancy in the amount, it proceeded to file its Petition for Money Claim[26] for P1,851,814.45 before the COA Proper as instructed. In an unexpected turnaround, the City of Manila denied liability and prayed for the dismissal of Metro Laundry's monetary claim in its Answer[27] dated May 16, 2016. Contrary to its previous acknowledgment of liability and affirmation to pay Metro Laundry for its services from April to December 2011, the City of Manila argued this time that the liability should be directed against the OMMC officers who ordered the extension of the laundry services without prior appropriation and a written contract.[28] The Supervising Auditor, through a Memorandum dated August 1, 2016, recommended the denial of the claim because of the irregularities in the transaction, i.e., lack of public bidding, written contract, and appropriation for the retained services. The Supervising Auditor also averred that the amount claimed was excessive since the City Accountant alleged that services rendered in October 2011 were already paid ""per city's record under Check No. 662432 dated February 2, 2012.""[29] In a Memorandum[30] dated July 11, 2017, the Regional Director of the COA Local Government Sector National Capital Region concurred in the Supervising Auditor's opinion, and even recommended that the alleged amount already paid to Metro Laundry in October 2011 be returned.[31] In its assailed Decision No. 2020-043[32] dated January 10, 2020, the COA Proper focused on the illegality of the extended contract. Relying mainly upon COA Resolution No. 86-58[33] dated November 15, 1986, the COA Proper ruled that the patent disregard of the mandatory requirements for procurement of services under Section 10[34] of Republic Act (RA) No. 9184[35] and Sections 85(1)[36] and 86[37] of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445[38] nullified Metro Laundry's legal claim for payment. The COA Proper explained that, pursuant to Section 48,[39] Book V, Title I, Subtitle B, Chapter 8 of the Administrative Code of 1987,[40] Metro Laundry's recourse should be against the OMMC officials who secured its services in disregard of government procurement rules. Hence, with a 2-3 vote, Metro Laundry's claim was disposed as follows: WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Petition for Money Claim of [Metro Laundry], represented by its Proprietor, Ms. Elizabeth T. Tindog, against the City Government of Manila, for payment of laundry services rendered to the [OMMC] from April to December 2011, amounting to [P]1,851,814.45, is hereby DENIED.[41] (Emphases in the original.) COA Chairperson Michael G. Aguinaldo (Chairperson Aguinaldo) dissented[42] in the outright denial of Metro Laundry's money claim. Without discounting the admitted illegality of the transaction, Chairperson Aguinaldo cited case laws which upheld payment of compensation to a contractor or service provider by way of quantum meruit despite defects in or even nullity of the contract. In his Dissenting Opinion,[43] he opined: [T]he Decision makes much reliance on COA Resolution No. [86-58] dated [November 15, 1986,] which states the policy on the Recovery by Government Contractors on the Basis of Quantum Meruit. This Resolution, which curiously limits quantum meruit recovery to a single ground - the absence of the certificate of availability of funds, has long been rendered obsolete by numerous decisions of the Supreme Court through the last three decades. It is archaic, a relic of the past, and totally out of tune with[,] not just jurisprudence[,] but reality. Relying on the Resolution as a basis for the denial of the money claim is not simply turning a blind eye to jurisprudence[,] but being inattentive and unjust. The justification usually given for the denial of money claims based on quantum meruit is that contractors continue to violate government procurement laws. But who actually violates the procurement law? Absent any proof of collusion, the burden of which falls on the Commission, it cannot be presumed that the contractor colluded with the government officials involved. It is the government official who violates the procurement law, by not holding any public bidding, or proceeding without appropriation or a written contract. Consequently, the proper party to penalize is the government official responsible. The denial of a quantum meruit money claim, in the absence of proof of collusion, will not have the effect of lessening procurement law violations for the simple reason that the wrong person is being penalized. The proper recourse is referral of the matter to the Office of the Ombudsman for investigation of the government officials involved. x x x x I vote to grant the Petition for Money Claim, subject to a quantum meruit determination of the actual services rendered and the reasonable value thereof.[44] Metro Laundry now comes directly to the Court on certiorari, insisting to be paid on the basis of quantum meruit for the services it had actually rendered for the City of Manila.[45] For its part, the COA Proper, through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), points out Metro Laundry's failure to file a motion for reconsideration (MR) before the COA Proper before it sought remedy to the Court, which would have warranted the dismissal of the petition.[46] Nevertheless, the OSG prays for the modification of the assailed Decision No. 2020-043 as it also argues for Metro Laundry's entitlement to compensation and the application of the principle of quantum meruit since the City of Manila had admittedly benefited from Metro Laundry's services, subsequent appropriations for the payment were already done, and disbursement vouchers were correspondingly issued therefor.[47] However, the OSG takes exception to the grant of the whole amount of P1,851,814.45 claimed, and instead argues that only the amount appearing in the disbursement vouchers - a total of P1,666,633.00 - should be granted.[48]","COA Proper Decision No. 2020-043 dated January 10, 2020, which denied Metro Laundry Services' (Metro Laundry) money claim for the unpaid services it rendered at the Ospital ng Maynila Medical Center (OMMC). ... The COA Proper ruled that the patent disregard of the mandatory requirements for procurement of services under Section 10[34] of Republic Act (RA) No. 9184[35] and Sections 85(1)[36] and 86[37] of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445[38] nullified Metro Laundry's legal claim for payment. The COA Proper explained that, pursuant to Section 48,[39] Book V, Title I, Subtitle B, Chapter 8 of the Administrative Code of 1987,[40] Metro Laundry's recourse should be against the OMMC officials who secured its services in disregard of government procurement rules. Hence, with a 2-3 vote, Metro Laundry's claim was disposed as follows: WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Petition for Money Claim of [Metro Laundry], represented by its Proprietor, Ms. Elizabeth T. Tindog, against the City Government of Manila, for payment of laundry services rendered to the [OMMC] from April to December 2011, amounting to [P]1,851,814.45, is hereby DENIED.[41] (Emphases in the original.)","We find merit in the petition. ... Payment for services done on account of the government cannot be avoided despite irregularity or nullity of the contract. There is no dispute that Metro Laundry's extended contract with OMMC without public bidding violated the procurement law. ... We, however, highlight that the OMMC and the City of Manila have consistently recognized Metro Laundry's entitlement to payment for its actual services rendered despite non-compliance with the foregoing provisions as shown by the series of certifications, indorsements, and vouchers issued by OMMC and concerned city officials.[55] Even the COA Proper, in its assailed Decision No. 2020-043,[56] agreed that Metro Laundry is entitled to be paid for its services, although it took exception to Metro Laundry's recourse against the local government due to the invalidity of the contract, and for that sole reason, denied Metro Laundry's claim outright.[57] ... This catena of cases clearly shows that the outright denial of Metro Laundry's legitimate claim for compensation is unjustified. Insofar as Metro Laundry is concerned, it has fulfilled the services it was contracted for, and in doing so, no evidence of bad faith or collusion with the approving OMMC officials was presented against it. Needless to say, the government has admittedly benefited from Metro Laundry's services. Given these circumstances, there is no justification for the COA Proper to impose upon Metro Laundry the burden of pursuing its claim against the public officials who engaged its services without compliance with the law.[67] The liability of these erring officers may properly be imposed in a disallowance case, if bad faith on their part is proven, and/or in an administrative or criminal case, if warranted.[68] Thus, we find no further obstacle in ruling for the payment of Metro Laundry's services based on quantum meruit. COA should determine the proper amount to be paid. When payment is based on quantum meruit, the amount of recovery should be the reasonable value of the thing or services rendered regardless of any agreement as to value.[69] Determination of such value is a purely factual matter, which necessitates reception and evaluation of competent evidence. Metro Laundry claims payment of services rendered from April 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011 amounting to P1,851,814.45. As shown in pertinent issuances,[70] the City of Manila admitted this amount, albeit later on, it claimed that ""per city's record under Check No. 662432 dated February 2, 2012,""[71] the services rendered in October 2011 was already paid, leaving an outstanding balance of P1,629,926.25.[72] However, there is a paucity of evidence to substantiate this allegation. The OSG, on the other hand, points out that only the amount appearing in the disbursement vouchers[73] –a total of P1,666,633.00–should be paid.[74] These contradicting allegations constrain this Court to remand the case to the COA for the conduct of a post-audit to determine the amount of the services rendered, to which Metro Laundry shall be entitled.","FOR THESE REASONS, the petition is PARTLY GRANTED. The Commission on Audit Proper Decision No. 2020-043 dated January 10, 2020 is SET ASIDE. Accordingly, the case is REMANDED to the Commission on Audit for the determination of the proper amount to be paid to Metro Laundry Services. The City of Manila is then ORDERED to pay Metro Laundry Services such determined amount. This disposition is without prejudice to any civil, criminal, and administrative action which may be filed against erring officials of the Ospital ng Maynila Medical Center for violation of the law, if warranted. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. Nos. 225568-70*, February 15, 2022","LILYBETH R. PEREZ, PETITIONER, VS. OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSMAN, RESPONDENT.","On December 5, 2005, the General Investigation Bureau-A (complainant) of the Ombudsman filed several Criminal and Administrative Complaints[5] against petitioner in her capacity as Revenue Officer I of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR)-Tax Fraud Division. Petitioner, together with a certain Amelita E. Abad and Aguinaldo L. Miravalles, was charged in relation to her Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Net Worth (SALN) for the years 1994 to 2002. [6] In particular, complainant alleged that petitioner: (1) failed to file her 1999 SALN; (2) acquired properties manifestly out of proportion to her lawful income since her assets increased by P2,782,000.00 in a span of eight years despite her legitimate annual income as a Revenue Officer being merely P772,800.00; (3) falsely declared in her 1997 SALN that she bought a parcel of land in Limay, Bataan, but which transaction was consummated in 1998; (4) increased the acquisition cost of her Bataan property in her 2001 and 2002 SALNs; (5) declared a false market value in her 1994 to 2000 SALNs for the parcel of land located in Valenzuela City; (6) made over declarations of her liabilities with Fatima Credit Cooperative (FCC) in her 1997 and 1998 SALNs; and (7) failed to disclose that she had a child in her SALNs for the years 1995 to 1998. [7] In her Counter-Affidavits, [8] petitioner argued that all her properties were legitimately acquired. She asserted that the increase in her assets can be explained by the loans she made from the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) and FCC to acquire some properties from 1994 to 1998. She revealed that aside from her salary, she also earned annual additional income of P294,000.00 from the rentals of her seven small apartment units in Valenzuela City, which she acquired from her parents through donation. The fair market value of her jewelry and her Valenzuela lot also increased, as duly reflected in her SALNs for the years 1995 to 1998. In her 2001 and 2002 SALNs, petitioner declared her time deposits with FCC and placed it under the heading ""Cash and cash substitutes, investments, furniture and fixtures, jewelries, legal and accounting books and references, motor vehicles, appliances."" Lastly, to explain why her SALN for the year 1999 was not submitted to the BIR National Office, petitioner averred that she filed the same with the Administrative Section of Revenue District No. 27 because she was detailed at said district office during that time.","In its June 8, 2007 Decision, [9] the Ombudsman dismissed the charge of failure to file a SALN for the year 1999 against petitioner. On December 15, 2015, the Ombudsman issued a joint resolution finding probable cause to indict petitioner for six counts of the offense under Sec. 8, in relation to Sec. 11 of R.A. No. 6713. The dispositive portion reads: WHEREFORE, finding probable cause for six (6) counts of violation of Section 8 in relation to Section 11 of R.A. No. 6713 against Lilybeth R. Perez, let the corresponding Informations be FILED with the appropriate court. The criminal charges against respondents Amelita E. Abad and Aguinaldo L. Miravalles are hereby DISMISSED. SO ORDERED. [10] Foremost, the Ombudsman only considered the SALN violations for the years 1997 to 2002 since the alleged violations committed by petitioner in her 1994 to 1996 SALNs had already prescribed. Nonetheless, it found that petitioner failed to disclose her seven apartment units in Valenzuela City and the rental income she earned from said property in her SALNs for the years 1997 to 2002. The Ombudsman also opined that petitioner violated the legal requirements pertaining to the submission of her SALN when she failed to disclose the existence of her child in her 1997 and 1998 SALNs. The Ombudsman, however, dismissed the other criminal and administrative charges against petitioner, and ruled that she could not be guilty of perjury since there was no showing that she deliberately asserted falsehoods in her SALNs for the years 1994 to 2002. The alleged violation of R.A. No. 1379 was also found by the Ombudsman as baseless. The Ombudsman recognized that an increase in the net worth did not automatically mean an increase in assets or properties by purchase. According to the Ombudsman, complainant manifestly failed to substantiate its claim that the increase in petitioner's net worth was caused by acquisition of properties from illegal sources. The Ombudsman gave credence to petitioner's claim that she had other sources of income and that she had taken out several loans from the GSIS and FCC, which were used to acquire the assets she had gained over the years. Lastly, the Ombudsman dismissed the charges against petitioner's co-accused. Aggrieved, petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration asserting that her right to speedy disposition of cases was violated. She argued that the Ombudsman violated such right when it took 10 years from the time of the filing of the complaints to issue the joint resolution. Additionally, petitioner claimed that she exercised good faith in filing her SALNs for the years 1997 to 2002, which was bolstered by the Ombudsman's finding that there was no evident bad faith on her part when she filed her SALNs. Petitioner averred that she declared the Valenzuela property in her SALNs and claimed that the apartment units were mere improvements thereon. Such improvements were already included in the fair market value she indicated in her SALNs, thereby explaining the increase from 1998 to 1999. As for her failure to declare the rental income from the apartment units, petitioner alleged that she was denied due process of law since such allegation was not included in the complaints, which deprived her of the right to rebut the same by competent evidence. Petitioner also contended that she was not obliged to declare the existence of her child since the requirement under the law specified that the public officer is required to disclose his or her unmarried child only if the latter has assets, liabilities, business interests or financial connections. In its April 12, 2016 Joint Order, the Ombudsman denied petitioner's motion for reconsideration for being filed out of time. The Ombudsman also held that it is not precluded from finding her guilty of the offense under Sec. 8 of R.A. No. 6713 on the basis of her failure to disclose the rental income from her apartment units in Valenzuela City, despite not being alleged in the original complaint.","The Court finds that there was an unexplained and inordinate delay in the preliminary investigation conducted by the Ombudsman, which violated petitioner's constitutional right to speedy disposition of cases and right to procedural due process of law. Such delay rendered void the assailed joint resolution and joint order. Applying Alarilla, the burden of proof shifted to the Ombudsman when it issued the joint resolution 10 years after the complaints against petitioner were filed. Even assuming that the one-year extension is applied to the 24-month period for complex cases, there is still an inordinate delay of seven years from the time the complaints were filed against petitioner in 2005, until the joint resolution was issued in 2015. In the present case, the Ombudsman manifestly failed to explain in its comment before the Court, the 10-year delay of its December 15, 2015 Joint Resolution. There is even dearth of allegation or proof that the case involves complex issues or that the voluminous records could have caused the inordinate delay. Considering the inordinate delay of 10 years by the Ombudsman in the conduct of its preliminary investigation and the apparent lack of sufficient justification, petitioner's right to speedy disposition of cases and right to procedural due process of law have been patently disregarded. On this point alone, the complaints against petitioner should be dismissed for having been issued with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction on the part of the Ombudsman. At any rate, the Court finds that petitioner did not violate R.A. No. 6713. Petitioner's explanation, i.e., that she did not declare her newborn child in the 1995 to 1997 SALNs because her child had no assets, liabilities, business or financial interests, is well taken. Similarly, regarding the failure to disclose apartment units and rental income, the Court finds no malicious intent on petitioner's part to conceal the same, as she herself disclosed the apartment units and rental income in her counter-affidavit, and explained that the units were declared as improvements reflected by the increase in the fair market value of the Valenzuela property. Moreover, income or sources of income is not required to be declared or explained in the SALN under R.A. No. 6713, only assets, liabilities, net worth, and financial and business interests. All told, the Court finds that the Ombudsman gravely abused its discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction in issuing the assailed joint resolution and joint order. The complaints against petitioner should be dismissed in view of the inordinate delay in the termination of the preliminary investigation, which violated petitioner's rights to speedy disposition of cases and to procedural due process of law.","WHEREFORE, the instant petition for certiorari is GRANTED. The December 15, 2015 Joint Resolution of the Office of the Ombudsman in OMB-C-C-05-0681-L, OMB-C-C-05-0686-L, and OMB-C-C-05-0687-L, and its April 12, 2016 Joint Order, finding probable cause to indict Lilybeth R. Perez for six (6) counts of the offense under Section 8, in relation to Section 11 of Republic Act No. 6713, are hereby ANNULLED and SET ASIDE. The Ombudsman is hereby ORDERED to DISMISS the complaints filed against petitioner Lilybeth R. Perez for violating her constitutional right to speedy disposition of cases. SO ORDERED."
"[ G.R. No. 213207, February 15, 2022 ]","REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, PETITIONER, VS. PASIG RIZAL CO., INC.,* RESPONDENT.","Sometime in 1958, Manuel Dee Ham (Manuel) caused the survey of the Subject Property under Plan Psu-169919. [6] The plan was subsequently approved by the Director of Lands, and the Subject Property was declared in Manuel's name for tax purposes. [7] Manuel died in 1961. Consequently, the Subject Property was inherited by his surviving wife Esperanza Gerona (Esperanza), and their children, who, in turn, collectively transferred their beneficial ownership over the Subject Property to the Dee Ham family corporation, PRCI. [8] Thereafter, PRCI began paying the real property taxes due in its name. [9] On November 6, 2009, Esperanza executed an Affidavit to formalize the transfer. [10]
RTC proceedings In 2010, Esperanza, as President of PRCI, filed before the RTC an application for original registration of title over the Subject Property, for and on behalf of the latter. [11] There, Esperanza asserted that PRCI is the owner of the Subject Property and all improvements found thereon, and that PRCI and its predecessors in interest have been in open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession of the Subject Property for more than fifty (50) years. [12] Esperanza also averred that the Subject Property has neither been encumbered, nor has it been adversely possessed or claimed by any other party. [13] No opposition was entered against the application after due notice and publication. [14] Thus, an order of general default was entered against the whole world, with the exception of the Republic of the Philippines (Republic). [15] Subsequently, PRCI presented its evidence ex-parte. [16] The evidence presented by PRCI was summarized by the CA, as follows: x x x [PRCI] appended the following documents, to wit: a) the Approved Survey Plan, Technical Description and Surveyor's Certification of [the Subject Property] showing its area and boundaries; b) Tax Declarations and Tax Receipts proving that since 1956, [the Subject Property] was already declared for tax purposes and the corresponding realty taxes were paid; c) Affidavit of Esperanza Gerona establishing the transfer of ownership and possession of the subject realty to [PRCI]; d) Certification of the Regional Technical Director of Forest Management Service of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) proving that the subject lot is within the alienable and disposable land of public domain, as verified under Project No. 21 of Pasig pursuant to [Land Classification] Map 639 which was approved on [March 11, 1927 and] per ocular inspection on the ground on [September 12, 2011]; and e) Affidavit of Bernarda Lu, a friend and neighbor of the Dee Ham family, attesting to [PRCI's] ownership of the [Subject Property] and its uninterrupted possession as well as the payment of land taxes thereon. [17]","CA proceedings On February 25, 2014, the CA issued the assailed Decision dismissing the Appeal, thus: WHEREFORE, foregoing considered, the [RTC Decision] is AFFIRMED. SO ORDERED. [23] The CA held that the evidence presented by PRCI sufficiently established that the Subject Property is alienable and disposable. [24]... Aggrieved, the Republic filed a Motion for Reconsideration [35] (MR) on March 19, 2014. The CA denied said MR through the Assailed Resolution, [36] which the Republic received on July 7, 2014. [37] On July 22, 2014, the Republic filed a Motion for Extension of Time to File Petition, [38] praying for an additional period of thirty (30) days within which to file its petition for review on certiorari before the Court. Finally, the Republic filed the present Petition on August 22, 2014.","The Court resolves to remand the Petition to the CA for the reasons set forth below. As a starting point, it bears recalling that the RTC held that PRCI was able to establish that it had been in open, actual, continuous, adverse, and notorious possession of the Subject Property in the concept of an owner for the period then required by law for the acquisition of title. [57] ... Thus, the crux of the present controversy hinges on a single question \u00ad whether PRCI has established that the Subject Property forms part of the alienable and disposable agricultural land of the public domain in accordance with the requirements set by prevailing law. ... RA 11573 shall apply retroactively to all applications for judicial confirmation of title which remain pending as of September 1, 2021, or the date when RA 11573 took effect. These include all applications pending resolution at the first instance before all Regional Trial Courts, and applications pending appeal before the Court of Appeals. Applications for judicial confirmation of title filed on the basis of the old Section 14(1) and 14(2) of PD 1529 and which remain pending before the Regional Trial Court or Court of Appeals as of September 1, 2021 shall be resolved following the period and manner of possession required under the new Section 14(1). Thus, beginning September 1, 2021, proof of ""open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation of alienable and disposable lands of the public domain not covered by existing certificates of title or patents under a bona fide claim of ownership for at least twenty (20) years immediately preceding the filing of the application for confirmation"" shall be sufficient for purposes of judicial confirmation of title, and shall entitle the applicant to a decree of registration. In the interest of substantial justice, the Regional Trial Courts and Court of Appeals are hereby directed, upon proper motion or motu proprio, to permit the presentation of additional evidence on land classification status based on the parameters set forth in Section 7 of RA 11573. Such additional evidence shall consist of a certification issued by the DENR geodetic engineer which (i) states that the land subject of the application for registration has been classified as alienable and disposable land of the public domain; (ii) bears reference to the applicable Forestry Administrative Order, DENR Administrative Order, Executive Order, or proclamation classifying the land as such; and (iii) indicates the number of the LC Map covering the land. In the absence of a copy of the relevant issuance classifying the land as alienable and disposable, the certification must additionally state (i) the release date of the LC Map; and (ii) the Project Number. Further, the certification must confirm that the LC Map forms part of the records of NAMRIA and is precisely being used by the DENR as a land classification map. The DENR geodetic engineer must be presented as witness for proper authentication of the certification in accordance with the Rules of Court.","WHEREFORE, premises considered, the petition for review on certiorari filed by the Republic of the Philippines is DENIED in part. The February 25, 2014 Decision and June 27, 2014 Resolution respectively rendered by the Court of Appeals First Division and Special First Division in CA-G.R. CV. No. 98531 are AFFIRMED insofar as it holds that Pasig Rizal Co., Inc., by itself and through its predecessors in interest, has been in open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession and occupation of the Subject Property since 1956. The case is REMANDED to the Court of Appeals for reception of evidence on the Subject Property's land classification status based on the parameters set forth in Section 7 of Republic Act No. 11573. Thereafter, the Court of Appeals is directed to resolve the present case in accordance with this Decision with due and deliberate dispatch. SO ORDERED."

Joy Mart consented to sell its property and give up its leasehold rights over the adjacent properties provided it would be given the first option to redevelop the entire area of the consolidated block of a total of 2,014.9 sq. m., with the same provided for in the whereas clause of the contract. In September, 1982, while negotiations were underway between Joy Mart and the LRTA, the latter entered into a contract with the Philippine General Hospital Foundation, Inc. (PGHFI), which granted PGHFI the right to develop areas adjacent to the LRT stations, and manage and operate concessions thereon. Later, under a Deed of Absolute Sale (DoAS) dated February 22, 1983, Joy Mart, in consideration of P44,000,000.00 and a supposed first refusal option to redevelop the consolidated block, sold its property and waived its leasehold rights on the adjacent lots in favor of the government through the LRTA.[3] Pertinent portions of the said DoAS read: WHEREAS, the VENDEE, upon recommendation of the Special Panel created by the LRT Committee on Land and Property Acquisition agrees that ""the owners of Isetann and as Lessee of the President Hotel x x x (Joy Mart Consolidated Corp.) should be given the first option in the redevelopment of the consolidated block, notwithstanding the compensation for their property.""[4] Pursuant to the supposed first refusal option granted to Joy Mart, PGHFI subleased to the former the consolidated block through a sublease agreement entered into on February 1, 1984... A little less than two years later, the 1986 EDSA Revolution happened in February 1986. Nearly three years from the execution of the DoAS[6] in question, or on April 8, 1986, the LRTA, through its then Chairman Hernando B. Perez, wrote[7] Joy Mart to inform the latter that the sublease was rescinded and that it was to pay the rental proceeds not to PGHFI but directly to the LRTA. Then, on July 21, 1986, over three years from the execution of the DoAS and over two years since Joy Mart and Isetann entered into the cancelled sublease agreement with PGHFI, the LRTA, already under the new administration of President Corazon Aquino, caused the publication of the Notice for Pre-Qualification Bidding for the development of the LRT commercial stalls. During the public bidding that followed, Phoenix Omega Development and Management (Phoenix) made a bid and won.[8] In November, 1986, proceeding from Phoenix's successful bid, the LRTA entered into a Commercial Stalls Concession Contract[9] with Phoenix, which awarded to the latter all the areas and commercial spaces within three LRT terminals and fifteen LRT stations, including Carriedo Station. Pursuant to said Commercial Stalls Concession Contract with the LRTA, Phoenix began the construction of the commercial stalls. Then, on August 20, 1987, or nine months after Phoenix had begun its construction, Joy Mart and Isetann sued the LRTA and Phoenix before Branch 32, Regional Trial Court of Manila (RTC) in a complaint for specific performance, injunction and damages,[10] docketed as Civil Case No. 87-41731.","RTC Ruling: In its Decision[14] dated July 16, 2012, the RTC dismissed the complaint of Joy Mart and Isetann... The RTC held that while the first refusal option was part and parcel of the DoAS,[16] the same first refusal option pertains to a public contract undertaken by the LRTA as a government entity, which meant that the right to develop or redevelop any property pursuant to such a public contract required public bidding.[17] For having been granted outside of any public bidding, the RTC ruled that the said first refusal option may not give rise to any preferential right in favor of Joy Mart and Isetann. x x x CA Ruling: Ruling on Joy Mart and Isetann's appeal, the CA, in its Decision[22] dated February 6, 2014, reversed the RTC and resolved the appeal in their favor, viz.: WHEREFORE, the appeal is GRANTED. The assailed Decision is REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The complaint in Civil Case No. 87-41731 is GRANTED. Accordingly the Light Rail Transit Authority is ordered to comply with the parties' 1983 Deed of Sale by granting Joy Mart Consolidated Corporation and/or Isetann Department Store, Inc. the right to redevelop the entire area denominated as the consolidated block of the LRT Carriedo Station and to pay to the latter, by way of compensatory damages, the rentals thereon which are deposited, by way of consignation, with the Regional Trial Court, National Capital Judicial Region, Br. 32, Manila, in Civil Case No. 87-41731. With costs.","The two threshold points of query for the resolution of the present petitions are as follows: (i) Is the first refusal option of Joy Mart and Isetann valid? (ii) Are Joy Mart and Isetann guilty of estoppel by laches? The Ruling of the Court On the above central issues, the Court finds for the LRTA and Phoenix. x x x The first refusal option was invalid. As settled in jurisprudence, the LRTA is correct in its submission that although the DoAS, in its whereas clause, did say that the first refusal option was granted as a privilege to Joy Mart and Isetann, that same privilege was invalid from the moment of its grant, and may not be saved by the application of freedom to contract. The reason for this is no other than the rule that such freedom to contract cannot be extended as to permit a contracting away of provisions of law, i.e., the need for public bidding in government contracts, as in this case. x x x The right of first option, assuming it was enforceable, was effectively waived. Moreover, even if the first refusal option did survive to be enforceable, it was nonetheless waived by Joy Mart and Isetann through a series of clear but foregone opportunities to assert their claim to the right of first option, the earliest of which was when it entered into a sublease with PGHFI, followed by their failure to object to the public bidding that they knew was being conducted for the redevelopment. x x x Award of damages improper. On the matter of the award of damages, the Court similarly reverses the CA's award for utter lack of legal basis.","Based on the foregoing premises, the petition in G.R. 212602 is DENIED and the petition in G.R. No. 211281 is GRANTED. The Decision dated February 6, 2014 of the Court of Appeals – First Division in CA-G.R. CV No. 100000 and its Resolution dated May 19, 2014 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The Decision dated July 16, 2012 of Branch 32, Regional Trial Court of Manila in Civil Case No. 87-41731 is hereby REINSTATED. SO ORDERED."

SANDIGANBAYAN, SPECIAL THIRD DIVISION, OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSMAN REPRESENTED BY THE OFFICE OF THE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR AND PHILIPPINE AMUSEMENT AND GAMING CORPORATION, RESPONDENTS.","On June 21, 2011, the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) filed a Complaint against Rene Figueroa (Rene) and its other officers for corruption. On July 19, 2011, the complaint was endorsed for preliminary investigation. On July 29, 2011, the Office of the Ombudsman directed Rene and the other officers to file their counter-affidavits within ten (10) days from notice. On August 16, 2011, Rene received a copy of the order and requested an additional ten (10) days within which to file his counter-affidavit. On September 5, 2011, Rene filed his counter-affidavit. On September 22, 2014, the Ombudsman recommended the filing of informations for two (2) counts of violation of Sections 3(e) of Republic Act (RA) No. 3019 against Rene and the other officers. Rene and the other officers sought reconsideration but was denied. On June 3, 2016, the Ombudsman filed the corresponding charges before the Sandiganbayan docketed as SB16-CRM-0326 and SB16-CRM-0327. Thereafter, the Office of the Special Prosecutor recommended the amendment of the informations to indicate the respective middle names of the accused and to indicate the correct designation of Rene as Executive Vice-President and Head of the Research and Development Department. On March 6, 2017, the Overall Deputy Ombudsman approved the recommendations. On even date, the Ombudsman moved for the admission of the amended informations. On July 4, 2017, the Sandiganbayan admitted the amended informations. The Sandiganbayan found the proposed amendments as merely formal which did not change the nature of the offense charged. On July 20, 2017, Rene moved to quash the informations due to an inordinate delay in the handling of his case. On October 11, 2017, the Sandiganbayan denied the motion to quash. The Sandiganbayan explained that the delay is reasonable and part of the ordinary process of justice. Moreover, Rene failed to raise the speedy disposition of his cases before the Ombudsman.","The petition is meritorious. ... Obviously, whether the 10-day, 12-month or 24-month period is applied, it is clear that the Ombudsman exceeded the specified time for preliminary investigation. ... Notably, the Ombudsman did not discuss the context of the case of Rene and his co-respondents, the amount of evidence to be weighed, or the complexity of the issues raised therein to explain the delay in the conclusion of the preliminary investigation. The Ombudsman merely argued that the delay, if any, was reasonable. ... Differently stated, the prosecution failed to prove that the delay was reasonable and justified. ... Similarly, the Court finds that Rene's failure to assert his right before the Ombudsman is not a ground for the denial of the motion to quash absent any pleading or act on his part that contributed to the deferral of the proceedings. Rene's request for an additional ten (10) days within which to file his counter-affidavit did not significantly contribute to the delay in the resolution of his cases. It is also of no moment that Rene did not file a motion to expedite the proceedings before the Ombudsman or raise his right to speedy disposition in his motion for reconsideration. The burden is not upon Rene to ensure that the wheels of justice continue to turn. Rather, it is for the State to guarantee that the cases are disposed of within a reasonable period.","FOR THESE REASONS, the petition is GRANTED. The Sandiganbayan's Resolution dated October 11, 2017 in SB16-CRM-0326 and SB16-CRM-0327 is SET ASIDE.",The criminal cases against Rene C. Figueroa are DISMISSED for violation of his constitutional right to the speedy disposition of cases.
"G.R. No. 229265, February 15, 2022 [G.R. No. 229624]","SILVINO B. MATOBATO, SR., PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT. [G.R. No. 229624] WALTER B. BUCAO AND CIRILA A. ENGBINO, PETITIONERS, VS. HONORABLE SANDIGANBAYAN-SPECIAL FIFTH DIVISION AND PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENTS.","On September 22, 1994, the Sangguniang Bayan of the Municipality of Pantukan, Compostela Valley, passed Resolution No. 164, Series of 1994 authorizing Silvino B. Matobato, Sr. (Silvino), the Municipal Treasurer, to transfer an unspecified amount of municipal funds from the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) to Davao Cooperative Bank (DCB). [2] Accordingly, Silvino opened a time deposit account with DCB and transferred therein various amounts from 1994 to 1998. However, DCB suffered insolvency in 1998, and was placed under receivership. As a result, the Municipality of Pantukan failed to withdraw the deposited amounts. In its Annual Audit Report for 1998, the Commission on Audit (COA) found that the Sangguniang Bayan of Pantukan treated the funds deposited with DCB as idle funds. The COA also noted that the Sangguniang Bayan should have allocated the funds to certain municipal projects. Yet, the implementation of these projects was jeopardized since the funds cannot be withdrawn. Thus, the COA recommended the filing of criminal and administrative charges against the municipal officials involved in the transaction with DCB. [3] Acting on the COA's report, the Ombudsman filed an Information [4] for violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act (RA) No. 3019 [5] against Silvino and Sangguniang Bayan members Walter B. Bucao (Walter), and Cirila A. Engbino (Cirila), along with seven other municipal officials before the Sandiganbayan docketed as Criminal Case No. SB-10-CRM-0015. The Information charged the accused of conspiracy and gross inexcusable negligence in issuing Resolution No. 164, Series of 1994. Allegedly, the funds were not idle funds that may be deposited at any bank under a time deposit account. Moreover, the accused authorized the transaction without investigating DCB's financial status. [6] After trial, the Fifth Division of the Sandiganbayan acquitted Silvino, Walter, and Cirila, as well as their co-accused based on reasonable doubt in a Decision dated September 20, 2016, and a Resolution dated January 11, 2017, in Crim. Case No. SB-10-CRM-0015. [7] The Sandiganbayan held that the prosecution failed to prove the second element of the offense, i.e. , that the accused committed gross and inexcusable negligence , which entails an omission of care that even inattentive and thoughtless men never take in their own property, and in cases involving public officials, takes place only when breach of duty is flagrant and devious. [8] For the Sandiganbayan, the prosecution's evidence do not concretely establish that the funds were not idle when Resolution No. 164, Series of 1994 was passed. [9] As such, the fund transfer from LBP to DCB can hardly be considered as unlawful, or violative of Section 21 of COA Circular No. 92-382. [10] Nevertheless, the Sandiganbayan ordered the accused civilly and solidarity liable for the municipality's unrecovered funds in the amount of P9.25 million. The Sandiganbayan explained that even if the accused were not grossly and inexcusably negligent to be held criminally liable under Section 3(e) of RA No. 3019, they were still negligent enough to incur civil liability. [11] According to the Sandiganbayan, the accused negligently transferred the municipal funds despite their failure to conduct reasonable due diligence in ascertaining DCB's solvency by merely relying on the bank manager's assurances. [12] Hence, these consolidated petitions: Petition for Review on Certiorari [13] G.R. No. 229624, assailing the Decision dated September 20, 2016; and Petition for Review on Certiorari , [14] G.R. No. 229265, assailing the Resolution dated January 11, 2017. Silvino, Walter, and Cirila attack the Sandiganbayan's ruling with regard to their civil liability. Silvino argues that he is not civilly liable because DCB is still under liquidation. Thus, actual damage to the municipality has not yet been ascertained. If later on the amount can be recovered from DCB after liquidation, then the municipality would be unjustly enriched at the expense of the accused. On the other hand, Walter and Cirila maintain that there is no preponderant evidence to support the Sandiganbayan's ruling. Walter and Cirila invoke the presumption of regularity in the performance of their official functions.","The petitions are unmeritorious. Every person criminally liable for a felony is also civilly liable. [15] Yet, the dismissal of the criminal action does not carry with it the extinction of the civil liability where: ""(a) the acquittal is based on reasonable doubt as only preponderance of evidence is required; (b) the court declares that the liability of the accused is only civil; and (c) the civil liability of the accused does not arise from or is not based upon the crime of which the accused is acquitted."" [16] The quantum of proof to establish civil liability is preponderance of evidence which is defined as the ""weight, credit, and value of the aggregate evidence on either side and is usually considered to be synonymous with the term ' greater weight of the evidence ' or ' greater weight of the credible evidence .' It is evidence which is more convincing to the court as worthy of belief than that which is offered in opposition thereto."" [17] Notably, the Sandiganbayan acquitted Silvino, Walter, and Cirila because their guilt were not proven beyond reasonable doubt. Thus, any civil liability survives because only preponderant evidence is necessary to establish it. Here, the required quantum of proof was met to sustain the Sandiganbayan's findings on the civil liability of Silvino, Walter, and Cirila.","Under Section 101(1) of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445, [18] Silvino, as Municipal Treasurer, was accountable for the safekeeping of municipal funds in conformity with law. [19] However, Silvino did not exercise that reasonable care and caution which an ordinarily prudent person would have used in the same situation. [20] First , Silvino failed to at least flag any possible risk relating to the transaction of the Municipality of Pantukan with DCB. Second , Silvino vouched on DCB's financial status and continued depositing municipal funds despite the business climate, specifically the Asian Financial Crisis, besetting at that time. Third , the relatively new entry of DCB at such a turbulent time for the banking industry served as a warning sign, but Silvino pushed for the investment proposal. Fourth , Silvino continued to deposit the municipal funds despite the expiration of DCB's authority to accept government deposits on June 14, 2006. [21] Lastly , Silvino did not establish any precautionary or contingent measure to protect the financial interests of the Municipality of Pantukan from the whiplash of DCB's insolvency. As the Sandiganbayan aptly observed in its Decision, [22] preponderant evidence exists that Silvino was negligent in the discharge of his duties as Municipal Treasurer, thus: It is apparent that [Silvino] was also remiss in the exercise of his duties as Municipal Treasurer. Under Section 470 of the Local Government Code, the Municipal Treasurer is tasked, among others, with the following duties: (1) advise the governor or mayor, as the case may be, the sanggunian, and other local government and national officials concerned regarding disposition of local government funds and on such other matters relative to public finance[;] and (2) take custody of and exercise proper management of the funds of the local government unit concerned. Also, as officer charged with the possession or custody of the government funds, he is accountable therefor and for the safekeeping thereof in conformity with the law. Pursuant to his mandate, he is duty bound to conduct due diligence before making a proposal to the local legislative body for the investment of municipal funds. It is likewise the Municipal Treasurer's duty to ensure that these funds are safe guarded [ sic ]. But [Silvino] failed to comply with these duties . [23] (Emphasis supplied and citation omitted.) Silvino's contention that he could not be held civilly liable pending DCB's liquidation is specious. The Municipality of Pantukan already suffered damage for all these years that it was, and is still, not able to withdraw and utilize the funds for government purposes. [24] Verily, were it not for the negligence of Silvino and his co-accused, the funds could have been spent long ago to meet the exigencies of public service and to address the pressing needs of the constituency. Until today, the Municipality of Pantukan still has not benefitted from even a single centavo of the wasted public funds. Differently stated, damage has been done and it is immaterial whether DCB is still under liquidation or not. Further, as the Sandiganbayan noted, there is no evidence that the present assets of DCB pending liquidation would be able to cover the P9.25 million liability in favor of the municipality. [25] On this premise, Silvino and his co-accused, who all negligently caused the inability of the municipality to timely withdraw and make use of the funds should compensate the municipality in accordance with the dictum that ""[ f ] undamental in the law on damages is that one injured by ax x x wrongful or negligent act or omission [,] shall have a fair and just compensation commensurate to the loss sustained as a consequence of defendant's act. x x x. Actual damages are primarily intended to simply make good or replace the loss caused by the wrong ."" [26] (Citation omitted.) Similarly, Walter and Cirila cannot conveniently invoke the presumption of regularity in the performance of their official functions. This disputable presumption crumbles in light of Walter and Cirila's negligence and indispensable participations in the transfer of funds from LBP to DCB. Considering the substantial amount of money and the financial risks involved, Walter and Cirila merely relied on the verbal representations of the bank manager about DCB's financial stability. As Sangguniang Bayan members, Walter and Cirila should have further required and examined the audited financial statements of DCB since, as mentioned earlier, the bank was relatively new in existence at the time the investment proposal was submitted for the Sangguniang Bayan's consideration. In comparison with other Sangguniang Bayan members, Walter and Cirila did not protest the investment or interpose serious reservations on the proposal. They actively participated in authorizing Silvino to deposit substantial amount of municipal funds to a risky bank. Under Section 340 [27] of RA No. 7160 otherwise know and cited as the ""Local Government Code of 1991,"" dated October 10, 1991, other local officers who, though not accountable by the nature of their duties, may likewise be held accountable and responsible for local government funds through their participation in the use and application thereof. Also, pursuant to Section 21 of COA Circular No. 92-382, [28] idle funds of the local government unit may only be deposited with duly authorized depository banks under time deposit accounts upon prior authority of the Sangguniang Bayan and approval of the local chief executive. Thus, without Resolution No. 164, Series of 1994 of the Municipality of Pantukan, Campostela Valley, which, to emphasize, should have been preceded by a painstaking scrutiny of the investment proposal by Walter, Cirila, and other Sangguniang Bayan members, the municipal funds would not have been transferred from LBP to DCB. All told, the Sandiganbayan correctly held Silvino, Walter, and Cirila civilly and solidarily liable to indemnify the Municipality of Pantukan, Compostela Valley. On this point, the Court reminds that public funds, like public office, are founded on public trust. How the public funds are managed and how they are safely kept reflect on the ability of the government to keep inviolate its fiduciary duty to the people. All public servants must ever be conscious that they are accountable for public resources that they handle for the people.","the petitions are DENIED. The Sandiganbayan's Decision dated September 20, 2016 and the Resolution dated January 11, 2017 in Criminal Case No. SB-10-CRM-0015 are AFFIRMED."

Manzano was assigned in the Office of BOI Governor Pelagio T. Ricalde (Ricalde) to perform the following services: Review documents papers and any proposed rules and regulations which the Board of Governors may find relevant to implement in line with its duties to give meaning to the intent of the Omnibus Investments Code of 1987 (Executive Order [EO] No. 226); Prepare draft scheme of the legal steps or requirements for proposing an investment incentives [ sic] to investors and entrepreneurs, foreign or local, with desired objective of promoting economic growth in the country; and Render legal opinion on issues presented before the Board of Governors which are deemed complicated and may need extensive study and research.

[11] The following persons were made liable to settle the disallowed transactions: (1) Atty. Gascon, [12] Atty. Manzano, [13] and Atty. Clarino [14] as payees; (2) Butalid, [15] Ricalde, [16] and Leaño [17] for entering into the service contracts with the lawyers; (3) Estella F. Jimenez (Jimenez), [18] Chief Accountant, for certifying that the supporting documents for the transactions were complete; (4) Reine Corazon S.

Corpuz, Human Resource Management Officer V, for certifying that the charges to appropriation/allotment were necessary and lawful and that the supporting documents were valid, proper, and legal; and (7) Lydia D. Ordoñez, Budget Officer, for certifying the availability of funds for the transactions. On October 10, 2012, the BOI appealed the NDs to the COA NGS-Cluster 8 Director. [20] The officers argued that COA Circular No. 86-255 was not applicable under the circumstances because the lawyers were hired not as legal counsels, but as technical assistants. They also claimed that Atty. Clarino does not fall within the ambit of a private law practitioner as she had never rendered legal services for compensation before her engagement with the BOI. [21] In its Decision No. 2014-011 [22] dated August 11, 2014, the COA NGS-Cluster 8 Director ruled that the requirements under COA Circular No. 86­255, as amended, applies to the hiring of private lawyers for a rendition of any legal service. Since the questioned service agreements enumerated a scope of work which required performance of legal services, and the required OSG written conformity and acquiescence and COA written concurrence were not obtained, the disallowance of the salaries paid to the three lawyers was upheld: WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing premises, the appeal is hereby DENIED DUE COURSE and is accordingly DISMISSED. Accordingly, the subject [NDs] on the payment of salaries to Attys. Manzano, Gascon, and Clarino for CY 2011 in the total amount of P774,189.00 is hereby affirmed. [23] On January 4, 2016, a Notice of Finality of Decision (NFD) No. OCD-2016-001(2014) [24] was issued, stating that COA NGS-Cluster 8 Decision No. 2014-011 has become final and executory, there being no petition for review filed within the reglementary period. On February 2, 2016, Decision No. 2014-011-A [25] was issued to correct the disallowed amount stated in Decision No. 2014-011 from P774,189.00 to P797,790.77 as reflected in the NDs. On even date, NFD No. OCD-2016-001(2014)-A [26] was issued for the same purpose. On March 22, 2016, Butalid, Ricalde, and Leaño filed a Petition for Review [27] before the COA Proper to question Decision No. 2014-011-A. The COA Proper gave due course to the appeal despite being belatedly filed, noting that Butalid, Ricalde, and Leaño were notified of the adverse decision only when they received the amended decision and NFD on February 18, 2016. [28] In its assailed Decision No. 2020-263 [29] dated January 31, 2020, the COA Proper ruled as follows: WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Petition for Review of [Butalid, Ricalde, and Leaño,] all of the [BOI], of [COA NGS-Cluster 8] Decision No. 2014-[0]11 dated August 11, 2014, as amended by COA NGS-Cluster 8 Decision No. 2014-[0]11-A dated February 2, 2016, is hereby DENIED. Accordingly, [ND] Nos. 2012-007-101 (11) to 2012-019-101(11), all dated May 30, 2012, on the payment of salaries of three contractual lawyers for calendar year 2011 in the total amount of [P]797.790.77 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION, in that Attys.

As regards the other persons liable who have seasonably filed an appeal, the NFD is SET ASIDE. [30] (Emphases supplied.) Hence, this petition raises the same arguments on the inapplicability of COA Circular No. 86-255, alleging that Atty. Gascon and Atty. Manzano were hired as technical assistants and not as lawyers to represent the BOI before any judicial or quasi-judicial body. [31] As regards Atty. Clarino, the petition points out that she was not hired on a fixed retainer fee, which the Circular prohibits; and that her salary was not unreasonable, it being at par with a BOI Attorney II's salary. In any case, the petition cites the BOI's 'dire need' [32] of additional technical staff to justify the engagement of the three lawyers' services and to support the invocation of good faith on the part of the approving and certifying officers. The petition also prays that an equitable resolution be extended to Fondevilla, claiming that his failure to seasonably appeal the COA NGS-Cluster 8 decision was due to lack of notice. [33] In its Comment, [34] the OSG points out that only Fondevilla and Jimenez actually filed the present petition as only their signatures appear in the petition, as well as in the Certification Against Forum Shopping. [35] As such, the OSG argues for the dismissal of the petition since the COA NGS-Cluster 8 decision is already final and immutable with respect to Fondevilla and Jimenez for their failure to appeal to the COA Proper; [36] (2) Fondevilla and Jimenez have no authority to file the petition on behalf of Butalid, Ricalde, and Leaño; [37] (3) no Motion for Reconsideration (MR) was filed before the COA Proper resort to the Court; [38] and (4) the COA Proper correctly sustained the disallowances and the officers' liability because the questioned engagements were done without the written conformity and acquiescence of the OSG, and the written concurrence of the COA in violation of an established regulation. [39] Butalid and Ricalde subsequently joined the petition through a Motion with Leave to Intervene, [40] which the Court granted in a Resolution [41] dated September 14, 2021.","Commission on Audit (COA) Proper Decision No. 2020-263 dated January 31, 2020, which: DENIED the Petition for Review filed by Butalid, Ricalde, and Leaño; AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION the disallowance of P797,790.77 on the payment of salaries of three contractual lawyers, in that Attys. Gascon, Manzano, and Clarino (payees) were excluded from liability under the NDs; and AFFIRMED the Notice of Finality of Decision (NFD) with respect to Fondevilla (due to failure to appeal seasonably) but SET ASIDE the NFD regarding the other persons who seasonably filed an appeal.","The petition is partly meritorious. The Court upheld the disallowance, finding that the engagement of private lawyers by the BOI violated COA Circular No. 86-255, as amended, because the indispensable requirements—written conformity and acquiescence of the OSG and written concurrence of the COA—were not secured. The Court reiterated that the prohibition covers the hiring of private lawyers to render any form of legal service, not just litigation. However, regarding the approving and certifying officers' liability, the Court ruled that since the COA Proper had already determined the propriety of allowing the payees (Attys. Gascon, Manzano, and Clarino) to retain all the payments made to them for their services (pursuant to the principle of quantum meruit/good faith), the officers' liability to return the disallowed amount must necessarily be extinguished. Applying the principle of 'net disallowed amount' as established in Madera v. Commission on Audit, the officers cannot be held accountable for the refund, as this would result in the unjust enrichment of the government.","FOR THESE REASONS, the Petition for Certiorari is PARTLY GRANTED. Decision No. 2020-263 dated January 31, 2020 of the Commission on Audit Proper is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION in that the approving and certifying officers need not refund the disallowed amount. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 239313, February 15, 2022","CESAR M. CALINGASAN,* PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","Calingasan was charged under an Information, the accusatory portion of which reads: 'That sometime in 2004 up to the present[,] in Quezon City, Philippines, the said accused, being the husband of [AAA], did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously commit an act of economic abuse against said complainant and their child [BBB], fifteen (15) years old, a minor, by then and there, abandoning them, leaving them with no material and financial support legally due them, thereby causing mental and emotional anguish, public ridicule or humiliation to said offended parties to their damage and prejudice. Contrary to law.' On November 27, 1995, Calingasan and private complainant got married. They had a son, BBB. Due to frequent quarrels, Calingasan left the conjugal home in October 1998 with the promise that he would support BBB financially, as he was then earning US$939.00 per month as a seaman. Despite this promise, he failed to give any support. Private complainant learned he migrated to Canada, where he started a business. From 1998, private complainant solely supported herself and BBB, working as a seafarer, paying all expenses including approximately P500,000.00 in school fees alone. Sometime in 2010, private complainant got sick and could no longer work as a seafarer, depleting her savings. She contacted Calingasan via email demanding P160,000.00 per year as support, but Calingasan claimed his business in Canada went bankrupt and he was not in a position to help. Calingasan interposed the defense of denial, claiming that upon leaving home in 1998 and until 2005, he supported his family through remittances. He asserted that in 2009, he was convicted of sexual assault in British Columbia, Canada, leading to incarceration and loss of employment. After release in 2010, he had difficulty finding jobs, forcing him to depend on his family for support, thus explaining his inability to send money. He is a resident and citizen of Canada. He returned to the Philippines in 2011 for his father's wake, where the instant case was filed, and a hold departure order was issued. His brother, Danilo, testified that he offered postdated checks for P7,500.00 per month for the withdrawal of the complaint, but private complainant demanded a lump sum of P1,400,000.00 instead, or that Danilo buy her Bataan condominium unit for P300,000.00 in exchange for dropping the case.","The Regional Trial Court (RTC) found Calingasan guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Violation of Section 5(i) of R.A. 9262 and sentenced him to an indeterminate penalty of Two (2) years, Four (4) months and One (1) day of prision correccional, as minimum, to Six (6) years and One (1) day of prision mayor, as maximum, and ordered him to pay a fine of P100,000.00 plus costs, and undergo mandatory psychological counseling. The trial court gave full credence to the private complainant's claim that Calingasan left the conjugal home and was remiss in giving financial support. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the RTC Decision but modified the penalty, sentencing Calingasan to suffer imprisonment of two (2) years, four (4) months and one (1) day of prision correccional, as minimum, to nine (9) years and four (4) month of prision mayor, as maximum. The CA held that Calingasan's withholding of financial support constitutes an act of psychological violence and that his defense of good faith was immaterial in violation of R.A. 9262, a special law.","The Court grants the Petition and acquits Calingasan of the crime charged. The Supreme Court applied the doctrine established in Acharon v. People (G.R. No. 224946, November 9, 2021), which clarified that the failure or inability to provide financial support per se is not a criminal act punishable under Section 5(i) of R.A. 9262. Section 5(i) penalizes the act of inflicting psychological violence by willfully or consciously denying financial support, meaning the act must be dolo in nature (intentional). The elements required are: (1) The offended party is a woman and/or her child; (2) The relationship exists; (3) The offender willfully refuses to give or consciously denies financial support; and (4) The offender denied the support for the purpose of causing mental or emotional anguish. The Court found that the prosecution failed to prove the third and fourth elements. Calingasan presented unrebutted evidence that his subsequent failure to provide support was due to circumstances beyond his control, specifically his incarceration in Canada for almost six (6) years starting in 2009, and his subsequent difficulty in finding a permanent job. These facts belie the accusation that he deliberately or willfully refused support for the purpose of causing mental or emotional anguish. Furthermore, the Court reiterated that conviction under Section 5(e) (deprivation of support for the purpose of control or restriction) is not applicable under the variance doctrine, as Section 5(e) and Section 5(i) penalize two distinct crimes requiring specific intent which was not proven in this case.","WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Petition is hereby GRANTED. The Decision dated December 15, 2017 and Resolution dated May 10, 2018 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 39417 are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Accordingly, petitioner Cesar M. Calingasan is hereby ACQUITTED of the crime charged for failure of the prosecution to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt."
"G.R. No. 254697, February 14, 2022","TRAVELOKA PHILIPPINES, INC. AND YADY GUITANA, PETITIONERS, VS. PONCEVIC CAPINO CEBALLOS, JR., RESPONDENT.","Sometime in September 2016, respondent was employed as country manager by Traveloka, the local branch of a multi-national travel corporation headquartered in Indonesia. As head of the company's Philippine operations, respondent was tasked by Traveloka to lead the company's growth and development, meet financial targets, and ensure optimal employee synergy, engagement, and training. In the performance of his duties, respondent directly reported to petitioner Yady Guitana (Guitana), the head of Traveloka's mother company. Respondent alleged that on October 18, 2017, and despite Traveloka's supposed impressive financial performance, Guitana informed him of complaints lodged by several company officers and employees against him for his purported poor management style. According to respondent, Guitana immediately relieved him of his duties and authority without giving him a chance to explain his side, despite his protestations. Respondent was consequently placed on indefinite floating status and further told that there would be no possibility of his continued employment in the company relative to its Philippine operations. Guitana nonetheless mentioned that he will exert his best efforts to look for an alternative but unguaranteed position for respondent in Indonesia. Soon after, however, an Indonesian national, Isabella Yonathan (Yonathan) was appointed to immediately fill respondent's former position. In the succeeding weeks, respondent continued to report for work. Several informal meetings were conducted, wherein respondent was allegedly pressured by Guitana to sign a quitclaim in exchange for a generous separation package and recommendation letter, which he did not accept. On November 4, 2017, respondent was summoned for a meeting at Traveloka's office, wherein he was served with a Notice to Explain and Order of Preventive Suspension detailing the charges against him. Respondent was also unceremoniously made to return his identification card, office laptop, and other company paraphernalia by Guitana in full view of his subordinates. Claiming that he was already dismissed, respondent no longer responded to the written notice against him. On November 24, 2017, Traveloka issued a Notice of Decision informing respondent of the termination of his employment effective immediately. Later, on December 19, 2017, respondent instituted a complaint for illegal dismissal against Traveloka and Guitana (collectively, petitioners), claiming that he was constructively dismissed, and thus, prayed for reinstatement and the payment of backwages, moral and exemplary damages, and attorney's fees. For their part, petitioners denied that respondent was constructively dismissed and on the contrary, claimed that he was validly terminated on just grounds of serious misconduct and loss of trust and confidence. In particular, petitioners alleged that respondent: ( a ) humiliated his colleagues on several occasions; ( b ) was unwilling to receive constructive feedback; ( c ) insisted on doing certain things his own way against company interest; and ( d ) failed to provide needed support to employees. In support thereof, petitioners submitted a total of four (4) affidavits purportedly executed by Traveloka employees, among which is the affidavit of Perry Dave Binuya (Binuya), Traveloka's Head of People Operations/Human Resources. However, Binuya eventually executed an Affidavit of Recantation, attesting to the fact that Traveloka merely forced him to sign a pre-drafted affidavit in order to ward off respondent's complaint. Meanwhile, respondent filed the following: ( a ) Motion for Production and Inspection of Electronic Files (motion for production), requesting access to his company-issued laptop and other electronic data in order to rebut the new allegations contained in Traveloka's Position Paper; and ( b ) Request for Issuance of Subpoena Ad Testificandum , etc. (request for subpoena), praying for the conduct of hearings on certain dates so that he may be able to cross-examine as adverse/hostile witnesses the Traveloka employees who executed affidavits against his claim. Notably, the LA never resolved the aforesaid motion and request for subpoena.","The Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 162588, reversed the Resolutions dated March 29, 2019 and June 28, 2019 of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) in NLRC NCR Case No. 12-18511-17/NLRC LAC No. 02-000923-19 affirming the Labor Arbiter's (LA) Decision dated October 18, 2018. The CA found that the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion when it ruled that there was no constructive dismissal and that there was a just cause for respondent's dismissal. As such, the CA reinstated respondent to his former position without loss of seniority rights and other privileges, and further ordered petitioners to solidarily pay respondent: ( a ) backwages from the time of his dismissal until reinstatement; ( b ) moral damages in the amount of P100,000.00; ( c ) exemplary damages in the amount of P100,000.00; and ( d ) attorney's fees equivalent to ten percent (10%) of the total award, with interest at the legal rate of six percent (6%) per annum on all of the foregoing amounts from finality of the decision until full payment.","The Court finds that the CA correctly ascribed grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC when it ruled that respondent was not constructively dismissed and that there was just cause to terminate his employment. The petitioners failed to prove the existence of just causes (serious misconduct and loss of trust and confidence) by substantial evidence, noting that the affidavits presented were self-serving and cast with doubt due to an Affidavit of Recantation and identical formatting. Furthermore, the acts of petitioners (relieving him of duties, hiring a replacement, demanding company paraphernalia return publicly) amounted to constructive dismissal. The labor tribunals also committed grave abuse of discretion by failing to address respondent's motion for production and request for subpoena, thereby violating his right to due process. However, the Supreme Court modified the CA ruling regarding the order of reinstatement because respondent's position was already filled, rendering reinstatement no longer viable. Separation pay in lieu of reinstatement is warranted.","WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED. The Decision dated June 29, 2020 and the Resolution dated November 25, 2020 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 162588 are hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION in that in lieu of reinstatement, petitioner Traveloka Philippines, Inc. is ordered to pay respondent Poncevic Capino Ceballos, Jr. separation pay equivalent to one (1) month salary for every year of service, with a fraction of at least six (6) months to be considered as one (1) whole year, to be computed from the date of his employment up to finality of this Resolution. The rest of the Court of Appeals' Decision STANDS."
"G.R. No. 222226, February 14, 2022","FE J. MORADA, PETITIONER, VS. RANDY RIAS, EX-O ROLLY CEBU, DESK OFFICER ROMY DONALDO, DESK OFFICER FERNANDO DOMINGO AND OTHER JOHN DOES OF BARANGAY 176, CALOOCAN CITY, RESPONDENTS.","Morada alleged that on October 14, 2015 at around 8:00 a.m., she received a text message from her daughter, Jennilyn J. Morada, that Johnson was arrested and detained by the barangay tanods of Barangay 176, Caloocan City for alleged theft of a mobile phone in the house of another barangay tanod, herein respondent Randy Rias (Randy). Morada went to the barangay hall at about 7:00 p.m. of October 14, 2015. At the barangay hall, respondent Rolly Cebu (Rolly) informed Morada that Johnson was already released by either respondent Fernando Domingo (Fernando) or respondent Romy Donaldo (Romy) from the custody of the barangay as evidenced by the entry in the barangay blotter, signed by Johnson himself. In December 2015, Morada went to the Northern Police District (NPD) to report that her son is missing. An investigation was conducted but the same was terminated in view of the lack of a witness to shed light on Johnson's disappearance and the insistence of the respondent barangay desk officers that Johnson was already released from their custody. In the meantime, rumors circulated within Barangay 176 that Johnson had been extrajudicially killed and that his body was mixed in cement in order to conceal the incident. This prompted Morada to institute a petition for the issuance of a writ of amparo to determine whether respondents had violated or threatened to violate Johnson's right to life, liberty and security, and to compel respondents to determine the whereabouts of Johnson, and the person/s responsible for his disappearance or possible death, among others. On January 25, 2016, Morada filed before the RTC a Petition for Issuance of Writ of Amparo, docketed as SP. PROC CASE NO. C-5159.","On January 26, 2016, the RTC rendered the assailed Order denying the petition. The RTC held that there was no showing of any refusal on the part of the respondents to acknowledge or to give information on Johnson's whereabouts such that there was no intention to remove him from the protection of the law for a prolonged period of time. Thus, the third and fourth elements of enforced disappearance are absent. The decretal portion of the RTC Order reads: Premises considered, the petition is hereby DENIED DUE COURSE and is accordingly DISMISSED. SO ORDERED.","The petition has no merit. No substantial evidence exists to prove Morada's claim. While it is admitted that Johnson was arrested for the alleged theft that he committed in the house of Randy, it was sufficiently established by the respondents that he was already released from their custody on October 14, 2015, as evidenced by the barangay blotter, signed by Johnson himself. In fact, Morada neither denied nor refuted the said document of release. Thus, it is clear that there was no refusal to give information on the whereabouts of Johnson. Accordingly, there was no intention to remove Johnson from the protection of the law for a prolonged period of time as he had been released already. Hence, We see no enforced or involuntary disappearance that would warrant the issuance of the writ of amparo. In the instant case, the Court agrees with the RTC that Morada failed to prove by substantial evidence her claim of enforced disappearance. Morada's petition is mainly anchored on the alleged rumor which circulated in their community that Johnson was killed and his dead body was mixed in cement. However, said allegation lacked corroborations. Morada's continued reliance on mere rumors and speculations, without presenting any clear and independent evidence showing that there was a threat to Johnson's life, liberty, and security, even prior to his arrest or that he was physically harmed by the respondents while in detention, does not amount to substantial evidence. Given the foregoing, there is no basis for the issuance of the writ of amparo.","WHEREFORE, the instant petition is hereby DENIED. The assailed Order dated January 26, 2016 of the Regional Trial Court of Caloocan City, Branch 123 is AFFIRMED. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 230861, February 14, 2022","ASIAN TRANSMISSION CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, RESPONDENT.","The crux of the present controversy lies in the validity of eight Waivers of the Defense of Prescription under the Statute of Limitations of the National Internal Revenue Code (Waivers) executed successively by ATC, through Roderick M. Tan, ATC Vice President for Personnel and Legal Affairs. Previously, on the strength of a Letter of Authority (LOA) dated August 9, 2004, the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) commenced its audit and investigation of ATC's books of account and other accounting records pertaining to taxable year 2002, including those in connection with the following documents filed by ATC: (a) Annual Information Return of Income Taxes Withheld on Compensation and Final Withholding Taxes filed on January 30, 2003; and (b) Annual Information Return of Creditable Income Taxed Withheld (Expanded)/Income Payments Exempt from Withholding Tax filed on March 3, 2003. Based on these filing dates, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue's (CIR) right to assess ATC for the relevant taxes was due to prescribe in the first quarter of 2006. However, the Waivers' execution extended until December 31, 2018: (a) the BIR's investigation period; and (b) the CIR's assessment period. Consequently, this allowed the CIR to serve a Formal Letter of Demand (FLD) on July 15, 2008 assessing ATC for deficiency withholding tax on compensation (WTC), expanded withholding tax (EWT), and final withholding tax (FWT). In its administrative protest, ATC raised only two main objections: first, the BIR violated ATC's right to due process when it failed to indicate in the Preliminary Assessment Notice (PAN) and accompanying details of discrepancies ""the surrounding circumstances supporting the assessment that will allow the taxpayer the opportunity to dispute the assessment;"" and second, the BIR's details of discrepancies in the FLD, which set out to compute the deficiency WTC, EWT, and FWT are erroneous and must be reconsidered. The CIR denied ATC's protest, and its subsequent request for reconsideration. Subsequently, the ATC proceeded to file a judicial protest before the CTA where it introduced the following arguments: first, the LOA became invalid due to lack of revalidation; and second, the first, second, and third Waivers were defective; thus, these did not validly extend the assessment period.","This resolves the Motion for Reconsideration of the Court Decision dated September 19, 2018 denying Asian Transmission Corporation's (ATC) Petition for Review on Certiorari thereby affirming the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) En Banc Decision dated August 9, 2016 in CTA EB No. 1289.","The Court denies the Motion for Reconsideration. ATC's proposition seeks to divest the CIR of its right to assess and collect deficiency taxes on account of alleged defects caused by the BIR that outnumber the one caused by ATC. The Court rejects this reasoning. If a waiver suffers from defects on account of both parties, the waiver's validity in relation to the timeliness of the CIR's subsequent issuance of a tax assessment is not determined by a mere plurality of the defects committed between the BIR and the taxpayer. A more circumspect appreciation of the relevant jurisprudence reveals that the taxpayer's contributory fault or negligence coupled with estoppels will render effective an otherwise flawed waiver, regardless of the physical number of mistakes attributable to a party. In other words, while a waiver may have been deficient in formalities, the taxpayer's belated action on questioning its validity tilts the scales in favor of the tax authorities. . . . That ATC acquiesced to the BIR's extended investigation and failed to assail the Waivers' validity at the earliest opportunity gives rise to estoppel. Moreover, ATC's belated attempt to cast doubt over the Waivers' validity could only be interpreted as a mere afterthought to resist possible tax liability. Verily, it has been held that the doctrine of estoppel, as a bar to the statute of limitations protecting a taxpayer from prolonged investigations, must be applied sparingly. However, the number of successive Waivers executed by ATC is telling. Certainly, no taxpayer may be allowed to execute haphazard waivers deliberately, go through the motions that the waivers are effective, and lead the tax authorities to believe that the assessment period has been extended, only to deny the validity thereof when it becomes unfavorable to him. Otherwise, it would create a dangerous situation – ""open to abuse by unscrupulous taxpayers who intend to escape their responsibility to pay taxes by mere expedient of hiding behind technicalities.""","WHEREFORE, the present Motion for Reconsideration is DENIED for lack of merit. The Court shall not entertain further pleadings or motions in the case. Let entry of judgment be issued. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 210928, February 14, 2022","REX G. RICO, PETITIONER, VS. UNION BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","Union Bank issued Rico a Union Bank Visa credit card. Rico filed a complaint for damages claiming Union Bank negligently handled his account by charging him for disputed items (like 'U-Protect Premium Plan' and 'Expedia Service Fees'), imposing late payment charges, and declining his transaction at Gourdo's Restaurant on November 20, 2005, which caused him embarrassment and humiliation. The dishonor occurred despite Union Bank eventually reversing the disputed charges. Union Bank asserted that Rico's credit card was declined because his account was in 'past due' status for failure to pay the minimum amount due of P500.00 on his SOA dated October 16, 2005. Rico had insisted on paying only P347.00, refusing to pay the minimum amount because it included a transaction for Tiger Airways airline tickets (P30,376.79) which he claimed to have cancelled, though the dispute was still pending resolution at the time of the dishonor.","The Regional Trial Court (RTC) ruled in favor of Rico, ordering Union Bank to pay P500,000.00 as moral damages, P200,000.00 as exemplary damages, P300,000.00 as attorney's fees, and costs of suit. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the RTC decision with modification, reducing the awards to: P30,000.00 as moral damages; P20,000.00 as exemplary damages; and P10,000.00 as attorney's fees.","The Supreme Court found the disapproval of Rico's credit card on November 20, 2005 as justified and done in good faith. The Court ruled that Union Bank neither breached its contract with Rico nor acted with willful intent to cause harm when it revoked Rico's credit card privileges when he failed to pay the minimum amount due on his SOA dated October 16, 2005, pending the final resolution of the disputed transactions related to the Tiger Airways airline tickets. The Court held that Rico's alleged humiliation or embarrassment fell under *damnum absque injuria* because the loss or harm was not the result of a violation of a legal duty by the bank, but rather Rico's own decision not to pay the minimum due while the dispute was ongoing. Consequently, the awards for moral damages, exemplary damages, and attorney's fees were deleted.","WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED. The June 28, 2013 Decision and January 21, 2014 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 96400 are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The complaint for damages filed by petitioner Rex G.

Conag (Conag) in 2011 against the vice mayor and the members of the sanguuniang bayan of Esperanza, Masbate (local government officials), for Gross Negligence, and violation of the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees.[8] The complaint was grounded on the local government officials' failure to respond to the request of a certain organization for an ordinance establishing a marine reserve and fish sanctuary in Masbate.[9] Jonathan G. Monterde and Roy C. Conag (petitioners) are among the members of the sanguuniang bayan impleaded in the complaint.[10] In its February 22, 2013 Decision[11] (assailed Decision), the Ombudsman found merit in the complaint and held that the local government officials were indeed remiss in their duties.[12] The Ombudsman thus imposed upon them the penalty of suspension for six months, viz.: WHEREFORE, premises considered, we find that there is substantial evidence that respondents REBEKAH O. YAP, JOSEPHINE P. GUIZ, LILIA B. ESPENILLA, FRANQUILINO B. BONDESTO, ERNIE L. ANTIPOLO, JONATHAN G. MONTERDE, ALDRIN B. JAO, ROY C. CONAG, NICOLAS B. BAGUIO, MODESTO P. LISTONES JR. AND ESTELA H.

In case the respondents are already retired from government service or if the principal penalty cannot be enforced for any reason, the alternative penalty of FINE equivalent to SIX (6) MONTHS SALARY is hereby imposed upon them which shall be paid to this Office. x x x Aggrieved, the local government officials, including petitioners, filed two separate motions for reconsideration, arguing in common that the assailed Decision has no basis in fact and law, and that the suspension was too harsh a penalty.[14] The Ombudsman partially granted the motions in its May 1, 2013 Order, and reduced the penalty to a fine equivalent to three-months' salary.[15] In the meantime, petitioners were re-elected during the May 13, 2013 elections.[16] x x x Thereafter, the local government officials filed a Motion to Stay Execution[20] of the Ombudsman's assailed Decision as modified by its May 1, 2013 Order (modified assailed Decision), grounded, among others, on the application of the condonation doctrine.[21] Acting on such motion, the Ombudsman rendered its March 24, 2014 Order[22] (second assailed Order), holding that the condonation doctrine does not apply in petitioners' case because the decision that found them guilty of the offense had already become executory even before their re-election.[23] Thus, it denied the motion, viz.: WHEREFORE, respondents' Motion to Stay Execution dated 17 March 2014 is hereby DENIED. SO ORDERED.[24] Undeterred, petitioners filed the instant petition,[25] arguing that the assailed Decision and the assailed Orders should be nullified for being rendered with grave abuse of discretion.[26] Petitioners insist that they can no longer be administratively disciplined following their re-election.[27]",The petition should be dismissed.,"It is well-settled that appeals from the decisions of the Ombudsman in administrative disciplinary cases should be taken to the Court of Appeals under the provisions of Rule 43.[36] As held by the Court in Fabian v. Desierto:[37] x x x appeals from decisions of the Office of the Ombudsman in administrative disciplinary cases should be taken to the Court of Appeals under the provisions of Rule 43.

Finality and Execution of Decision. — Where the respondent is absolved of the charge, and in case of conviction where the penalty imposed is public censure or reprimand, suspension of not more than one month, or a fine equivalent to one month salary, the decision shall be final, executory and unappealable. In all other cases, the decision may be appealed to the Court of Appeals on a verified petition for review under the requirements and conditions set forth in Rule 43 of the Rules of Court, within fifteen (15) days from receipt of the written Notice of the Decision or Order denying the Motion for Reconsideration. (Emphasis supplied) x x x In view thereof, and insofar as it seeks to nullify the assailed Decision and the first assailed Order which are both final issuances, the instant petition should be dismissed. As to the second assailed Order, which is an interlocutory order, even though the special civil action of certiorari may be the proper remedy, petitioners still violated the hierarchy of courts when they filed the petition directly to this Court without citing any exception to the rule.[43] Thus, the petition deserves to be dismissed on this ground. Besides, even if we consider petitioners' arguments on the merits, the Court still finds no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Ombudsman when it refused to implement the modified assailed Decision. Significantly, decisions of the Ombudsman in administrative disciplinary cases are required to be executed as a matter of course, viz.: Section 7. Finality and execution of decision. — x x x x A decision of the Office of the Ombudsman in administrative cases shall be executed as a matter of course. The Office of the Ombudsman shall ensure that the decision shall be strictly enforced and properly implemented. x x x Hence, the Ombudsman cannot be considered to have acted with grave abuse of discretion in denying petitioners' motion to stay execution. It was merely doing its duty as required by law. Accordingly, insofar as it assails the second assailed Order, the petition ought to be dismissed. In fine, the petition should be set aside because petitioners availed the wrong remedy and violated the rule on hierarchy of courts, and further because decisions of the Ombudsman in administrative disciplinary cases are required to be executed as a matter of course.","WHEREFORE, this Court resolves to DISMISS the petition.

GILBERT ALEGRE Y NAZARAL, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","On February 7, 2014, an Information[4] for Murder was filed against Alegre, the accusatory portion of which reads: That on or about December 1, 2013, in Valenzuela City and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named, without any justifiable cause, with deliberate intent to kill and acting with treachery, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously shoot with a gun one Ronald Pascua y Raza (victim), hitting the latter's head and neck, thereby inflicting upon the latter serious physical injuries which caused his death. CONTRARY TO LAW.[5] Upon his arraignment on March 21, 2014, Alegre pleaded ""not guilty"" to the crime charged.[6] After the termination of the preliminary conference[7] and pre-trial,[8] trial on the merits subsequently ensued. Version of the Prosecution: On December 1, 2013, at around 7:00 p.m., security guards John Monito Tagle (Tagle), Ronald Pascua y Raza (Pascua), and Isidro Magpusao (Magpusao), were on duty at Century Glass Center located in Valenzuela City. At that time, they had just finished eating and Pascua was washing dishes.[9] A few moments later Tagle heard a knock on the gate. He opened the gate and saw Alegre, who was also a security guard thereat. Tagle asked Alegre what he was doing there and the latter replied that he just dropped by to ask how they were and to know if he could already report for duty. Tagle informed Alegre to report to the operations manager and he subsequently let him in.[10] Alegre then told Tagle that Pascua had been saying bad things about him. Tagle cautioned him to keep quiet as Pascua was just washing dishes inside. However, Pascua overheard their conversation and asked Alegre about what he was saying. Alegre then started cursing at Pascua and told him that he lost his job because of him. A heated exchange ensued between the two. Tagle tried to pacify and stop the squabble by leading Alegre out of the premises. However, Alegre continued to shout and curse at Pascua, who did not back down and also shouted expletives against Alegre.[11] Afterwards, Alegre motioned to his waist area and drew his .38 caliber gun. Pascua then told Alegre, ""wag mo akong daanin sa ganyan,"" but Alegre still pulled the trigger and shot him on the neck.[12] When Pascua dropped to the ground, Alegre approached him, almost kneeled on top of him, and proceeded to shoot him on the head.[13] Tagle then wrestled the gun away from Alegre, and he and Magpusao closed the gate to prevent Alegre from leaving but he was able to escape through another exit. Nevertheless, Tagle was able to chase after him and Alegre was brought to the police precinct thereafter.[14] Pascua instantly died from the shooting and was later taken to Candido Funeral Homes. The autopsy conducted by medico-legal officer Police Chief Inspector Jocelyn Cruz confirmed that he died due to the gunshot wounds on the head and neck.[15] By reason of his death, Pascua's family allegedly incurred expenses totaling the amount of P86,900.00.[16] Version of the Defense: For his part, Alegre averred that on the day of the incident, he went to Century Glass Center to retrieve his things. At the premises, he saw Pascua, who started shouting and cursing at him. Alegre asked him what he wanted, but Pascua continued to hurl invectives at him. Alegre got fed up and brought out his gun. Pascua then told him not to resort to such, but Alegre already lost his patience and shot Pascua. Shocked at the sight of Pascua falling to the ground, Alegre ran out and boarded a ""kuliglig"" to leave the place.[17]","This appeal[1] seeks to reverse and set aside the January 30, 2020 Decision[2] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 12447, which affirmed the November 13, 2018 Decision[3] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Valenzuela City, Branch 75, in Criminal Case No. 179-V-14 finding accused-appellant Gilbert Alegre y Nazaral (Alegre) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder. ... On January 30, 2020, the CA promulgated its Decision denying Alegre's appeal. Similar to the RTC, the CA found that the prosecution sufficiently proved all the elements of Murder, including the qualifying circumstance of treachery. It likewise held that the same was adequately alleged in the Information, and noted that this issue was only brought up for the first time on appeal; thus, it became too late for Alegre to raise such an objection pursuant to Section 9, Rule 117 of the Rules of Court.","After a judicious review of the records of the case, the Court holds that the conviction of Alegre for Murder cannot be upheld. He is properly liable only for Homicide. ... Based on the attendant facts, Alegre's acts were more of a result of a sudden impulse or a spur of the moment decision due to his previous heated altercation with the victim, rather than a planned and deliberate action. There is no showing that he consciously employed a particular mode of attack in order to facilitate the killing without any risk to himself. It appears that Alegre shot Pascua because he got fed up and was carried away by the anger arising from his confrontation with the deceased. Further, it bears noting that Alegre shot Pascua in their workplace and in the presence of Tagle and Magpusao. If Alegre deliberately intended that no risk would come to him, he could have chosen another time and place to attack Pascua to ensure success in committing the crime. The records are also bereft of any indication that Alegre went to Century Glass Center knowing that Pascua would actually be there. Moreover, it is clear that Pascua was aware of Alegre's hostility against him and that there was a possibility of an impending atttack. Given the circumstances, the Court finds that treachery was wanting in this case. In the absence thereof, Alegre can only be convicted of Homicide, not Murder.","WHEREFORE, the appeal is GRANTED IN PART. The Court DECLARES accused-appellant Gilbert Alegre y Nazaral GUILTY of HOMICIDE, for which he is SENTENCED to suffer the indeterminate penalty of eight (8) years and one (1) day of prision mayor, as minimum, to fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months, and one (1) day of reclusion temporal, as maximum. He is further ordered to PAY the heirs of Ronald Pascua y Raza the amounts of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity, P50,000.00 as moral damages, P50,000.00 as exemplary damages, and P59,712.25 as actual damages. All monetary awards shall earn interest at the legal rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the date of finality of this Decision until fully paid. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 256878, February 14, 2022","RODELIO R. ONIA, PETITIONER, VS. LEONIS NAVIGATION COMPANY, INC., WORLD MARITIME CO. LTD.,* CAPT. HERNANI P. FEUSCA, FELIX ANDRADA, RICARDO NOLLEDO, RYO MATSUNAGA, TAKASHI UTO, VALERIANO R. DEL ROSARIO, MARY JEAN MADRENERO, AND JENNIFER E. CERRADA, RESPONDENTS.","Respondent World Maritime Co. Ltd. (World Maritime) is the foreign principal of respondent Leonis Navigation Company, Inc. (LNCI), a domestic corporation engaged in the business of recruiting and deploying Filipino seafarers for ocean-going vessels. The other respondents in this case are members of LNCI's board of directors and corporate officers, namely: Captain Hernani P. Feusca, Felix Andrada, Ricardo Nolledo, Ryo Matsunaga, Takashi Uto, Valeriano R. Del Rosario, Mary Jean Madrenero, and Jennifer E. Cerrada (respondents).[5] It was averred that World Maritime, through LNCI, engaged the services of petitioner as an oiler onboard the vessel MV Navios Koyo for a period of nine (9) months commencing on February 13, 2014.[6] As such, the latter's duties principally entailed the maintenance and operation of ship engine parts as well as lubricant filtering and purifying equipment. On August 18, 2015, prior to his deployment, petitioner underwent a pre-employment medical examination (PEME) conducted by LNCI's company-accredited physician, Dr. Peter O. Dator (Dr. Dator), who found petitioner ""fit for sea duty.""[7] However, despite the said finding, Dr. Dator nonetheless prescribed maintenance medicines to petitioner for his hypertensive cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus.[8] Subsequently, petitioner boarded the MV Navios Koyo on November 2, 2015.[9] On May 20, 2016, while the vessel was en route from China to Colombia, petitioner suddenly felt dizzy and his vision became blurred. His condition then grew worse as the right side of his body became numb and his speech became slurred. Petitioner was immediately treated on board and was found to be exhibiting symptoms of a stroke.[10] On May 24, 2016, petitioner was given further medical attention as he was confined for two (2) weeks at a hospital in Brazil. On June 13, 2016, he was medically repatriated and, upon arriving in the Philippines, confined at the Manila Doctors Hospital on June 17, 2016.[11] After undergoing several laboratory tests, he was diagnosed with ""Cerebrovascular infarct, Left Pons, Hypertensive Cardiovascular Disease and Diabetes Mellitus.""[12] On June 22, 2016, petitioner was discharged but was advised to return for follow-up checkups.[13] However, when petitioner went to Marine Medical Services — respondents' company-accredited medical provider — for his checkup, he was informed that his medication will not be shouldered by LNCI and that any further medical expenses that he will incur by reason of his illness shall be shouldered by him. Petitioner then made requests from LNCI for medical assistance, which went unheeded. Dismayed, petitioner went to Dagupan City without undergoing further medical checkups. When petitioner consulted his personal physicians, Dr. Petrarch B. Bravo (Dr. Bravo) and Dr. Carlos L. Chua (Dr. Chua), both advised him to undergo 2D Echo and various chemical laboratory analyses. Based on the results of the tests, Drs. Bravo and Chua declared petitioner to be permanently and totally disabled. This prompted petitioner to file a complaint for payment of total disability benefits, damages, and attorney's fees before the NLRC against respondents.[14] For their part, respondents maintained that petitioner is not entitled to disability benefits because: (a) he knowingly concealed and failed to disclose during his PEME that he had a heart condition and diabetes mellitus; (b) petitioner's illness was not work-related;[15] and (c) the medical certificates issued by petitioner's doctors, Drs. Bravo and Chua, did not include a discussion as to the factors which triggered petitioner's illness and its relation to his work.[16]","the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 154448, which affirmed the Decision[4] dated September 29, 2017 of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) in NLRC NCR Case No. (M) 02-01694-17, dismissing the claim of petitioner Rodelio R. Onia (petitioner) for total and permanent disability benefits and damages.","The petition is meritorious. At the onset, the Court finds that concealment cannot be appreciated against petitioner; hence, he cannot be deemed barred from claiming disability benefits. Under Section 20 (E) of the 2010 Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) – Standard Employment Contract (2010 POEA-SEC), ""[a] seafarer who knowingly conceals a pre-existing illness or condition in the Pre-Employment Medical Examination (PEME) shall be liable for misrepresentation and shall be disqualified from any compensation and benefits."" In this case, it clearly appears that petitioner's alleged pre-existing illnesses, i.e., hypertension and diabetes mellitus, are conditions which are easily discoverable during his PEME; thus, they cannot be deemed pre-existing within the contemplation of Section 20 (E) of the 2010 POEA-SEC. Having established that petitioner is not disqualified from recovering disability benefits, the Court now proceeds to discuss the propriety of such claim, particularly as to the existence of the twin-requirements of work-relatedness and compensability. Under Section 20 (A) of the 2010 POEA-SEC, the employer is liable for disability benefits when the seafarer suffers from a work-related injury or illness during the term of his contract. It should be stressed that petitioner's diagnosed illnesses of ""Cerebrovascular infarct, Left Pons, Hypertensive Cardiovascular Disease and Diabetes Mellitus"" are presumed to be work-related, since these are listed under Section 32-A (Occupational Diseases) of the 2010 POEA-SEC. Clearly, a linkage between petitioner's illnesses and work exists in this case. In this case, it appears that the lower tribunals glossed over the fact that no final and definite assessment was made within the prescribed periods, thereby rendering petitioner's disability as total and permanent by operation of law. Records disclose that petitioner was medically repatriated on June 13, 2016... However, the medical report by the company-designated physician, while issued within the prescribed period, failed to contain any statement – much less an assessment – on the degree of petitioner's disability. Hence, the same cannot be considered as a final and definite disability assessment. As per prevailing jurisprudence, such omission renders petitioner's disability as total and permanent by force of law. In fine, the Court finds that the NLRC's ruling is tainted with grave abuse of discretion and hence, should have been reversed by the CA through certiorari. Accordingly, the CA's ruling must be reversed and set aside. Petitioner is entitled to the payment of total and permanent disability benefits in the sum of US$60,000.00... Meanwhile, anent petitioner's claim for moral and exemplary damages, it appears from the records that these were not supported by any proof of bad faith or malice on respondents' part and hence, must be denied. With regard to his claim of attorney's fees, however, the Court finds that petitioner is entitled to attorney's fees in the amount equivalent to ten percent (10%) of the total award, or its Peso equivalent at the time of payment, in line with prevailing jurisprudence.","WHEREFORE, the petition is PARTLY GRANTED. The Decision dated September 30, 2020 and the Resolution dated June 11, 2021 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 154448 are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Accordingly, the Decision dated June 30, 2017 of the Labor Arbiter in NLRC NCR Case No. (M) 02-01694-17 awarding petitioner Rodelio R. Onia the amount of US$60,000.00 representing his total and permanent disability benefits and ten percent (10%) attorney's fees is hereby REINSTATED WITH MODIFICATION, deleting the awards of moral and exemplary damages and imposing on said monetary awards interest at the legal rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the finality of this Decision until full payment.

"G.R. No. 248492, February 14, 2022","THELMA DUMPIT-MURILLO, PETITIONER, VS. CAREER EXECUTIVE SERVICE BOARD, REPRESENTED BY MARIA ANTHONETTE VELASCO-ALLONES AND/OR ARTURO M. LACHICA, RESPONDENT.","The case stemmed from the Complaint dated December 17, 2013 filed by the Career Executive Service Board (CESB) for Dishonesty and Falsification of a Public Document against Dumpit-Murillo before the OMB. In the Complaint, the CESB alleged that Dumpit-Murillo was a candidate for Career Executive Service (CES) eligibility. Although Dumpit-Murillo successfully passed the first three stages of the process, the CESB still recommended the denial of her CES eligibility upon discovering her alleged false representations in her CES Personal Data Sheet (PDS). Dumpit-Murillo made the following entries in her CES PDS: LEVEL OF EDUCATION: POST GRADUATE, SCHOOL: NATIONAL DEFENSE COLLEGE OF THE PHILIPPINES, COURSE (MAJOR): MASTERS IN NATIONAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION, INCLUSIVE DATES OF ATTENDANCE: 2000-2001, HONORS RECEIVED: DEAN'S LISTER. To verify the entries, the CESB requested a certification from the NDCP President, who stated in a Letter dated December 2, 2013, that General Order No. 06 dated July 17, 2001 conferred upon Dumpit-Murillo the Master in National Security Administration (MNSA) degree, but this was conditioned upon her submission of a final copy of her thesis in hardbound format which she failed to do, leading NDCP to refuse certification of her as a bona fide alumna. In her Counter-Affidavit, Dumpit-Murillo alleged she was denied due process and asserted that she did not declare in her PDS that she was a 'graduate' but only stated the inclusive dates of her attendance. She insisted she could not be held liable for Dishonesty and Falsification of a Public Document in view of the unconditional General Order that conferred upon her the MNSA degree, and noted that the Report of Grades/Academic Requirements shows she obtained a grade of 'Passed' in her thesis subject and was a consistent Dean's Lister.","On June 18, 2015, the OMB rendered its Decision finding Thelma Dumpit-Murillo guilty of Dishonesty and Falsification of a Public Document and imposing upon her the penalty of DISMISSAL FROM THE SERVICE. The OMB held that Dumpit-Murillo knew she would not be a full-fledged graduate of NDCP's MNSA program until her submission of the final copy of her thesis. Upon appeal, the Court of Appeals, in a Decision dated February 7, 2019, affirmed the OMB Decision and Order, finding no violation of due process and ruling that Dumpit-Murillo had indeed knowingly made false representations that she was an MNSA graduate of NDCP.","The Court holds that Dumpit-Murillo was not deprived of due process when she was not given the opportunity to explain her side prior to the CESB's approval of Resolution No. 1128 and its subsequent filing of the administrative complaint against her before the OMB. However, the Court does not find Dumpit-Murillo guilty of Dishonesty and Falsification of a Public Document but instead holds her administratively liable for Simple Negligence. The Court found that the General Order plainly, unequivocally, and categorically conferred upon her the MNSA degree without condition, and she could safely rely on this public document. Nevertheless, the Court found Dumpit-Murillo guilty of Simple Negligence for her failure to pay attention to the details and proper form of her CES PDS, which resulted in the imprecision and inaccuracy of the information she divulged therein, specifically by leaving the column titled 'Highest Year Completed [/] Units Degree Earned' blank despite her full knowledge of her failure to submit a final, hardbound copy of her thesis to NDCP.","WHEREFORE, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is PARTLY GRANTED. The assailed Decision dated February 7, 2019 and Resolution dated July 12, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 144145 are SET ASIDE. Petitioner Thelma Dumpit-Murillo is found GUILTY of Simple Negligence and is meted out the penalty of suspension from office without pay for one (1) month and one (1) day. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 206404, February 14, 2022","CONCEPCION CHUA GAW, PETITIONER, VS. SUY BEN CHUA AND FELISA CHUA, RESPONDENTS.","Subjects of contention in this case are the following pieces of real property located in Hagonoy, Bulacan: (1) A 2,319-square-meter parcel of land, hereinafter referred to as Lot No. 5370-A; (2) A 61-square-meter parcel of land, hereinafter referred to as Lot No. 5662; and (3) A 379-square-meter parcel of land, hereinafter referred to as Lot No. 5663. On November 22, 1969, Pedro S. Santos, Nestorio S. Santos, Herminia Santos Salamat, Roman S. Santos, and Gloria Santos Valera (the Santoses) executed a deed of absolute sale over the aforementioned three lots in favor of Lu Pieng for the consideration of P19,000.00. Lu Pieng rented these lots to spouses Chua Chin and Chan Chi for their lumber business. Chua Chin and Chan Chi were Chinese nationals... On November 26, 1976, Lu Pieng sold the three lots to Lucio... On July 18, 1980, Lucio sold the three lots to Juanita... On November 27, 1980, Juanita was issued Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-263881 under her name for Lot Nos. 5662 and 5663. On July 28, 1988, Juanita donated Lot No. 5370-A to Ben. Juanita also subsequently sold Lots Nos. 5662 and 5663 to Ben on September 20, 1989... On May 25, 1998, TCT No. T-263881 under Juanita's name was cancelled and TCT No. T-112477 was issued under Ben's name covering Lot Nos. 5662 and 5663. On June 16, 1995, Ben filed an application for the registration and confirmation of land titles in his name, docketed as Land Registration Case (LRC) Case No. 25-M-95. On October 25, 1996, Concepcion, joined by her spouse, Antonio Gaw, filed a complaint for reconveyance of her undivided share in real property held in trust and for damages against Ben and his spouse and co-respondent herein, Felisa Chua (Felisa), docketed as Civil Case No. 804-M-96. Concepcion posited that Ben cannot assert sole ownership over the same as their parents, Chua Chin and Chan Chi, had actually purchased Lot Nos. 5662 and 5663 with the understanding that the buyer or transferee shall only hold legal and beneficial ownership in trust for the legal heirs of Chua Chin and Chan Chi. Concepcion re-asserted the plaintiffs' position that, upon their family lawyer's advice, Lu Pieng only acted as the trustee and tagapag-ingat of the three subject lots and was to transfer the same to the heirs of Chua Chin and Chan Chi when they become Filipino citizens.","The RTC denied Ben's application for registration and confirmation of land titles in his name and granted Concepcion's complaint for reconveyance and damages. The RTC expressly ruled in its April 28, 2008 Decision: 'WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered as follows: (a) With respect to LRC Case No. 25-M-95, the application for registration of title over Lot No. 5370-A filed by applicant Suy Ben Chua is DENIED; and (b) With respect to Civil Case No. 804-M-96, plaintiff Concepcion Chua Gaw is hereby declared entitled to her undivided share in Lot No. 5370-A, Lot No. 5662 and Lot No. 5663; and, applicant-defendant Suy Ben Chua is hereby ordered to deliver the said undivided share to plaintiff Concepcion Chua Gaw.' Ben appealed to the CA. The CA modified the dispositions of the RTC. While affirming the RTC's denial of Ben's application for registration and confirmation of land titles, the CA dismissed Concepcion's complaint for reconveyance and damages. The CA so declared in its assailed August 17, 2012 Decision: 'WHEREFORE, in the light of the foregoing discussions, the appeal is PARTLY GRANTED. Accordingly, the Decision dated April 28, 2008 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 83, Malolos, Bulacan as regards Land Registration Case No. 25-M-95 is AFFIRMED while the Complaint in Civil Case No. 804-M-96 is DISMISSED.'","We affirm the appellate court. Implied resulting trust not an exception to the Constitutional ban against ownership of Philippine lands by a non-Filipino. The 1987 Constitution is clear on the right of Filipinos to own lands in the Philippines to the exclusion of foreigners: 'Save in cases of hereditary succession, no private lands shall be transferred or conveyed except to individuals, corporations, or associations qualified to acquire or hold lands of the public domain.' The primary purpose of the Constitutional provision is the conservation of the national patrimony in the hands of Filipino citizens. Not even an ownership in trust is allowed. Moreover, there is no implied trust if the enforcement of the trust would be against law or public policy. Concepcion's testimony established that the intent behind the trust was to circumvent the Constitutional prohibition against foreign ownership of Philippine lands, making the objective unlawful. The implied trust being insisted on by Concepcion cannot have any legal effect as Chua Chin, due to his alienage, was incapacitated to own real property. Furthermore, Concepcion's evidence did not prove the existence of an implied trust as required, failing to show actual payment of consideration and failing to overcome the presumption of regularity of the notarized deeds of sale.","WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED. The assailed August 17, 2012 Decision and the March 20, 2013 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 94669 are hereby AFFIRMED."
"G.R. No. 249195, February 14, 2022","ROMMEL S. ALENAJE,* PETITIONER, VS. C.F. SHARP CREW MANAGEMENT, INC., REEDEREI CLAUS-PETER OFFEN (GMBH & CO.) AND ROBERTO B. DAVANTES, RESPONDENTS.","On July 15, 2015, Rommel S. Alenaje (petitioner) filed with the Labor Arbiter (LA) a Complaint [6] for illegal dismissal, payment of the unexpired portion of his contract, damages, and attorney's fees. In his Position Paper, [7] he contended the following: He had worked as a seaman for 18 years already. On April 13, 2015, he entered into a Contract of Employment [8] with Reederei Claus-Peter Offen (GMBH & Co.) KG (respondent foreign principal), through its local agent, C.F. Sharp Crew Management, Inc. (respondent local manning agency) represented by Roberto B. Davantes (collectively, respondents), as a steward on board the vessel M/V CPO New York for a period of six months with a basic monthly salary of US$644.00, among others. [9] On April 14, 2015, he boarded M/V CPO New York that then left Manila. He was surprised to learn that he was the only steward assigned in the vessel considering its size and number of crew. There was also no mess man assigned to the crew. Thus, he worked as a steward for the officers and, at the same time, as a mess man for the crew. He would work until 1:00 a.m. and wake up at 6:00 a.m., or just five hours later, to arrange the food in the provision room. [10] On the morning of April 17, 2015, while he was preoccupied with arranging the scattered food in the provision room, Chief Mate Lukasz Leszek Kucharz (Chief Mate Kuchan) instructed him to strip and wax the navigational bridge floor from 10:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. While the assigned task was not part of his duties and responsibilities as a steward, he politely told Chief Mate Kuchan that, if possible, he would clean the navigational area in the afternoon because anytime before 11:00 a.m., he would start to prepare and serve the food to the officers, the crew, and the additional ten persons who were repairing the vessel. Chief Mate Kucharz, however, accused him of insubordination; he threatened him that he would work out for his dismissal. [11] The next day, April 18, 2015, petitioner received a Show Cause Notice [12] with the charge of insubordination. A hearing was conducted on the same day. He explained that in his years of service as a steward, there was not an instance that he was asked to strip and wax the navigational bridge floor. He stated that he did not refuse outright Chief Mate Kucharz's request but merely asked if he could do the task anytime in the afternoon and not during the time when he would be preparing and serving food to the vessel officers and crew. [13] On that same day, he received a Notice of Formal Warning [14] that if his future behavior would not be compliant with the code of conduct, he would be dismissed from the vessel. [15] After the hearing, Chief Mate Kucharz continued telling him that he would be dismissed from his employment. He felt harassed and singled out by Chief Mate Kucharz: it added to the tension and pressure brought about by the April 17 incident. [16] As a result, he was constrained to tender his resignation on April 21, 2015, [17] which was accepted on the same date through an email [18] from Jan Wehner, the Senior Personnel Officer of respondent foreign principal. On May 20, 2015, a Notice of Dismissal [19] was issued to him. He was subsequently repatriated and was paid his salary equivalent to one month and eight days. [20] In their Position Paper, [21] respondents alleged the following: Petitioner disobeyed the lawful order of the Captain, through Chief Mate Kucharz, to clean the navigational bridge floor. He was disrespectful in his refusal to follow such order; thus he was given a warning of insubordination on April 18, 2015 which was entered in the vessel's logbook. [22] Despite the warning, he still refused to follow the lawful order of his superior so that a disciplinary action was taken against him. In the Notice of Hearing, respondents informed him that a hearing for insubordination will be conducted in the master's office where he may bring with him his statement, documents, and witnesses for his defense. [23] In the Minutes of Hearing, [24] the following were stated: (1) that petitioner admitted having disregarded the order for him to strip and wax the navigational bridge floor as it was not his duty to do so; (2) that he demanded repatriation; and (3) that he aggressively raised his voice during the proceedings. Respondents dismissed him effective May 21, 2015, [25] but he refused to receive the Notice of Dismissal. [26] Petitioner disembarked the vessel by virtue of the termination of his contract due to valid grounds provided under Section 33 (insubordination) of the Standard Terms and Conditions Governing the Overseas Employment of Filipino Seafarers On-Board Ocean-going Ships (POEA Standard Contract). [27] After his repatriation, on May 22, 2015, he went to the office of respondent local manning agency where he accomplished a Debriefing Report. [28] In the report, he stated ""resign"" as the reason for his sign-off and did not give negative remarks on any of the questions in the Report regarding any problem on board the ship. [29] On June 26, 2015, respondents filed with the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) a Complaint [30] for disciplinary action for insubordination against petitioner, but the latter failed to appear during the hearing. However, respondents were surprised to receive an Order from the LA declaring them to have waived their right to file a position paper in the illegal dismissal case filed by petitioner against them for failure to appear during the scheduled mandatory conciliation conference. Respondents filed their motion for reconsideration with the LA; the latter granted it and allowed them to file their position paper. [31] Respondents subsequently filed a Reply. [32]","Ruling of the LA: On November 24, 2015, the LA issued a Decision, [33] the dispositive portion of which reads: WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered: 1. FINDING that the complainant was constructively dismissed. 2. HOLDING respondents C.F. Sharp Crew Management, Inc. and Roberto B. Davantes solidarily liable to the complainant and ORDERING them to pay complainant Rommel S. Alenaje the amount of Php 192,458.22, comprising the payment of the unexpired portion of his employment contract, moral and exemplary damages in the amount of P30,000.00 and ten percent (10%) attorney's fees. [...] Ruling of the NLRC: In the Decision [38] dated January 29, 2016, the NLRC reversed the LA's Decision, the dispositive portion of which reads: WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Decision of the Labor Arbiter is hereby REVERSED AND SET ASIDE. Complainant Rommel Alenaje's claims of his salaries and benefits for the unexpired portion of his contract with respondents C.F. Sharp Crew Management, Inc., Roberto B. Davantes and Reederei Claus-Peter Offen (GMBH & Co.), moral and exemplary damages as well as attorney's fees are denied for lack of basis and merit. [39] The NLRC found that petitioner tendered his resignation on April 21, 2015 which was accepted on the same day by respondent foreign principal. Thus, NLRC declared that it was him who pre-terminated his contract with respondents. [...] Ruling of the CA: On March 28, 2018, the CA issued its assailed Decision, [46] the dispositive portion of which states: WHEREFORE, the Petition is DISMISSED. The Decision and Resolution of the National Labor Relations Commission in NLRC Case No. OFW VAC-01-000007-2016, dated January 29, 2016 and May 20, 2016, respectively, are AFFIRMED. [47] The CA ruled that the NLRC did not commit grave abuse of discretion in issuing its decision as it was duly supported by substantial evidence. It declared that if indeed petitioner was badly treated at his work, he should have indicated it in the Debriefing Report he filled up upon his repatriation;","The Court finds no merit in the petition. At the outset, the Court deems it proper to dispose of the procedural issues raised by respondents in their Comment. [52] Respondents assert that the decision of the NLRC had already attained finality because petitioner's motion for reconsideration of the decision was filed beyond the reglementary period. [53] The Court is not persuaded. [...] We defer to the exercise of discretion by the NLRC and uphold its judgment in applying a liberal construction of its procedural and technical rules to this case in order to ventilate and resolve the issues raised by respondent in the motion for reconsideration and fully resolve the case on the merits. [...] It appears that the CA had exercised its discretion when it did not only rule on the technical issue but also the merits of the motion for reconsideration. [58] The Court now addresses the merits of the case. Petitioner tendered his resignation on April 21, 2015, and it was accepted on the same day through an email from respondents' Senior Personnel Officer, Jan Wehner: We accept your resignation and guarantee repatriation from the next convenient port. Your decision is either to stay in the cabin off duty until repatriation or to work according to Head of Department/Masters orders. Your wages will be paid until arrival in your home country. [59] As petitioner admittedly resigned, it is incumbent upon him to prove that his resignation was involuntary and that it was actually a case of constructive dismissal with clear, positive, and convincing evidence. [60] [...] After a careful review of the evidence presented and applying the foregoing principles as a guide, the Court finds that the CA committed no reversible error in upholding the findings of the NLRC that there was voluntary resignation on the part of petitioner. The Court finds that petitioner failed to prove his allegations of constructive dismissal with clear and positive evidence. In his letter of resignation dated April 21, 2015, petitioner wrote: In as much as you forced me to work not in accordance with my duties and responsibilities under my contract of employment and due to unbearable working condition/and or atmosphere and in consideration of my safety, I am tendering my resignation effective today (April 21, 2015). Hence, I am requesting my repatriation to my home country. [65] It had been established that petitioner was instructed by Chief Mate Kucharz, on behalf of the captain, to strip and wax the navigational bridge floor. [66] However, petitioner alleged that such job was not part of his work as a steward. Notably, Section 1(B)(3) of the POEA Standard Contract provides that the seafarer has the duty to be obedient to the lawful commands of the master or any person who shall lawfully succeed him and to comply with company policy including the safety policy and procedures and any instructions given him in connection therewith. The order to strip and wax the navigational bridge floor was a lawful command of Chief Mate Kucharz, on behalf of the captain, and it concerned the safety policy in the ship; [67] thus petitioner had the duty to follow such order. In fact, respondents had attached the Affidavits [68] of three seafarers who had worked on-board international container ships as stewards for years where they all stated that stripping and waxing or cleaning of navigational bridge floor was an occasional duty which may be assigned to them by the chief officer on behalf of the master and that such work was not unlawful nor beyond their duties as steward. Therefore, the assigned task may also be done occasionally by a steward, if the need arises, as instructed by the Master or the Chief Officer. Petitioner, however, tendered his resignation because he did not want to do the waxing or cleaning of navigational bridge floor as ordered by Chief Mate Kucharz, citing that it was not part of his duty. Moreover, the fact that petitioner did not want to do the assigned task was also proved by the Minutes of Hearing [69] held on April 18, 2015, to wit: Mr. Alenaje admitted that he had disregarded the order about stripping and waxing of navigational bridge floor. He claimed that it is not his duty and would not do it. Mr. Alenaje demanded repatriation. We must add that manner of expression of Mr. Alenaje was unacceptable he was raising voice in aggressive way. [70] ( sic ) Petitioner's claim that he politely asked Chief Mate Kucharz if he could do the stripping and waxing of the navigational bridge in the afternoon but not between 10:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. as ordered because he would be preparing the food by 11:00 a.m. was not supported by the evidence on record. Such defense appeared only as an afterthought because petitioner never stated it in his resignation letter nor was it mentioned in the Minutes of Hearing. Also, if indeed petitioner had politely told Chief Mate Kucharz that he would do the assigned task in the afternoon, and had actually done it, there would be no entry of the verbal warning of insubordination in the vessel's logbook; [71] and there would be no need for a hearing regarding the incident and no formal warning would be issued to him. The fact that he did not do the assigned task proved that he did not want to do it believing that it was not part of his duty as a steward. Petitioner's allegation of unbearable working conditions/atmosphere because Chief Mate Kucharz kept on telling him that he will be dismissed and that he was maltreated and insulted were all self-serving due to lack of evidentiary support. In fact, his claim was contradicted by the Debriefing Report [72] dated May 22, 2015 which he himself filled up in respondents' local manning office after his repatriation. [...] Petitioner's allegation of fear for his safety which made him tender his resignation was also not substantiated. The Court agrees with the CA when it adopted the NLRC's findings that petitioner was on-board the vessel for more than a month after he submitted his resignation and before he was repatriated without any untoward incident. [74] Based on the foregoing discussions, the Court finds no need to pass upon the second issue raised in this petition.","WHEREFORE, the petition for review is DENIED. The Decision dated March 28, 2018 and the Resolution dated August 29, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 10288 are hereby AFFIRMED. SO ORDERED."

NUEVA, NORMA C. LUPAS, MERCY B. GALABIN, LUZVIMINDA DIAPOLET, CLARA RAMIREZ, AND ELVIE ARCEBAR, ACCUSED-APPELLANTS.","The Antecedents: Accused-appellants were charged before the MTCC with violation of Article 91(B)(3) of PD 1067 in Criminal Case No. 7621 in an Information that reads: That on or about July 13, 2009, in the City of Panabo, Davao del Norte, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, being members of the White Sand Bentol Fishermen Cooperative, conspiring, confederating and mutually helping each other, without securing the necessary permit required by law, willfully, unlawfully and knowingly occupied, built and constructed building structures in the foreshore area located at Brgy. San Pedro, Panabo City. CONTRARY TO LAW. [7] Upon arraignment, accused-appellants pleaded not guilty to the crime charged. [8] During the pre-trial, the parties stipulated on the following: 1. The prosecution admitted that not one of the complainant[s] is officially employed with the National Water Resources Council; 2. The defense, on the other hand, admitted the following: a. That all the accused have their residence[s] outside the coastal area where their (illegal) structures are found; b. That all the accused claim that they are members of what they call Whitesand Bentol Cooperative; c. That Whitesand Bentol Cooperative is represented by a certain Zosimo Lasco; d. That the Whitesand Bentol Cooperative represented by Zosimo Lasco has filed a Foreshore Lease Application (FLA) received by the CENRO on June 10, 2005; e. That the FLA was signed by Zosimo Lasco in representation of the aforesaid cooperative of which all the accused herein are members; and f. That a Certification issued by the CENRO states that there is no approval of the FLA in favor of the cooperative. [9] Thereafter, trial on the merits ensued. Version of the Prosecution: The evidence for the prosecution presented the following version of events: Accused-appellants are members of the White Sand Bentol Fishermen Cooperative (WSBFC). [10] Sometime in January 2009, accused-appellants entered and occupied the foreshore area of Barangay San Pedro, Panabo City, Davao del Norte. They constructed sheds, cottages, and other structures, and operated sari-sari stores without WSBFC's foreshore lease application having been approved by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), or the necessary business permit issued by the Licensing Section of Panabo City, Davao del Norte. [11] On July 13, 2009, prosecution witnesses Oliver Q. Oriol and Mario R. Paña discovered accused-appellants' illegal occupation of the subject foreshore area, construction of various structures, and operation of sari-sari stores. [12] The Panabo City Government interposed an objection to WSBFC's foreshore lease application and subsequently sent individual notices to accused­-appellants to vacate the subject foreshore area which they ignored. [13] Accused­-appellants likewise disregarded the notices posted by the Community Environment and Natural Resources Office – DENR (CENRO-DENR) informing the public that no foreshore lease application was approved in favor of any person or group in the subject area, and that a pending lease application filed by any person or group does not authorize them to occupy and possess the area. [14] Consequently, on May 22, 2013, the Building Official of the Office of the City Engineer, Panabo City issued a Certification stating that no one among the accused-appellants had been issued a building permit. [15] Version of the Defense: The defense presented the following version of events: Accused-appellants admitted that they are members of the WSBFC and occupied the foreshore area prior to July 13, 2009. On June 10, 2005, WSBFC, headed by Zosimo Lasco (Lasco), filed a foreshore lease application with the CENRO-DENR Region XI-2B, Panabo City over an area of 93,497 square meters (sqm) for the establishment of a beach resort. [16] As per DENR-LMS, Region XI, Davao City, the subject area was classified as ""foreshore"". [17] They further alleged that the Municipality of Panabo, Davao del Norte, through its Sanggunian , passed Resolution No. 299, Series of 2000 dated May 14, 2000 confirming Resolution No. 46, Series of 2000 of the Sangguniang Barangay of San Pedro, Municipality of Panabo, declaring the white sand area as a beach resort. [18] They insisted that they did not know that they needed to secure a permit to set up stores and conduct business activities in the subject area. They alleged that no one from the government informed them of the need to secure a permit. They, however, acknowledged the need to apply for a foreshore lease with the DENR. However, they contended that their occupation and economic activities are lawful pending their foreshore lease application. [19] Furthermore, they claimed that the MTCC, Panabo City authorized their continued possession of the subject area as per the injunctive relief issued on November 8, 2009 and the December 4, 2009 Decision in Special Civil Case (SCC) No. 30-08, an action for forcible entry filed by accused-appellants against Manuel W. Tan (Tan) and other defendants, which ultimately restored accused-appellants to their possession of the subject foreshore area. [20]","After due consideration, we resolve to affirm accused-appellants' conviction of violating Article 91(B)(3) of PD 1067 or unauthorized occupancy of foreshore area without the necessary permit. At the outset, the Court notes that accused-appellants availed of the wrong mode of appeal by filing a mere notice of appeal, the proper remedy being a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45. ... On this alone, accused-appellants' employment of improper mode of appeal warrants the dismissal of the case.","After due consideration, we resolve to affirm accused-appellants' conviction of violating Article 91(B)(3) of PD 1067 or unauthorized occupancy of foreshore area without the necessary permit. At the outset, the Court notes that accused-appellants availed of the wrong mode of appeal by filing a mere notice of appeal, the proper remedy being a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45. Section 1, Rule 45 of the Rules of Court provides that: Section 1. Filing of petition with Supreme Court . — A party desiring to appeal by certiorari from a judgment, final order or resolution of the Court of Appeals, the Sandiganbayan, the Court of Tax Appeals , the Regional Trial Court or other courts, whenever authorized by law, may file with the Supreme Court a verified petition for review on certiorari . The petition may include an application for a writ of preliminary injunction or other provisional remedies and shall raise only questions of law, which must be distinctly set forth. The petitioner may seek the same provisional remedies by verified motion filed in the same action or proceeding at any time during its pendency. Section 2. Time for filing; extension . — The petition shall be filed within fifteen (15) days from notice of the judgment or final order or resolution appealed from, or of the denial of the petitioner's motion for new trial or reconsideration filed in due time after notice of the judgment. On motion duly filed and served, with full payment of the docket and other lawful fees and the deposit for costs before the expiration of the reglementary period, the Supreme Court may for justifiable reasons grant an extension of thirty (30) days only within which to file the petition. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied) In addition, Sections 3 and 6 of Rule 56 explicitly states that: SEC 3. Mode of appeal . – An appeal to the Supreme Court, may be taken only by a petition for review on certiorari , except in criminal cases where the penalty imposed is death, reclusion perpetua or life imprisonment. x x x x SEC. 6. Disposition of improper appeal . – Except as provided in Section 3, Rule 122 regarding appeals in criminal cases where the penalty imposed is death, reclusion perpetua or life imprisonment, an appeal taken to the Supreme Court by notice of appeal shall be dismissed . (Emphasis and underscoring supplied) Accused-appellants received the CA's November 21, 2018 Decision and June 17, 2019 Resolution on December 14, 2018 and July 1, 2019, respectively. Hence, they have 15 days from receipt on July 1, 2019 within which to file a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 to assail the CA's November 21, 2019 Decision and June 17, 2019 Resolution. However, instead of availing of the proper remedy under Rule 45, accused-appellants merely filed an ordinary appeal. On this alone, accused-appellants' employment of improper mode of appeal warrants the dismissal of the case. The implication of such improper appeal is that the notice of appeal did not toll the reglementary period [37] for the filing of a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 which is the proper remedy in the instant case. ... Even granting that accused-appellants availed of the proper remedy, we see no error in the CA's November 21, 2019 Decision and June 17, 2019 Resolution affirming accused-appellants' conviction for violating Article 91(B)(3) of PD 1067 which provides, thus: ARTICLE 91. A. A fine of not exceeding Three Thousand Pesos (P3,000.00) or imprisonment for not more than three (3) years, or both such fine and imprisonment, in the discretion of the Court, shall be imposed upon any person who commits any of the following acts: x x x x B. A fine exceeding Three Thousand Pesos (P3,000.00) but not more than Six Thousand Pesos (P6,000.00) or imprisonment exceeding three (3) years but not more than six (6) years, or both such fine and imprisonment in the discretion of the Court, shall be imposed on any person who commits any of the following acts: x x x x 3. Unauthorized obstruction of a river or waterway, or occupancy of a river bank or seashore without permission . Admittedly, accused-appellants constructed and occupied various structures on the subject area, which is classified as a foreshore land, without the necessary permit. It is immaterial that the Information adverted to ""foreshore"" instead of ""seashore"" in charging them of violating Article 91(B)(3) of PD 1067. This inadvertence does not warrant their acquittal. As correctly held by the courts a quo , the term seashore encompasses foreshore lands. ... What PD 1067 penalizes is the unauthorized occupancy of the ""seashore"" which necessarily includes the ""foreshore"". Hence, although the Information charged accused-appellants of building and constructing structures on ""foreshore area"" instead of ""seashore"" without securing the necessary permit, accused-appellants cannot deny the fact that they committed a violation of Article 91(B)(3) of PD 1067. In fact, they admitted that they had a pending foreshore lease application with the DENR which means that at the time of their unauthorized occupancy, they knew that they needed to secure a permit before they could build and construct various structures on the subject foreshore area. Also, although an act prohibited by a special law does not automatically make it malum prohibitum , the act of unauthorized occupancy of seashore without the necessary permit punished under Article 91(B)(3) of PD 1067 is considered malum prohibitum . The test to determine when the act is mala in se and not malum prohibitum is whether it is inherently immoral or the vileness of the penalized act. [40] The mere occupancy and construction of various structures by accused-appellants on the subject foreshore land without the necessary permit is not inherently immoral but constitutes a violation of and penalized by Article 91(B)(3) of PD 1067. Hence, as malum prohibitum , accused-appellants' pending foreshore lease application over the subject area with the DENR is not a defense to exculpate them of the criminal charge. Even the restoration of their possession of the subject foreshore area against the alleged rightful owners thereof in the forcible entry case filed before the MTCC in SCC No. 30-08 is not a valid defense to their occupancy of the foreshore land without the necessary permit. To reiterate, accused-­appellants admitted that they occupied and constructed various structures on the foreshore land without the necessary permit, and during the pendency of their foreshore lease application with the DENR. Intent is immaterial. Hence, despite their good intention, the pendency of their foreshore lease application, or the restoration of their possession in a forcible entry case, the offense is already committed which warrants the application and implementation of PD 1067. Furthermore, Article 93 of PD 1067 explicitly states that ""all actions or offenses punishable under Article 91 of this Code shall be brought before the proper court."" Thus, there is no merit in accused-appellants' contention that the prosecution violated the principle of exhaustion of administrative remedies...","WHEREFORE , the appeal is DISMISSED . The November 21, 2018 Decision and June 17, 2019 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 01622-MIN are hereby AFFIRMED . SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 254021, February 14, 2022","PHILIPPINE BANK OF COMMUNICATIONS, PETITIONER, VS. PHILIPPINE BANK OF COMMUNICATIONS EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION (PBCOMEA), RESPONDENT.","The Multi-Purpose Loan Program In the 1980s, Philippine Bank of Communications (petitioner) adopted a policy granting multi-purpose loan benefits to its qualified employees. The program allowed employees to avail themselves of several loans simultaneously, subject to the debt service ratio (i.e., the overall debt servicing for all types of loans should not exceed 35% of the employee's net pay). It also allowed employees who would avail themselves of loans to pledge or utilize their mid-year and year-end bonuses, regardless of whether their monthly salary could still accommodate the loan amortizations without upsetting the allowable debt service ratio. In 2003, the loan policy and its corresponding benefits were incorporated in the parties' collective bargaining agreement (CBA). Nonetheless, in 2007, the enjoyment of the benefits was disturbed when the new management took over and crafted a new loan policy. Accordingly, the grant of loans through pledges or deductions from the mid-year or year-end bonuses became discretionary on petitioner's part. Consequently, the Philippine Bank of Communications Employees Association (respondent) opposed the new policy such that petitioner suspended its implementation. In 2014, a new group of investors took over the management of petitioner and redefined the multi-purpose loan program. Under the latest loan policy, employees can no longer avail themselves of additional loan using their mid-year and year-end bonuses as pledges in case the amortization can still be accommodated by their take-home pay. Respondent again protested, but unlike the previous management which deferred the implementation pending the settlement of the controversy, the new management unilaterally enforced the latest multi-purpose loan program. The Service Award Policy Moreover, petitioner had the policy of recognizing the long service of its employees by giving out service awards on its anniversary, or every September 4 of each year. The service award policy took effect on January 1, 1998 and was given to employees who completed 10 years of service and continued to serve every five years thereafter. It covered even those who retired under petitioner's mandatory retirement policy but completed the required number of years in service. Resigned employees were given the same arrangement as the retired employees. However, on September 18, 2015, under its new management, petitioner modified the service award policy in that an employee must be ""on board as of release date or September 4 of each year"" to be entitled to it. Consequently, at least three employees were unable to receive the service award as they were no longer ""on board"" as of the release date, namely: John Conrad Clavio, Ronald Buenavista, and Marcus Brian Belo. Respondent asked for the recall of the policies on loan and service award but to no avail. Hence, the matter was brought under voluntary arbitration. For its part, petitioner countered that it did not violate the CBA and that it validly exercised its management prerogative when it disallowed the pledge of bonuses as payment of the employees' loans and amended the service award policy.","The petition is DENIED. The Court sustains the decision of the CA to affirm the ruling of the OVA that the requirement for employees to be ""on board"" on the date of the release of the service award is void.","The Court's Ruling The petition is denied. It is settled that the Court is not a trier of facts and only questions of law should be raised in a petition for review on certiorari. At the same time, it is beyond dispute that in labor law, the CBA is the norm of conduct or the law between the parties. When the terms of a CBA are clear and there is no doubt as to the parties' intention, the literal meaning of its stipulations shall prevail, as in the present case. x x x By the Service Award Policy dated January 1, 1998 above, the award shall cover incumbent employees, as well as retired and resigned employees, and petitioner may modify the policy in the exercise of its management prerogative. Subsequently, the service award policy was incorporated in the CBA. This time, the participation of both petitioner and respondent is necessary in revising the terms and conditions for the service award. Specifically, Section 2, Article XII of the CBA provides for the review of petitioner, as the management, and respondent, as the employees' union, in determining and granting the service award: x x x The wordings of the CBA are clear and unequivocal. Petitioner could revise the service award policy only with the knowledge and participation of respondent. x x x It follows that petitioner cannot unilaterally alter its terms without consulting respondent. Thus, when petitioner decided to require that only those who are ""on board"" at the time of awarding can be granted the service award, without consulting respondent with the change in policy, petitioner violated the CBA which is not allowed by the law. The right of petitioner to ascertain who among its employees are entitled to a service award is not totally eliminated but it is limited by the express provision of the CBA. Verily, considering that the CBA is the law between the parties, petitioner is obliged to comply with its provisions. Stated differently, where the CBA is clear and unambiguous, it becomes the law between the parties and compliance with it is mandated by the express policy of the law. At the same time, the act of petitioner of modifying the terms and conditions of the grant of service award amounted to a diminution of benefits. Such is the case because petitioner unilaterally withdrew a benefit enjoyed by the employees and founded on a company policy; thus, petitioner's act must be corrected.","WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED. The Decision dated October 18, 2019 and the Resolution dated September 17, 2020 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 155585 are AFFIRMED. SO ORDERED."

Specifically, the Project covered the establishment of the Jaro Floodway that aimed to address the serious flooding in Iloilo City, create a more suitable urban community, and provide a safer and more pleasant living condition for the people concerned. [11] In its Order [12] dated January 24, 2007, the RTC issued a Writ of Possession after the Republic deposited P188,313,599.55 representing the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) zonal valuation of the subject properties and the provisional value of the improvements affected by the expropriation. [13] Subsequently, the RTC constituted a Board of Commissioners (BOC) for the determination of just compensation of the subject properties. It was composed of the following: Engineer Jerry A. Rapista, Officer-in-Charge, Division Chief of the Appraisal Division, Iloilo Provincial Assessor's Office; Jose Monis (Monis), Certified Public Accountant and Auditor at Sycip, Gorres, Velayo and Co., Metro Manila; and Atty. Mateo Hachuela, RTC Branch Clerk of Court and Court-Appointed Commissioner. [14] Later, Atty. Aristeo Cruz substituted Monis due to the latter's untimely demise. [15] On May 9, 2007, the BOC, along with the representatives from the Office of the Solicitor General, respondents' attorney-in-fact, DPWH Assistant Project Manager, Engineer Al Fruto and his team, conducted an ocular inspection on the subject properties. [16] On August 29, 2007, the BOC submitted their Commissioners' Report [17] recommending the amount of P1,920,374,374.00 [18] as just compensation. [19] The Republic filed a Manifestation and Motion [20] praying that it be allowed to present additional evidence. The RTC granted the motion on October 12, 2007 stating that it generously granted the motion even if the Republic earlier failed to submit additional exhibits and position paper, despite the additional period of time granted for it to do so. [21] Subsequently, the parties presented their respective resource persons at the reopened proceedings of the BOC. [22] On April 19, 2011, the BOC submitted its revised Report [23] but nonetheless recommended the payment of the same amount (P1,920,374,374.00) indicated in its Report dated August 29, 2007. In the revised Report, the BOC highlighted the following matters: First, Pacific Rehouse Corporation (PRC) and Philippine Estate Corporation (PEC), which were real estate developers, purchased the subject properties for their residential, commercial or industrial development as they formed part of the Jaro Grand Estates. Moreover, it “is common practice in the field of realty business that [the] development of a certain area as residential, commercial, or industrial is done phase by phase, as testified to by an experienced realtor and appraiser in the person of Herbert Buot.” [24] Second, to ascertain the just compensation and the consequential damages that PRC and PEC were entitled to receive, the BOC conducted hearings, summoned expert witnesses, held several interviews and deliberations on the fair market value guided by the provisions of Republic Act No. (RA) 8974 [25] and the Rules of Court. [26] The BOC, thus, stated: x x x In several interviews conducted, the commission found out that the commercial lots in a nearby subdivision, Metropolis, has a price pegged at Php5,600.00 per square meter. The lots along the Jaro-Leganes Highway cost Php8,000.00 per square meter. Further interviews conducted with several realty brokers/agents would reveal that the price of the lots at Smallville, along B. Aquino Ave[n]ue, Mandurriao, Iloilo City, is Php20,000.00 per square meter and its fishpond areas (undeveloped) has a selling price of Php8,000.00. With this information, the commission deems it best to reduce the [claim] of the defendants x x x and adopt the selling price of Metropolis in the amount of Php5,600.00. Considering that the selling price per square of the lots of Chateaux Geneva is Php4,500.00 as supported by the documents of sale between the defendants and their lot-buyers, the commission grants the same to defendants. [27] Third, the subject properties were very accessible and situated in between two major highways – the Jaro-Leganes Highway and the Coastal Road. Public transportation regularly plied in the area and was available on a 24-hour basis. The properties were also near religious, educational, and commercial centers; their physical and technical description proved that the highest and best uses of the properties were residential and commercial. The topography of the properties further showed that they were within an accessible distance from commercial, trading, educational, medical center, and other city services. [28] Fourth, the Project would cause consequential damages to the existing improvements affected and/or damaged by the Project. It would cut the Jaro Grand Estates into two halves and traverse a major road which provided the Jaro Grand Estates direct access to the Jaro-Leganes Highway and the Coastal Road causing consequential damages on the following properties: [29] Area (sq.m) Value/sq.m Amount Dinagyang Plaza & Commercial (Phase 6) 3,278 Php 5,600.00 Php 18,356,800.00 Central Commercial Development (Phase 9-A) 7,597 Php 5,600.00 Php 42,453,976.00 High-end Residential (Phase 10) 408 Php 5,600.00 Php 2,284,800.00 Chateaux Geneva (affected) 12,321 Php 4,500.00 Php 55,444,500.00 Chateaux Geneva (traversed) 7,566 Php 4,500.00 Php 34,047,000.00 Total 31,170 Php 152,676,300.00 [30] The Republic objected to the amount of just compensation. It maintained that the BIR zonal value of P1,800.00 per square meter was the true and correct compensation for the subject properties. [31] For their part, respondents PRC and PEC, which were sister companies engaged in land acquisition and development, [32] insisted that the amount of P2,598,661,687.00 was the just compensation due them. [33] Meanwhile, the RTC declared that Alathea H. Sinense and Florentino Diana already sold their properties affected by the Project to PRC and PEC and that they no longer filed an answer to the complaint. [34]","On November 13, 2012, the RTC rendered a Decision [35] adopting the findings of the BOC, the dispositive portion of the Decision reads: Wherefore, above premises considered, the court accepts the Commissioner[s]' Report and Judgment is hereby rendered in accordance therewith directing the plaintiff Republic of the Philippines to pay the amount of PHP 1,920,374,373.00 as just compensation to defendants Pacific Rehouse Corp. and Philippine Estate Corp[.]. On May 22, 2013, the RTC denied [38] the motions for reconsideration but, nevertheless, modified the Decision of November 13, 2012 by deleting therefrom the payment of value-added tax. On December 18, 2017, the CA affirmed [39] the RTC Decision with modification in that interest at the rate of 12% per annum was imposed on the amount of just compensation from the time of the taking of the subject properties until June 30, 2013 and thereafter, the legal interest of 6% per annum from July 1, 2013 until full payment.","Primarily, the Republic contends that the just compensation for the subject properties should only be fixed at P1,800.00 per square meter. It asserts that the RTC and the CA failed to consider the relevant factors for the determination of just compensation. It further argues that the RTC and the CA adopted the BOC's Report on the sole ground that it was allegedly founded on testimonies of experts in the realty business. In fine, it posits that the BOC's Report is purely speculative and based on unsubstantiated evidence and is contrary to law and jurisprudence. [46] Such contentions are without merit. The issues pertaining to the just compensation for the expropriated properties involve factual matters which are beyond the scope of a petition under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. The Court is not a trier of facts and only questions of law may be raised in a petition for review on certiorari. In the absence of allegations and proof that this case falls within the exception to such rule, the view of the Republic that the just compensation should only be pegged at P1,800.00 per square meter is untenable. Further, given the uniform factual findings of the RTC and the CA, we accord respect and consider them binding upon the Court especially so in the absence of showing that the RTC and CA erred in adopting the BOC's recommended just compensation. [47] Even if the petition is deemed as a proper recourse, the Court still finds no reason to overturn the CA decision affirming the RTC ruling with the only modification as to the rate of interest to be imposed on the just compensation. Here the CA properly sustained the RTC ruling adopting the recommendation of the BOC. Such is the case as the BOC's Report is pursuant to the relevant factors set forth under Section 5 of RA 8974 as follows: (a) The classification and use for which the property is suited; (b) The developmental costs for improving the land; (c) The value declared by the owners; (d) The current selling price of similar lands in the vicinity; (e) The reasonable disturbance compensation for the removal and/or demolition of certain improvement on the land and for the value of improvements thereon; (f) [The] size, shape or location, tax declaration and zonal valuation of the land; (g) The price of the land as manifested in the ocular findings, oral as well as documentary evidence presented; and (h) Such facts and events as to enable the affected property owners to have sufficient funds to acquire similarly-situated lands of approximate areas as those required from them by the government, and thereby rehabilitate themselves as early as possible. It cannot, thus, be denied that the adoption by the RTC and the CA of the BOC's recommendation was not arbitrary but is supported by evidence and upon consideration of relevant factors for the determination of just compensation. Furthermore, contrary to the view of the Republic, the zonal valuation of the properties subject of expropriation is but just one of the several factors to be considered in determining just compensation. Indeed, ""zonal valuation, although one of the indices of the fair market value of real estate, cannot, by itself, be the sole basis of just compensation in expropriation cases."" [53] Overall, the petition failed to show any sufficient reason for the Court to reverse the ruling of the CA which affirmed the amount of just compensation arrived at by the RTC.","WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED. The Decision dated December 18, 2017 and the Resolution dated July 23, 2018 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CEB CV No. 05070 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION in that an interest at the rate of 6% per annum shall be imposed on the total amount due from the finality of the Decision until full payment. Accordingly, the Court finds in order the just compensation for the subject properties in the total amount of P1,920,374,374.00 with legal interest at the rate of 12% per annum from the taking of the properties until June 30, 2013, and 6% per annum from July 1, 2013 until the finality of the Decision. As above stated, the total amount due shall also earn legal interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the finality of the Decision until full payment. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 214435, February 14, 2022","PROFESSIONAL REGULATION COMMISSION, PETITIONER, VS. DAYAMON DIDATO ALO, RESPONDENT.","On July 5, 2011, respondent Dayamon Didato Alo (Alo) was formally charged with unprofessional conduct and/or dishonorable conduct before the Board for Professional Teachers (Board), which operates under petitioner Professional Regulation Commission (PRC), for using fraud or deceit in obtaining a certificate of registration and professional license, allegedly committed as follows: You used a falsified Board Resolution No. 671 dated September 28, 2000 when you registered as a professional teacher on September 14, 2007. The original Board Resolution No. 671 dated September 28, 2000 does not contain your name as among those who will be registered as professional teachers without examination either in the elementary level or in the secondary level. [4] For her defense, Alo alleged in her counter-affidavit [5] that she is a holder of a degree in Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education and had been a public elementary school teacher in Kalanganan Elementary School from 1995 to 2006 before she secured her certificate of registration and professional license. [6] She is currently a public school teacher in Tambo Cadayonan Elementary School, Pantar District, Pantar, Lanao del Norte. [7] Sometime in September 2007, Alo allegedly went to the PRC Head Office in Manila to apply for a Professional Teacher's License based on Section 26 (C) of Republic Act No. (RA) 7836. [8] RA 7836, under certain conditions, grants a certificate of registration and professional license to qualified applicants without need for examination. [9] Alo, who was not a passer of the board examination for professional teachers, claimed that she knew of some professional teachers who were granted permanent appointments under the said law and believed that she was qualified to be extended the same privilege since she has been teaching in the public school from 1995 to 2006. [10] She averred that when she went to the PRC, she was given forms to fill out and was made to pay various fees. [11] A few days later, she was issued a professional identification card, followed by a certificate of good standing and a certificate of membership in the National Organization of Professional Teachers, Inc. [12] Alo maintained that there was no iota of proof that she used the alleged falsified Board Resolution No. 671 in obtaining her certificate of registration and professional license. [13] She claimed that she never knew of the existence of such board resolution, and that it was the first time she heard about it. [14] Also, she never attached the said board resolution to her application for registration, and noted that the accusation against her belittled the efficiency of the PRC personnel, wondering how the latter could have been easily defrauded into issuing a professional license based on an alleged falsified board resolution when they could have easily checked or verified with their own record or office the authenticity of the said document. [15] Moreover, Alo argued that she already enjoyed security of tenure pursuant to Section 5 of RA 4670, [16] otherwise known as ""The Magna Carta for Public School Teachers,"" which provided that ""teachers appointed on a provisional status for lack of necessary civil service eligibility shall be extended permanent appointment for the position he is holding after having rendered at least ten years of continuous, efficient and faithful service in such position."" [17] In her position paper, [18] which Alo filed in lieu of her personal appearance during the trial, she bolstered her allegations in her counter-affidavit. [19] She stressed that she never submitted the alleged falsified Board Resolution No. 671 and even tasked the special prosecutor to present in evidence the said falsified document; if she actually submitted a falsified board resolution, the prosecution needed only to request from the PRC all the papers and documents she submitted before it when she applied for her license and certificate of registration. [20] Alo also pointed out that there was no need for her to present the alleged Board Resolution No. 671 since she applied for her license and certificate of registration on the strength of Section 26 (C) of RA 7836. [21] On September 11, 2012, the Board rendered a Decision [22] against Alo, the dispositive portion of which states: WHEREFORE, premises considered, this Board hereby declares the respondent, DAYAMON DIDATO ALO, GUILTY as charged and accordingly REVOKES her certificate of registration and license as professional teacher. Respondent is hereby ordered to surrender to this Board her Certificate of Registration and Professional Identification Card as Professional Teacher within fifteen (15) days upon finality of this decision and to desist from the practice of the teaching profession under the pain of criminal prosecution. [23] Dissatisfied, Alo filed a motion for reconsideration [24] which the Board denied. [25] Without elevating the case to the PRC, Alo directly filed a petition for review [26] with the CA under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court. [27] On September 3, 2013, the CA issued a Minute Resolution [28] requiring the Board and the PRC, which was impleaded in the petition, to file their comment on Alo's petition for review. [29] However, since the Board and the PRC failed to file their comment within the reglementary period, the CA deemed that they waived the filing of their comment and submitted the instant case for decision without comment. [30] On February 12, 2014, the CA rendered the assailed Decision, [31] granting Alo's petition for review and reversing the ruling of the Board, to wit: WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant petition for review is GRANTED and the September 11, 2012 Decision and March 15, 2013 Order of respondent Board for Professional Teachers are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Accordingly, petitioner is EXONERATED of the charge against her. SO ORDERED.","The petition is GRANTED. The February 12, 2014 Decision and September 12, 2014 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 129993, are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The September 11, 2012 Decision of the Board for Professional Teachers is REINSTATED.","The CA has jurisdiction of the case. While the CA has jurisdiction, Alo failed to exhaust all administrative remedies, and thus, under the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies, her case must be dismissed for lack of cause of action. In any event, even if the merits of the case are considered, Alo, who is a non-passer of the professional teacher's board examinations, was patently not qualified to obtain a professional teacher's license and a certificate of registration under Section 26 (C) of RA 7836, because she graduated after the cut-off date (reckoned as of December 16, 1994) and applied for registration in September 2007, seven years from the deadline provided under BPT Resolution 600-1997 (September 19, 2000). Alo's right to due process was not violated when the Board declared that she was not qualified for registration under Section 26 of RA 7836, as she was the one who raised the issue. The Board's Decision dated September 11, 2012, finding Alo guilty and consequently, revoking her certificate of registration and license as a professional teacher, was supported by substantial evidence, considering that she falsely represented that her name was included in Board Resolution No. 671 by writing the notation ""671 s'2000 E/C"" at the dorsal portion thereof under Board Res./Approved Letter (Number & Date) when she filled out the Registry Book for Teachers with Serial No. RS-AA 0080206.",GRANTED
"G.R. No. 207828, February 14, 2022","SRL INTERNATIONAL MANPOWER AGENCY, REPRESENTED BY SEVILLA SARAH SORITA AND AKKILA CO., LTD., UAE AND/OR AL SALMEEN, PETITIONERS, VS. PEDRO S. YARZA, JR., RESPONDENT.","Respondent Pedro S. Yarza, Jr. (Yarza) alleged that the petitioners SRL International Manpower Agency (SRL) and Akkila Co. Ltd. UAE (Akkila, collectively, petitioners), SRL's foreign principal, hired him as a Project Manager for a duration of two years. His employment contract [6] states that his monthly basic salary is AED 8,000.00/month, in addition to a transportation allowance of AED 2,000.00/month, and inflation allowance of AED 2,200.00/month. Yarza departed for the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on October 14, 2010. [7] On March 24, 2011, Yarza was repatriated to the Philippines with an instruction to renew his visa, and with the condition that he should return 10 days after its processing. Although Yarza complied with all the requirements, petitioners terminated his employment without prior notice and due process. To his surprise, he received a termination letter [8] dated May 22, 2011 from Akkila. Yarza claimed that he enjoys security of tenure since he was contracted to serve for 24 months and was hired based on his credentials. Withal, they failed to prove that he was dismissed based on a just or authorized cause, or under the employment contract. [9] Consequently, on June 29, 2011, Yarza filed a complaint [10] for illegal dismissal, payment of salary for the unexpired portion of his contract, refund of transportation fare, and moral damages against the petitioners. [11] On the other hand, SRL confirmed that Akkila and Al Salmeen Trading Est. (Al Salmeen), purportedly both owned by Mr. Haytham Akkila, are its foreign principals. Akkila informed SRL that it needed manpower for its Qatar project; hence, the latter posted the job opening. In view of this, Yarza submitted his application as Project Manager. In July 2010, SRL received word from Akkila that the latter was interested in hiring Yarza. Afterwards, SRL forwarded Yarza's documents to Akkila for the processing of his employment visa. [12] However, unknown to SRL, Akkila and Yarza directly contacted each other regarding Yarza's deployment. To SRL's surprise, Akkila sent a visit visa for Yarza instead of an employment visa. SRL protested and informed Akkila that Yarza cannot be deployed under a visit visa since it would violate the rules of the Philippine Overseas Employment Agency (POEA). Akkila and Yarza insisted on using the visit visa, stating that they have a mutual and voluntary agreement. SRL objected as it wanted to strictly follow POEA's requirement that an overseas worker should be deployed under an employment visa. Nonetheless, SRL turned over to Yarza all of his documents including the visit visa. From then on, SRL did not facilitate Yarza's deployment under the visit visa as Yarza handled it on his own. SRL argued that it did not agree to act as the local manpower agency of Akkila with respect to Yarza's deployment under the visit visa, given that the employment contract was between Akkila and Yarza only. [13] SRL additionally asserted that on April 4, 2011, Akkila informed it that Yarza returned to the Philippines after working from October 2010 until April 2011 under the visit visa. Akkila claimed that Yarza will apply for deployment anew under an employment visa. Furthermore, Yarza will process his POEA Overseas Employment Certificate (OEC) himself. SRL told Akkila and Yarza that Yarza cannot obtain the OEC on his own, as he needs SRL, the authorized local agency of Akkila, to secure it for him. [14] When SRL started processing Yarza's documents, the latter underwent a medical examination to assess his fitness for work. SRL informed Yarza that he has to submit to a medical examination since the deployment will be treated as an entirely new one. SRL then referred Yarza to its accredited clinic, Seamed Medical Clinic (Seamed). However, Seamed declared that Yarza was unfit for work due to Uncontrolled Diabetes Mellitus Type II, which was reflected in a Medical Certificate [15] dated May 10, 2011. SRL disclosed the finding to Akkila and informed the latter that if it is still interested, it should send a waiver indicating its willingness to hire Yarza notwithstanding his unfitness for work. Akkila replied that it has a strict qualification not to hire an applicant who is not fit for work. Subsequently, in a letter dated May 22, 2011, Akkila informed Yarza that he cannot be hired due to medical reasons. [16]",The petition has no merit. Yarza is entitled to his claims.,"The 'Offer of Employment' is invalid since it was not approved by the POEA. At the root of the controversy is the validity of the 'Offer of Employment' which served as Yarza's 'contract' during his initial deployment under the visit visa. There is no dispute that his deployment did not pass through the official channel, specifically the POEA. 'Under our Labor Code, employers hiring [Overseas Filipino Workers or] OFWs may only do so through entities authorized by the Secretary of the Department of Labor and Employment. [84] Unless the employment contract of an OFW is processed through the POEA, the same does not bind the concerned OFW because if the contract is not reviewed by the POEA, certainly the State has no means of determining the suitability of foreign laws to our overseas workers.' [85] Moreover, the 'Offer of Employment' states that the rules and regulations found in UAE's labor laws should apply, [86] which is contrary to our country's policies concerning labor contracts and security of tenure... Notwithstanding the invalidity of the 'Offer of Employment,' an employer-employee relationship exists. Absent a valid employment contract, the Court must then consider the attendant circumstances to determine if there is an employer-employee relationship between Akkila and Yarza. To ascertain the existence of this association, the following elements should be evident: '(1) the selection and engagement of the employee; (2) the payment of wages; (3) the power of dismissal; and (4) the employer's power to control the employee's conduct... Thence, an employer-employee relationship was established notwithstanding the absence of a valid and POEA-approved contract. Both substantial and procedural due process were not observed. Since an employer-employee relationship exists, the petitioners should accord Yarza due process, both substantial and procedural, before terminating his employment. To comply with substantive due process, Yarza can only be dismissed for a just or authorized cause, the absence of which renders his dismissal illegal... Akkila did not present any certification from a competent public health authority citing that Yarza's disease cannot be cured within six months, or that his employment is prejudicial to his health or that of his co-employees. Absent this certification, Akkila failed to comply with Article 299 [284] of the Labor Code as well as Section 8, Title 1, Book Six of the Omnibus Rules Implementing the Labor Code. In other words, Yarza's dismissal was not based on a just cause. Apart from this, Akkila did not accord Yarza procedural due process. It is settled that 'the employer must give the concerned employee at least two notices before his or her termination, and thereafter, the employer's decision to dismiss him. Aside from the notice requirement, the employee must be accorded the opportunity to be heard.'... The petitioners are solidarily liable to Yarza. Based on substantial evidence, [117] Yarza proved SRL's solidary liability with its foreign principal, Akkila/Al Salmeen. This is notwithstanding Yarza's undocumented status or SRL's insistence on its supposed non-participation... Yarza is entitled to his salaries for the unexpired portion of his contract. Even if the 'Offer of Employment' is invalid, the existence of an employer-employee relationship entitles Yarza to claim for the payment of his salaries for the unexpired portion of his contract. Relevantly, both the NLRC and the CA rendered their rulings before the Court resolved anew the issue on the constitutionality of the cap of three-month pay for every year of service on an overseas worker's money claims... the Court, in Sameer Overseas Placement Agency, Inc. v. Cabiles (Sameer) , [118] again 'declared unconstitutional the cap of three-month pay for every year of service.'... Thus, Yarza should receive his unpaid salaries corresponding to the unexpired portion of his contract (based on the 'Offer of Employment') at the rate of AED 8,000.00 per month. Out of the 24 months, he still had around 19 months left to work, had he not been abruptly dismissed. He is thus entitled to a total of AED 152,000.00 (19 months x AED 8,000.00)... Yarza is entitled to moral and exemplary damages as well as attorney's fees. The Court likewise finds it proper to award moral and exemplary damages, amounting to P100,000.00 each. [125]... Moreover, Yarza is entitled to attorney's fees at the rate of 10% under Article 2208 of the Civil Code... all the monetary awards should incur interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum reckoned from the finality of judgment until fully paid.","WHEREFORE, the petition is hereby DENIED. The March 25, 2013 Decision and June 18, 2013 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 126776 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATIONS in that the petitioners SRL International Manpower Agency, represented by Sevilla Sarah Sorita, and Akkila Co., Ltd., UAE and/or Al Salmeen, are hereby ORDERED to indemnify, jointly and severally respondent Pedro S. Yarza, Jr. the following amounts: His unpaid salaries amounting to AED 152,000.00 or its Philippine Peso equivalent at the time of payment, corresponding to the unexpired portion of his employment contract (""Offer of Employment""); Moral damages in the amount of One Hundred Thousand Pesos (P100,000.00); Exemplary damages in the amount of One Hundred Thousand Pesos (P100,000.00); Attorney's fees equal to ten percent (10%) of the total monetary award; and Costs of suit.

ACTS CONTRARY TO LAW. Upon arraignment, XXX pleaded not guilty to the crimes charged. During the pre-trial, the prosecution and the defense stipulated on the following facts: The identity of accused, [XXX]; That private complainants, [CCC] and [BBB] [AAA], are minors; That accused is residing at x x x xx x x xxxx; That a certain establishment in the name of x x x xx x x xxxx is located at x x x xx x x xxxx; That the accused manages or owns said x x x xx x x xxxx establishment; That the accused was apprehended by police officers at x x x xx x x xxxx on April 7, 2013; and That the accused was brought by the PNP x x x xx x x xxxx to the Provincial Prosecution Office of x x x xx x x xxxx for inquest proceedings. Evidence for the Prosecution: On September 28, 2012, AAA, DDD, and EEE were recruited by GGG and XXX ('Mama Diane') to work as waitresses in a bar in x x x xx x x xxxx, promising P250 per day, but advising them to claim they were 18. Upon arrival on September 29, 2012, XXX instructed them to change names and wear revealing clothes. They were brought to x x x xx xxxx KTV Bar. Their work included entertaining customers by sitting beside them, drinking wine, allowing physical touching for P140, engaging in private room entertainment for P850, and having sexual intercourse outside (bar fine) for P1,600, all fees paid directly to XXX. AAA testified she experienced all these forms of exploitation. AAA and others attempted to escape several times. On April 7, 2013, AAA escaped with JJJ, sought help from a guard, and reported the incident to the police, leading to XXX's arrest. Evidence for the Defense: XXX claimed that she was introduced to AAA by GGG to work as a waitress in XXX's eatery (selling 'log-log,' 'pancit,' and 'dinuguan,' with videoke) in x x x xx x x xxxx. When AAA, EEE, DDD, and FFF arrived, XXX employed them as servers. After some time, AAA and EEE returned and worked again in January 2013. On April 7, 2013, AAA left without permission, and XXX discovered P3,000.00 and a worker's cellular phone missing. XXX went to the bus terminal to locate AAA, who immediately ran away and approached a police officer, leading to XXX's arrest.","On February 4, 2015, the RTC rendered its Judgment convicting XXX of violating Section 4(a) of RA 9208 in Criminal Case No. 2013-0202 committed against AAA, but acquitting XXX in Criminal Case No. 2013-0203 committed against CCC, for insufficiency of evidence. XXX was ordered to suffer the penalty of LIFE IMPRISONMENT and to pay a fine of TWO MILLION (P2,000,000.00) PESOS. On July 20, 2017, the CA rendered its assailed Decision denying XXX's appeal and affirming with modification her conviction, ordering her to pay P500,000.00 as moral damages; P100,000.00 as exemplary damages; and Interest at the legal rate of six percent (6%) per annum on all the amounts of damages awarded, commencing from the finality of this decision until such amounts shall have been fully paid.","After due consideration, we sustain XXX's conviction. Section 3(a) of RA 9208 defines the term ""Trafficking in Persons"" as the ""recruitment, transportation, transfer or harboring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders by means of threat or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the person, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person for the purpose of exploitation which includes at a minimum, the exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs"". The Court found that the prosecution had duly established all the elements of Qualified Trafficking in Persons. XXX hired or recruited AAA, DDD, FFF, and EEE, on the pretext of being waitresses in a bar but were forced to entertain male customers, by accompanying and drinking alcohol with them in the bar or in a private room, to be subjected to lascivious acts, and to engage in sexual intercourse, all for a fee. The alleged inconsistencies or absurdity in AAA's testimony... are trivial which do not affect the criminal act committed by XXX, that is, recruiting or hiring AAA to be subjected to prostitution or lascivious acts in exchange of money. As to the failure of the prosecution to present the original or certified true copy of AAA's birth certificate, the latter's testimony as to her age, i.e., 14 years old at the time of the incident, and XXX's express and clear admission of her age during the pre-trial in the stipulation of facts, sufficiently established AAA's minority. Apropos, we affirm XXX's conviction of Qualified Trafficking in Persons in view of AAA's minority, in violation of Section 4(a), in relation with Sections 6 and 10, of RA 9208.","WHEREFORE, the appeal is DISMISSED.

QLDI filed with the CIR a request for reconsideration dated March 30, 2015, which was denied by the CIR in the Decision dated February 4, 2020.[12] Consequently, the CIR ordered QLDI to pay the deficiency taxes and the compromise penalty for taxable year 2010. On June 30, 2020, QLDI filed a Petition for Review[13] before the CTA Division, challenging the CIR's February 4, 2020 Decision and questioning the prescription of the CIR's right to collect taxes. The CTA Division, in its Resolution dated June 7, 2021, held that the period within which the CIR may collect deficiency taxes had already lapsed, applying the five-year collection period reckoned from the mailing of the FAN/FLD on December 12, 2014, thus prescribing on December 12, 2019. The CIR's collection letters were issued in 2020. The CTA Division denied the CIR's Motion for Reconsideration on December 11, 2021, and enjoined the CIR from collecting the deficiency taxes. Hence, the CIR filed the present Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition directly with the Supreme Court, challenging the CTA Division's assumption of jurisdiction and finding of prescription.","After a careful study of the allegations and the records of this case, the Court resolves to dismiss the Petition and uphold the Resolutions dated June 7, 2021 and December 11, 2021 issued by the CTA Division.","The CIR availed itself of the wrong remedy in filing the instant Petition before the Court. The CTA Resolutions dated June 7, 2021 and December 11, 2021, which cancelled the assessment against QLDI on the basis of prescription and enjoined the CIR from collecting the deficiency taxes for taxable year 2010, are final judgments or orders. The CIR's proper remedy on the adverse Resolutions of the CTA Division was to file an appeal by way of a petition for review with the CTA En Banc. Nonetheless, the Petition would still be dismissed on the merits. The CTA has jurisdiction over the case based on Section 7(a)(1) of RA 1125, as amended by RA 9282, which includes 'other matters' arising under the NIRC, such as the issue of prescription of the CIR's right to collect taxes, which is separate from the validity of the assessment itself. Regarding the period to collect taxes, the CTA Division erred in applying the five-year period. The Court ruled that where the assessment is issued within the three-year ordinary prescriptive period (as in this case), the CIR has another three years within which to collect the tax due by distraint, levy, or court proceeding. Since the FAN/FLD was mailed on December 12, 2014, the CIR had until December 12, 2017, to enforce collection. Prescription had already set in when the CIR initiated its collection efforts only in 2020. Lastly, the CTA has authority to enjoin the collection of taxes under Section 11 of RA 1125, as amended by RA 9282, when the collection may jeopardize the interest of the government and/or the taxpayer, especially when prescription has set in. Since QLDI posted a surety bond, the injunction was proper.","WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Petition is DISMISSED. The June 7, 2021 and December 11, 2021 Resolutions of the Court of Tax Appeals Second Division in CTA Case No. 10291 are hereby AFFIRMED. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 229179, March 29, 2022","BENHUR SHIPPING CORPORATION/SUN MARINE SHIPPING S.A. AND EDGAR B. BRUSELAS, PETITIONERS, VS. ALEX PEÑAREDONDA RIEGO, RESPONDENT.","On October 8, 2013, Benhur Shipping Corporation (BSC) engaged the services of respondent to work as Chief Cook on board the vessel ""MV Hikari I,"" an ocean-going vessel of its foreign principal, Sun Marine Shipping S.A. (SMS) . Subject to the provisions of the Philippine Overseas Employment Association-Standard Employment Contract ( POEA-SEC) , the Contract of Employment [6] executed by the parties provided for a term of 12 months with a basic monthly salary of US$535.00 for a 48-hour work-week, with provisions for overtime pay and vacation leave with pay. Found fit to work during the Pre-employment Medical Examination, [7] respondent boarded the vessel. [8] On the first week of December 2013, respondent suffered from abdominal and lower back pain while on board the vessel. He was brought for medical check-up and examined by a doctor in Thailand and was given medications. Respondent was recommended for repatriation for further medical evaluation. [9] On December 15, 2013, respondent arrived in the Philippines and was immediately endorsed by BSC to Marine Medical Services wherein he was attended to by Dr. Robert D. Lim (Dr. Lim) , the company-designated physician, for further medical care and treatment. [10] On December 16, 2013, the company-designated physician issued the first Medical Report [11] stating that respondent was referred to a gastro-enterologist and orthopedic surgeon. The specialist reviewed respondent's lumbosacral spine x-ray and noted normal results. It was recommended that respondent should undergo laboratory examination, gastroscopy, ultrasound of the whole abdomen and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbosacral spine. He was likewise requested to come back on December 17, 2013 for re-evaluation. [12] On December 17, 2013, the company-designated physician issued a second Medical Report [13] stating that respondent was under the care of a gastroenterologist and orthopedic surgeon. His laboratory examination showed normal complete blood count, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, SGPT and alkaline phosphatase. Gastroscopy showed esophagogastroduodenal muscosa, small hiatal hernia and negative H.pylori infection. Respondent then underwent ultrasound of the upper abdomen and MRI of the lumbosacral spine for further evaluation. He was likewise given medication and advised to come back on December 26, 2013 for the re-evaluation with result. [14] On December 26, 2013, the company-designated physician issued a third Medical Report [15] indicating that respondent no longer claimed to have abdominal discomfort and that the ultrasound of his upper abdomen showed normal results of his liver, gall bladder, pancreas, spleen, kidneys, urinary bladder and prostate gland. As such, respondent was cleared from a gastro-enterologic standpoint for his hiatal hernia. He was also seen by an orthopedic surgeon and physiatrist since he complained of an on-and-off low localized back pain, especially when bending forward and standing from a sitting position. There was also tightness of both his hamstrings, the manual muscle test was 5/5 on both extremities with pain upon resistance of hip flexion, while there were negative straight-leg raising test results. Respondent's lumbosacral spine x-ray showed normal results. However, the MRI of his lumbosacral spine showed mild lumbar spondylosis, with no evidence of disc herniation, spinal canal or foraminal stenosis at any level. Respondent was advised to start rehabilitation, to continue his medications and to return on January 16, 2014 for re-evaluation. [16] Respondent was diagnosed to have Hiatal Hernia, L4-L5, L5-S1 Disc Bulge. [17] In the fourth Medical Report [18] dated January 16, 2014, the company-designated physician stated that respondent was previously cleared gastro- intestinal wise with regard to his hiatal hernia. He was seen by an orthopedic surgeon and had no complaints of pain or discomfort from his lower back area. Respondent had full range of motion of his trunk, had normal sitting and standing tolerance, and was ambulatory over all surface. The specialist opined that respondent was cleared from an orthopedic standpoint as of the said date. He was also advised of the proper back mechanics to prevent and minimize the recurrence of his back pain. Also on even date, respondent signed a Certificate of Fitness to Work [19] indicating that he was fit to work notwithstanding the diagnosis that he has Hiatal Hernia, L4-L5, L5-S1 Disc Bulge. [20] On February 10, 2014, the company-designated physician issued a fifth Medical Report [21] stating that respondent complained of pain on the left lower back radiating to the left lower extremity. The MRI of the lumbosacral spine showed that the mild disc bulge at L4-L5 had not significantly changed. There was, however, no evidence of disc herniation, spinal canal stenosis or foraminal stenosis at any level. Also, no new abnormalities were demonstrated. Respondent was advised to continue his rehabilitation and medication, and to come back on February 24, 2014 for re-evaluation. [22] Several progress notes were issued on February 22, 2014 and March 8, 2014, which indicated that there were still no pertinent improvements and there were still persistent problems, such as lower back pain radiating to the left leg, grade 1 tenderness on the left leg, muscle spasm on paralumbar and leg, and tightness of hamstring. [23] The company-designated physician issued a note referring respondent to Lucena MMG General Hospital (MMG Hospital) for continued physical therapy on March 31, 2014. [24] Respondent claimed that on March 28, 2014, the company-designated physician informed him that petitioners already terminated his medical treatment. [25] In a medical note addressed to the company-designated physician dated May 12, 2014, Dr. Kharen Michelle Esmeralda (Dr. Esmeralda) , neurologist of MMG Hospital, suggested, among others, that respondent be referred to neurosurgery to assess the degree of nerve compression and, if possible, the decompression of the spine. [26] It was added therein that neurorehabilitation will only provide transient episodes of pain relief, and it could lead to further damage. [27] On May 26, 2014, the company-designated physician issued the final Medical Report [28] stating that on follow-up check-up, respondent still complained of lower back pain radiating to the left lower extremity with no significant improvement with physical therapy, and there was still sensory deficit on his left leg. The company-designated physician further stated that if respondent is entitled to disability benefits, his final disability grading under the POEA schedule of disabilities remains at Grade 11 – 1/3 loss of lifting power. [29] Notably, on May 30, 2014, the company-designated physician issued a certification that respondent has under medical/surgical evaluation treatment from December 16, 2013 to present due to Hiatal Hernia; L4-L5, L5-S1 Disc Bulge. [30] Consequently, respondent consulted a physician of his choice, Dr. Fidel M. Magtira (Dr. Magtira) , for a second medical opinion. On June 5, 2014, Dr. Magtira issued a Medical Report [31] stating that respondent was permanently disabled and permanently unfit to work in any capacity. On June 11, 2014, respondent through his legal counsel sent a Letter [32] to BSC informing the latter that ""[c]onsidering the persistent back pain he continues to suffer, he consulted his chosen medical expert to make another assessment and he was declared permanently unfit to work."" [33] Respondent further requested for medical treatment for his back pain due to disc bulge radiating to his extremities, since he had no financial capacity to support continued treatment and therapy. Moreover, respondent requested BSC to refer him for a third medical opinion should it continue to refuse to shoulder his treatment and therapy. [34] On June 25, 2014, respondent sent another Letter [35] to BSC, reiterating his request for the latter to refer him for a third medical opinion as the medical assessments of their respective doctors differ, and to consider said assessment as final and binding to the parties. On June 30, 2014, respondent underwent an MRI of his lumbosacral spine at the Banawe Diagnostic MRI Center, Inc. On July 2, 2014, Dr. Magtira issued a Medical Report [36] finding respondent permanently disabled and unfit to work in any capacity. [37] On July 28, 2014, respondent filed a Complaint [38] against petitioners for total and permanent disability benefits, moral and exemplary damages, and attorney's fees. [39] The LA Ruling In its February 27, 2015 Decision, the LA granted respondent's complaint for disability benefits in the total amount of US$7,465.00 pursuant to a Grade 11 Disability Assessment – 1/3 loss of lifting power as determined by the company designated physician plus 10% attorney's fees. [40] The dispositive portion of the decision provides: WHEREFORE , premises considered, respondents Benhur Shipping Corporation, et al. are hereby ordered to pay complainant Alex P. Riego the sum of US$7,465.00 pursuant to the Grade 11 disability assessment – 1/3 loss of lifting power as determined by the company designated physician plus 10% attorney's fees. SO ORDERED . [41] The LA held that it was undeniable that the injury suffered by respondent was work-related, the same having been sustained while he was performing his tasks on board his employer's vessel. The LA gave credence to the medical assessment provided by the company-designated physician. It found that from the medical report rendered by Dr. Magtira, no disability grading was issued. The NLRC Ruling In its July 16, 2015 Decision, the NLRC affirmed the ruling of the LA, to wit: WHEREFORE , premises considered, the appeal is denied for lack of merit. The assailed Decision of Labor Arbiter Joanne G. [Hernandez]-Lazo dated February 27, 2015 is AFFIRMED . SO ORDERED . [44] The NLRC held that respondent's claim for permanent and total disability benefits is without basis at all. [45] The NLRC declared that even if the findings of respondent's private physician were to be taken into consideration, the company-designated physician's assessment should prevail over that of the former. The CA Ruling In its September 30, 2016, Decision, the CA reversed and set aside the ruling of the NLRC. The dispositive portion of the decision, reads: WHEREFORE , the instant petition is hereby GRANTED . The Decision dated July 16, 2015 is hereby ANNULLED and SET ASIDE . Petitioner Alex Peñaredonda Riego is hereby awarded Total Permanent Disability Benefits in the amount of Sixty Thousand (US$60,000.00) US Dollars and Ten Percent (10%) Attorney's Fees. SO ORDERED . [52] (emphases and italics in the original; citation omitted) The CA held that if the treatment of 120 days is extended to 240 days, but still no medical assessment is given, the finding of permanent and total disability becomes conclusive. [53] Respondent should be granted total and permanent disability benefits since no assessment was issued for a disability grade before the lapse of the 120-day period. The CA noted that respondent was repatriated on December 15, 2013 and was only assessed by the company-designated physician as suffering from Grade 11 disability on May 26, 2014 or after the lapse of 156 days. No justifiable reason was shown why it took that long for the company-designated physician to come up with the assessment. Petitioners failed to come up with the disability assessment within 120 days without justifiable reason and with respondent being cooperative with the medical treatment that was cut short without proper notice given. Respondent must be awarded total permanent disability benefits. [56] The CA denied petitioners' motion for reconsideration in its January 6, 2017 Resolution. Hence, this appeal by certiorari, raising the following grounds for allowance of the petition: I THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED PALPABLE ERROR WHEN IT HEAVILY RELIED IN THE DECISION OF ELBURG [SHIPMANAGEMENT], PHILS., INC., ET AL. VS. QUIOGUE, JR. IN HOLDING THAT THE COMPANY-DESIGNATED PHYSICIAN'S FINAL DISABILITY ASSESSMENT OF GRADE 11 ISSUED MORE THAN 120 DAYS SHOULD BE DISREGARDED FOR THE COMPANY-DESIGNATED PHYSICIAN'S FAILURE TO STATE JUSTIFICATION WHY THE TREATMENT SHOULD EXCEED 120 DAYS. II UNDER THE POEA-SEC, THE LAW THAT APPLIES BETWEEN THE PARTIES, DISABILITIES ARE NOT ALWAYS REGARDED AS PERMANENT/TOTAL. THUS, THE POEA-SEC INCLUDES THE SCHEDULE OF DISABILITIES WITH EQUIVALENT DISABILITY COMPENSATION, WHICH MUST BE APPLIED. THEREFORE, THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED PALPABLE ERROR IN NOT UPHOLDING THE FINAL DISABILITY ASSESSMENT OF GRADE 11 AND IN DISREGARDING AND RENDERING NUGATORY THE POEA-SEC PROVISIONS ON DISABILITY SCHEDULE. [57] (emphasis and italics in the original; citation omitted)","WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED.","The Court found that the company-designated physician failed to issue a final and valid assessment within the extended 240-day period, transforming the temporary total disability to permanent total disability, regardless of the disability grade. Further, the Court found that the respondent had sufficiently complied with the mandatory procedure under Sec. 20(A)(3) of the POEA-SEC by sending two letter-requests for referral to a third doctor, but petitioners failed to act on it. Because the employer failed to entertain the request for a referral to a third doctor, the tribunals and courts are empowered to conduct its own assessment to resolve the conflicting medical opinions. The Court concluded that respondent is suffering from permanent disability, which renders him unfit to work in any capacity as a seafarer, resulting in loss of earning capacity and, therefore, entitles him to permanent and total disability benefits.","The petition is DENIED. The September 30, 2016 Decision and January 6, 2017 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 142911 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. Petitioners are hereby ORDERED to PAY respondent Alex Peñaredonda Riego total and permanent disability benefits in the amount of US$60,000.00 at the prevailing rate of exchange at the time of payment, as well as attorney's fees equivalent to ten percent (10%) of the total monetary award. Finally, all monetary awards shall earn legal interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from finality of this Decision until full payment."
"G.R. No. 246369, March 29, 2022","SERVFLEX, INC., PETITIONER, VS. LOVELYNN* M. URERA, SHERRYL I. CABRERA, PRECIOUS** C. PALANCA AND JOCO JIM L. SEVILLA, RESPONDENTS.","The case stemmed from a complaint for regularization of employment and nonpayment of benefits with prayer for moral and exemplary damages and attorney's fees filed by Lovelynn M. Urera, Sherryl I. Cabrera, Precious C. Palanca, and Joco Jim L. Sevilla (respondents) against Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT), Servflex, Inc. (petitioner), and their respective officers – Rosalie C. Simeon (Simeon) and Dandy D. Abundo (Abundo). PLDT is a domestic company engaged in the telecommunications industry. It alleged that due to an increase in internet usage, its revenue from call and text messaging services decreased. To facilitate its digital shift, PLDT invested in new technologies and was constrained to outsource staff from contractors. In such regard, it engaged petitioner who agreed to undertake the supply of labor, particularly Database Engineers, to support the network facility build-up, migrations, optimization, and testing and troubleshooting of PLDT. The contract of service between petitioner and PLDT was for three years commencing on January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2016. However, even before the commencement of the contract of service, petitioner had already assigned respondents at PLDT. In particular, respondents began working for PLDT on the dates and with the monthly salaries as follows: NAME START OF WORK WITH PLDT MONTHLY SALARY 1 Lovelynn M. URERA 18 March 2013 P15,860.00 2 Precious C. PALANCA 14 May 2013 P13,110.00 3 Sherryl I. CABRERA 7 March 2013 P13,110.00 4 Joco Jim L. SEVILLA 1 Oct. 2013 P13,110.00 Meanwhile, respondents alleged that they applied at PLDT, but the latter referred them to petitioner which, after their engagement, still deployed them at PLDT. They stated that petitioner was a mere labor-only contractor considering that: (1) it had no independent business for which it hired respondents; (2) respondents' work was integral to the business of PLDT; and (3) their work performance was under the control of PLDT. On the other hand, PLDT, petitioner, and their officers (Simeon and Abundo) countered that petitioner deployed respondents at the premises of PLDT pursuant to an agreement for contracted service, and such agreement laid down petitioner's hiring, termination, control and supervision over respondents and their work; thus, respondents were regular employees of petitioner, not of PLDT. They averred that petitioner was a legitimate job contractor as shown by: (1) its registration and certification issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), respectively; (2) certifications showing that it had no pending case with the DOLE; (3) its General Information Sheet for the year 2016; and (4) petitioner's goodwill and established clientele. In the Decision dated June 10, 2016, the LA ruled for respondents, the dispositive portion of which reads: WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered as follows: DECLARING SERVFLEX, INC. (SERVFLEX) as a labor only contractor and considered merely as an agent of PHILIPPINE LONG DISTANCE [TELEPHONE] CO. (PLDT); DECLARING complainants LOVELYNN M. URERA, PRECIOUS C. PALANCA, SHERRYL CABRERA, and JOCO LIM L. SEVILLA as regular employees of PLDT, since they started working with PLDT and are entitled to security of tenure and all benefits and rights appurtenant thereto, including those which should have been received by them; ORDERING PLDT and SERVFLEX to pay jointly and severally complainants, (a) previous entitlements, which should have been given to them, had they been treated as regular employees of PLDT, which are partially computed as of 16 May 2016 in the amount of P1,169,463.52, for LOVELYNN M. URERA; P1,218,963.52, for PRECIOUS C. PALANCA; P1,037,885.54, for SHERRYL CABRERA; and P785,860.24, for JOCO LIM L. SEVILLA; (b) moral and exemplary damages of P25,000.00 each; and (c) attorney's fees of ten percent of the monetary award, except damages; and DISMISSING all other claims, for want of substantiation. Petitioner and PLDT filed their separate appeals before the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC). On July 29, 2016, the NLRC reversed and set aside the LA Decision and accordingly dismissed the complaint for lack of merit. With the denial of their motion for reconsideration, respondents filed a petition for certiorari with the CA. On July 5, 2018, the CA granted the petition for certiorari. It ordered PLDT and petitioner to solidarily pay respondents: (1) salary and employee benefits reckoned from the commencement of their work with PLDT; (2) moral and exemplary damages in the amount of P25,000.00 each; and (3) attorney's fees at 10% of the amount of wages recovered. Petitioner and PLDT filed their separate motions for reconsideration, which the CA denied in its Resolution dated April 1, 2019. Aggrieved, petitioner filed the present petition raising arguments that its certificate of registration proves it is a legitimate job contractor and that its employees independently perform the contracted work.","The petition lacks merit. Foremost, the Court underscores that the issues of whether petitioner is an independent contractor or a mere labor-only contractor, and of whether respondents are its regular employees are factual in nature and therefore, they are not within the scope of a Rule 45 petition. Nonetheless, there being divergent factual findings between the LA and CA, on one hand, and the NLRC, on the other hand, the Court deems it necessary to reevaluate the evidence for the just disposition of the case. Equally important, ""in a Rule 45 review in labor cases, the Court examines the CA's Decision from the prism of whether [in a petition for certiorari,] the latter had correctly determined the presence or absence of grave abuse of discretion in the NLRC's Decision."" There is grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC when its findings and conclusions are not supported by substantial evidence, i.e., that amount of relevant evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion. Such grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC warrants the grant of the extraordinary remedy of certiorari. In the present case, the Court finds that the CA did not err in finding that the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion in reversing and setting aside the LA Decision and accordingly dismissing the case.","Let it be underscored that to fully resolve the matters on hand, it is significant for the Court to delve into the concept of labor-only contracting as defined in law and discussed in jurisprudence. Labor-only contracting refers to an arrangement whereby a person who does not have substantial capital or investment deploys workers to the employer for them to perform tasks that are directly necessary to the employer's principal business. It is present where: (1) a person who supplies workers to an employer does not possess substantial capital or investment in the form of tools, pieces of equipment or machinery, work premises, among others; and (2) the workers are made to perform tasks which are directly related to the employer's principal business. Under the circumstances, the intermediary or the person who assigned the workers to the employer shall be deemed as the latter's agent, and the employer shall be responsible for the workers, as if it directly hired them. Overall, the presence of a labor-only contracting is evident in such a situation where the contractor merely recruits, supplies, and assigns workers to perform a job for a principal, as in the present case. First, it bears stressing that in the context of labor-only contracting, substantial capital or investment rests not only on the capitalization indicated in the financial documents but on the pieces of equipment and machinery, and work premises a person or entity actually and directly used in the performance of the work or service it contracts out. Here, petitioner did not at all specify any tool or equipment it owned and supplied respondents for them to perform their work for PLDT. On the contrary, PLDT provided the relevant tools and the premises for the performance of respondents' work. More importantly, respondents have been performing tasks central and necessary to the business of PLDT. Undeniably, all these matters indicate that PLDT is the employer of respondents. Second, there is no clear showing that petitioner had the power of control over respondents. In the case, PLDT not only possessed, but actually wielded and exercised the power of control over the work performance of respondents. This is made evident by the following circumstances duly noted by the LA: [Respondents] are required to work in the premises of PLDT. ... PLDT similarly obliged them to follow work schedule, just like the regular employees of PLDT. The electronic mails (email) manifestly display that [respondents] directly received orders from PLDT Manager, Garnel Gilberto Dangel, and Section Head, Willie Sison. ... Furthermore, x x x PLDT's action of providing trainings and seminars about its processes and software, are intended to improve and develop [respondents] so that they can better contribute to the realization of the company's goal. And last, petitioner's reliance on its certificate of registration is not sufficient to establish that it is an independent labor contractor. The presumption cannot prevail in this case, there being overwhelming evidence supporting the conclusion that petitioner is a mere labor-only contractor. Verily, the ruling of the NLRC that petitioner is the employer of respondents and that it is engaged in a legitimate job contracting is not supported by substantial evidence. The Court finds that petitioner and PLDT are engaged in labor-only contracting. Consequently, by legal fiction, they are considered agent and principal, respectively and thus, are jointly and severally liable to pay respondents the salaries and benefits due them as regular employees. All told, the CA did not err in finding that the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion when it reversed and set aside the LA decision and concomitantly, dismissed the case.","WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED. The Decision dated July 5, 2018 and the Resolution dated April 1, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 148586 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION in that all the monetary awards shall earn interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the finality of this Decision until full payment. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 208379, March 29, 2022","LUIS R. VILLAFUERTE, CARIDAD R. VALDEHUESA, AND NORMA L. LASALA, PETITIONERS,* VS. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, BANGKO SENTRAL NG PILIPINAS, SECRETARY OF FINANCE, THE NATIONAL TREASURER, BANKERS ASSOCIATION OF THE PHILIPPINES, PHILIPPINE DEALING & EXCHANGE CORPORATION, PHILIPPINE DEPOSITORY & TRUST CORP., PHILIPPINE SECURITIES SETTLEMENT CORPORATION, PHILIPPINE DEALING SYSTEM HOLDINGS CORPORATION, AND VICENTE B. CASTILLO, RESPONDENTS.","Petitioners allege that the creation of the monopoly began in the early 2000s when private respondent Vicente E. Castillo (Castillo) and his colleagues in BAP exploited the lack of market for privately-issued securities in the country. This led to the establishment of the Fixed-Income Exchange (FIE), a marketplace or facility for fixed-income securities. To implement the FIE, the PDS Group was created, with each company tasked to provide a specific service: (1) PDEx, to provide the trading platform for the FIE; (2) PSSC, to operate as the central clearing and settlement institution for trading activities; (3) PDTC, to act as the depository, registry, and custodian of fixed-income securities; and (4) PDSHC, to be the holding company for the three corporations. The FIE, according to petitioners, failed as a financial venture. PDEx allegedly incurred heavy business losses, which accumulated to about P170 million by the end of 2006. These financial losses led Castillo and BAP to intrude upon the stable OTC market for government securities in 2008, which was then operated by the Money Market Association of the Philippines (MART). In intruding upon the said market, MART was allegedly unlawfully eased out. Petitioners allege that the monopoly of the PDS Group was made possible with the help of public respondents through the following rules, orders, issuances, and acts: BSP Circular No. 338 (2002), which amended the Manual of Regulations for Banks by adding the FIE as one of the non-financial allied undertakings in which equity banks may invest, allegedly ensuring that PDEx could legally source its funding from banks; BSP Circular No. 392 (2003), which imposed an additional requirement for a book entry of scripless securities where none was previously required, supposedly creating a business for PDTC; BSP Circular No. 428 (2004), which enumerated the prequalification requirements for a securities custodian and registry, allegedly giving figment of legitimacy to the operations of PDTC; BSP Circular Letter dated November 16, 2004, which authorized PDTC to perform securities custodianship and registry operations, giving license to PDTC to act as such despite being unqualified and despite being the only non-bank entity accredited by the BSP; BSP Circular No. 481 (2005), which deferred the implementation of the P650 million minimum capital requirement for non-bank financial institutions (NBFI) to operate as quasi-banks, allegedly favoring PDTC; BSP Circular No. 557 (2007), which lifted the moratorium in granting licenses to engage in quasi-banking activities, allegedly allowing PDTC to be licensed despite not being qualified; BSP's act of disallowing MART from participating in government securities trading, unlawfully depriving the latter of business; BSP and the National Treasurer's act of allowing PDEx and PDTC to electronically connect or interface with the Registry of Scripless Securities (ROSS)—the Bureau of Treasury (BTr)'s registry for government securities—allegedly forcing trading participants to use the PDEx trading system and consolidating the PDS Group's monopoly; BSP and the National Treasurer's act of allowing PDTC and PSSC to electronically connect or interface with the Philippine Payment and Settlement System (PhilPaSS)—a payment system owned and operated by the BSP—allegedly consolidating the PDS Group's monopoly; SEC's act of regulating government securities, allegedly amounting to grave abuse of discretion as the Securities Regulation Code (SRC) covers regulation of private securities only; SEC's grant of license to PDEx as a Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO)—an organization or association registered under the SRC that is empowered to make and enforce its own rules among its members—allegedly enabling PDEx to enter such market and establish a monopoly therein; SEC Memorandum Circular No. 14, or the Rules Governing the OTC Market (OTC Rules), which ""have been so crafted at the instigation of PDEx as to effectively preclude any other organization x x x from setting up such an SRO;"" and The Secretary of Finance's and the National Treasurer's abdication of their duties when they allowed the SEC to encroach upon their regulatory powers over government securities. In their petition, petitioners also lay down the following arguments: First, that government securities are outside the power of the SEC to regulate, since the securities defined in the SRC refer only to securities issued by private corporations, by private commercial enterprises, and by private profit-making ventures. Second, that SEC exceeded its jurisdiction with grave abuse of discretion when it licensed PDEx to be the marketplace or facility for the OTC market in government securities and to be the SRO in the said OTC market concurrently with its exchange operations. Third, that SEC committed grave abuse of discretion when after it agreed with petitioners through correspondence with petitioner Villafuerte: (1) that PDEx could not compel trading participants to join PDEx as its member, (2) that PDEx could not compel participants to course their trade exclusively in the PDEx trading system; and (3) that trading participants may course their transactions in other trading platforms, SEC still continued to allow PDEx to enforce Section 6 of the OTC Rules requiring that no broker or dealer shall participate in an OTC market unless he or she is a member of a registered SRO. Fourth, that PDEx could not compulsorily charge ad valorem mapping fees. Fifth, that the BSP committed grave abuse of discretion when it temporarily lifted the minimum capital requirement of P650 million for NBFIs in order to grant quasi-banking and trust licenses to PDTC, a subsidiary of the monopolistic PDS Group. Sixth, that the Secretary of Finance, through the BTr, committed grave abuse of discretion when PDTC was unlawfully allowed to connect and have access to ROSS, the official public record of ownership or interest in government securities at the primary market and of the transfers through the secondary market by and among government securities eligible dealers. Last, that BSP, as operator of PhilPaSS, committed grave abuse of discretion when, in concert with the Secretary of Finance, it allowed PSSC (a private entity) to intervene for a fee in the settlement of government securities transactions.",The petition suffers from procedural infirmities. We dismiss.,"Petitioners have no legal standing. Among the requisites for judicial review is legal standing or locus standi, which is the ""right of appearance in a court of justice on a given question."" To possess legal standing, parties must show ""a personal and substantial interest in the case such that [they have] sustained or will sustain direct injury as a result of the governmental act that is being challenged."" Here, petitioners state that they are former legislators, former national treasurers, and a former budget secretary and economics professor, who all maintain a continuing interest in the subject of the petition in view of their advocacies and prior government positions. However, this allegation by itself does not satisfy the requirement of standing. None of the exceptions (taxpayer suit, concerned citizens/transcendental importance, or third-party standing on behalf of BAP member-banks) apply. As taxpayers, their claim that public money used to finance ROSS was deflected to an improper and illegal purpose does not meet the requirement that the disbursement itself was illegal. As citizens/advocates, they failed to show a clear or obvious disregard of the relevant constitutional provision on monopoly, which is regulated, not prohibited per se. Further, there are other parties with a more direct and specific interest (participants in the markets or MART). Lastly, petitioners were unable to establish the necessary legal standing to file the instant Petition. Petitioners violated the constitutional filtering mechanism of hierarchy of courts. Here, petitioners filed the case directly before this Court despite the concurrent jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals and the Regional Trial Courts to issue the writs of certiorari and prohibition they pray for. Direct recourse to this Court is proper only to seek resolution of questions of law. Some of the issues here are not purely legal. Petitioners ask this Court to nullify the various rules, orders, issuances, and acts of public respondents for essentially perpetuating the alleged monopoly of the PDS Group, and the existence of a monopoly is a question of fact. Even the legal issues are inextricably intertwined with underlying questions of fact (e.g., comparing the specifications of the PDEx trading system with the specifications described in the OTC Rules). The need to bring this case before a trial court is amplified by the dynamic nature of the securities market, as shown by developments (MART licensed as an SRO, ROSS upgraded to NROSS) which may render some issues moot. When a question before the Court involves determination of a factual issue indispensable to the resolution of the legal issue, the Court will refuse to resolve the question regardless of the allegation or invocation of compelling reasons, such as the transcendental or paramount importance of the case. Such question must first be brought before the proper trial courts or the CA, both of which are specially equipped to try and resolve factual questions.","WHEREFORE, this Court resolves to DISMISS the petition. The Motion to Withdraw as Petitioner of Benjamin E. Diokno is GRANTED. Respondent Bankers' Association of the Philippines' compliance with the Move in the Premises Resolution dated March 3, 2020 is DISPENSED WITH. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 221201, March 29, 2022","ATTY. VICTOR AGUINALDO, PETITIONER, VS. NEW BILIBID PRISON (BUREAU OF CORRECTIONS), DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, BUREAU OF JAIL MANAGEMENT AND PENOLOGY, DIFFERENT MUNICIPAL, CITY AND PROVINCIAL JAILS IN THE PHILIPPINES, AND ENLISTED VOTERS OF THE NEW BILIBID PRISON, AND/OR DETAINEES, RESPONDENTS.","On March 6, 2012, COMELEC promulgated Resolution No. 9371. Among its key provisions, this issuance defined persons deprived of liberty (PDL) who are eligible to register and vote, constituted a Committee on PDL Voting, laid down the guidelines for registration and voting, designated special polling places inside jails, and constituted a Special Board of Election Inspectors and their support staff. Since certain PDLs are statutorily denied the right to vote, Rule 1, Section 2(a) of Resolution No. 9371, which applies to PDLs qualified to register and vote (qualified PDLs), provides that: Persons Deprived of Liberty — Refers to any person: (1) confined in jail, formally charged for any crime/s and awaiting/undergoing trial; or (2) serving a sentence of imprisonment for less than one (1) year; or (3) whose conviction of a crime involving disloyalty to the duly constituted government such as rebellion, sedition, violation of the firearms laws or any crime against national security or for any other crime is on appeal. In this petition, Atty. Aguinaldo assails the validity of Resolution No. 9371 as it failed to provide for its own implementing rules and regulations, did not undergo prior public consultations, violates the equal protection of laws by favoring PDL voters over other classes of voters, and fails to address certain operational and logistical blind spots, ultimately praying: WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, PETITIONER respectfully prays of this Honorable Court that respondents, and/or all government agencies tasked to implement COMELEC Resolution No. 9371 be RESTRAINED, ENJOINED, and/or PROHIBITED from applying the said law; and thus, not allowing all the detainees in the entire Philippines to register and vote in the 2016 coming elections unless clear parameters or guidelines have been set as to cover all circumstances or incidents on detainee registration and voting. Further, it is hereby prayed that the afore-cited provisions of COMELEC Resolution No. 9371 be declared as UNCONSTITUTIONAL because of their imperfections, inadequacies, and deficiencies in its applications; and thus, creating uncertainties, loopholes, gaps, and ambiguities in its provisions, application, and/or implementation. Unless COMELEC Resolution No. 9371 has been AMENDED, REVISITED and REVISED, the same should be declared as UNCONSTITUTIONAL OR OF NO FORCE AND EFFECT. On behalf of respondents COMELEC, New Bilibid Prison, Bureau of Corrections (BuCor), Department of Justice, Bureau of Jail Management and Penology, and Different Municipal, City and Provincial Jails in the Philippines, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) submitted a Comment dated February 3, 2016, arguing that petitioner filed a procedurally flawed petition, and that he failed to rebut Resolution No. 9371's presumed constitutionality. Subsequently, the Court, in an April 19, 2016 Resolution, partially granted petitioner's prayer for injunctive relief insofar as Resolution No. 9371 would impact the conduct of the 2016 Local Elections. However, the same Resolution allowed qualified PDLs to vote on the National Level: WHEREFORE, the Court PARTIALLY GRANTS the application for a TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER and ENJOINS the Commission on Elections and the other respondents from applying the following provisions on the May 9, 2016 elections on the LOCAL LEVEL: (i) Rule 1, Section 1; (ii) Rule 1, Section 2(a) and (c); Rule 2, Section 3; (iii) Rule 3, Section 1; and (iv) Rule 7, Section 1 of COMELEC Resolution No. 9371. This Temporary Restraining Order is NOT APPLICABLE to the May 9, 2016 elections on the NATIONAL LEVEL. Detainees are, if they so choose, ALLOWED to vote on the National Level. On May 3, 2016, prompted by the Court's injunction, the COMELEC promulgated Resolution No. 10113, General Instructions on the Conduct of Counting and Canvassing of Ballots of Persons Deprived of Liberty (PDL) Voters with Votes Cast in Favor of Local Candidates in Connection with the May 9, 2016 National and Local Elections. The 2016 National and Local Elections then proceeded in due course. On March 13, 2019, the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) sought to intervene as amicus curiae and submitted an Amicus Curiae Brief for the Court's consideration. In its brief, the CHR asserted its mandate to ensure the fulfillment of the human rights of persons deprived of liberty and argued, among other points, that granting the petition would deprive qualified PDLs of their right to electoral participation. Thus the CHR prayed for the dismissal of the petition. Seeing as respondents Enlisted Voters of New Bilibid Prison and/or Detainees (Enlisted Voters) had yet to participate in the instant proceedings, the Court issued a March 3, 2020 Resolution, requiring said respondents to comment on the petition. As custodian of the enlisted PDL voters, the BuCor filed a Manifestation dated September 30, 2020, asking the Court to direct the COMELEC to furnish the BuCor a list of the PDL voters who participated in the 2016 Elections. This way, the BuCor could facilitate the preparation and filing of the enlisted PDL voters' comment. The Court issued such an order in a May 4, 2021 Resolution, to which the COMELEC asked for an extension to comply. With the imminent 2022 National and Local Elections, and considering that respondents Enlisted Voters' participation on the local level hinges on a resolution of this petition, the Court resolves to dispense with the filing of their comment. At any rate, the OSG's Comment on behalf of the other respondents presents exhaustive arguments on the issue of legality of the assailed COMELEC Resolution.","After a judicious review of the allegations, issues, and arguments adduced by the parties, the Court dismisses the instant petition for failing to establish the requisites of judicial review.","The Court's power of judicial review may be exercised in constitutional cases only if all the following requisites are complied with: (i) the existence of an actual and appropriate case or controversy; (ii) a personal and substantial interest of the party raising the constitutional question; (iii) the exercise of judicial review is pleaded at the earliest opportunity; and (iv) the constitutional question is the lis mota of the case. Deplorably, petitioner did not even bother to establish the foregoing requisites. Fatally absent in the instant petition are the requisites of an actual case or controversy, and petitioner's locus standi. As defined, an actual case or controversy is one that involves a conflict of legal rights, an assertion of opposite legal claims susceptible of judicial resolution; the case must not be moot or academic or based on extra-legal or other similar considerations not cognizable by a court of justice. Clearly, the existence of an actual clash between legal rights brought about by the assailed act is required before courts of justice may exercise the power of judicial review. In Provincial Bus Operators Association of the Philippines v. Department of Labor and Employment, therein petitioner likewise assailed the constitutionality of a Department of Labor and Employment administrative rule. The Court dismissed the petition for failing to present an actual case or controversy, ruling that 'for there to be a real conflict between the parties, there must exist actual facts from which courts can properly determine whether there has been a breach of constitutional text.' Else, the Court would only be rendering an advisory opinion, which is: x x x one where the factual setting is conjectural or hypothetical. In such cases, the conflict will not have sufficient concreteness or adversariness so as to constrain the discretion of this Court. After all, legal arguments from concretely lived facts are chosen narrowly by the parties. Those who bring theoretical cases will have no such limits. They can argue up to the level of absurdity. They will bind the future parties who may have more motives to choose specific legal arguments. It was thus important for petitioner to show the effect of the assailed COMELEC Resolution on him, how it may have diminished his legal rights, i.e., the actual facts that would ground the COMELEC Resolution's supposed unconstitutionality. Petitioner had not shown any such circumstances. Absent a clear showing of a diminished right for which petitioner will suffer because of the implementation of the assailed COMELEC Resolution, it cannot be said that a conflict of legal rights exists. On this score alone, the instant petition is already dismissible. Still, regarding locus standi, petitioner merely stated his standing as 'a citizen, lawyer and taxpayer' without further elaborating on the same. When suing as a citizen, the petitioner must be able to show not only that the law or any government act is invalid, but also that he sustained, or is in imminent danger of sustaining, some direct injury as a result of its enforcement, and not merely that he suffers thereby in some indefinite way. Alternatively, in assailing the constitutionality of a governmental act, petitioners suing as citizens may dodge the requirement of having to establish a direct and personal interest if they show that the act affects a public right. Mere mention of being a citizen, without sufficiently alleging nor establishing how the implementation of Resolution No. 9371 would affect him or any supposed public right, fails to establish citizens' standing to invoke the Court's exercise of judicial review. Parties suing as taxpayers must specifically prove sufficient interest in preventing the illegal expenditure of money raised by taxation. Apart from the glaring omission of these requisite assertions, petitioner overlooks that Resolution No. 9371 is not a disbursement measure, but, rather, outlines the procedure and logistics for the registration and voting of PDLs. Finally, on standing as a lawyer, the mere invocation of the duty to preserve the rule of law does not suffice to clothe members of the bar with standing. Even more so must petitioner's claim of lawyers' standing fail, considering that he did not substantiate this allegation. As a general rule, the challenger must have a personal and substantial interest in the case such that he has sustained, or will sustain, direct injury as a result of its enforcement. Petitioner's material averments fail to show how he stands to be affected by the implementation of Resolution No. 9371. He does not appear to be a PDL voter covered by the COMELEC issuance, or an official tasked with implementing its provisions. Essentially, petitioner has no interest in this supposed controversy. As firmly and consistently held by the Court, locus standi requires a personal stake in the outcome of a controversy for significant reasons. It assures adverseness and sharpens the presentation of issues for the illumination of the Court in resolving difficult constitutional questions. As the petitioner failed to meet the requisites of judicial review, the Court sees no need to delve into the substantive issues raised.","WHEREFORE, the instant petition is DISMISSED. The Temporary Restraining Order issued on April 19, 2016 is LIFTED thereby allowing the Commission on Elections to fully implement Resolution No. 9371 in the upcoming and succeeding elections."

LAQUINDANUM, DIRECTOR IV, CORPORATE GOVERNMENT SECTOR CLUSTER 3-PUBLIC UTILITIES; EYREN MARANAN­-YULDE, IN HER CAPACITY AS MWSS-CO RESIDENT COA AUDITOR; AND ANGELA B. BULOS, AUDIT TEAM LEADER, RESPONDENTS.","Petitioners are current and former employees and officials of the MWSS­-CO. In 2012 and 2013, they approved and/or received varying amounts representing meal allowances, purportedly granted pursuant to board resolutions of the MWSS Board of Trustees (MWSS Board). Subsequently, the Audit Team Leader and Supervising Auditor of the COA issued four notices of disallowance (NDs) against said payments in the aggregate amount of P8,173,730.00. The NDs stated that the payment and increase of meal allowances had no legal basis. As to the meal allowance given to incumbents as of 30 June 1989, the COA noted that the amounts paid were in excess of the meal allowance of P66.00 per month. As to non-incumbents of positions as of 30 June 1989, the COA emphasized that they are not entitled to any meal allowance. Petitioners appealed to the Office of the Cluster Director of the COA's Corporate Government Sector, Cluster 3 (Public Utilities). They argued that the MWSS Charter vests the MWSS Board of Trustees with the requisite power and autonomy to grant employee benefits. The COA Cluster Director affirmed the NDs. Petitioners then elevated the matter to the COA Proper via a petition for review. The COA Proper denied the petition for review and sustained the NDs, finding the petition filed out of time and without merit, leading to this petition for certiorari.","In its Decision No. 2019-09 dated 20 February 2019, the COA Proper denied the petition for review and sustained the NDs, thus: WHEREFORE , premises considered, the Petition for Review is hereby DENIED for having been filed out of time and for lack of merit. Accordingly, Commission on Audit Corporate Government Sector-Cluster 3 Decision No. 2016-08 dated March 31, 2016, which affirmed Notice of Disallowance Nos. 14-005-05-(12), 14-006-05-(12), 14-007-05-(13), and 14-008-05-(13), all dated June 30, 2014, on the payment to the officials and employees of Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System of meal allowance for calendar years 2012 and 2013, in the total amount of P8,173,730.00, is FINAL and EXECUTORY.","The Court found that the petition was filed out of time; nevertheless, substantive justice demands a relaxation of the rules. The COA Proper did not gravely abuse its discretion in sustaining the disallowances; the authority of the MWSS Board is circumscribed by prevailing laws and regulations on salaries and benefits, and the grant of allowances beyond the limits or to non-incumbents was ultra vires under RA 6758, lacking prior Presidential approval. The payees are required to return the amounts they received pursuant to the principle of solutio indebiti, as none of the exceptions under the Madera Rules apply, since the grant had no legal basis. Those who only certified on the completeness of supporting documents and the availability of funds (classified as (b) under the NDs) are excused from solidary liability (ministerial duty). Officers who certified the expenses as necessary/lawful, approved the payments, or were part of the MWSS Board (classified as (a), (c), and (d)) are solidarily liable for the net disallowed amounts, having been found to have acted in gross negligence/bad faith. However, the Court modified the cut-off date for determining incumbency from 30 June 1989 to 01 July 1989.","WHEREFORE, the petition is PARTLY GRANTED. The Decision No. 2019-019 dated 20 February 2019 and Resolution No. 2020-038 dated 21 January 2020 of the Commission on Audit Proper is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATIONS, in that: (1) For purposes of determining incumbency, the cut-off date used in Notice of Disallowance Nos. 14-005-05-(12), 14-006-05-(12), 14-007-05-(13), and 14-008-05-(13) should be MODIFIED from 30 June 1989 to 01 July 1989, as provided under Section 12 of Republic Act No. 6758; and (2) Officers who only certified the completeness of supporting documents and the availability of funds, or those classified as (b) under the Notices of Disallowance, are EXONERATED from their solidary liability to return the disallowed amounts. All other approving/certifying officers, or those classified as (a), (c), and (d) under the Notices of Disallowance, are solidarily liable for the disallowed amounts. All passive recipients, including the approving/certifying officers who had received the disallowed amounts in their capacity as payees, are liable only for the amounts they received.

"G.R. No. 203876, March 29, 2022","ABS-CBN CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. CLARA L. MAGNO, RESPONDENT.","ABS-CBN Corporation (ABS-CBN) is a company engaged in the business of broadcasting television and radio programs in the Philippines. Respondent Clara L. Magno (Magno) was employed by ABS-CBN since 1992 and served as a Production Assistant and eventually a Video Tape Recorder (VTR) Playback Operator for its various programs. In 2002, ABS-CBN created the Internal Job Market (IJM) system for accredited technical/creative manpower. In January 2002, Magno was placed under the IJM system as a VTR Playback Operator without her consent. One program Magno worked on was Wowowee hosted by Willie Revillame (Revillame). When Revillame eventually left ABS-CBN, Magno was assigned to the replacement show, Pilipinas Win na Win! (PWNW). Magno attended a dinner hosted by Revillame. Magno claimed that her superiors learned about this, were angered, and forced her to resign for being unworthy and disloyal to the network. She therefore filed her Resignation Letter dated August 16, 2010. Magno alleged she was constructively dismissed when ABS-CBN stopped giving her any work assignments and cancelled her active program assignments, forcing her to take on work in another television network (Revillame’s new show “Willing Willie”). Magno filed a Complaint dated September 13, 2010 against ABS-CBN for illegal dismissal, regularization, and monetary claims. Magno argued she was a regular employee and was constructively dismissed. ABS-CBN argued that Magno was an independent contractor hired through the IJM system, over whom it did not exercise control, and that she voluntarily resigned, hence the Complaint should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction and lack of cause of action.","The Labor Arbiter (LA) rendered a Decision dismissing Magno's Complaint for lack of cause of action and/or lack of merit, ruling that she was not a regular employee as she failed to prove ABS-CBN exercised the determinative element of control. The National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) affirmed the LA Decision. The Court of Appeals (CA) rendered a Decision granting Magno's petition for certiorari, reversing and setting aside the NLRC rulings. The CA concluded that Magno was a regular employee of ABS-CBN, having rendered necessary and desirable services for over 18 years, and held that she was constructively dismissed because her resignation letter only covered the PWNW program, and ABS-CBN illegally prohibited her from working on other shows. The CA ordered ABS-CBN to reinstate Magno, pay her appropriate backwages, P20,000.00 as moral damages, P10,000.00 as exemplary damages, and 10% of her total money award as attorney's fees.","The Supreme Court found the petition partially meritorious. The Court ruled that Magno is a regular employee of ABS-CBN, guided by prevailing jurisprudence (Del Rosario v. ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation), which established an employer-employee relationship between ABS-CBN and IJM talents like Magno, who performed functions necessary and desirable to its business. However, the Court ruled that Magno failed to prove that she was constructively dismissed. Her claim of forced resignation was utterly unsubstantiated, and her amiable resignation letter and subsequent statements in a Complaint-in-Intervention filed with her colleagues suggested she voluntarily resigned to follow Revillame. Because Magno was not illegally dismissed, the CA's grant of backwages and other monetary claims must be reversed. Although not constructively dismissed, the Court held Magno did not abandon her job, meaning the employment relationship was never actually severed. ABS-CBN was therefore ordered to accept her back to work.","WHEREFORE, the petition for review on certiorari is GRANTED. The Decision dated June 29, 2012 and the Resolution dated October 5, 2012 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 123028 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Respondent ABS-CBN Corporation is ORDERED to reinstate respondent Clara L. Magno to her former position without payment of backwages or other monetary claims."
"G.R. No. 194310, March 29, 2022","FELICITAS AGUILAR BOLLOZOS, PETITIONER, VS. HEIRS OF LUISA ABRIO VDA. DE AGUILAR REPRESENTED BY FLORENTINO DIPUTADO, RESPONDENTS.","On December 28, 2007, respondent Florentino Diputado (respondent Diputado), in his capacity as the named executor in the will, filed a Verified Petition for the probate of the will of Luisa Abrio Vda. de Aguilar (Vda. de Aguilar) before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Misamis Oriental, Branch 17. The RTC set the petition for hearing on February 13, 2008, required all interested parties to appear, and ordered the publication of the same Order once a week for three (3) consecutive weeks. On January 28, 2008, the petitioner, claiming to be the daughter and the sole surviving heir of Vda. de Aguilar filed an Opposition with Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction grounded on non-payment of the proper docket fees. The RTC issued a Resolution dated October 23, 2008 denying the petitioner's Opposition. Thereafter, the petitioner filed two motions: first, seeking reconsideration of the October 23, 2008 Resolution, and second, a Motion to Make Definite Appraisal of Estate Value which was filed on February 27, 2009. Both motions were denied by the RTC in its Orders dated March 10, 2009 and April 21, 2009, respectively. The petitioner then filed a petition for certiorari before the CA assailing the Orders dated March 10, 2009 and April 21, 2009, alleging the RTC committed grave abuse of discretion when it assumed jurisdiction despite the respondent's deficient payment of docket fees (based on P1,000,000.00 declared value instead of P6,595,616.00 market value) and defective publication (no republication after postponement of hearing). The CA, through its Resolution dated June 30, 2009 denied due course to the petition on account of petitioner's failure to file a motion for reconsideration before resorting to a special civil action for certiorari. On September 23, 2010, the CA denied the petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration. Thus, petitioner filed this petition for review on certiorari.","The petition is not meritorious.
WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant petition for review on certiorari is DENIED.","The Court finds that the non-filing of a motion for reconsideration of the RTC orders before the CA was not fatal in this case, as two exceptions apply: the questions raised were already duly raised and passed upon by the RTC, and the issue raised regarding republication is one purely of law. However, the Court finds no reason to reverse the Orders of the RTC. On the matter of docket fees, the RTC acquired jurisdiction because it is undisputed that the respondents paid in full, the amount of docket fees assessed by the clerk of court on the basis of the value stated in the verified petition. Fraudulent intent cannot be presumed, and the definitive assessment of value for the purpose of computing the correct amount of docket fees need not be done during the commencement of the proceedings, but prior to its cessation, should the appraised value be greater than the declared amount. With respect to the issue of publication, the requirement is mandatory and jurisdictional only for the initial notice. The initial publication satisfied the in rem nature of probate proceedings, notifying all persons of the verified petition. That the hearing date indicated in the notice did not push through is beside the point, and any subsequent development is easily verifiable, thus republication is not required.","The Resolution dated October 23, 2008 and Orders dated March 10, 2009 and April 21, 2009 of the Regional Trial Court of Misamis Oriental, Branch 17, are hereby AFFIRMED."
"G.R. Nos. 249351-52, March 29, 2022","EDNA LUISA B. SIMON, PETITIONER, VS. THE RESULTS COMPANIES AND JOSELITO SUMCAD, RESPONDENTS.","The instant case stemmed from the Complaint dated October 18, 2016 filed by Edna Luisa B. Simon (petitioner) against The Results Companies (Results), a corporation engaged in business process outsourcing (BPO), and Joselito Sumcad for illegal dismissal, underpayment of salaries, nonpayment of separation pay, and discrimination; with claims for moral damages, exemplary damages, and attorney's fees. In her Position Paper, petitioner alleged that Results hired her as a Customer Service Representative on October 6, 2012 until it forced her to resign on December 13, 2012. To prove her employment, she submitted copies of her identification card and payslips. In defense, Results averred in its Position Paper that after being notified of petitioner's Complaint, it conducted a thorough search of her employment records but found none. Results attributed petitioner's lack of employment records to her short stint of service in the company, which was only two months and seven days, and the fact that she filed her complaint four years after her alleged dismissal from service. Results argued that petitioner's allegation of being forced to resign was incredible and that her separation was possibly brought by her voluntary resignation or absence without official leave (AWOL). In the Decision dated January 31, 2017, the LA ruled in favor of petitioner and held that Results illegally dismissed her from employment, but, considering petitioner was a mere probationary employee, she was entitled to backwages only for the remaining months of her probationary period. The LA further held that petitioner's monetary claims already prescribed. The NLRC, in the Decision dated March 21, 2017, agreed with the LA that petitioner was a probationary employee of Results and that she was illegally dismissed from employment, although it adjusted the rate of her backwages from P13,500.00 to P15,200.00 a month. The CA, in the assailed Decision dated March 28, 2019, reversed and set aside the ruling of the NLRC, holding that petitioner was actually a regular employee of Results. However, the CA ruled that she failed to prove the fact of her dismissal from employment and held that 'the present case falls under a situation wherein there is neither dismissal nor abandonment. There being no dismissal nor abandonment to speak of, the status quo between employer and employee should be maintained as a matter of course.' Thus, the CA ordered Results to reinstate petitioner to her previous position without payment of backwages.","WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated March 28, 2019 and the Resolution dated September 12, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP Nos. 151219 and 151323 are hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION.","The Court agrees with the CA that petitioner was deemed a regular employee of Results by operation of law because Results failed to communicate the standards for her regularization at the time of her engagement. However, the CA erred in concluding that petitioner was not able to prove the fact of her dismissal. The Court agrees with the labor tribunals that Simon was indeed illegally dismissed from employment, finding substantial evidence, including SMS conversations with her supervisor, that she was included in the list of non-rehirable call center agents. Since petitioner was born on August 19, 1955, and is now over the compulsory retirement age of 65 (as of August 19, 2020), reinstatement is no longer possible. The Court grants her separation pay in lieu of reinstatement. Consequently, the computation of her backwages should be from the time of her illegal dismissal on December 13, 2012 up to her compulsory retirement age on August 19, 2020. The Court finds that petitioner was not entitled to moral and exemplary damages as there was no proof her dismissal was tainted with some moral obliquity. However, for having been compelled to litigate, petitioner is entitled to reasonable attorney's fees at the rate of 10% of the total monetary award pursuant to Article 2208(2) of the Civil Code. The total monetary award shall earn legal interest rate of 6% per annum reckoned from the finality of this Decision until its full payment.","Respondent The Results Companies is declared liable for illegal dismissal and is ordered to pay petitioner Edna Luisa B. Simon separation pay, in lieu of her reinstatement; backwages computed from the time of her dismissal on December 13, 2012 up to her compulsory retirement on August 19, 2020; and attorney's fees at the rate of 10% of the total monetary award. The total monetary award shall earn legal interest rate of 6% per annum from the date of finality of this Decision until full satisfaction. The case is hereby REMANDED to the Labor Arbiter for the proper computation of the monetary awards."
"G.R. No. 250445, March 29, 2022","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. GEMMA FLORANTE ADANA, ROLAND CUENCA GRIJALVO, FELIX ABELANO TIMSAN, EMMANUEL FORTUNO ENTERIA, AND JONATHAN KEE CARTAGENA, ACCUSED-APPELLANTS.","The instant case stemmed from the Information filed in the Sandiganbayan charging accused-appellants (Gemma Florante Adana, then Municipal Mayor, and Roland Cuenca Grijalvo, Felix Abelano Timsan, Emmanuel Fortuno Enteria, and Jonathan Kee Cartagena, all BAC members) with violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019, the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, for the purchase of five heavy equipment from CVCK Trading for P8,800,000.00. The prosecution alleged that the procurement was irregular, citing six specific violations of RA 9184 and its IRR, including: (1) failure to publish the Invitation to Apply for Eligibility and to Bid (IAEB) in the PhilGEPS website; (2) failure to include the Approved Budget for the Contract (ABC) in the IAEB; (3) issuance of the Notice of Award before the approval of the BAC resolution declaring CVCK Trading as the lowest calculated responsive bid; and (4) subsequent amendment of the specifications of the Road Grader and Road Roller after the Notice of Award without conducting a rebidding. The defense admitted some procedural lapses (like PhilGEPS publication failure) but asserted that the ABC was public knowledge, denied the chronological error regarding the Notice of Award, and claimed the modified equipment was of superior quality at no additional cost to the municipality.","On July 31, 2019, the Sandiganbayan rendered the assailed Decision finding accused-appellants guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019, and are each sentenced to imprisonment for a minimum of six (6) years and one (1) month and a maximum of eight (8) years, with perpetual disqualification from public office. The Sandiganbayan ruled that they worked together as head of procuring entity and as members of the BAC to cause the acquisition of the subject heavy equipment without complying with the basic requirements of the procurement law, thereby giving CVCK Trading unwarranted benefits, advantages, or preference.","The Supreme Court noted that while procedural lapses were committed by accused-appellants in the conduct of the public bidding (including failure to disclose the ABC in the IAEB, failure to hold a pre-bid conference, and unauthorized modification of specifications after the Notice of Award), violations of procurement laws, on their own, do not automatically lead to conviction under Section 3(e) of RA 3019. Citing Martel v. People, the Court required proof beyond reasonable doubt that the accused acted with manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence, and that this caused undue injury or gave unwarranted benefits. The Court found that there was no sufficient evidence to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused-appellants acted with malicious and fraudulent intent. Furthermore, the Court found no undue injury (as the Municipality received superior equipment) and no sufficient proof that unwarranted benefits were accorded to CVCK Trading. Thus, the prosecution failed to establish the third and fourth elements of the crime.","The appeal is GRANTED. The Decision dated July 31, 2019 and the Resolution dated October 4, 2019 of the Sandiganbayan in SB-16-CRM-0317 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Accused-appellants Gemma Florante Adana, Roland Cuenca Grijalvo, Felix Abelano Timsan, Emmanuel Fortuno Enteria, and Jonathan Kee Cartagena are ACQUITTED for failure of the prosecution to prove their guilt beyond reasonable doubt."
"G.R. No. 250987, March 29, 2022","NOEL G. GUINTO, PETITIONER, VS. STO. NIÑO LONG-ZENY CONSIGNEE, ANGELO SALANGSANG, AND ZENAIDA SALANGSANG, RESPONDENTS.","On February 6, 2017, petitioner filed a Complaint[7] for illegal dismissal with prayer for the payment of separation pay and attorney's fees against respondents: Sto. Niño Long-Zeny Consignee (the Consignee); its owner Angelo Salangsang (Angelo); and his wife,[8] Zenaida Salangsang (Zenaida), the manager[9] of the Consignee (collectively, respondents).[10] Upon petitioner's Motion to Amend Complaint,[11] the Complaint was amended to include the nonpayment of service incentive leave pay and 13th month pay.[12] The Consignee is engaged in the brokerage/trading of various aquatic animals, including but not limited to crabs, shrimps, prawns, milkfish, and tilapia; and its place of business is located at the Orani Fishport in Orani, Bataan. Petitioner averred that he was an employee of respondents since August 1997. He initially occupied the position of warehouseman until he was appointed by respondents as a ""sizer,"" or one who selects, sorts, and arranges the aquatic animals according to their respective sizes until his termination in November 2015. From time to time, respondents directed petitioner to clean the trays used for their business, the office, and the warehouse of the Consignee.[13] Petitioner alleged that on November 27, 2015, at the house of Zenaida, the latter told him: ""Wag ka [nang] papasok at lumayas ka."" Petitioner, however, could not recall any reason or cause for such termination of his services. He added that the following morning, he received a text message from a certain ""Nam-Nam,"" Zenaida's representative, telling him: ""Pare, wag ka [nang] papasok pati ang anak mo sabi ni Ate.""[14] As mediation between the parties proved unsuccessful, petitioner filed the Complaint and asserted that he was respondents' regular employee based on the following pieces of evidence: (1) a Certification[15] issued by Angelo, pertinently stating that petitioner has been employed as a warehouseman of the Consignee ""from August 1997 up to present;"" (2) the work schedule posted at respondents' work premises; (3) the Sinumpaang Salaysay[16] of Rizalito G. Alfonso (Rizalito), a dispatcher of JC Garcia Consignee which is a similar and adjacent establishment to the Consignee, attesting that petitioner was respondents' employee; (4) the payslips issued by respondents in favor of petitioner; and (5) a Katunayan[17] executed by porters Alejandro Roman, Rodolfo Lopez, Crisanto Pena, Gil Santos, and Edgar Villanueva vouching that petitioner was an employee of respondents and not a member of any of the association of porters in the Orani Fishport. In the same affidavit, they attached a list of porters[18] associated with the Orani Fishport with a statement that petitioner was not included in the list because he was a regular employee of respondents.[19] Respondents vehemently denied petitioner's allegations. They asserted that: (1) there was no employer-employee relationship existing between them and petitioner; (2) petitioner was a porter at the Orani Fishport; and (3) while porters and sizers normally grouped together and were associated with the consignation of their choice, they have never been considered as under the employ of such consignation.[20] To prove that petitioner was not their employee, respondents presented the following pieces of evidence: (1) the joint affidavit of porters Romano Lopez and Godofredo Reyes attesting to the fact that petitioner was not an employee of respondents because he was a porter/sizer at the Orani Fishport who rendered his services to other fishpond owners other than herein respondents; (2) the joint affidavit of porters Armando Guinto, Joel Guinto, and Sonny Guinto, petitioner's own father and brothers, who pertinently vouched that petitioner is actually a nephew of Zenaida, and as porters/sizers, they were not employees of the fishpond owners; and (3) the Consignee's applications for mayor's permit for several years which stated that respondents only had two regular employees, namely: Ricardo Salangsang and Donato Decena.[21] Still, petitioner insisted that he was a regular employee of respondents as clearly stated in the Certification issued by Angelo himself. He argued that a porter is one who transports aquatic animals from the boat or truck of a fishpond owner to the consignation; hence, the position is different from a sizer. As he was respondents' sizer and not a porter, he asserted that he was terminated from his employment in view of Zenaida's verbal instruction for him not to report to work and the subsequent text message he received stating that he was no longer allowed to do so. As such, petitioner argued that his dismissal was illegal because it was made without cause and due process. Thus, he prayed for the payment of separation pay and backwages. On his monetary claims, petitioner averred that as a regular employee, he was entitled to the payment of service incentive leave pay and 13th month pay, from the time he was hired by respondents until his illegal dismissal. He also sought the payment of exemplary damages and attorney's fees.[22] Respondents countered that: (1) the Certification presented by petitioner was merely an ""accommodation document"" which was executed by Angelo at petitioner's own request to support the latter's purported application for employment abroad; (2) the identification card (ID) presented by Rizalito effectively disproved petitioner's own claim of employment with respondents as the latter's own employees presented their own IDs while petitioner failed to do so; and (3) the handwritten notes submitted by petitioner did not prove the payment of salaries as the notes are classified as ""cuenta,"" or bills that porters earn as a group which they eventually divide among themselves. Thus, respondents prayed for the dismissal of petitioner's Complaint.[23] Ruling of the LA In the Decision[24] dated October 18, 2017, the LA held that petitioner was indeed respondent's employee based on the Certification issued by Angelo that he presented in evidence. The LA discarded respondents' explanation that the certification was issued by way of an accommodation as they cannot vary the very wording of the document without violating the rules on evidence. As to the issue of illegal dismissal, the LA opined that respondents had interposed no other defense aside from their denial that petitioner was not their employee. As such, the LA concluded that petitioner was illegally dismissed from his employment, and was thus entitled to the payment of service incentive leave pay and 13th month pay.[25] The LA decreed: WHEREFORE, premises considered, complainant is found to have been illegally dismissed even as respondents are held liable therefor. Thus, respondents are hereby ordered to pay complainant his full backwages from the time of his illegal dismissed until the finality of this decision, initially computed at this time at Php194,652.50. Respondents are likewise ordered to pay complainant's separation pay of Php156,000.00, service incentive leave pay of Php4,500.00, 13th month pay of Php23,400.00 and 10% attorney's fee of Php37,855.25. All other claims are dismissed for lack of merit. So Ordered.[26] Aggrieved, respondents appealed to the NLRC.[27] Ruling of the NLRC In the Decision[28] dated May 2, 2018, the NLRC agreed with the LA that petitioner was a regular employee of respondents considering the certification, affidavits of witnesses, work schedule, attendance sheet, and payslips he submitted in evidence. It pointed out that respondents had exercised control over petitioner who worked within its premises and received instruction and guidance from them; and petitioner occupied a position that was usually necessary or desirable in the usual trade or business of respondents.[29] However, the NLRC reversed the LA's finding of illegal dismissal in the case because, other than petitioner's bare claims, he failed to adduce corroborating evidence to prove that he was actually dismissed from employment by respondents.[30] Thus, it ruled that the appropriate remedy was petitioner's reinstatement without backwages and the award of service incentive leave pay in his favor as respondents failed to show proof of payment thereof. Anent the matter of the 13th month pay benefit, the NLRC held that petitioner was not entitled thereto as he himself claimed that he was paid on a commission basis. Lastly, it also awarded petitioner attorney's fees equivalent to 10% of the total award considering that he was compelled to litigate and incur expenses to protect his rights and interest.[31] Hence, the NLRC disposed of the case in this wise: WHEREFORE, the Labor Arbiter's decision is set aside and a new one entered dismissing the complaint for illegal dismissal for lack of merit. However, respondents are ordered to reinstate complainant to his former position but without backwages. The awards of separation pay and 13th month pay are deleted. Respondents are ordered to pay complainant his service incentives leave pay in the amount of Php4,500.00 and 10% attorney's fees. SO ORDERED.[32] Petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration,[33] but the NLRC denied it in its Resolution[34] dated June 20, 2018 for lack of merit. Aggrieved, petitioner filed a Petition for Certiorari[35] before the CA. Ruling of the CA In the Decision[36] dated May 24, 2019, the CA dismissed the petition and sustained in all aspects the Decision dated May 2, 2018 and the Resolution dated June 20, 2018 of the NLRC.[37] The CA, quoting the ruling of the NLRC, found no cogent reason to depart from the findings of the LA and the NLRC that petitioner was a regular employee of respondents, viz.: For the Commission, the pieces of evidence submitted by complainant, taken together, proves that he was a regular employee of complainant since 1997. First, the certificate of employment issued by the respondents clearly states that he was their employee as early as 1997. Second, assuming that [the] certificate of employment was merely an accomodation [sic] document, the affidavit of Mr. Alfonso collaborated the contents of the certificate of employment. Third, the affidavits of Messrs. Roman, Lopez, Pena, Santos and Villanueva controverted the affidavits of respondents' witnesses. The affidavits of complainant's witnesses, together with the work schedule, attendance sheet, and payslips submitted by the complainant substantially supported complainant's claim that he was an employee of respondents. Lastly, the element of control was also present because complainant performed his work within the premises of respondents, at the instruction and guidance of the same. In sum, complainant was a regular employee of respondents because he occupied a position that was usually necessary or desirable in the usual business or trade of respondents.[38] As to the issue of whether petitioner was illegally dismissed, the CA upheld the NLRC's finding that petitioner had failed to discharge his burden of proving his claim of dismissal from work. It pointed out that petitioner's filing of a complaint for illegal dismissal does not ipso facto prove that he was actually terminated from his employment.[39] The CA also affirmed the LA and the NLRC's unanimous ruling that petitioner was entitled to receive his service incentive leave pay considering that respondents failed to present evidence on the issue. However, it agreed with the NLRC that petitioner was not entitled to receive 13th month pay from respondents because he was paid on a purely commission basis.[40] Lastly, the CA affirmed the NLRC's ruling as regards petitioner's reinstatement instead of the award of separation pay in lieu thereof. It relied on the pronouncement of the Court in Pu-od v. Ablaze Builders, Inc.[41] citing Borja v. Miñoza[42] that ""in instances where there was neither dismissal by the employer nor abandonment by the employee, the proper remedy is to reinstate the employee to his former position, but without the award of backwages.""[43] The dispositive portion of the Decision provides: WHEREFORE, premises considered, the petition is DISMISSED. Accordingly, the May 2, 2018 Decision and the June 20, 2018 Resolution of public respondent National Labor Relations Commission (First Division) in NLRC-LAC Case No. 01-000157-18 (NLRC Case No. RAB-III-02-25235-17) are hereby SUSTAINED in all aspects. SO ORDERED.[44] Petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the CA Decision, but the CA denied it in its Resolution[45] dated December 12, 2019. Hence, the petition. The Petition Petitioner maintains that because respondents did not question the findings of the CA and the NLRC that he was respondents' regular employee, such findings had already attained finality. Thus, petitioner's status as a regular employee can no longer be questioned on appeal.[46] Petitioner also argues as follows: First, he was illegally dismissed from employment. Similar to the circumstances in the case of Fernandez v. Kalookan Slaughterhouse Incorporated[47] (Fernandez), herein respondents, too, failed to specifically deny and rebut the allegations as to his dismissal from work. Thus, based on Section 11, Rule 8 of the Rules of Court, respondents' silence on the matter is deemed as an admission that he was actually dismissed on November 27, 2015. He would not have filed a complaint against respondents if not for the fact that he was indeed illegally terminated from his employment.[48] Second, he is entitled to the payment of his full backwages given his illegal dismissal from work as well as separation pay in lieu of reinstatement, in view of the evident strained relations between the parties and considering that his reinstatement would only perpetuate the unlawful act of respondents against him.[49] Third, he is entitled to the awards of service incentive leave pay, 13th month pay, moral and exemplary damages, and attorney's fees. Significantly, Presidential Decree No. (PD) 851,[50] which mandates all employers to pay their employees 13th month pay, includes within its coverage those who are paid on a piece-rate basis such as himself.[51] As to attorney's fees, he was compelled to litigate and incur expenses in filing his petition.[52] Finally, Angelo and Zenaida should be held solidarity liable with the Consignee in the payment of the monetary awards in his favor considering their presumed knowledge of the pertinent labor laws and their assent to his illegal dismissal.[53] In their Comment,[54] respondents counter as follows: First, the present petition is outside the scope of an appeal under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. Besides, petitioner, too, conveniently ignored the basic reason as to why the CA found no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC in dismissing his Complaint for illegal dismissal. In particular, the NLRC found that petitioner had failed to first establish by substantial evidence the fact of his dismissal from work, which was fatal to his cause.[55] Second, the pretext that the employee would not have filed the complaint for illegal dismissal if he had not really been dismissed is clearly a non sequitur reasoning that can never validly take the place of the evidence of both the employer and the employee.[56] In his Manifestation (In Lieu of Reply),[57] petitioner states that he was adopting his discussions in the present petition as his Reply to the Comment.","The Court resolves to partially grant the petition. The Court holds that the CA erred in not finding grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC when it reversed the LA's Decision and dismissed the Complaint for illegal dismissal for lack of merit. In fine, the CA erred in concluding that the NLRC's appreciation of the evidence before it is supported by substantial evidence.","The Court holds that the CA erred in not finding grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC when it reversed the LA's Decision and dismissed the Complaint for illegal dismissal for lack of merit. In fine, the CA erred in concluding that the NLRC's appreciation of the evidence before it is supported by substantial evidence. As will be discussed below, the conclusion of the NLRC that petitioner failed to prove the fact of his dismissal from employment is not supported by substantial evidence. To be precise, respondents are deemed to have admitted petitioner's specific allegations as to the act of petitioner's dismissal from employment considering their failure to specifically deny these allegations. The rule is that ""in illegal dismissal cases, the burden of proof is on the employer in proving the validity of dismissal. However, the fact of dismissal, if disputed, must be duly proven by the complainant.""[65] In relation thereto, Section 3, Rule 1 of the 2011 NLRC Rules of Procedure provides for the suppletory application of the Rules of Court for proceedings before the LA and the NLRC. It states: x x x Section 11, Rule 8 of the Rules of Court, in turn, provides that ""[m]aterial averment[s] in the complaint, other than those as to the amount of unliquidated damages, shall be deemed admitted when not specifically denied."" Thus, in illegal dismissal cases, it follows that when the employer fails to specifically deny the complainant employee's material averments as to the circumstances of his dismissal, the employer is deemed to have admitted the fact of dismissal and must then discharge his burden of proving that the dismissal of the employee was valid. x x x In the case, respondents did not specifically deny and rebut petitioner's allegations as to the fact of his dismissal from employment. To recall, petitioner alleged in his Complaint that: (1) on November 27, 2015, Zenaida told him to leave and not come to work anymore; and (2) the following morning, he received a text message from Zenaida's representative telling him: ""Pare, wag ka [nang] papasok pati ang anak mo sabi ni Ate."" Meanwhile, in an attempt to relieve themselves from liability, respondents raised the defense that there was no employer-employee relationship between the Consignee and petitioner. In other words, respondents did not specifically deny that Zenaida and her representative, on separate occasions, told petitioner to leave and to stop going to work. Thus, respondents are deemed to have admitted petitioner's allegations as to his dismissal from work. Notably, the NLRC, too, had affirmed the LA's ruling that petitioner was indeed a regular employee of respondents. There being no indication in the records that respondents ever assailed this ruling with the CA, it is clear that the issue has already been resolved with finality. Hence, it is no longer a proper subject of dispute with the Court. Under the circumstances, the Court finds that petitioner, who was a regular employee of respondents, had been illegally dismissed from his employment considering: first, the latter's deemed admission of the fact of dismissal; and second, the absence of any clear showing of a just or valid cause for such dismissal. Consequently, the Court holds that petitioner is entitled to the payment of his full backwages under Article 294[67] of the Labor Code of the Philippines (Labor Code). Petitioner also prays that he be awarded separation pay in lieu of reinstatement on the ground of the alleged strained relations between him and respondents. x x x Here, petitioner should have proven the existence of strained relations between him and respondents before the lower tribunals. However, he failed to do so. As such, the Court is constrained to deny petitioner's prayer for the award of separation pay in lieu of reinstatement as his illegal dismissal alone does not justify a finding of strained relations. As to the other monetary claims of petitioner, there is no issue that petitioner is entitled to service incentive leave pay in the amount of P4,500.00 as ruled by the LA and affirmed by the NLRC. It bears emphasis that the NLRC ruling on this matter has already attained finality considering respondents' failure to assail it before the CA by way of their own petition for certiorari. With respect to petitioner's prayer for the award of 13th month pay, the CA is correct that the NLRC did not gravely abuse its discretion when it ruled against his entitlement thereto. Under Section 3(e) of the Rules and Regulations Implementing PD 851,[70] employers of those who are paid on purely commission, boundary, or task basis, among others, are exempted from the payment of 13th month pay to its employees.[71] Significantly, petitioner alleged in his Complaint that he was paid on a commission basis.[72] Seemingly realizing his mistake, it appears that he changed his theory in the present petition, alleging instead that he was paid on a piece-rate basis in an effort to make himself qualified to receive 13th month pay under PD 851. As a matter of fairness, petitioner cannot now be allowed to change his theory of the case on appeal before the Court. x x x Given the foregoing, the Court finds that petitioner is entitled to the payment of his full backwages and service incentive leave pay, with attorney's fees equivalent to 10% of the judgment awards considering that he was compelled to litigate to enforce his rights and protect his interests. x x x As to who among respondents are liable to pay petitioner, the applications for mayor's permit for the years 2012 and 2014 show that the Consignee is a sole proprietorship with Angelo as the declared owner.[77] Thus, the Consignee, being a sole proprietorship, has no juridical personality to defend the lawsuit, and Angelo, as the owner, is liable to petitioner for the entirety of the monetary awards in the case.[78] As to Zenaida's personal liability, the records show that respondents' own averments in their Memorandum of Appeal represented her as a co-owner of the Consignee. x x x Given the foregoing, the Court finds Zenaida solidarity liable with Angelo to pay petitioner the entirety of the monetary awards. Lastly, the totality of the monetary awards shall earn legal interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the finality of this Decision until full satisfaction as compensatory interest arising from the final judgment.","WHEREFORE, the petition is PARTLY GRANTED. The Decision dated May 24, 2019 and the Resolution dated December 12, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 157156 are hereby SET ASIDE. Let a new judgment be entered as follows: Petitioner Noel G. Guinto is found to have been illegally dismissed. Respondents Angelo Salangsang and Zenaida Salangsang are ORDERED to: reinstate petitioner Noel G. Guinto to his former position without loss of seniority rights; and solidarity pay petitioner Noel G. Guinto his full backwages from the time of his illegal dismissal until the finality of this Decision, his service incentive leave pay in the amount of P4,500.00, 10% attorney's fees of the total amount due to petitioner, and legal interest of 6% per annum on the total monetary awards computed from the time of finality of this Decision until fully paid. The Labor Arbiter is DIRECTED to recompute the monetary awards in favor of petitioner Noel G. Guinto in accordance with this Decision. SO ORDERED."

The SC clarified that while the CA correctly awarded P1,200,000.00, its reliance on Section 1(b), Rule 111 of the Rules of Court was incorrect, as the civil case was filed ahead of the criminal cases. The proper basis for recovery is the final and executory ruling in the prior civil case (CA-G.R. CV No. 96212, affirmed in G.R. No. 220841) where FDI expressly reduced its claim in the civil suit by P1,200,000.00 to avoid double recovery, thus permitting recovery of that specific amount in the criminal proceedings. The SC also held that FDI did not commit forum shopping, as the criminal action and the collection suit, while related, have different causes of action, and FDI promptly informed the civil court of the pendency of the BP Blg. 22 cases and adjusted its claim accordingly. Finally, the Court modified the interest rate pursuant to the guidelines set in Nacar v. Gallery Frames.","WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Decision dated February 6, 2018 and the Resolution dated May 24, 2018 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

Buenaflor is ORDERED to pay respondent Federated Distributors, Inc. the amount of P1,200,000.00, with interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum from the filing of the 12 Informations until June 30, 2013 and thereafter at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from July 1, 2013 until the finality of this Decision. Petitioner Martin R. Buenaflor is also ORDERED to PAY interest on the monetary awards in favor of respondent Federated Distributors, Inc. at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the date of the finality of this Decision until full payment.

"[ G.R. No. 212012, March 28, 2022 ]","HEIRS OF JOSE DE LARA, SR., PETITIONERS, VS. RURAL BANK OF JAEN, INC., RESPONDENT.","Jose, a farmer-beneficiary under the Operation Land Transfer of Presidential Decree No. (PD) 27, was awarded a parcel of land in Dampulan (now Vicente), Jaen, Nueva Ecija with an area of 2,257 square meters (subject land). On November 20, 1998, TCT No. EP-86727 under the Department of Agriculture Reform (DAR) Emancipation Patent (EP) No. 00735825 covering the subject land was issued in favor of Jose. Subsequently, Jose obtained a loan from respondent bank secured by a mortgage over the subject land. Unfortunately, he failed to pay his obligation; hence, the mortgage was foreclosed. On February 27, 2003, a public auction was held wherein respondent bank was declared the highest bidder. On July 3, 2003, the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Gapan, Nueva Ecija issued a Certificate of Sale to respondent bank. On August 19, 2003, respondent bank registered the sale with the Register of Deeds. A year passed but neither Jose nor his heirs redeemed the subject land. Thus, on October 4, 2004, respondent bank executed an Affidavit of Consolidation of Ownership over the said land. On December 16, 2004, respondent bank filed a verified petition for cancellation of TCT No. EP-86727 covering the subject land before the PARAD. Petitioners filed an Answer and sought the dismissal of the petition. They argued that the PARAD did not acquire jurisdiction over them for failure to implead necessary parties. They also averred that respondent bank's petition lacked a cause of action because the purported real estate mortgage executed by Jose was void ab initio as it was executed within the 10-year prohibitory period under Section 27 of Republic Act No. (RA) 6657, otherwise known as the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program. Lastly, petitioners claimed that the mortgage was void because it was executed without the consent of Jose's wife, Marcela Mariano (Marcela).","In this petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, the heirs of Jose E. De Lara seek the reversal of the December 10, 2013 Decision and March 13, 2014 Resolution of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA­-G.R. SP No. 126325, which reversed the July 4, 2012 Decision of the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB) in DARAB Case No. 15281 (Reg. Case No. 08395-SNE-04), and denied their motion for reconsideration, respectively. The CA reinstated the January 4, 2006 Decision of the Provincial Agrarian Reform Adjudicator (PARAD) for Cabanatuan City that directed the Register of Deeds of Nueva Ecija to cancel Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. EP-86727 with DAR E.P. No. 00735825 registered in the name of the late Jose E. De Lara (Jose), and to issue a new title in the name of respondent Rural Bank of Jaen, Inc. ... The PARAD held that respondent bank substantially proved that Jose obtained and failed to pay his loan, and that the extrajudicial foreclosure of mortgage was in accord with Act No. 3135, as amended. Thus, TCT No. EP-86727 ought to be cancelled, and a new one issued in the name of respondent bank. ... In its July 4, 2012 Decision, the DARAB reversed the PARAD. The DARAB stated that respondent bank's act of consolidating ownership over the subject land is prohibited under agrarian laws. ... In its Decision dated December 10, 2013, the CA reversed the DARAB Decision and reinstated the PARAD Decision. The CA ruled that Jose and Marcela had already fully paid Land Bank of the Philippines their amortizations covering the subject land before it was mortgaged to respondent bank which resulted in the issuance of an EP on March 18, 1999. Hence, as owners of the subject land, they validly entered into a mortgage contract with respondent bank. The CA also held that pursuant to Section 6 of RA 7353, respondent bank, as a rural bank, can foreclose the subject land although falling under RA 6657 since Jose and Marcela failed to pay their obligation, and to redeem the property within the one-year period.","DARAB has no jurisdiction over the case at bench as there is no agrarian dispute between the parties. ... Even if the case involves cancellation of an EP, an agrarian dispute between the parties should first exist for the then DARAB or DAR Secretary to acquire jurisdiction. ... There was no tenancy relationship between petitioners and respondent bank over the subject land. ... Thus, respondent's petition should have been dismissed by the DARAB for lack of jurisdiction. ... This notwithstanding, the petition if given due course would still be dismissed. Subject land is deemed non­transferrable under the provisions of PD 27 and RA 6657, as amended by RA 9700. ... Records show that the EP covering the subject land was issued in favor of Jose on November 20, 1998. At the time the foreclosure sale was held on February 27, 2003, only four years had passed from the time he acquired the said land in his name. While respondent bank's right to foreclose the mortgage over the subject land properly had its basis on Jose's failure to pay the loan, it arose within the 10-year period during which Jose was supposed to keep the subject land to his name. There was, therefore, a factual impediment to respondent's action to foreclose the mortgage, and a legal imperative to await the lapse of the 10-year retention period before pursuing his cause against Jose. Nonetheless, the foreclosure sale proceeded. This violated the provisions of PD 27 and RA 6657, as amended by RA 9700. Agreements that violate law and public policy are inexistent and void from the beginning. ... All said, the sale of the subject land by foreclosure to herein respondent bank, being violative of the law and public policy embodied in PD 27 and RA 6657 as amended by RA 9700, is void ab initio.","WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED. The December 10, 2013 Decision and Resolution dated March 13, 2014 of the Court of Appeals in CA-­G.R. SP No. 126325 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The Petition for Cancellation of Transfer Certificate of Title No. EP-86727 filed by the respondent Rural Bank of Jaen, Inc. is DISMISSED. The extrajudicial foreclosure of real estate mortgage on July 3, 2003 over the land located in Dampulan (now Vicente), Jaen, Nueva Ecija with an area of 2,257 square meters registered under the name of Jose E. de Lara per Transfer Certificate of Title No. EP-86727 is declared VOID AB INITIO. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 212333, March 28, 2022","COLEGIO SAN AGUSTIN-BACOLOD AND/OR FR. FREDERICK C. COMENDADOR, PETITIONERS, VS. MELINDA M. MONTAÑO, RESPONDENT.","This case arose from a complaint[7] for illegal suspension, illegal dismissal, separation pay, diminution of benefits, moral and exemplary damages, and attorney's fees filed by respondent Dr. Melinda M. Montaño (respondent) against petitioners Colegio San Agustin-Bacolod (CSA-Bacolod) and its president, Fr. Frederick C. Comendador. CSA-Bacolod is an educational institution duly organized and existing under the laws of the Philippines.[8] CSA-Bacolod first employed respondent as a chemistry instructor in 1973.[9] In 2003, she was appointed school registrar; her appointment was renewed several times.[10] Respondent alleged that in her reappointment letter for the 2009-2011 term, there was a diminution of her salary; her basic salary was reduced from P33,319.00 to P26,658.20.[11] She thus wrote to the Human Resource Director to seek an explanation.[12] It was the school president who responded, and he stated that her total gross pay did not change as the school merely opted to break down the amount to show the amount of honorarium.[13] Respondent claimed that this was the time when the president started to show his bias against her.[14] Thereafter, respondent was suspended, and her employment was eventually terminated due to complaints from two faculty members alleging that she allowed some students to attend the graduation ceremony despite not meeting the requirements.[15] These events led to her filing of the complaint. Respondent admitted that she allowed certain students to join the March 2009 graduation ceremony in CSA-Bacolod even if they did not pass some of their subjects.[16] She claimed that she merely continued the practice of previous registrars; she even imposed more stringent rules in determining when ineligible students may join the rites.[17] She added that she allowed these students to participate due to humanitarian reasons.[18] Respondent did not issue special order numbers to these students; thus, they are not considered graduates.[19] She cited the Student's Manual, which provides that the inclusion of students' names in the list of candidates for graduation, their picture in the yearbook, and their participation in the commencement exercises do not make them full-fledged graduates unless all requirements were complied with and a Special Order Number has been issued by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED).[20] Respondent claimed that management did not consider her explanation and she was instead served with a notice of charges on January 20, 2010.[21] She responded to the notice. She asserted that the basis of the notice was not really the letter complaints but mere letters seeking for clarification of the school's policy regarding graduation.[22] She also questioned the jurisdiction of the Disciplinary Committee created by the president. The matter should have been brought to the Vice President for Academic Affairs, and if not resolved, it may be elevated to the Grievance Committee.[23] She refused to attend the Disciplinary Committee meeting scheduled on January 26, 2010.[24] CSA-Bacolod, for its defense, posited that respondent's suspension and eventual dismissal was due to gross misconduct resulting to loss of trust and confidence.[25] Respondent had been reminding the college deans that students with academic deficiencies should not be allowed to participate in the graduation exercises.[26] Two faculty members reacted to this because they knew of certain students that were allowed by respondent to participate despite non­compliance with the requirements.[27] As a result, the president ordered that a report be submitted regarding the matter[28] The concerned faculty members submitted reports naming four students who were allowed to participate despite failing in some of their subjects.[29] CSA-Bacolod's Administrative Manual provides that the School Registrar is tasked to: (a) conduct regular evaluation of subjects and credits earned by students and advise them on deficiencies; and (b) enforce graduation requirements, as well as preparation of the graduation list for approval and supervision of the ceremony itself.[30] The president thus created an Ad Hoc Committee to look into the case. A notice of charges was issued to respondent for gross misconduct, tampering of school records, and willful breach of trust and confidence or gross negligence.[31] At the same time, she was placed under preventive suspension for 30 days.[32] Although, respondent submitted her response to the notice, she refused to attend the hearing of the Ad Hoc Committee. Another hearing was held and respondent attended this time.[33] The Ad Hoc Committee deliberated and thereafter recommended the termination of respondent's employment for gross misconduct and willful breach of trust and confidence.[34] The president issued a notice of termination dated February 20, 2010.[35]","The petition is partially meritorious. The Court finds that respondent was validly dismissed from employment. Resultantly, she is not entitled to backwages, separation pay, moral and exemplary damages, and attorney's fees. The Court, however, finds that respondent is entitled to salary differential as a result of diminution of benefits during her reappointment as school registrar.","The Court agrees with the NLRC that respondent committed serious misconduct in allowing ineligible students to march. She violated an established school policy as espoused in a memorandum issued by the university.[97] The memorandum states that ""[n]o student will be allowed to march for graduation unless he/she has fully complied with all the academic requirements of his/her course.""[98] Circumstances show that respondent's act is clearly a conscious and willful transgression of the university's established rule regarding graduation rites. It is not a mere error in judgment or an inadvertent act. ... The Court also finds that respondent's act constitutes a breach of trust and confidence. There is no dispute that respondent as school registrar occupied a position of trust. She is in possession and custody of student records, which are vital for any educational institution. As to the second requisite, the Court holds that respondent's act justifies loss of trust and confidence. Respondent's conscious decision of allowing the ineligible students to march shows her willfulness to transgress the established rule. This willful transgression of a rule indeed results to the loss of the trust and confidence CSA-Bacolod has reposed on her. ... As to respondent's preventive suspension, the Court finds that CSA-Bacolod acted well within its right in doing so. The implementing rules of the Labor Code allows an employer to preventively suspend an employee if continued employment poses a serious and imminent threat to the life or property of the employer or co-workers.[103] In preventive suspension, the employer safeguards itself from further harm or loss that may further be caused by the erring employee.[104] CSA-Bacolod was well within its rights to preventively suspend respondent. The threat raised by the school was not unfounded as respondent was school registrar, whose functions include evaluation of subjects and credits earned by students and enforcement of graduation requirements.[105] Respondent's violation was indeed related to her functions as school registrar. With her continued presence during the investigation, it is not impossible that the school records under her custody may be tampered; it is also not impossible that the investigation may be influenced given the nature and ascendancy of her position. With the finding that respondent is validly dismissed from employment, it follows that she is not entitled to backwages, separation pay, moral and exemplary damages, and attorney's fees.[106] The Court finds that respondent is entitled to the salary differential as a result of diminution of benefits. ... In the Court's view, there was indeed a diminution of benefit. The explanation of the school that the amount was merely broken down fails to convince. It must be emphasized that there was no showing in these proceedings that respondent received honorarium prior to her 2009 reappointment as school registrar.[111] Her prior appointments stated that she was to receive compensation equivalent to a certain number of load or units pertaining to her academic rank; there was no mention of payment of honorarium then. Thus, it is but fair and just to conclude that the entire P33,319.00 that respondent had received prior to her 2009 reappointment is considered as her monthly basic pay. As it was established that respondent continued to receive the same amount of P33,319.00 despite the addition of honorarium for the 2009 reappointment, it can be concluded then that the basic pay indeed was reduced. This resulted to diminution of benefit that is expressly prohibited by the Labor Code.","WHEREFORE, the Petition is PARTLY GRANTED. The July 10, 2013 Decision and April 11, 2014 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP. No. 06330 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The April 12, 2011 Decision and June 28, 2011 Resolution of the National Labor Relations Commission in NLRC Case No. VAC-01-000069-2011 are REINSTATED with MODIFICATION in that petitioners Colegio San Agustin-Bacolod and its President, Fr.

However, in a Manifestation and Undertaking with Motion to Dismiss dated July 26, 2017, Anderson's counsel informed the Court that Anderson had already died on April 21, 2007, as evinced by Anderson's Certificate of Death. This means that Anderson had already passed away during the pendency of the criminal case against him, prior to the Court's Resolution dated April 26, 2017.","Had the Court been timely made aware of Anderson's supervening death in the interim, his conviction would not have been affirmed as his criminal liability and civil liability ex delicto in connection therewith had already been extinguished. In view of the foregoing, the Court is constrained to set aside the Resolution dated April 26, 2017 issued in connection with this case. Consequently, the Court hereby dismisses Criminal Case Nos. 04-7543, 04-7618, and 04-7619 before the Regional Trial Court of Muntinlupa City, Branch 207 by reason of Anderson's supervening death prior to his final conviction.","Under prevailing law and jurisprudence, Anderson's death prior to his final conviction by the Court should have resulted in the dismissal of the criminal case against him.

Likewise, the civil action instituted for the recovery of the civil liability ex delicto is also ipso facto extinguished, as it is grounded on the criminal action. However, the claim for civil liability survives notwithstanding the death of accused, if the same may also be predicated on a source of obligation other than delict (e.g., Law, Contracts, Quasi-contracts, Quasi-delicts), which must be pursued by way of filing a separate civil action against the executor/administrator or the estate of the accused.","WHEREFORE, the Court resolves to: (a) SET ASIDE the Court's Resolution dated April 26, 2017; (b) DISMISS Criminal Case Nos. 04-7543, 04-7618, and 04-7619 before the Regional Trial Court of Muntinlupa City, Branch 207 by reason of accused-appellant Paul Anderson y Jeffrey's supervening death prior to his final conviction; and (c) DECLARE this case CLOSED and TERMINATED.

"G.R. No. 216771, March 28, 2022","HEROLD G. UBALDE, PETITIONER, VS. HON. CONCHITA C. MORALES, IN HER CAPACITY AS THE OMBUDSMAN, RESPONDENT.","The present petition is an offshoot of the several cases arising from the so-called “chopper scam,” which involved the procurement of second-hand light police helicopters (LPOHs) for use of the Philippine National Police (PNP). At the time material to the case, Ubalde was the Director of the PNP Legal Services and a regular member of the PNP National Headquarters Bids and Awards Committee (NHQ-BAC). After two failed public biddings, the procurement of at least one (1) equipped LPOH and two (2) standard LPOHs was recommended through negotiated procurement under Section 53(b) of IRR-A of R.A. No. 9184. The NHQ-BAC, through Resolution No. 2009-36, affirmed the recommendation to award the Supply Contract to MAPTRA Sole Proprietorship (later MAPTRA Corporation) for P104,985,000.00. The Field Investigation Office (FIO) of the Ombudsman filed criminal and administrative complaints, alleging the sale caused undue injury to the government and gave unwarranted benefits, as MAPTRA Corporation was ineligible (primary purpose was selling parts, not new helicopters; negative net financial contracting capacity; LPOHs delivered did not meet NAPOLCOM standards). The Ombudsman found Ubalde and others guilty of serious dishonesty and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service, imposing dismissal. The Court of Appeals affirmed the Ombudsman’s ruling.",The petition is DENIED.,"The Court ruled that there is substantial evidence to hold Ubalde administratively liable. While the eligibility requirements under Sections 23.11.1(2) and 23.11.1(3) of the IRR-A are inapplicable to negotiated procurement, MAPTRA Sole Proprietorship/Corporation was still not a technically, legally, and financially capable supplier nor a previous supplier of good standing, as evidenced by its limited previous contracts, inappropriate corporate purpose, and negative net worth. Ubalde, as a member of the NHQ-BAC, reneged on his obligation to ensure that the standards for negotiated procurement were complied with, giving unwarranted benefits to MAPTRA. The Court disagreed with the Ombudsman's finding of serious dishonesty, as there was no evidence Ubalde lied or cheated. Instead, the Court found Ubalde guilty of grave misconduct, for blatant and willful disregard of procurement rules, and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service because his acts tarnished the image and integrity of his public office.","The Resolutions dated July 24, 2014 and February 12, 2015 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

Petitioner was the secretary, treasurer and administrator of the NAPOLCOM Employees Paluwagan, tasked with loan disbursements, collection, accounting and liquidation. While petitioner returned contributions and interest from 1994 to 1997, she failed to do so in December 1998. She explained that she failed to collect the money borrowed by residents of Dagat-dagatan. Despite a demand letter sent on July 31, 1999, petitioner failed to return the contributions.","The Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Quezon City, Branch 96 convicted her of Estafa under Article 315, paragraph 1(b) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC). The RTC sentenced her to suffer penalty of imprisonment of eight (8) years and one (1) day of prision mayor, as minimum, to twenty (20) years of reclusion temporal, as maximum, and to indemnify the offended parties.

Petitioner is not criminally liable for Estafa under Article 315, paragraph 1(b) because the prosecution failed to prove the second element (misappropriation or conversion) beyond reasonable doubt. The SC found that petitioner did not misappropriate the funds as if they were her own; her failure to return the money was due to the fact that the borrowers failed to pay their loans. Her act of loaning money to non-members was not proven to be a violation of the paluwagan's rules. Furthermore, the circumstantial evidence (failure to return/account) was sufficiently disproven by the defense. The mere failure to return the entrusted funds does not ipso facto constitute Estafa absent clear proof of the elements of misappropriation and conversion. However, since the acquittal is based on reasonable doubt, petitioner can still be held civilly liable based on preponderance of evidence. The transaction involved in this case is not a simple contract of loan or sale, and the petitioner admitted her liability and obligation to return the private complainants' money, totaling P691,912.81.","WHEREFORE, premises considered, the May 31, 2012 Decision and the May 6, 2013 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

"G.R. No. 209702, March 23, 2022","SOCORRO P. CABILAO, PETITIONER, VS. MA. LORNA Q. TAMPAN, REP. BY HER ATTORNEY-IN-FACT JUDITH TAMPAN-MONTINOLA & DANILO TAMPAN, RESPONDENTS.","On April 7, 1988, Lorna Tampan-Naldoza (Lorna) purchased a residential house and lot from Socorro Cabilao (Socorro) located at 599 Narciso St., Surigao City (subject property), covered by TCT No. T-59, through a Deed of Absolute Sale of a Residential Land together with a House[5] (Deed of Sale), in the amount of P10,000.00. Since Lorna was in the United States, her mother, Antonieta, purchased the property on her behalf.[6] In 1995, Lorna decided to have TCT No. T-59 registered in her name but she discovered that the owner's duplicate got lost while it was kept by Judith Tampan-Montinola (Judith) in the house. Thereafter, Lorna, through Judith, filed a petition for the issuance of a new owner's duplicate. However, spouses Lapulapu and Lelita (Lelita) Buyser (collectively, spouses Buyser) opposed her petition on the ground that they were in possession of the said title after buying the same from Socorro. Thus, Lorna's petition was dismissed.[7] When Lelita informed Socorro about the petition for the issuance of a new owner's copy of the title, Socorro denied having sold the subject property to Lorna. However, due to the controversy, Socorro repurchased the subject property and the owner's duplicate was surrendered back to her.[8] On April 29, 1996, Lorna and Judith lodged a complaint for declaration of nullity of a pacto de retro sale entered into on January 25, 1995 between Socorro and spouses Buyser. The case was docketed as Civil Case No. 4818.[9] On May 5, 1996, Socorro filed an action for Annulment or Cancellation of Document, Quieting of Title/Recovery of Ownership and Possession, Injunction, and Damages with Prayer for Preliminary Injunction and Temporary Restraining Order[10] against Lorna and Danilo Tampan, which was docketed as Civil Case No. 4826. She alleged that she was the absolute and registered owner of the subject property covered by TCT No. T-59 which was in her possession. Moreover, on April 18, 1990, she sold the subject property through a pacto de retro sale to Enriqueta Baybayon (Enriqueta) for P89,000.00, and to Lelita on January 25, 1995. During both transactions, she surrendered her owner's copy of TCT No. T-59 to Enriqueta and Lelita.[11] In her Answer,[12] Lorna maintained that she owned the subject property and claimed that Socorro was in full possession of her mental faculties when they signed the Deed of Sale before the notary public, Atty. Ildefonso Mantilla (Atty. Mantilla). Moreover, the document was translated and interpreted by Atty. Mantilla to Socorro in the Surigaonon dialect, which is the dialect she understands. Since Lorna was in the United States, her mother, Antonieta, personally gave the consideration of P10,000.00 to Socorro in the presence of Atty. Mantilla. In the Deed of Sale, Antonieta also signed for and on Lorna's behalf. The true consideration paid was more or less P100,000.00 but the Deed of Sale reflected a lesser amount to avoid a higher payment of taxes. The owner's copy of TCT No. T-59 was stolen by Socorro while she was living in the subject property.[13] On August 23, 1996, the RTC ordered the consolidation of Civil Case Nos. 4818 and 4826.","In its January 31, 2013 Decision,[29] the CA reversed the RTC's findings. It held that while the Torrens title is evidence of indefeasible title over the property, the execution of a deed of sale of such property transfers the ownership thereof to the buyer even if the same remains under the name of the seller or registered owner. Since Socorro assails the validity of the Deed of Sale to Lorna, she has the burden of proving its invalidity. However, Socorro failed to substantiate her claim that the Tampans employed fraud and deception in securing her signature on the Deed of Sale. The Tampans were paying for the realty taxes over the property, thereby indicating strong evidence of ownership.[30] The CA further held that the Deed of Sale between Socorro and Lorna, being a notarized document, bears evidentiary weight with respect to its due execution and enjoys a presumption of regularity. As to the gross inadequacy of the consideration, the CA ruled that it does not affect the validity of the sale. Likewise, it held that the late or non-registration of a deed of sale does not affect its validity.[31] The fallo of the CA Decision reads: WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant appeal is GRANTED. The Decision dated September 21, 2007 issued by the Regional Trial Court, Branch 29, Surigao City is hereby MODIFIED in that as to Civil Case No. 4826, the same is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE and the Complaint for [""]Annulment or Cancellation of Document, Quieting of Title/Recovery of Ownership and Possession, Injunction, and Damages with Prayer for Preliminary Injunction and Temporary Restraining Order"" filed by appellee Socorro Cabilao is hereby DISMISSED for lack of merit.","We find the petition unmeritorious. The present controversy hinges on the validity of the Deed of Sale between Lorna and Socorro, which however is a question of fact.[40] ... After a judicious review of the records of the case, We sustain the findings of the CA and uphold the validity of the Deed of Sale between Lorna and Socorro. Article 1305 of New Civil Code (NCC) provides that a contract is ""a meeting of minds between two persons whereby one binds himself, with respect to the other, to give something or to render some service."" The essential requisites are: (1) consent of the contracting parties; (2) object certain which is the subject matter of the contract; and (3) cause of the obligation which is established. In the present case, all the elements of a valid contract are present. In the case at bar, the Deed of Sale validly transferred the ownership over TCT No. T-59 from Socorro to Lorna in consideration of P10,000.00. ... It is a well-settled rule that a duly notarized document enjoys the prima facie presumption of authenticity and due execution, as well as the full faith and credence attached to a public instrument.[45] Thus, a party assailing the authenticity and due execution of a notarized document is required to present evidence that is clear, convincing and more than merely preponderant.[46] Here, Socorro failed to overcome this burden. ... While Socorro claims that she is an illiterate person, she failed to prove this fact. ... Gross inadequacy of price does not affect the validity of a contract of sale, unless it signifies a defect in the consent or that the parties actually intended a donation or some other contract.[50] ... Transfer of the certificate of title in the name of the buyer and transfer of ownership to the buyer are two different concepts.[52] As correctly held by the CA, between the seller and buyer, ownership is transferred not by the issuance of the new certificate of title in the name of the buyer but by the execution of the instrument of sale in a public document.[53] Article 1498 of the New Civil Code provides that: Art. 1498. When the sale is made through a public instrument, the execution thereof shall be equivalent to the delivery of the thing which is the object of the contract, if from the deed the contrary does not appear or cannot clearly be inferred. ... It is also uncontested that the real property taxes are paid by the Tampans.[55] It is a settled rule that tax declarations and realty tax payment of property are not conclusive evidence of ownership, they are nonetheless good indicia of the possession in the concept of owner, for no one in his right mind would be paying taxes for a property that is not in his actual or at least constructive possession.[56] Coupled with the other pieces of respondent's evidence, it is reasonable to conclude that the property was indeed sold to Lorna since the Tampans have been living in the property and exercising acts of dominion and control over the property. As between the testimonies of petitioner and her other witnesses which failed to prove clearly, positively, and convincingly that she did not intend to sell the property, and the testimonial and documentary evidence of respondents, i.e., the notarized Deed of Sale, tax declaration, and tax receipts, the latter evidence prevails.","WHEREFORE, the petition is hereby DENIED. The January 31, 2013 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV. No. 01695 is hereby AFFIRMED. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 248311, March 23, 2022","PEPE GUMAWID @ KAPPIT, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","The case stemmed from an Information that charged petitioner Pepe Gumawid @ Kappit and Ronaldo Balingit @ Tonga with Homicide for the killing of Bello Bucsit y Joves on October 23, 2013, in Pangasinan. According to the prosecution (Lydia and Jamaica Bucsit, mother and daughter of the victim), while at a wake, Bello told his brother Hayde that they should go home after Hayde was accused of stealing money; petitioner then punched Bello on his back. Bello went home, but petitioner and Ronaldo followed, shouted, and threw stones at the house. Bello went outside and hit petitioner with a steel pipe, causing petitioner to fall. Ronaldo then held Bello's hands, allowing petitioner to stand up and stab Bello twice on the left chest, causing his death. The defense denied the charge. Petitioner claimed that Bello suddenly struck his nape with a steel pipe as they passed by his house, causing petitioner to lose consciousness, making it impossible for him to stab Bello. Defense witnesses corroborated that petitioner lost consciousness. The Regional Trial Court (RTC) found petitioner guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Homicide but acquitted Ronaldo for insufficiency of evidence (lack of conspiracy). The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the RTC Decision, finding the prosecution witnesses credible and the alleged inconsistencies minor.","The petition is DENIED. The Decision dated November 14, 2018 and the Resolution dated July 9, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 39834 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION.","The Court found no compelling reason to depart from the uniform factual findings of the RTC and the CA, and thus affirms petitioner’s conviction. The elements of Homicide under Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code were established: (1) Bello was killed; (2) the prosecution witnesses positively and categorically identified petitioner as the stabber; (3) petitioner had the intention to kill, shown by the fact that he followed the victim, shouted, hurled stones, and stabbed him twice on the left chest; and (4) the killing was not attended by any qualifying circumstances. The alleged inconsistencies cited by petitioner—whether Lydia was inside or outside the house—refer to minor or immaterial matters which hardly affect the credibility of the eyewitnesses, who consistently and positively identified petitioner as the person who stabbed Bello. Petitioner's defense of denial and claim of lost consciousness is intrinsically weak and cannot prevail over the positive identification made by the prosecution witnesses.","Petitioner Pepe Gumawid @ Kappit is sentenced to suffer the indeterminate penalty of eight (8) years and one (1) day of prision mayor, as minimum, to fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months, and one (1) day of reclusion temporal, as maximum; and he is ORDERED to pay the heirs of Bello Bucsit y Joves the following amounts: P45,500.00 as compensatory damages, P50,000.00 as civil indemnity, and P50,000.00 as moral damages. All the damages awarded shall earn legal interest rate of 6% per annum from the finality of this decision until fully paid."

RURAL BANK OF SAN RAFAEL (BULACAN) INC., FLORANTE VENERACION, CELERINA SABARIAGA, ALICIA FLOR KABILING, FIDELA MANAGO, CEFERINO DE GUZMAN, AND RIZALINO QUINTOS, RESPONDENTS.","Respondent Rural Bank of San Rafael (Bulacan) Inc. (RBSR) is a domestic banking corporation while respondents Florante Veneracion (Veneracion), Celerina Sabariaga (Sabariaga), Alicia Flor Kabiling (Kabiling), Fidela Manago (Manago), Ceferino De Guzman (De Guzman), and Rizalino Quintos (Quintos) (collectively, respondents), are members of RBSR's Board of Directors. Sometime in 2012, several stockholders of RBSR complained about the discrepancies in the amounts of the purchase price of stock subscriptions appearing in the original receipts as against the duplicate copies issued by the bank. The anomaly involved several millions of pesos collected from stockholders of RBSR which, if not corrected, will certainly tarnish the image and integrity of the latter. Acting on this anomaly, RBSR conducted an investigation and confirmed the irregularities. It was discovered that in the original receipts given to the stockholders, the stated price of shares ranged from P250.00 to P275.00, but in the duplicate copies retained by RBSR, only P100.00 was indicated. Moreover, the original receipts were signed by Flordeliza Cruz, then President of RBSR, while the duplicate copies were signed either by its then Treasury Head Emilline C. Bognot (Bognot), or Branch Manager Reynaldo Eusebio, Jr. (Eusebio). Thus, in compliance with the Manual of Regulations for Banks mandating the prompt report of anomalies to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), RBSR's Board of Directors approved a Report on Crimes and Losses and directed Reyes – as Compliance Officer – to certify the same. However, Reyes refused to certify the report, reasoning that no independent investigation was conducted, and that he cannot completely validate the same for lack of material data and evidence, and that he was being pressured to certify the report. Thereafter, Reyes claimed that instead of furnishing him the hard copies of the reports and its original attachments to enable him to verify and certify the same, RBSR issued him two show cause orders and put him on preventive suspension for neglect of duty. Meanwhile, RBSR contended that several administrative hearings were scheduled to hear Reyes' side, but all were ignored. On March 25, 2013, Reyes, together with Bognot and Eusebio (complainants) – who were principally accused of theft/misappropriation of funds in connection with the anomaly – filed a Complaint [6] against respondents for illegal suspension and money claims. An Amended Complaint [7] was subsequently filed to include illegal dismissal, in view of their eventual dismissal from work.","The appeal is meritorious. The Court found that the CA erred in affirming the NLRC Decision. Respondents were not denied due process before the Labor Arbiter, and thus, a liberal interpretation of the procedural rules was not warranted to allow RBSR to submit evidence belatedly. Furthermore, Reyes was illegally dismissed by RBSR because respondents failed to comply with the procedural due process requirements (muddled and vague charges, general termination notice). The Court also found that there was no valid cause for termination. While Reyes' refusal to certify the report was intentional disobedience, it was based on an honest assessment regarding the lack of material data and evidence, and was not attended by a wrongful and perverse mental attitude warranting the ultimate penalty of dismissal, which the Court deemed terribly disproportionate to the alleged infraction.","The appeal is meritorious. The CA erred in affirming the NLRC Decision. The application of a more liberal policy [in favor of the employer] is unwarranted. Respondents failed to comply with the due process requirements in dismissing Reyes due to the muddled and vague charges against him and the general statements used in the termination letter. Furthermore, there was no valid cause to dismiss Reyes; while his refusal to certify the report was intentional disobedience, it was based on his honest assessment that the report lacked material data and evidence, and this disobedience was not attended by a wrongful and perverse mental attitude that warrants dismissal. The penalty of dismissal imposed upon Reyes was terribly disproportionate to his alleged infraction.","WHEREFORE, the Petition is hereby GRANTED.

"G.R. No. 236826, March 23, 2022","HEIRS OF HERMINIO MARQUEZ, REPRESENTED BY ALMA MARIE MARQUEZ, PETITIONERS, VS. HEIRS OF EPIFANIA M. HERNANDEZ, REPRESENTED BY LOURDES H. TIONSON, RESPONDENTS.","As narrated by the CA in the assailed Decision and based on the records of the case, the essential facts and antecedent proceedings of the case are as follows: The instant case stemmed from a complaint [6] for specific performance with damages filed by herein respondents Heirs of Epifania M. Hernandez; namely, Lourdes Hernandez-Tiongson, Hernando H. Hernandez, Gliceria Hernandez-De Dios, Remedios Hernandez-Castro, Dionisia Hernandez-Panopio, Aurora Hernandez-Pascual, and Oscar M. Hernandez (collectively, respondents), on November 21, 2000 against Herminio Marquez (Herminio). In their amended complaint, [7] respondents impleaded herein petitioner Marquez. Respondents are the children and legal heirs of Epifania Hernandez (Epifania). Since 1955, respondents and Epifania have been occupying a parcel of land located in Matungao, Bulacan with an area of200 square meters (subject property). The subject property forms part of a 1,417-square meter property previously owned by the spouses Anastacio and Lourdes Sakay (spouses Sakay), and spouses Godofredo and Florsita Cruz (spouses Cruz). Epifania and respondents had built their house on the subject property with the consent and tolerance of its previous owners. [8] In 1967, the spouses Sakay and the spouses Cruz sold the 1,417-square meter property to Herminio. [9] In 1985, Herminio sold to Epifania the 200-square meter portion of the land on which her house was built for P400.00 per square meter. In view of this sale agreement, Epifania supposedly undertook to pay Herminio the total price of the subject property within the year of its purchase, or sometime before the end of 1985. In the event that Epifania failed to comply with the terms, the sale agreement would be considered or treated as a lease contract, and the amounts paid by Epifania would be treated as rentals or advances to Herminio under a continuing lease of the subject property. [10] Epifania made an initial payment to Herminio in the amount of P2,000.00 as evidenced by a provisional receipt [11] dated October 23, 1985 signed by Herminio, which states: Tinanggap ko kay Gng. Epifania M. Hernandez ang halagang (P2,000) dalawang libong piso bilang paunang bayad sa loteng kanyang kinatatayuan, ngayong 23 October 1985 (Ang bawat metro ay P400). [12] Epifania then made payment by way of installment to Herminio by depositing certain amounts of money in a joint account between them with the Rural Bank of Del Pilar, Inc. Epifania also paid Herminio through various Metrobank Checks all of which were in the amounts of P500.00 each. [13] According to respondents, Epifania was able to pay in full the agreed purchase for the subject property before her death on July 28, 1995. Sometime in March 2000, respondents executed an Extrajudicial Settlement of the Heirs of Epifania Hernandez [14] which stated, in part, that the proceeds of the joint savings account of their mother and Herminio with the Rural Bank of Del Pilar, Inc. shall be considered as full payment for the subject property. Notably, Herminio signified his conformity to the above-quoted provision in the said extrajudicial settlement between respondents by affixing his signature thereon. [15] Subsequently, the Rural Bank of Del Pilar, Inc. ceased operations. After processing the deposit insurance claim with the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation (PDIC), a check in the amount of P61,429.87 was released by PDIC, which was received by Herminio on June 16, 2000. [16] Meanwhile, on December 15, 1999 [17] and July 17, 2000, [18] respondents received from Marquez demand letters to vacate the premises of the subject property. It appears that on August 4, 1994, Marquez and Herminio executed an Extrajudicial Settlement of Estate with Waiver of Rights [19] whereby Herminio waived all his rights, interest and participation over the 1,417-square meter property in favor of Marquez. Despite respondents' demands, Herminio allegedly refused to execute a deed of absolute sale over the subject property in favor of Epifania. Thus, respondents' complaint for specific performance against Herminio. Marquez, being the registered owner of the 1,417-square meter property, which is covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. (TCT) T-81516, [20] respondents filed an amended complaint [21] impleading Marquez as a defendant. In the said amended complaint, respondents prayed that judgment be rendered directing Herminio and Marquez to cause the execution of a deed of absolute sale for the subject property in favor of respondents and that title over the subject property be transferred to their names. In his answer, [22] Herminio argued that when Epifania reneged on her obligation to complete payment of the purchase price in 1985, their initial agreement became one of lease, and not a contract of sale. He also averred that he is not the real-party in interest as the title over the 1,417-square meter property was already transferred to Marquez as early as 1996. Marquez, for her part, alleged in her answer [23] that Epifania did not make any subsequent payments after her initial payment of P2,000.00 to Herminio. Moreover, all amounts accepted by Herminio from Epifania are considered as rental payments for the use and occupancy of the subject property. Meanwhile, Herminio died and was substituted by his heir, herein petitioner.","In the assailed Decision, [32] the CA denied the appeal for lack of merit. The dispositive portion of the assailed Decision reads: WHEREFORE, the trial court's Decision dated January 28, 2016 and Resolution dated June 14, 2016 are affirmed, subject to the modification that the following paragraphs (2) and (3) of the dispositive portion of the Decision are hereby deleted: '(2) Directing the parties herein, especially defendant Alma Marie Marquez, to cause the partition of the parcel of land particularly described and covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-81516 to give full effect to the contract of sale between Herminio Marquez and Epifania Hernandez; (3) Directing the Register of Deeds of Guiguinto, Bulacan, after the said partition, to cause the cancellation of TCT No. T-81516 and in lieu thereof, to issue separate titles in the name of Epifania Hernandez and Alma Marie Marquez, each reflecting their respective shares in the subject property;' SO ORDERED. [33] The CA affirmed the findings of the RTC that the complaint filed by respondents is not for specific performance but one for quieting of title. The CA held that the Extrajudicial Settlement of Estate with Waiver of Rights executed by Herminio in favor of Marquez had the effect of casting a cloud on respondents' equitable title over the subject property. The CA also held that respondents are not guilty of laches since their continuous and actual possession of the subject property have rendered their right to bring an action for quieting of title imprescriptible. The CA also affirmed the findings of the RTC that a perfected contract of sale existed between Herminio and Epifania. The CA, however, held that the RTC had no jurisdiction to order the partition of the 1,417-square meter property between Epifania and Marquez since partition of real property is a special proceeding and not an ordinary civil action. Aggrieved, Marquez moved for reconsideration, [34] which was, however, denied in a Resolution [35] dated January 19, 2018. Hence, this petition.","The Court resolves to deny the petition. An examination of the issues raised by Marquez in her petition including her memorandum readily reveals that the same are a mere rehash of the basic issues raised before the RTC and the CA, and which were already exhaustively passed upon and duly resolved by the lower courts. Moreover, this Court observes that Marquez failed to show that the factual findings of the RTC and the CA were not supported by evidence, or that their decisions were contrary to applicable law and jurisprudence. ... There was a valid contract of sale between Herminio and Epifania. At any rate, this Court is in accord with the findings of the RTC and CA that there exists a perfected contract of sale between Epifania and Herminio based on the following pieces of evidence: First, the October 23, 1985 provisional receipt signed by Herminio...; second, the checks issued to Herminio as partial payments...; third, the acknowledgment receipt dated July 16, 2000 from the PDIC...; and fourth, the Extra-Judicial Settlement of the Heirs of Epifania stating that the proceeds of the joint savings account served as full payment from Epifania of the subject property, which was conformed to and signed by Herminio. ... We also agree with the findings of the RTC that the contract of sale was consummated even before Epifania made full payment of the purchase price, and that Herminio transferred ownership over the said property when he allowed Epifania and respondents to continue their occupation thereon consequent to the execution of the agreement. ... Even if the 1,417-square meter property was owned in common by Herminio and Marquez, We hold that the sale of a definite portion thereof by Herminio to Epifania is entirely valid. This is because the moment Herminio pointed out the boundaries of the subject property, and Marquez made no objection thereto, there is, in effect a partial partition of the co-owned property. ... Respondents' complaint is not only for specific performance but also for quieting of title. ... Accordingly, it cannot be said that respondents are guilty of laches since their continuous actual possession of the subject property has rendered their right to bring an action for quieting of title imprescriptible. ... A complaint for quieting of title does not amount to a collateral attack because at the heart of the action for quieting of title is the adjudication of the ownership of the disputed property and the consequent nullification of the questioned certificates of title, if so warranted by the circumstance of the case. ... The RTC, therefore, did not err in issuing the abovementioned directives to the Register of Deeds as it merely upheld contract of sale between Herminio and Epifania, and reiterated the constituted partial partition of the 1,417-square meter property embodied in the Extra-Judicial Settlement of the Heirs of Epifania Hernandez. Thus, the Supreme Court affirmed the CA Decision, but modified it by reinstating the partition orders of the RTC.","WHEREFORE, the petition for review on certiorari is hereby DENIED. The September 22, 2017 Decision and January 19, 2018 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 107241 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATIONS, as follows: (1) Affirming as valid the contract of sale between Herminio Marquez and Epifania Hernandez affecting the portion of the parcel of land where the house of said Epifania Hernandez stands, specifically the 190-square-meter portion thereof, more or less, which is covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-81516, now registered in the name of petitioner Alma Marie Marquez; (2) Directing the parties herein, especially petitioner Alma Marie Marquez, to cause the partition of the parcel of land particularly described and covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-81516 to give full effect to the contract of sale between Herminio Marquez and Epifania Hernandez; (3) Directing the Register of Deeds of Guiguinto, Bulacan, after the said partition, to cause the cancellation of Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-81516 and in lieu thereof, to issue separate titles in the name of Epifania Hernandez and Alma Marie Marquez, each reflecting their respective shares in the 1,417-square meter property; and (4) Directing petitioner Alma Marie Marquez to pay respondents herein the amount of P20,000.00 as and by way of attorney's fees.

CONTRARY TO LAW.
[9]
Upon his arraignment, accused-appellant pleaded ""not guilty"" to the crimes charged. After the termination of pre-trial, trial on the merits subsequently ensued.
[10]
Version of the Prosecution:
On September 8, 2011, at around 11:00 p.m., AAA, who was then only 14 years old,
[11]
went with her friend, BBB, to
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
to meet with the latter's ""textmates.""
[12]
Upon arriving at the hotel, BBB introduced AAA to accused-appellant and an unidentified man. Afterwards, the two men booked two separate rooms and all four of them proceeded to go upstairs.
[13]
At first, they all stayed in one room where accused-appellant tried to get to know AAA. After some time, AAA noticed that her companions were holding a folded foil paper. Accused-appellant then asked AAA if she wanted to try it out, which turned out to be ""
enchang
"" or shabu. AAA initially declined the offer but BBB eventually convinced her to join in and try the substance. Thereafter, BBB asked AAA and accused-appellant to leave the room.
[14]
Accused-appellant then brought AAA to another room. He asked AAA for her age and further inquired if she was still a virgin. She answered in the affirmative. Accused-appellant then turned off the lights and approached her. He tightly held her upper right arm and kissed her on the lips. While he was taking off her clothes, AAA fearfully pleaded, ""
bata pa po ako
."" Accused-appellant assured her that she would not get hurt.
[15]
AAA tried to escape and ran towards the door but accused-appellant grabbed her clothes and forcefully pulled her back. AAA resisted but her efforts proved futile and accused-appellant continued to undress her. After successfully removing all her clothes, accused-appellant laid AAA in bed, kissed her vagina, went on top of her, and inserted his penis into her vagina. Terrified and helpless, AAA could only cry in pain as she pushed accused-appellant away. She tried to stand up but he forcefully tugged her back to bed. That night, accused-appellant ravished her twice.
[16]
When she went to the restroom, AAA noticed that her vagina was bleeding. She then rushed to BBB in the other room and told the latter, ""
Ginalaw ako ni
xxxx
."" However, BBB merely brushed it off and told AAA, ""
okay lang iyon. Wala lang iyon
.""
[17]
Three days later, or on September 11, 2011, AAA was back at the same hotel with BBB after the latter made her think that they were going somewhere else. There, accused-appellant was already waiting for AAA. BBB then persuaded AAA to go with him, who also promised her that he would give her a mobile phone if she would go to bed with him. Although AAA initially declined the offer, she was nonetheless forced to take drugs and have sex with him.
[18]
AAA saw accused-appellant a few more times thereafter because BBB would always find a way to persuade her to go back to the hotel with her. On one occasion, accused-appellant told AAA and BBB to bring four other minor females with them so that he could match these girls with four of his male friends. AAA and BBB did as instructed and brought four girls to the hotel. Inside one of the booked rooms, all of them took shabu. Subsequently, accused
-appellant provided AAA with her own male customer, whom she had to have sex with. For the sexual service AAA rendered, the customer paid accused
-appellant P2,000.00, from which accused-appellant and BBB got P500.00 each, while AAA received the remaining P1,000.00.
[19]
The same payment and sharing scheme applied to the other girls who accused-appellant paired with the other male customers.
[20]
On another date, accused-appellant told AAA and BBB to bring three more girls with them. Similar to the previous incident, accused-appellant matched each of them, including AAA, with a male customer. Afterwards, BBB gave AAA her share in the payment for the sexual service she rendered.
[21]
Later on, accused-appellant and AAA had a misunderstanding and they never saw each other again.

On October 11, 2011, AAA's mother, CCC, found out about the ordeal her daughter had suffered in the hands of accused-appellant. AAA told her mother everything – that accused-appellant sexually abused her, pimped her out to several men, and also taught how to use shabu.
[23]
Thus, AAA and CCC proceeded and reported the matter to the Women's Desk / Inter Agency Anti-Crime Taskforce (IACAT). Subsequently, the police authorities conducted an entrapment operation at
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
where accused-appellant, together with two other persons, was successfully apprehended.
[24]
On October 13, 2011, AAA was subjected to a medical examination, which revealed a ""presence of shallow healing laceration at 3 o'clock position, deep healing laceration at 5 o'clock position and deep healed laceration at 7 o'clock position.""
[25]
It further stated that ""medical evaluation shows a clear evidence of blunt penetrating trauma to the hymen.""
[26]
Moreover, AAA also went through a voluntary drug rehabilitation program,
[27]
as well as a urinalysis, which showed that she was positive for ""Trichomonas Vaginalis 0-6/hpg,"" a sexually transmitted disease.
[28]
Version of the Defense:
For his part, accused-appellant vehemently denied the allegations against him. He claimed that he met AAA on October 12, 2011 through BBB and a certain ""Lyn,"" who asked him if he wanted to pay for the sexual services of AAA, since the latter was in need of some money and was willing to be hooked up.
[29]
Accused-appellant agreed and instructed AAA and BBB to proceed to
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
. When accused-appellant and his friend, YYY, met the girls, they immediately noticed how young AAA looked. Accused
-appellant asked for AAA's true age but BBB assured him and his friend that both she and AAA were already of age.
[30]
Unconvinced, accused-appellant and YYY decided to call off the arrangement and leave the hotel.
[31]
However, before they could leave the hotel room, BBB heard a commotion outside. When she opened the door to check what was happening, police officers suddenly barged into the room and immediately ordered them to lie face down on the ground. Thereafter, accused-appellant and YYY were arrested and brought to Camp Bagong Diwa. Accused-appellant was detained for three months while his case was being heard by the prosecutor's office.
[32]","This appeal seeks the reversal of the April 8, 2019 Decision of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR HC No. 08573, which affirmed with modification the June 27, 2016 Decision of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of xxxxxxxxxxx , Branch 130, in Criminal Case Nos. C-87527 and C-87528 finding accused-appellant XXX (accused-appellant) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crimes of Qualified Trafficking in Persons and Rape. In a Decision dated April 8, 2019, the CA found accused-appellant's appeal unmeritorious and upheld the decision of the RTC. It ruled that the RTC did not err when it convicted accused-appellant of the crimes of Qualified Trafficking in Persons and Rape since the prosecution was able to adequately establish the presence of all the elements of both crimes. Anent the award for damages, the CA deemed it proper to modify the amounts granted by the RTC in order to conform to prevailing jurisprudence. Hence, the present appeal. The sole issue for this Court's resolution is whether accused-appellant is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crimes of Qualified Trafficking in Persons and Rape. Our Ruling: The appeal has no merit. The Court sustains the conviction of accused-appellant for the crimes of Qualified Trafficking in Persons and Rape.","Applying the foregoing law and jurisprudence in the case at bar, the RTC and the CA correctly convicted accused-appellant of Qualified Trafficking in Persons. It was sufficiently proved that all the elements of the crime are present. Through the straightforward and credible testimonies of the prosecution witnesses, particularly AAA's, it was established that: 1) accused-appellant recruited or hired AAA by instructing her and BBB to bring other minor females at the hotel and introducing them to different customers on separate occasions; (2) accused-appellant took advantage of AAA's vulnerability as a minor child and as someone who was in need of money; and (3) the purpose of such acts was for AAA and the other minor females to engage in sexual intercourse or to render sexual services to several men in exchange for money. Additionally, it is an undisputed fact that AAA was only 14 years old during the time when the incident occurred. Thus, this Court finds that the CA committed no reversible error when it affirmed the RTC's finding that accused-appellant is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Qualified Trafficking in Persons. Accused-appellant's bare denial that he did not recruit AAA to engage in prostitution must fail in light of the latter's clear, consistent, and credible testimony of AAA. All the elements of Rape are likewise availing in this case. Accused-appellant next argued in his appellant's brief that the prosecution failed to prove all the elements of Rape in Criminal Case No. C-87528. He claimed that the presence of force, threat, or intimidation is lacking since AAA disclosed in her sworn statement that she needed money and willingly went with BBB after finding out that the latter earned money by prostituting herself. This Court is not persuaded. Here, the prosecution sufficiently established that accused-appellant had carnal knowledge of AAA on September 8, 2011, through force and intimidation by pulling her and pinning her down, and inserting his penis into her vagina, against her will and without her consent. AAA clearly and categorically testified that accused-appellant successfully had sexual intercourse with her, despite her struggles and protestations. Her narration revealed the continuous resistance that she put up, and how accused-appellant eventually overpowered her in consummating his bestial desires. Thus, while it was not stated in AAA's sworn statement that she had sexual intercourse with accused-appellant against her will and without her consent, greater weight must be accorded to her testimony in court where she described in full detail how accused-appellant actually forced himself on her. In sum, the Court finds no cogent reason to overturn the findings of the RTC, as affirmed by the CA. There was no showing that they overlooked, misunderstood, or misapplied the surrounding facts and circumstances of the case. Thus, accused-appellant's criminal liability for the aforesaid acts must stand.","WHEREFORE , the appeal is DISMISSED . The April 8, 2019 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR HC No. 08573 is AFFIRMED . Accused-appellant XXX is hereby found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crimes of: (1) Qualified Trafficking in Persons under Section 4(e) in relation to Section 6(a) and punished under Section 10 (c) of Republic Act No. 9208 or the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003. He is SENTENCED to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and to PAY a fine of Two Million Pesos (P2,000,000.00). He is further ORDERED to PAY Five Hundred Thousand Pesos (P500,000.00) as moral damages and One Hundred Thousand Pesos (P100,000.00) as exemplary damages to AAA; (2) Rape under Article 266-A and penalized under Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code. He is thus SENTENCED to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua . Further, he is ORDERED to PAY the victim, AAA, the following amounts: (1) P75,000.00 as civil indemnity; (2) P75,000.00 as moral damages; and (3) P75,000.00 as exemplary damages. All damages awarded shall be subject to interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the finality of this Decision until its full satisfaction. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 214195, March 23, 2022","UNIMASTERS CONGLOMERATION INCORPORATED, PETITIONER, VS. TACLOBAN CITY GOVERNMENT, PRIVATIZATION AND MANAGEMENT OFFICE, PHILIPPINE TOURISM AUTHORITY, AND THE PROVINCE OF LEYTE, RESPONDENTS.","Leyte Park Hotel Inc. ( LPHI ) is a 61,322-square meter property that stands on Magsaysay Boulevard, Tacloban City and covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-1883. It is co-owned by Assets Privatization Trust ( APT ), now Privatization and Management Office ( PMO ), the Province of Leyte, and the Philippine Tourism Authority ( PTA ), now Tourism Infrastructure and Enterprise Zone Authority ( TIEZA ). APT/PMO holds 34% of the shares while PTA and the Province of Leyte hold 40% and 26% of the shares, respectively.[3] On September 15, 1994, then APT, representing the owners of LPHI, and Unimasters Conglomeration Incorporated ( UCI ), through its President, Wilson Chan ( Chan ), entered into a Contract of Lease over LPHI with a duration of 12 years.[4] A stipulation in the contract provides: COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS x x x x Section 11.04. Real property taxes shall be for the account of the LESSOR. Any payment of real property taxes by the LESSEE shall be credited against any amount due from the LESSEE to the LESSOR;[5] x x x x Initially, UCI was faithfully paying its monthly rentals and real property taxes, the latter payments were subsequently credited to its rental payment.[6] However, starting December 16, 2000, UCI stopped paying its obligations, prompting PMO to send several letters demanding compliance with the provisions of the contract. Even so, the agreement expired without UCI settling its obligations. Since then, UCI has retained possession and enjoyment of the premises without paying any rentals and taxes due.[7] Meanwhile, the City Treasurer of Tacloban sent several demand letters[8] to Chan to collect the unpaid real property taxes of LPHI for the years 1989 to 2012 in the amount of P65,969,406.74, but the same remained unpaid despite notice. Hence, the City Treasurer of Tacloban instituted a collection case against LPHI, UCI, APT, PTA, and the Province of Leyte before the CTA. The case was subsequently docketed as CTA OCA No. 012. After trial, the CTA (Special First Division) rendered a Decision,[9] dated November 15, 2011, which found UCI liable to pay the amount of P22,826,902.20. However, the CTA recognized the clause in the Contract of Lease signed by the parties which allowed the crediting of any payments made by UCI against its rentals.[10] UCI moved for reconsideration. When its motion was denied, UCI filed a petition for review before the CTA En Banc.[11] After due proceedings, the CTA En Banc issued the assailed Decision[12] dated August 22, 2014, which affirmed UCI's liability to pay the realty taxes for the period covering 1995-2004. Citing the cases of GSIS v. City Treasurer and City Assessor of the City of Manila[13] and Republic v. City of Kidapawan,[14] the CTA En Banc stood firm in ruling that realty tax pertaining to government assets attach to the property and is chargeable against the taxable person who had actual or beneficial use and possession of it regardless of whether or not he is the owner.[15] As regards the enforceability of the contractual obligation of the local government units, particularly the crediting of paid realty taxes on UCI's account, the CTA En Banc deferred to resolve the issue considering the pendency of a case involving the validity of the lease agreement between the parties.[16] Dissatisfied, UCI elevated the case to this Court ascribing error on the part of the CTA in holding UCI liable to pay the real property tax sought by the City Government of Tacloban over LPHI and in refusing to enforce the provision in the contract whereby PMO, PTA and the Province of Leyte contractually assumed liability to pay the taxes due.[17] UCI urges this Court to nullify the CTA rulings which applied the beneficial use principle. Citing the case of City of Pasig v. Republic of the Philippines,[18] UCI argues that the payment of realty taxes over LPHI should rest on the Republic in case the beneficial user failed to pay the required taxes thereon especially so in this case that the Republic, through the PMO, PTA, and the Province of Leyte, has waived its tax exemption when it contractually assumed the payment of real property taxes in the lease contract.[19]","We deny the petition for failure of the petitioner to show that the CTA En Banc committed any reversible error in dismissing its appeal. The CTA En Banc is correct in denying petitioner's appeal and, in effect, affirming the ruling of the CTA Division which found it liable to pay real property taxes over the LPHI property.","The Supreme Court upheld the application of the beneficial use principle derived from Section 234 (a) of the Local Government Code (RA 7160). This section exempts properties owned by the Republic (including government instrumentalities like PMO and PTA) from real property tax, unless the beneficial use thereof has been granted, for consideration or otherwise, to a taxable person. Since UCI, a private entity, had beneficial use of the LPHI property through a Contract of Lease, the tax exemption was lifted, and the burden to pay the taxes devolved upon UCI as the beneficial user, regardless of ownership. The Court clarified that the liability for unpaid taxes attaches to the taxable person who enjoys actual or beneficial use and possession of the property. Regarding UCI's argument that PMO and PTA contractually assumed the tax liability in the lease agreement (Section 11.04), the Court held that the Tacloban City Government is not privy to the lease contract. Under the general principle of relativity of contracts (Article 1311), the contract only binds the parties who entered into it, and thus, the contractual stipulation cannot automatically exonerate UCI from the tax burden created by law, nor bind the local government unit which was not a party to the agreement. Whether the stipulation regarding the crediting of taxes against rentals is valid and enforceable against the co-owners is a matter to be threshed out in the proper forum (the Regional Trial Court), where a case is already pending.","WHEREFORE, foregoing considered, the Petition is DENIED. The Decision dated August 22, 2014 of the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc in CTA EB No. 901 is AFFIRMED. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 226138, March 23, 2022","REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, REPRESENTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS AND HIGHWAYS, PETITIONER, VS. ESPINA & MADARANG, CO. AND MAKAR AGRICULTURAL CORP., RESPONDENTS.","Briefly, the present case involves the propriety of the Orders of the RTC of General Santos City, which (1) directed the Republic to deliver to the respondents Espina & Madarang, Co. and Makar Agricultural Corp. (Espina and Makar) the amount of P218,839,455.00 representing their road right of way (RROW) compensation as payment for the property taken by the government for the construction of the Cotabato-Kiamba-General Santos-Koronadal National Highway; and (2) ordered the sheriff to levy, garnish, seize, and deliver to Makar or to the court, funds of the DPWH that may be found anywhere in the Philippines to satisfy the judgment in their favor. [7]
The controversy originated from an undated letter of Vicente L. Olarte, the attorney-in-fact of the Olarte Hermanos y Cia Estate, to the Regional Director of the DPWH demanding for the payment of their RROW claim covering an area of 186,856 square meters taken by the government for the construction of the Cotabato-Kiamba-General Santos-Koronadal National Highway. [8]
Spec Pro. No. 2004-074 (Special Proceedings Case)
The foregoing was followed by a case entitled, ""In the matter of Insolvencia Voluntaria De Olarte Hermanos y Cia, Heirs of the Late Alberto P. Olarte and Jose P. Olarte, et al.,"" before the RTC of Cotabato City, Branch 14 docketed as Special Proceedings No. 2004-074 (Spec Pro. No. 2004-074). [9]
In an Order dated July 4, 2007, the RTC of Cotabato City enjoined the DPWH to pay the RROW claim of the heirs of Olarte. In its subsequent Order dated November 13, 2007, the RTC of Cotabato City directed the DPWH to pay the heirs of Olarte the partial payment of their RROW compensation in the amount of P44,891,140.65 within ten days from notice. In compliance therewith, the DPWH started paying the same to the heirs of Olarte. [10]
Civil Case No. 7788 (Injunction Case)
On May 7, 2008, Espina and Makar filed a complaint for injunction before the RTC of General Santos City docketed as Civil Case No. 7788 against the heirs of Alberto Pelayo Olarte and Jose Pelayo Olarte, the DPWH, and Register of Deeds of General Santos City. The complaint alleged that the Original Certificate of Title No. 12 (OCT No. 12) in the name of Olarte Hermanos, used as basis for the claim of the heirs of Alberto and Jose Olarte over the RROW compensation, was mortgaged to El Hogar Filipino (El Hogar). Due to nonpayment of the loan obligation, the property was sold at a public auction to El Hogar on October 15, 1933. Consequently, OCT No. 12 was canceled and TCT No. 886 was issued in the name of El Hogar. In 1937, El Hogar sold the property to the Espina sisters, namely: Salud, Soledad, Mercedes, and Asuncion to whom TCT No. (T-635) (T-19) T-2 was issued. Asuncion later on sold her share to Soledad in 1949, and TCT No. (T-636) (T-20) T-3 was issued in the name of the remaining three sisters. In 1958, the latter sold the property to Makar and TCT No. (T-5288) (T-433) T-118 was issued in its favor. Thereafter, Makar sold 195.1838 hectares of the property to Espina, which subdivided the same into lots and sold them to third parties. Despite the aforesaid change in ownership, Espina and Makar averred that the heirs of Olarte were able to file a RROW claim with the DPWH based on OCT No. 12. Hence, the complaint for injunction to enjoin the DPWH from paying the heirs of Olarte. [11]
In response thereto, DPWH filed a Manifestation and Motion (in lieu of Answer) dated October 17, 2008, alleging that it already paid the heirs of Olarte upon their representation that they were the rightful owners of the property traversed by the Cotabato-Kiamba-General Santos-Koronadal National Highway. Considering the dispute on ownership, DPWH claimed that it would support any proceeding that would thresh out the issue and that it would cease from paying the heirs of Olarte until the issue of ownership is resolved. [12]
On September 4, 2009, Espina and Makar filed a Manifestation to render Civil Case No. 7788 moot and academic in view of the Decision dated July 22, 2009 of the CA in CA-G.R. SP No. 02303-MIN, entitled ""Espina & Madarang, Co. & Makar Agricultural Corp. (Makar) represented by Rodrigo A. Adtoon, Petitioners v. Hon. Cedar P. Indar Al Haj, Judge, et al., Respondents."" Espina and Makar alleged that the aforesaid CA Decision already affirmed their ownership over the subject property and thus, the DPWH should be directed to release, in their favor, the payment of the RROW compensation. [13]
In their Comment to the Manifestation, DPWH acknowledged that the injunction case was indeed rendered moot and academic in view of the Decision dated July 22, 2009 of the CA in CA-G.R. SP No. 02302-MIN. However, DPWH asserted that it was improper for the RTC to order the payment of the RROW compensation in favor of Espina and Makar without a definite ruling that the latter are the owners of the subject property. According to DPWH, the CA merely ruled that the special proceedings case cannot proceed as the heirs of Olarte were no longer the owners of the subject property. [14]
Subsequently, on October 5, 2009, the RTC of General Santos City issued an Order ruling that the injunction case is already moot and academic in view of the Decision dated July 22, 2009 of the CA in CA-G.R. SP No. 02302-MIN. It also upheld Espina and Makar's ownership over the subject property and ordered the DPWH to deliver to them the payment of their RROW compensation. [15]
At odds with the ruling, DPWH moved for reconsideration, but the same was denied by the RTC of General Santos City in its Order dated October 30, 2009. [16]
On even date, a notice of garnishment was likewise issued. [17]
This was followed by a supplemental order dated November 13, 2009, directing the DPWH to pay Espina and Makar the amount of P218,839,455.00 representing the fair market value of the subject property as reflected in the masterlist of revalidated road right of way claim of the heirs of Olarte as of June 30, 2007. [18]
CA-G.R. No. SP No. 03310-MIN
The Republic, through the DPWH, thereafter, filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with prayer for a temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction before the CA, seeking to nullify the RTC Orders dated October 5, 2009, October 30, 2009, and November 13, 2009. The case was docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 03310-MIN. The Republic contended that the RTC of General Santos City went beyond its jurisdiction when it ordered the payment of the RROW even if the same was not prayed for in the complaint; that such payment is improper in injunction cases, being limited only to restraining an act; that the ownership of Espina and Makar over the subject property was not definitely established; and that public funds cannot be the subject of garnishment. [19]
Meanwhile, during the pendency of the case in CA-G.R. SP No. 03310-MIN, the RTC of General Santos City issued an Order dated June 1, 2010, directing the issuance of a new writ of execution to implement the Orders dated October 5, 2009 and November 13, 2009. Subsequently, a writ of execution was issued on June 2, 2010. [20]
On June 14, 2011, the CA in CA-G.R. SP No. 03310-MIN rendered a Decision, denying the petition filed by Republic. The CA held therein that there was no more issue regarding the transfer of ownership from El Hogar to Espina and Makar. Therefore, the latter's title is presumed valid... It also ruled that the grant of the RROW compensation in the injunction suit is proper because the concept of injunction is not limited to restraining a party or refraining him from doing the questioned act, but also for doing an act. Finally, the CA ruled that the exemption of public funds from garnishment does not apply in this case because the funds sought to be levied were already allocated by law for the satisfaction of a money judgment against the government. In fact, the Republic had already been paying the heirs of Olarte in the special proceedings case. [21]
Subsequently, the Republic moved for reconsideration, but the same was denied by the CA in its Resolution dated June 29, 2012. [22]
G.R. No. 202416
Unsatisfied, the Republic elevated the matter to this Court by a petition for review on certiorari docketed as G.R. No. 202416. [23]
On November 28, 2012, a Minute Resolution was issued by this Court, denying the petition for Republic's failure to sufficiently show reversible error in the challenged Decision of the CA to warrant the exercise of this Court's discretionary appellate jurisdiction. In another Minute Resolution dated March 18, 2013, this Court denied Republic's motion for reconsideration with finality. [24]
In view of the finality of G.R. No. 202416, Espina and Makar filed before the RTC of General Santos City an Ex-Parte Motion to Direct the Sheriff for Prompt and Immediate Implementation, praying for the reimplementation of the writ of execution dated June 2, 2010. [25]
In its Order dated December 16, 2013, the RTC of General Santos City directed the sheriff to immediately implement the writ of execution. [26]
The same was opposed by the heirs of Olarte. On the other hand, Espina and Makar filed an ex-parte motion to direct the sheriff for prompt and immediate implementation of the writ. [27]
On February 24, 2014, the RTC of General Santos City denied the Motion of the heirs of Olarte and granted the motion of Espina and Makar, directing the sheriff to implement the writ of execution dated June 2, 2010, and to levy, garnish, seize, and deliver to them or the court, whatever funds, money, or assets of the DPWH susceptible to execution found anywhere in the Philippines to satisfy the judgment. [28]
Thus, the Republic filed an Urgent Motion for Reconsideration, reiterating that public funds cannot be the subject of writ of execution. It added that Espina and Makar's claim should first be filed before the Commission on Audit (COA). The heirs of Olarte also filed a separate Motion for Reconsideration. [29]
On July 21, 2014, the RTC of General Santos City issued an Order, denying both motions for reconsideration. [30]
CA-G.R. SP No. 06472-MIN (the present case)
Undeterred by the setback, the Republic, as represented by the DPWH, once again filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition before the CA docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 06472-MIN. In support thereof, the Republic asserted that (1) the ownership of the subject property has not been settled; (2) the suability of the State does not mean liability because public funds cannot be the subject of garnishment; and (3) respondents should have first filed their claim before the COA. [31]
On January 25, 2016, the CA rendered the assailed Decision, [32] affirming in toto the Orders dated December 16, 2013, February 24, 2014, and July 21, 2014 of the RTC of General Santos City. The CA ratiocinated that the issues raised by the Republic involving the ownership of the subject property and the suability of the State have already been settled in CA-G.R. SP No. 03310-MIN, which this Court affirmed with finality in G.R. No. 202416. Thus, res judicata had already set in. [33]
As for the Republic's claim that the money claim should have been first filed with the COA, the CA opined that Republic is already barred from invoking the same for failure to raise the said issue in CA-G.R. SP No. 03310-MIN. [34]","On January 25, 2016, the CA rendered the assailed Decision, [32] affirming in toto the Orders dated December 16, 2013, February 24, 2014, and July 21, 2014 of the RTC of General Santos City.

Despite the rendition of a final and executory judgment validating their entitlement to the RROW compensation, the respondents are still required to pursue their claim before the COA for its execution.

"G.R. No. 206120, March 23, 2022","RAQUEL G. DY BUNCIO, PETITIONER, VS. LEONTINA SARMENTA RAMOS AND FERNANDO RAMOS, RESPONDENTS.","The instant case stemmed from a complaint for Accion Reinvindicatoria and Damages filed by Buncio on January 8, 2007 with the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Cabanatuan City, docketed as Civil Case No. 5302. Buncio claimed to be a registered co-owner of a parcel of land covered by TCT No. T-50156 and alleged that respondents Leontina Sarmenta Ramos and Fernando Ramos are the unlawful and unauthorized possessors. Respondents asserted that the RTC had no jurisdiction over the subject matter because there existed a leasehold agreement (tenancy) between the registered owners' parents and Leontina/Hilario Ramos. In its January 30, 2008 Order, the RTC initially held that it had jurisdiction since respondents failed to prove all elements of agricultural tenancy. However, subsequently, after an ocular inspection, the RTC, in its October 28, 2010 Resolution, reversed itself and referred the case to the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB), citing Section 50-A of RA 6657, as amended by RA 9700, because there was an allegation of landowner-tenant relationship. Buncio's Omnibus Motion for Reconsideration was denied in the RTC's June 6, 2011 Order. Aggrieved, Buncio filed a Petition for Certiorari with the Court of Appeals (CA) assailing the RTC's referral resolutions. In its September 30, 2011 Resolution, the CA dismissed Buncio's Petition for Certiorari, holding that Buncio availed of the improper remedy, stating that she had a plain, speedy, or adequate remedy before the DAR and that resort to certiorari was premature. The CA denied Buncio's Motion for Reconsideration in its March 6, 2013 Resolution. Displeased, Buncio filed the instant Petition for Review on Certiorari.","The Court of Appeals (CA) dismissed the petition for certiorari filed by petitioner Raquel G. Dy Buncio, holding that Buncio availed of the improper remedy. The CA ruled that Buncio had a plain, speedy, or adequate remedy before the DAR, and that resort to a special civil action for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules at that stage was premature. This ruling was embodied in the CA's September 30, 2011 Resolution and affirmed in its March 6, 2013 Resolution denying Buncio's Motion for Reconsideration.","The instant Petition is devoid of merit. The CA correctly dismissed Buncio's Petition for Certiorari for being a wrong remedy. Section 50-A of RA 6557, as amended by RA 9700, expressly provides that if there is an allegation that the case is agrarian in nature, the case shall be automatically referred to the DAR, and 'from the determination of the DAR, an aggrieved party shall have judicial recourse.' Hence, the proper recourse of Buncio upon the trial court's referral of the case was to await the DARAB's resolution, after which Buncio could assail the determination of the DARAB by appeal to the CA. Her immediate recourse to the CA via a Petition for Certiorari was improper and thus, correctly struck down by the appellate court. Furthermore, Buncio did not acquire any vested right from the RTC's initial January 30, 2008 Order, as jurisdiction is conferred by law, and the RTC correctly referred the case to the DAR in view of the respondents' substantial allegation of a tenancy relationship.","WHEREFORE, the instant Petition is DENIED. The assailed September 30, 2011 Resolution and March 6, 2013 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-GR CV No. 120922 are hereby AFFIRMED. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 208254, March 23, 2022","RURAL BANK OF CANDELARIA (ZAMBALES), INC. REPRESENTED BY ITS CHAIRMAN­-PRESIDENT, ANTONIO MANIKAN, PETITIONER, VS. ROMULO BANLUTA (DECEASED), SUBSTITUTED BY HIS CHILDREN, NAMELY: ROMULO BANLUTA, JR., ET AL., RESPONDENTS.","The present case stemmed from a Complaint for Annulment of Application for Foreclosure of Real Estate Mortgage, Notice of Extrajudicial Sale, Sheriff's Certificate of Sale with a Prayer for the Issuance of a Writ of Prohibitory Injunction, Accounting, Recovery of Possession with Damages [5] filed by Romulo Banluta (respondent) against the Rural Bank of Candelaria, Zambales, Inc. (petitioner), represented by its Chairperson and President, Antonio Manikan (Manikan) and Sheriff Romeo J. Enriquez.
In gist, respondent alleged that on June 11, 1993, he and his wife, Nimfa Banluta (Nimfa), obtained a loan from petitioner in the amount of P683,000.00. Said loan was secured by a real estate mortgage over two parcels of land. On June 28, 1996, while the mortgage was subsisting, Nimfa died. Said loan was already fully paid by the respondent as shown by his payments in the following amounts: (a) P122,400.05, paid on August 5, 1995; (b) P20,000.00, paid on July 3, 1999; (c) P50,000.00, paid on July 9, 1999; and (d) P703,279.54, as full payment of the loan inclusive of penalties and interests. Respondent further alleged that he had the impression that the loan was fully paid but did not bother to secure a Release of the Mortgage. Respondent's possession of the subject lands was peaceful until the first part of January 2003, when armed persons of petitioner entered the property and forcibly harassed respondent's son and daughter-in-law, who were in control and actual possession of the lands. Upon verification with the Office of the Provincial Sheriff, respondent discovered that an Application for Foreclosure of Real Estate Mortgage was filed by petitioner. In fact, the sale in public auction of the subject properties was already conducted by the sheriff, as shown by the Notice of Extrajudicial Sale and the Sheriff's Certificate of Sale, without due notice to respondent. [6] Respondent also averred that at the time of the constitution of the mortgage, only the tax declarations were used since the subject lands were not yet covered by a transfer certificate of title. When the certificates of title were issued in 1994, the area of the lands described therein became bigger compared to the area indicated in the tax declarations. Said certificates of title were the basis of petitioner's application for foreclosure of mortgage. Hence, assuming that the foreclosure was lawful and valid, such foreclosure should only be limited to the area originally mortgaged as indicated in the tax declarations. Also, petitioner had not registered the foreclosure with the Register of Deeds of Zambales. Consequently, respondent's right of redemption over the properties subsists and the one-year period therefor has not yet commenced. In any event, respondent asserted his willingness to pay the balance, if any, of the loan. Respondent ultimately prayed for the nullification of the foreclosure sale, an accounting of respondent's true monetary obligations, an award of attorney's fees, and damages. [7] Petitioner filed an Answer [8] and countered that respondent's original loan covered by the real estate mortgage was executed on January 23, 1984 and renewed on several occasions, the latest renewal being on September 15, 1999 for the amount of P683,000.00. Petitioner denied respondent's full payment of the latest loan and asserted that the alleged payments made by the respondent were not real payments but for the loan renewals. Respondent could not have possibly disregard the release of the mortgage if the loan was indeed already fully paid. For two (2) years since the last loan matured on March 14, 2000, and despite continuous demands from petitioner, respondent never coordinated or communicated with petitioner. It was only due to the pleas for extension made by respondent's son and daughter-in-law that petitioner deferred the foreclosure of the mortgage and the registration of the subsequent certificate of sale. Petitioner also averred that it had complied with all the legal requirements for foreclosure of mortgage. The certificate of sale has also been registered with the Register of Deeds of Zambales on June 29, 2001. Respondent did not redeem the property. Petitioner's consolidation of ownership was thus proper and in order. Anent the discrepancy in the area of the lands mortgaged, petitioner countered that what defines the value of the land is not the numerical figure indicated as area but the actual metes and bounds of the property. By way of counterclaims, petitioner sought for respondent's surrender of the certificates of title of the subject lands and the payment of attorney's fees and litigation expenses. [9]","On November 29, 2011, the CA rendered a Decision, [17] affirming the RTC Decision. Only respondent moved for partial reconsideration. [18] . . . On February 28, 2013, the granted respondent's motion and promulgated the assailed Amended Decision, [21] viz. : WHEREFORE , the motion for partial reconsideration is PARTIALLY GRANTED . The Decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 69, Iba, Zambales dated July 5, 2010 is hereby MODIFIED by DELETING paragraph (3) thereof, which reads: ""(3) Ordering the plaintiff to pay forthwith defendant bank the sum of P4,228,955.98 representing the principal loan of P683,000.00 plus 20% compounded interest computed from 15 March 2000 up to 14 March 2010 (sic) plus interest thereon until fully paid in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the promissory noted dated 15 September 1999."" SO ORDERED. [22] Albeit ruling that the PN dated September 15, 1999 is admissible in evidence because the document marked as Exhibit ""1"" is an original copy of said PN, [23] the CA nonetheless denied evidentiary value thereto insofar as establishing respondent's unpaid obligation is concerned. The CA gave credence to respondent's arguments in the motion for partial reconsideration and held that there was indeed material alteration of the September 15, 1999 PN. . . This time, petitioner moved for reconsideration, [28] which was denied by the CA through the challenged June 25, 2013 Resolution. [29]","The petition is partly meritorious. . . As regards the first issue, suffice it to state that the ruling of the RTC declaring the real estate mortgage and the subsequent foreclosure proceedings as null and void had already been sustained by the CA in its November 29, 2011 Decision, which initially affirmed in full the RTC findings and Decision. . . The other two (2) issues raised in the petition are the crux of the present appeal, i.e. , whether the CA committed a reversible error in ruling that the September 15, 1999 PN was materially altered and has no evidentiary value insofar as respondent's alleged loan is concerned. The Court rules in the affirmative. . . In fine, the defense of material alteration of the subject PN was not properly raised and adequately argued and proven before the RTC. Basic rules of fair play, justice, and due process require that arguments or issues not raised in the trial court may not be raised for the first time on appeal. [61] Verily, respondent cannot be allowed to raise the issue or defense of material alteration for the first time in the appeal with the CA. . . All told, the CA erred in rendering the Amended Decision and deciding the issue of material alteration for the first time on appeal. Consequently, as aptly held by the RTC, the terms and conditions of the September 15, 1999 PN, including the stipulated interest of 20% per annum , are valid and binding as to respondent. Said stipulated interest shall be imposed on the total principal due from March 4, 2000, the maturity date of the subject PN, until finality of this Decision. In addition, the total amount due to petitioner shall earn legal interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the finality of this Decision until full payment.","WHEREFORE , premises considered, the petition is PARTLY GRANTED . The February 28, 2013 Amended Decision and the June 25, 2013 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 95777 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE . The July 5, 2010 Decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 69, Iba, Zambales in Civil Case No. 1988-I is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATIONS in that the interest rate stipulated in the September 15, 1999 Promissory Note shall be imposed up to the date of finality of this Decision. From such finality until full satisfaction of the obligation, the total amount due shall earn legal interest at the rate of 6% per annum . SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 241776, March 23, 2022","ROSETTE Y. LERIAS, PEDRO C. LLEVARES, JR., MA. LUCINA L. CALAPRE, JOSEPH A. DUARTE, AND CATALINO O. OLAYVAR, PETITIONERS, VS. THE HON. OMBUDSMAN AND THE FIELD INVESTIGATION OFFICE, OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSMAN, RESPONDENTS.","On June 14, 2017, Field Investigation Office (FIO) of the Office of the Ombudsman (OMB) filed a complaint for malversation of public funds and violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019 (R.A. No. 3019) against Provincial Governor Rosette Y. Lerias (Lerias), Provincial Agriculturist Eluterio V. Tibon (Tibon), Provincial Treasurer Pedro C. Llevares, Jr. (Llevares, Jr.), Inspection Officer Ameo S. Capistrano (Capistrano), OIC-Provincial Accountant Ma. Lucina L. Calapre (Calapre), Provincial Budget Officer Joseph A. Duarte (Duarte), and Provincial General Services Officer Catalino O. Olayvar (Olayvar), all of the Provincial Local Government Unit (PLGU) of Southern Leyte; Leo P. Cañeda (Cañeda) of the Region Field Unit VIII of the Department of Agriculture (DA RFU VIII); and Clemente CH. Fernandez (Fernandez), sales manager of Philippine Phosphate Fertilizers Corporation (Philphos). [4] The complaint alleged that Lerias et al. conspired to defraud the government in using P3,250,000.00 to purchase 4,394 bags of various grades of fertilizers from Philphos without conducting public bidding, as required by Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9184. The complaint showed that the Fertilizer and Pesticide Authority (FPA) had previously accredited two suppliers of fertilizers in Southern Leyte. [5] The FIO further averred that on April 29, 2004, the PLGU Southern Leyte received the first tranche of the Ginintuang Masaganang Ani from the DA RFU VII in the amount of P3,250,000.00. On April 30, 2004, Tibon prepared, and Lerias approved, a purchase request for 4,394 bags of various grades of fertilizers. On May 5, 2004, Tibon prepared an unnumbered purchase order signed by Calapre, Duarte, Llevares, Jr., and Olayvar, and approved by Lerias. On May 20, 2004, the PLGU Southern Leyte paid P3,217,381.20 to Philphos. Tibon certified that there was no suitable substitute of substantially the same quality of fertilizers available at a lower price. In the inspection and acceptance report dated May 4, 2004, Capistrano certified that the quantity and specification of the fertilizers were acceptable. [6] Lastly, the FIO claimed that Lerias et al. violated R.A. No. 9184 and its Implementing Rules and Regulations when they adopted a direct contracting or single source procurement as an alternative method of procurement instead of conducting a public bidding. They allegedly accomplished this by making it appear that Philphos is the exclusive manufacturer of the procured fertilizers. The FIO claims that the FPA has previously accredited two suppliers of fertilizers in Southern Leyte. [7] In their joint counter-affidavit, Lerias, Capistrano, Duarte, and Calapre contended that resorting to direct contracting is not contrary to law as long as the conditions provided by R.A. No. 9184 were met. They explained that Philphos is the exclusive distributor within Region 8 while Nican Enterprises and EBR Marketing Corporation are merely distributors of fertilizers in Ormoc City. [8] They maintained that directly contracting with Philphos proved to be more beneficial to the government and it helped improve the province's overall rice production. [9] Olayvar echoed the arguments of Lerias, Capistrano, Duarte, and Calapre. [10] For his part, Tibon alleged in his counter-affidavit that he retired in December 2004. He denied having committed the charges against him and stated that the signatures that appeared in the documents were those of Daniel Mayorca, the provincial agriculturist who replaced him. [11] On the part of Fernandez, he asserted that he had no personal knowledge of the bidding procedure conducted by the PLGU-Southern Leyte. He admitted that he had knowledge of the purchase order with the caveat that he did not participate in the transaction. He acknowledged that P3,217,381.20 was paid to Philphos by the PLGU-Southern Leyte although he did not personally receive the same and thus, did not issue the official sales receipt. [12] Llevares, Jr. and Caneda did not submit any counter-affidavit despite notice. [13] The OMB found probable cause to charge Lerias, Llevares, Jr., Calapre, Duarte, and Olayvar for violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 by conspiring in releasing the funds in favor of Philphos without undergoing the correct procurement process. [14] The OMB observed that Lerias acted with manifest partiality when she approved the procurement of different fertilizers from Philphos without complying with the requirements of R.A. No. 9184 as to the conduct of a thorough canvass for similar suppliers. [15] As to the liability of Llevares, Jr., Calapre, Duarte, and Olayvar, the OMB noted that they were in conspiracy as can be gleaned from their act of signing the purchase order, disbursement voucher, and other documents. There was allegedly no proof that they consulted the resident auditor of the Commission on Audit (COA) to determine the aptness of the mode that they undertook. [16] Tibon was absolved by the OMB as it was established that the signature appearing above his name in all the documents was that of Daniel Mayorca. [17] Likewise, the OMB saw no wrongdoing on the part of Capistrano as he was not involved in the procurement through direct contracting with Philphos as he merely inspected the delivery of the assorted fertilizers. [18] With regard to Cañeda, the OMB found no evidence that he acted with evident bad faith or with intent to defraud the government when he signed the memorandum of agreement representing DA-RFU VIII. The OMB observed that his participation was limited to the transfer of funds to the PLGU of Southern Leyte and that he had no direct participation in the procurement process. In relation to Fernandez's culpability, the OMB saw no basis to charge him together with the other accused as there was no showing that his signature appeared in any of the documents attached in the complaint. [19] With respect to the charge of malversation of public funds, the same was dismissed based on the findings of the OMB that there was no evidence to show that Lerias, Tibon, Llevares, Jr., Capistrano, Calapre, and Duarte misappropriated or allowed any person to appropriate funds for their personal benefit. [20] On March 26, 2018, Calapre, Duarte, and Olayvar filed a joint motion for reconsideration while Lerias filed a separate motion for reconsideration. They alleged that the OMB's findings were erroneous due to the fact that (a) Philphos was the sole manufacturer of inorganic fertilizer in Region VIII from 1987 up to November 2012; (b) Philphos had no suitable substitute; (c) there was no evidence that Nican Enterprise and EBR Marketing Corporation were licensed fertilizer distributors in 2004; (d) the terms offered by Philphos were already inclusive of storage, insurance, security, and delivery; and (e) the exclusive distributorship requirement under Republic Act No. 9184 does not refer to a manufacturer and does not include subdealers selling at lower prices. [21] They further claimed that their signatures in the purchase order, disbursement voucher and/or check are part of their regular functions. They maintained that there was no criminal design and undue injury as the fertilizers were reasonably and completely delivered. With regard to Lerias, she stated that her reliance on her subordinate was justified and reasonable. Lastly, they argued that their right to a speedy disposition of their case was violated because of the fact that the OMB took four years to resolve the case from the time the complaint was filed in 2013 and 11 years from the time the audit report of the COA came out. [22] On April 30, 2018, the OMB denied the motions for reconsideration. [23] Hence, the instant petition.",The petition is impressed with merit.,"The Court applied the balancing test, specifically the refined framework established in *Cagang v. Sandiganbayan*. The starting point for computing delay was September 14, 2013 (submission of counter-affidavit). The OMB resolution was promulgated on June 14, 2017. The Court found that the OMB investigating officer and the OMB took 1370 days (3 years, 9 months, and 1 day) to determine probable cause, which is beyond the prescribed period under Rule 112 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure. The burden of justification thus shifted to the State. The Court rejected the OMB's justification that the case was complex, finding that the case involved a ""linear or straightforward determination that does not require years of examination"" and the documents were readily accessible. Furthermore, the Court found that petitioners suffered prejudice (agony, anxiety, inconvenience, and stigma) due to the protracted investigation. Since the petitioners timely invoked their right in their motion for reconsideration and proved unreasonable delay, the Court held that their right to the speedy disposition of their case was violated, necessitating the dismissal of the complaint with prejudice against the State.","WHEREFORE, the Court NULLIFIES and SETS ASIDE the Resolution and Order promulgated by the Office of the Ombudsman on June 14, 2017 and April 30, 2018 in OMB-C-C-13-0170. The Court DISMISSES OMB-C-C-13-0170 on the ground that the Office of the Ombudsman violated the right of the petitioners Rosette Y. Lerias, Pedro C. Llevares, Jr., Ma. Lucina L. Calapre, Joseph A. Duarte, and Catalino O. Olayvar to the speedy disposition of their case. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 225669, March 23, 2022","OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSMAN, PETITIONER, VS. LILAH YMBONG RODAS, RESPONDENT.","Respondent held the position of Engineer II at the Regional Office No. 7 of the Maritime Industry Authority (MARINA). When the instant controversy began in 2003, her gross annual salary was P173,400.00. In an anonymous letter dated August 26, 2003, addressed to the Ombudsman, respondent was accused of acquiring various assets which were disproportionate to her income. Acting on the same, the Ombudsman ordered MARINA's Regional Office No. 7 to submit copies of respondent's Statements of Assets, Liabilities and Net Worth (SALNs) for the years 1999 until 2003. In its Final Evaluation Report, the Ombudsman observed that in her 2001 SALN until her 2003 SALN, respondent erroneously indicated the fair market value of the real properties that she owned instead of the cost of the acquisition of the same. More importantly, the Ombudsman found that respondent's salary was disproportionate to the value of her acquisitions. And because respondent did not declare any other business that she or her husband possessed, it was not legally possible for her to increase her assets by P906,000.00, or from P4,680,000.00 to P5,586,000.00, from the year 2002 to the year 2003. Thus, respondent was administratively charged by the Ombudsman. In her defense, respondent admitted that she inadvertently made mistakes in the filing of her SALNs. Nevertheless, she asserted that prior to her employment with MARINA, she was employed by various private companies and corporations for 19 years; that she had the opportunity to retire twice, therefor receiving two retirement and separation benefits; that she inherited properties from her deceased father and uncle; that all of her properties, except two cars, were acquired before she was employed by MARINA; that her Toyota Surf and Mitsubishi Pajero, valuing P600,000.00, were purchased from a personal friend on an installment basis; and that her husband was a self-employed mechanical engineer who did not maintain a regular business, but rather took projects intermittently.","In its Decision dated August 28, 2009, the Ombudsman found respondent guilty of Serious Dishonesty and meting upon her the penalty of dismissal from the service. On October 29, 2015, the CA rendered the herein assailed Decision finding respondent guilty only of Simple Negligence and setting aside the penalty of dismissal meted out by the Ombudsman. Accordingly, the CA imposed against respondent the penalty of suspension without pay for a period of one year.","The CA correctly found respondent guilty only of simple negligence and not serious dishonesty. A mere misdeclaration in the SALN does not automatically amount to dishonesty. Only when the accumulated wealth becomes manifestly disproportionate to the income or other sources of income of the public officer/employee and he fails to properly account or explain his other sources of income, does he become susceptible to dishonesty. Where the source of the undisclosed wealth can be properly accounted for, then it is 'explained wealth' which the law does not penalize. A review of the records obtaining in this case reveals that respondent was able to prove the legitimacy of the source of her undeclared savings which, as of the year 2003, amounted to P906,000.00, through the chronological enumeration of her 19 years of employment in the private sector, along with the salaries, renumerations, and other benefits that she received, which were not even challenged or refuted by the Ombudsman. Since respondent was able to sufficiently explain the legality of her previously undisclosed savings, she cannot be held administratively liable for serious dishonesty. At most, respondent is guilty of simple negligence for having failed to ascertain that her SALN was accomplished properly, accurately, and in more detail.","The petition is DENIED for lack of merit. The Decision dated October 29, 2015 and the Resolution dated June 20, 2016 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 06453 are hereby AFFIRMED. Respondent Lilah Ymbong Rodas is found GUILTY of simple negligence and is ORDERED suspended from office for a period of one (1) year. However, considering respondent's untimely demise, this penalty can no longer be imposed. Accordingly, the corresponding death and survivorship benefits, if any, are ordered RELEASED to her heirs."

Contrary to law.""[8] Upon arraignment, accused-appellant pleaded not guilty to the crimes charged.[9] Trial ensued. Version of the Prosecution The prosecution established that around 12:00 p.m. on December 23, 2013, AAA arrived early from school when accused-appellant, who is the common-law husband of her sister, asked her to get a sando from her sister's bedroom. Once AAA was inside the bedroom, accused-appellant, who was only wearing tapis , held her shoulders and forced her to lie down. Acused-appellant then lifted AAA's skirt, pulled down her panties, and inserted his penis into her vagina. AAA felt pain. She struggled and tried to push him but to no avail. Thereafter, accused-appellant readily put on his tapis . He threatened her not to tell her sister and her mother, otherwise, he will evict them from the house.[10] On January 3, 2014 at around 7:00 a.m., AAA was sleeping in her bedroom when accused-appellant suddenly lay down beside her, placed his hand inside her shorts, and inserted his finger into her vagina. AAA pulled his hands away from her shorts, but accused-appellant refused to remove them. Thereafter, before leaving the room, accused-appellant threatened her not to tell her sister and mother.[11] A similar incident happened on January 16, 2014. Around 5:00 p.m., when AAA was asleep, accused-appellant suddenly lay down beside her and inserted his finger into her vagina. AAA forcibly removed his hands so that accused-appellant left the bedroom. When AAA's sister and mother arrived, she finally told them the horrible experiences she had with accused-appellant. Upon hearing AAA's complaint, the mother and sister immediately accompanied AAA to the barangay hall to file a complaint.[12] Version of the Defense In his defense, accused-appellant denied the charges. He insisted that: (1) on December 23, 2013, around 12:00 p.m., he was with his father and brother mending fishing nets on the boat and stayed there until 6:00 p.m.; (2) on January 3, 2014, he was in the house of his mother arranging the fishing nets; and (3) on January 16, 2014, he was in his house sleeping until 7:30 a.m. He further asserted that AAA made up the complaints because the latter harbored a resentment against him after he told her brother that he saw her meeting with someone in the dark.[13]","The Court of Appeals (CA) Decision[2] dated June 29, 2018 in CA-G.R.

Well settled is the rule that the matter of ascribing substance to the testimonies of witnesses is best discharged by the trial court, and the appellate courts will not generally disturb the findings of the trial court in this respect. . . . After a judicious study of the records of the instant appeal, the Court finds no compelling reason to depart from the RTC and the CA's uniform factual findings. The Court affirms accused-appellant's conviction for the crime of Rape. The Court concurs with the findings of the RTC, as affirmed by the CA, that the prosecution was able to establish beyond reasonable doubt the elements of Rape under paragraph 1(a), Article 266-A of the RPC. AAA painstakingly recalled how accused-appellant succeeded in having carnal knowledge of her through force, threat, and intimidation. . . . The inconsistencies cited by accused-appellant in AAA's affidavit vis-à-vis her court testimony refer to minor or immaterial matters which hardly affect AAA's credibility. . . . Further, the absence of fresh hymenal laceration or evident injury in AAA's genitalia[43] does not negate the commission of rape because hymenal laceration is not an element of the crime of rape.[44] Moreover, delay in revealing the commission of a crime such as rape does not necessarily render such charge unworthy of belief.[46] In the case, it is understandable that AAA was afraid to immediately report the incident because of accused-appellant's threats to evict them (AAA, her sister, and her mother) from the house.[49] Finally, the Court reiterates that accused-appellant's denial and alibi cannot prevail over the positive and categorical testimony of AAA.[50] As for the penalty, the RTC and the CA correctly imposed reclusion perpetua against accused-appellant in accordance with paragraph 1(a) of Article 266-A, in relation to Article 266-B of the RPC, as amended by RA 8353.","WHEREFORE , the appeal is DENIED . The Decision dated June 29, 2018 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 09423 that found accused-appellant XYZ guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Rape defined and penalized under Articles 266-A and 266-B of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 8353, is AFFIRMED . Accused-appellant XYZ is sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua and is hereby ORDERED to pay AAA the following amounts: P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages, and P75,000.00 as exemplary damages. All the damages awarded shall earn interest at the legal rate of 6% per annum from the finality of this judgment until fully paid. SO ORDERED."

SANGA, AND THE NATIONAL COMMISSION ON INDIGENOUS PEOPLES, DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES, RESPONDENTS.","Pinagtibukan It Pala'wan, Inc. (PINPAL) is a people's organization holding Resource Use Permit (RUP) No. 001-09, authorizing it to occupy, cut, collect, and remove almaciga resin from a Certificates of Ancestral Domain Claims (CADC) area. Danny Erong, a Pala'wan Tribal Chieftain, alleged that the DENR granted PINPAL's RUP without the required Certification Precondition (CP) under Section 59 of R.A. No. 8371, and that PINPAL required him to sell his almaciga resin only to petitioner Anita Santos, thereby allowing her to have monopoly over the market. On October 15, 2010, Erong filed a complaint before the NCIP-RHO. NCIP-RHO Regional Hearing Officer Gabaen issued a 20-day TRO. Santos filed a Verified Motion to Intervene but later withdrew it. On February 7, 2011, following a report that PINPAL would surreptitiously transport almaciga resin, a truck sent by Santos was apprehended by the Philippine Marines based on Gabaen’s instruction, and the vehicle and resin were impounded. Thereafter, the NCIP-RHO issued an Order dated February 7, 2011, requiring the almaciga resin to remain in custody, and a Cease and Desist Order dated February 10, 2011, enjoining Santos and others from continuing activities stemming from the allegedly illegally issued RUP. Santos filed a Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition with the Supreme Court, assailing the NCIP orders for lack of jurisdiction and seeking to annul them, and also asking the Court to declare unconstitutional Section 3(a) of R.A. No. 8371 and Section 1, Part II, Rule III of its IRR.",The petition must be dismissed.,"The Court dismissed the petition on procedural grounds. First, while a petition for certiorari and prohibition under Rule 65 was the proper remedy because the NCIP lacked jurisdiction over Santos (who is not a member of the Indigenous Cultural Community), the petition was dismissed for violating the doctrine of hierarchy of courts, as Santos failed to specify any exceptional circumstance to warrant direct resort to the Supreme Court. Second, Santos lacked legal standing to institute a suit defending the validity of PINPAL's RUP because her interest as a buyer of the resins was only incidental compared to PINPAL's direct interest as the RUP holder, and she did not sustain a direct injury. Third, the Court refrained from ruling on the constitutionality of Section 3(a) of R.A. No. 8371 and its corresponding IRR provision, as the grounds of non-observance of the doctrine of hierarchy of courts and the absence of legal standing were enough reasons to dismiss the petition.","WHEREFORE, the Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition with prayer for the issuance of a temporary restraining order under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court filed by petitioner Anita Santos against respondents Atty. Kissack B. Gabaen, Ricardo D. Sanga, and the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples, Department of Environment and Natural Resources is DISMISSED. SO ORDERED."

Cruz, Province of Zambales and the Municipality of Infanta, Province of Pangasinan, filed before the Court a special civil action for the issuance of a Writ of Kalikasan, with a prayer for the grant of a Temporary Environmental Protection Order (TEPO) pursuant to A.M. No. 09-6-8-SC that sought to enjoin the conduct of nickel mining operations in the Municipality of Sta. Cruz, Province of Zambales. The case was docketed as G.R. No. 224375.
Petitioners alleged that respondent mining companies (BNMI, EMI, LAMI, ZDMC, SMTC) adopted unsystematic mining practices resulting in nickel laterite siltation, destruction of the ecosystem, water/air/soil pollution, forest denudation, exacerbated flooding, and destruction of the irrigation system, thereby violating their constitutional right to a balanced and healthful ecology. The Court found the petition sufficient and issued the Writ of Kalikasan, referring the case (docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 00032) and the application for TEPO to the CA for hearing. During the pendency of the case before the CA, the DENR, through then Secretary Regina Lopez (Sec. Lopez), issued separate orders on February 8, 2017, canceling the Mineral Production Sharing Agreements (MPSA) of respondent mining companies, resulting in the closure of their mining operations. The CA subsequently denied the petition for writ of kalikasan, the application for TEPO, and the Urgent Motion for Ocular Inspection, ruling that the DENR Closure Orders rendered the case moot. However, following the elevation of the case to the Supreme Court, the OSG manifested that subsequently: (a) on January 7, 2021, the DENR issued a Memorandum lifting and setting aside the closure order dated February 8, 2017 against LAMI; (c) on September 30, 2019, the DENR issued a Resolution lifting the Suspension of Mining Operation of ZMDC; (d) on August 4, 2020, the DENR Sec. Roy A. Cimatu approved the Memorandum recommending the lifting of the closure order dated February 8, 2017 against BNMI; and (e) on August 4, 2020, the DENR Sec. Cimatu approved the Memorandum recommending the lifting of the closure order dated February 8, 2017 against EMI. The OSG further stated that at present, all respondent mining companies are already operational as a result of the lifting by the DENR of the Closure Order dated February 8, 2017.","In the assailed Resolution dated May 22, 2017, the CA denied petitioners' Petition for Writ of Kalikasan, application for TEPO, and Urgent Motion for Ocular Inspection. The CA ruled that prior to the referral of the petition by the Court, the DENR Region III and the MGB Region III already issued a series of Joint Suspension Orders against ZDMC, BNMI, and LAMI; that during the pendency of the case, the DENR already conducted an audit of the mining operations of respondent mining companies... and that on February 8, 2017, after finding that respondent mining companies violated pertinent environmental and mining laws, the DENR, through then Secretary Regina Lopez (Sec. Lopez), issued separate orders canceling the Mineral Production Sharing Agreements (MPSA) of respondent mining companies, resulting in the closure of their mining operations. The CA further ruled that with the closure of the mining companies, 'there can be no unlawful act or omission that may be committed by respondent mining companies that would result in actual or threatened violation of petitioner's constitutional right to a balanced and healthful ecology' and as such, there is no more actual controversy between the parties. The dispositive portion of the CA Resolution reads: WHEREFORE, premises considered, the petition for writ of kalikasan, petitioners' application for TEPO and Urgent Motion for Ocular Inspection are hereby DENIED. Accordingly, the prohibitory injunctive provisional writ of kalikasan issued by the Supreme Court in accordance with Section 5, Rule 7 of the Rules of Procedure on Environmental Cases is LIFTED.","The foregoing ruling of the CA no longer holds, owing to the subsequent and supervening events as manifested by the OSG and LAMI, more particularly on the lifting of the DENR Closure Order dated February 8, 2017 which previously cancelled the respective MPSA's of respondent mining companies. Indeed, with the lifting of the Closure Orders dated February 8, 2017 and the resumption of the mining operations of respondent companies as manifested by the OSG, petitioners' allegations—i.e., that respondent companies conduct unsystematic mining activities, and that their mining operations violate pertinent environmental and mining laws, which were considered by the DENR in the issuance of said Closure Orders—become material and significantly relevant in the subject petition for writ of kalikasan. Thus, the propriety of the ultimate relief in a petition for writ of kalikasan, that is, to prevent further violations of the constitutionally protected rights to a balanced and healthful ecology remains a justiciable controversy. This has not been squarely passed upon or resolved by the CA.","WHEREFORE, the Resolutions dated May 22, 2017 and December 14, 2017 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 00032 are SET ASIDE. Accordingly, the case is REMANDED to the Court of Appeals for the continuation of proceedings with dispatch."
"G.R. No. 243968, March 22, 2022","ANGELO CASTRO DE ALBAN, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS (COMELEC), COMELEC LAW DEPARTMENT AND COMELEC EDUCATION AND INFORMATION DEPARTMENT, RESPONDENTS.","Angelo Castro De Alban (De Alban) filed his CoC for senator in the May 13, 2019 elections as an independent candidate, indicating that he is a lawyer and a teacher. On October 22, 2018, the Comelec Law Department motu proprio filed a petition to declare De Alban a nuisance candidate alleging that he had no bona fide intent to run for public office and that his candidacy will prevent a faithful determination of the true will of the electorate. Moreover, De Alban will not be able to sustain the financial rigors of waging a nationwide campaign without clear proof of financial capacity. On the other hand, De Alban countered that he has a bona fide intention to run for public office given his government platforms covering education, agriculture, health, and housing programs. Also, De Alban claimed that he could wage a nationwide campaign because he sustained a paid website dedicated to his senatorial bid, commissioned social media platforms like Facebook to advertise him, and secured support statements from various groups. Lastly, De Alban averred that his frequent domestic and international travels are sufficient proof of his financial capacity. On December 6, 2018, the Comelec First Division declared De Alban a nuisance candidate. The Comelec cited the authorized expenses for an aspiring senator under the law and ruled that De Alban failed to establish the financial capacity to wage a nationwide campaign especially since he was running as an independent candidate. Aggrieved, De Alban moved for a reconsideration and argued that financial capacity is not among the qualifications to run for senator. The law did not set the minimum expenses for a candidate but only a cap or expenditure limit. On January 28, 2019, the Comelec En Banc denied De Alban's motion. Unsuccessful at a reconsideration, De Alban filed this Petition for Certiorari ascribing grave abuse of discretion on the Comelec in declaring him a nuisance candidate.","The Court upholds the constitutionality of Comelec's authority to motu proprio refuse to give due course to or cancel the CoC of a nuisance candidate under Section 69 of the OEC. However, the Court ascribes grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Comelec in cancelling De Alban's CoC pursuant to an erroneous interpretation of the law and for lack of supporting substantial evidence.","1. The authority of the Comelec to refuse to give due course to or cancel the CoC of nuisance candidates under Section 69 of the OEC applies to elections of all public officers, including senatorial candidates. 2. There is no irreconcilable conflict between Section 69 of the OEC and RA No. 6646 that will bar the Comelec's power to motu proprio declare candidates as nuisance. 3. The last phrase in Section 69 of the OEC which reads ""by other circumstances or acts which clearly demonstrate that the candidate has no bona fide intention to run for the office for which the certificate of candidacy has been filed and thus prevent a faithful determination of the true will of the electorate"" is declared NOT UNCONSTITUTIONAL as it does not violate the due process clause or infringe the equal protection clause and the right of suffrage. 4. The Comelec's motu proprio authority under Section 69 of the OEC is still subject to the requirements of procedural due process. 5. Financial capacity cannot be conflated with the bona fide intention to run, and the absence of a strong political machinery or low probability of success do not equate to the lack of bona fide intention to run for public office.","FOR THESE REASONS, the petition is partly GRANTED. The provisions of Section 69 of the Omnibus Election Code are declared NOT UNCONSTITUTIONAL on the grounds raised by the petitioner. The Commission on Elections En Banc's Resolution dated January 28, 2019 in SPA No. 18-045 (DC)(MP) which declared Angeio Castro De Alban a nuisance candidate is SET ASIDE."
"G.R. Nos. 210965 & 217623, March 22, 2022","DEVELOPMENT BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON AUDIT, RESPONDENT.","G.R. No. 210965: On 23 April 2007, DBP received from COA, through its Supervising Auditor, Hilconeda P. Abril (Auditor Abril), four Audit Observation Memoranda (AOM) relative to the grant of additional allowances and fringe benefits to DBP officers acting as officers of DBP Subsidiaries in 2006. The AOM stated that the allowances and benefits constitute double compensation to DBP officers, since they receive the same type of benefits from DBP where they hold permanent plantilla positions. Auditor Abril directed DBP to cause the immediate refund of all additional allowances granted to the officers in compliance with laws on double compensation. Subsequently, Auditor Abril issued ND No. SUB-2006-11 (06) dated 29 May 2007, disallowing the total amount of P1,629,303.34. DBP appealed, and later filed a Manifestation and Motion stating that then President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (President Arroyo) has confirmed the power and authority of the DBP Board of Directors (BOD) to approve the Compensation Plan, making the subject disallowance moot and academic. On 13 March 2012, COA rendered a Decision, denying DBP's appeal for lack of merit and affirming ND No. SUB-2006-11 (6). G.R. No. 217623: For the years 2005 and 2006, DBP granted its officers and employees an additional bonus of P1,200.00 per month and P4,000.00 economic assistance. The DBP BOD also approved the integration of the officers' allowance to the basic pay and granted a 5.85% average merit increase for 2006. Auditor Abril issued AOMs recommending discontinuing these benefits and requiring refund, citing MO No. 20, AO No. 103, and PD 1597 which require Presidential approval. Subsequently, Auditor Abril issued ND Nos. OA-2006-006 (06), EA-2006-005 (05 and 06) and Merit-2006-008 (06), disallowing the total amount of P106,599,716.93. While the appeal was pending, DBP submitted a Manifestation and Motion informing the cluster director that it was able to procure approval from President Arroyo on the merit increases and other benefits. Subsequently, COA rendered Decision No. 2013-216, denying DBP's petition for review for lack of merit and affirming the NDs.","G.R. No. 210965: COA affirmed LSS Decision No. 2009-141, sustaining ND No. SUB-2006-11 (6) and disallowing the amount of P1,629,303.34. It ruled that the DBP officers are covered by the constitutional prohibition provided under Section 8, Article IX (B) which prohibits appointive public officers or employee from receiving additional, double, or indirect compensation unless authorized by law.
G.R. No. 217623: COA affirmed ND Nos. OA-2006-006 (06), EA-2006-005 (05 and 06) and Merit-2006-008 (06), disallowing the total amount of P106,599,716.93. COA held that the grant of additional compensation to DBP officers and employees lacked legal basis, as they were granted merely through resolutions of the DBP BOD, and did not have the requisite approval of the President as sanctioned by PD 1597 and MO 20. COA also concluded that President Arroyo's approval, made 17 days before the 10 May 2010 elections, was illegal and amounted to no approval at all due to the election period ban.","The Court partially grants the petitions in G.R. Nos. 210965 and 217623. The Court affirms the COA decision in G.R. No. 210965, sustaining the disallowance of additional allowances and benefits (P1,629,303.34) because this amounts to double compensation and is prohibited under Section 8, Article IX (B) of the Constitution. The Court also affirms the COA decision in G.R. No. 217623, sustaining the disallowance of the grant of merit increase, integration of officers' allowance, and economic assistance (P106,599,716.93), as DBP BOD's authority is not absolute and the grant lacked Presidential approval required by PD 1597 and MO No. 20, noting that President Arroyo's subsequent approval was void due to the election period ban. However, in both cases, the Court holds that the officers who approved or certified the grant of disallowed benefits should not be held liable due to badges of good faith (relying on DBP Charter exemption and customary practice). Nevertheless, the individual payees or recipients remain liable for the amounts they personally received, as the disallowed benefits lacked legal cover and violated PD 1597, MO 20, and the Constitution, thus failing the 'genuinely given in consideration of services rendered' exception under the Madera guidelines.","WHEREFORE, the petitions are PARTIALLY GRANTED. 1. In G.R. No. 210965, the Decision dated 13 March 2012 and Resolution dated 06 December 2013 of the Commission on Audit, affirming the Notice of Disallowance No. SUB-2006-11 (6) in the amount of P1,629,303.34, are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. The approving/certifying officers are exonerated from their solidary liability to return the disallowed amount. The DBP officers who received the allowances and fringe benefits disallowed under Notice of Disallowance No. SUB-2006-11 (6), including the approving/certifying officers who had received the disallowed amounts in their capacity as payees, are ORDERED to refund the amount they received. 2. In G.R. No. 217623, the Decision dated 03 December 2013 and Resolution dated 17 March 2015 of the Commission on Audit, affirming the Notice of Disallowance Nos.

"[ G.R. No. 251876, March 21, 2022 ]","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. MARY JANE DELA CONCEPCION Y VALDEZ A.K.A. ""JUDITH A. VALDEZ"" A.K.A. ""OFELIA ANDAYA, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","Dela Concepcion, also known under the aliases ""Judith A. Valdez"" and ""Ofelia Andaya,"" was accused of promising overseas employment to more than 30 individuals in 2014. Dela Concepcion allegedly collected more than P1,000,000.00 in the guise of using the money to process their documents for deployment. Because of this, Dela Concepcion and a certain Vecita Sabacan Villareal (Villareal) were charged with several counts of illegal recruitment committed in large scale under Section 6 of Republic Act No. 8042 (as amended by R.A. No. 10022) and estafa under Article 315, paragraph 2(a) of the Revised Penal Code. During arraignment, Dela Concepcion pleaded not guilty. The prosecution presented six witnesses (Meonardo Parial, Aileene D. Laureano, Jennifer Portin Laureano, Mary Grace Dulay, James Dohn Oberez, and Nicanor Romualdez Ramos IV). Complainants testified that Dela Concepcion promised them jobs abroad (Italy/New Zealand) and collected substantial placement/processing fees, sometimes showing job orders, but failed to deploy them or return the money. Ramos (POEA Officer) certified that Dela Concepcion had no license. Dela Concepcion, the sole defense witness, denied promising overseas employment, maintaining that the meetings were only for the purpose of processing their documents (medical examination, DFA authentication, translation of Italian documents) and admitted asking for sums of money for these purposes (P5,000.00 for medical, P15,000.00 for DFA processing). The Regional Trial Court found Dela Concepcion guilty of simple illegal recruitment, illegal recruitment committed in large scale, and four counts of estafa, acquitting her in others. The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction, modifying the penalties.","This Court denies the appeal. The Court of Appeals made no reversible error in convicting accused-appellant, but we modify the penalty imposed.","Accused-appellant Mary Jane Dela Concepcion y Valdez is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of simple illegal recruitment, illegal recruitment committed in large scale, and estafa. All elements of large-scale illegal recruitment under R.A. 8042/10022 were present: she had no valid license or authority (non-licensee), she undertook recruitment activities by collecting fees and giving the impression she could deploy workers, and the crime was committed against three or more persons. Her failure to reimburse expenses incurred by the workers also constitutes illegal recruitment (Section 6(m) of R.A. No. 10022). The absence of receipts is not fatal, as credible testimonial evidence established the illegal recruitment activities. All elements of estafa by means of deceit were also proven, as her false pretenses (promises of deployment, presentation of job orders, claims of direct hiring) induced the complainants to part with their money, resulting in damage. The Court increased the fine imposed in Criminal Case No. 15-316296 (Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale) from P2,000,000.00 to P5,000,000.00, applying the maximum penalty because the act was committed by a non-licensee.","WHEREFORE, premises considered, the August 23, 2019 Decision of the Court of Appeals in C.A.

The Informations alleged that Roflo, as a member of the Sanggunian Panlalawigan Davao Oriental, conspired with Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio, and Chona, by making it appear that they are legitimate job order employees in the office of Roflo, when it truth, they worked as house helpers of Roflo and her family in their houses in Davao City. Bajenting averred that she was instructed by Roflo to submit the names of Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio, and Chona, to the Human Resources Department (HR Department) for the issuance of contracts of services in their favor, representing them to be job order employees of Roflo. Bajenting prepared the Daily Time Records (DTR), Accomplishment Reports (AR), time book, payroll and other supporting documents relative to the employment of Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio, and Chona. Utilizing the falsified DTRs and ARs, Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio, and Chona, were able to collect salaries from the provincial government of Davao Oriental, to the damage and prejudice of the government. Roflo instructed Bajenting to claim the salaries... and deposit it to Roflo's personal bank account... On cross-examination, Bajenting admitted that Roflo dismissed her (Bajenting) from the service on February 19, 2003, for certain anomalies she committed... Bajenting filed the instant complaint against Roflo on March 26, 2003, days after the Qualified Theft and Falsification cases were filed against her by Roflo and former Governor Elena Palma-Gil (Palma-Gil). The prosecution also established through the testimony of Carmencita E. Vidamo... that Derrick and Sergio were enrolled in the University of Mindanao for the school year 2002-2003 and 2001-2002, respectively... For her defense, Roflo claimed that Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio, and Chona, were legitimate job order employees of the provincial government of Davao Oriental assigned in her (Roflo) Satellite Office in Davao City during the period relevant to the case. The satellite office was open 24 hours a day... Roflo did not impose specific work hours to Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio, and Chona, because a job order employee is not considered a government employee, hence, is not required to report during the prescribed office hours like regular employees, as long as they rendered work for eight hours a day. The DTRs... were prepared by her staff stationed in her office in Davao Oriental, but were personally signed by the concerned job order employees... They indicated their time of arrival as 8:00 a.m. and time of departure as 5:00 p.m. pursuant to the advice of the HR Department in accord with the agency's prescribed office hours... Reynaldo T. Bicoy (Bicoy), Human Resources Manager... confirmed that there is no rule prohibiting the assignment of job order employees outside the province. Bicoy acknowledged that pursuant to Civil Service Resolution No. 020790, the provision in the contracts of service of the province's job order employees which mandated the rendition of service during the agency's prescribed office hours of 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., was deleted. The Accounting Office would not receive the DTRs or payrolls if the prescribed working hours of 8:00 to 12:00 and 1:00 to 5:00 were not stated... Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio, and Chona, uniformly corroborated the testimony of Roflo that they were Roflo's legitimate job order employees. They signed the DTRs reflecting their time in and out as 8:00 o'clock a.m. to 5:00 o'clock p.m. as per the directive of the Accounting Office, and that if they indicated a different time, the same would be rejected and returned to them for correction... Fidela... claimed that she was assigned at the first satellite office of then Representative Palma-Gil... and that the office was open 24 hours a day, seven days a week... The signatures of Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio, and Chona, on their contracts of services, DTRs and ARs were not forgeries as she personally witnessed them signing the same in the satellite office.","In the assailed Decision dated November 29, 2018, the Sandiganbayan found accused-appellants guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crimes of violation of Sec. 3 (e), RA 3019 and falsification of a public document under Article 171 (4) of the RPC and were sentenced as follows: WHEREFORE , judgment is hereby rendered as follows: 1.

The Sandiganbayan, however, exonerated Roflo from the charge of Estafa with Abuse of Confidence for failure of the prosecution to establish all the elements of the crime.","We rule in the negative. Only questions of law should be raised in petitions filed under Rule 45. This Court is not a trier of facts. It will not entertain questions of fact as the factual findings of the Sandiganbayan are generally conclusive upon this Court. This rule, however, admits of exceptions such as where: (1) the conclusion is a finding grounded entirely on speculation, surmises and conjectures; (2) the inference made is manifestly mistaken; (3) there is grave abuse of discretion; (4) the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts; and (5) the findings of fact of the Sandiganbayan are premised on a want of evidence and are contradicted by the evidence on record. We deem it proper to re-evaluate the factual findings and the conclusions reached by Sandiganbayan. We find that accused-appellants were able to adduce sufficient evidence to prove that they truly worked in the satellite office of Roflo in Davao City. Forgery was not substantiated by clear, positive and convincing evidence. The plain comparison of the questioned signatures made by the Sandiganbayan cannot prevail over the direct evidence of Fidela, accused-appellants' witness, who testified affirmatively that she was physically present during the signing of the subject documents. Falsification of a public document was not sufficiently established by the prosecution. The element of malicious intent on the part of accused-appellants is sorely wanting. Job order employees are not covered by Civil Service law, rules and regulations and are not required to work during the agency's regular office hours. They cannot be held criminally culpable for Falsification of Public Documents by making untruthful statements in a narration of facts in the absence of a clear showing that they acted with malicious intent. Roflo did not act in evident bad faith when she signed the contracts of services, DTRs and ARs of Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio, and Chona; neither did Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio, and Chona act in evident bad faith when they received their respective salaries. We find and so hold that the prosecution clearly failed to discharge this burden.","WHEREFORE, the appeal is GRANTED. The Decision and Resolution dated November 29, 2018 and August 28, 2019, respectively, of the Sandiganbayan in SB-06-CRM-0025 to 0029 and SB-06-CRM-0030 to 0034, are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Accused-appellants Ma. Consuelo Toroba Palma Gil-Roflo, Jerico O. Ebita, Norman Jay Jacinto P. Doral, Derrick P. Andrade, Sergio U. Andrade and Chona Andrade Tolentino, are ACQUITTED of the crimes of violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019, and Falsification of Public Documents under Article 171 (4) of the Revised Penal Code."
"G.R. No. 221845, March 21, 2022","SPS. GEMA O. TORRECAMPO AND JAIME B. TORRECAMPO SUBSTITUTED BY HIS HEIRS NAMELY: GAIE MARIE T. OUANO, GAIE ANNAH MARIE T. ARZADON, JEE JASPER O. TORRECAMPO, ELSBETH GAIE MARIE O. TORRECAMPO, AND JEE EDSEL O. TORRECAMPO, PETITIONERS, VS. WEALTH DEVELOPMENT BANK CORP., RESPONDENT.","On December 12, 2008, the spouses Gema and Jaime Torrecampo (spouses Torrecampo) entered into a housing loan agreement[5] with Wealth Development Bank Corp. (respondent bank). The housing loan agreement was secured by a real estate mortgage[6] over a property owned by the spouses Torrecampo known as Lot No. 5 of the consolidated subdivision plan PCS-07-005237, covered by TCT No. 187864.[7] The aggregate amount of the loan is P10,500,000.00, evidenced by promissory notes[8] signed by the spouses Gaie Marie and Daryl Ouano and spouses Richel and Faustino Masong. Subsequently, the spouses Torrecampo defaulted on the payment of their loan obligation. Thus, respondent bank commenced an action to foreclose the real estate mortgage extra-judicially under the provisions of Act No. 3135,[9] or an Act to Regulate the Sale of Property under Special Powers Inserted in or Annexed to Real-Estate Mortgages, as amended. A certificate of sale was issued on June 11, 2010 and was duly registered with the Register of Deeds of Cebu City on June 24, 2010. After the lapse of the one-year redemption period without any attempt on the part of the spouses Torrecampo to redeem the mortgaged property, the ownership of the lot was then consolidated in favor of respondent bank as the purchaser in the auction sale. On September 1, 2011, TCT No. 187864 in the name of the spouses Torrecampo was cancelled and a new one, TCT No. 107-2011003690, was issued by the Register of Deeds of Cebu City in the name of respondent bank. When petitioners refused to vacate the property upon respondent bank's demand, the latter filed an ex-parte petition for the issuance of a writ of possession,[10] which was granted by the RTC in an Order[11] dated August 25, 2011. On September 30, 2011, a notice to vacate[12] was issued by the sheriff. In its January 20, 2012 Resolution,[13] the RTC denied petitioners' motion for reconsideration[14] of the RTC's Order granting the application for a writ of possession. Subsequently, the writ of possession was successfully implemented and the petitioners were evicted from the property as shown in the Sheriff's Return on Writ of Possession and Delivery Receipt.[15] On March 8, 2012, the petitioners filed a motion to set aside the extra-judicial foreclosure sale and cancel the writ of possession with prayer for damages[16] on the ground that there was no violation of the mortgage contract. Petitioners argued that: (1) the agreed maturity date of the loan has not yet arrived; (2) the term loan agreement, the real estate mortgage contract, the promissory notes and the disclosure statement of loan/credit transaction did not provide for the amount of the monthly amortizations; and (3) no demand letter or statement of account of any amount payable for any given month was sent at their address. Further, they alleged that the extra-judicial foreclosure sale did not conform to the prescribed procedures as no notice was sent at their given address. Also, petitioners averred that the respondent bank's ex-parte petition for writ of possession is fatally defective as it contains no allegation as to the posting and publication of the first and second notices of extra-judicial foreclosure sale, nor the sending of such notices at their given address. Lastly, petitioners contended that they suffered damages arising from the extra-judicial foreclosure of their property and their eviction therefrom, which were both improper, unjust and oppressive.[17]","On June 8, 2012, the RTC issued an Order[19] denying petitioners' motion to set aside the extra-judicial foreclosure sale and cancel the writ of possession with prayer for damages. The RTC ruled that proceedings for the issuance of the writ of possession are non-litigious in nature such that the court will not delve into the merits of the petition. The pertinent portions of the Order read thus: In fact, the issuance of the writ of possession to a purchaser in an extra-judicial foreclosure is summary and ministerial in nature as such proceeding is merely an incident in the transfer of the title. The trial court does not exercise discretion in the issuance thereof. x x x WHEREFORE, finding the instant motion to be bereft of merit, the same is hereby DENIED. Notify parties and counsels accordingly. SO ORDERED.[20] In a Decision dated May 27, 2015, the CA denied the petitioners' appeal on the ground that the provisions of Act No. 3135, particularly Section 8, are only applicable until the period of redemption. Once redemption lapses and consolidation of the purchaser's title ensues, Act No. 3135 is not applicable anymore. Thus, petitioners' recourse to the law is misplaced. The Decision reads in part: In the present case, it is evident that the [petitioners] failed to redeem the mortgaged property within the period of redemption and consequently, the ownership over the property was consolidated in favor of the bank. Afterwards, a corresponding writ of possession was issued by the trial court after the redemption period. However, the [petitioners] still availed of the remedy under Section 8 of Act No. 3135 which is misplaced. x x x x Therefore, the denial of [petitioners'] motion was proper albeit on a different ground than that relied upon by the trial court. Having ruled that the recourse taken by the [petitioners] was improper, it follows that there is no more need to resolve the issues advanced by them. WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant appeal is DENIED. The Order of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 5 of Cebu City, dated 8 June 2012, dismissing [petitioners'] Motion to Set Aside the Extra-judicial Foreclosure Sale and Cancel the Writ of Possession with prayer for Damages is hereby AFFIRMED. SO ORDERED.[22]","The issues raised by petitioners can be summarized in one question: Did the CA err in not applying the provisions of Act No. 3135 to the case at bar? The Court answers in the negative. The CA did not err in not applying the provisions of Act No. 3135 in its Decision. Act No. 3135 only applies when the one-year redemption period has not yet lapsed. The general rule is that in extra-judicial foreclosures, a writ of possession may be issued to the purchaser in two different instances, and based on two different sources: (1) within the redemption period, in accordance with Act No. 3135, particularly Section 7, as amended; and (2) after the lapse of the redemption period, based on the purchaser's right of ownership.[24]... Under the second instance, which is what happened in the case at bar, a writ of possession may also be issued after consolidation of ownership of the property in the name of the purchaser or, in this case, the respondent bank. The purchaser becomes the absolute owner of the property purchased in the foreclosure sale, if it is not redeemed during the one-year period after the registration of the sale. After consolidation of ownership in the purchaser's name and issuance of a new TCT, possession of the land too becomes an absolute right of the purchaser. Thus, the issuance of the writ of possession to the purchaser, upon proper application and proof of title, merely becomes a ministerial duty of the court which cannot be enjoined or restrained... In the case at bar, the respondent bank registered the foreclosure sale on June 24, 2010. After the lapse of one year or after June 24, 2011, the provisions of Act No. 3135 no longer applied to the parties. The respondent bank became the absolute owner of the subject property as a matter of right. In line with this, the writ of possession was issued as a ministerial duty of the trial court. It was issued to the respondent bank as a matter of right, a mere incident of the bank's ownership, and not in accordance with the remedy provided under Section 8. ... Petitioners are not entitled to damages. Since petitioners failed to prove any of their claims, they cannot therefore be entitled to damages in any form, whether actual, moral or exemplary.","WHEREFORE, the petition for review on certiorari is DENIED. The May 27, 2015 Decision and the October 6, 2015 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 04839, which affirmed the Order of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 5 of Cebu City, dismissing petitioners' motion to set aside the extra-judicial foreclosure sale and cancel the writ of possession with prayer for damages, are hereby AFFIRMED.

In 1998, he divided the land and donated portions to his children and grandchildren (his co-petitioners). Petitioners were subsequently issued patents and certificates of title by the DENR (November 17-25, 1998). In 2003, respondents, who are holders of certificates of land ownership award (CLOA) issued by the DAR (December 19, 1998), filed a petition before the Office of the Provincial Adjudicator of the DARAB seeking the annulment/declaration of nullity of the 1979 deed of sale, alleging it was void for violating Section 6 of RA 6657 because it was not registered within three months from the effectivity of the Act. The Provincial Adjudicator dismissed respondents' petition for lack of jurisdiction and because the validity of title cannot be attacked collaterally. On appeal, the DARAB reversed the Provincial Adjudicator, declared the deed of sale and subsequent documents void, holding that the deed should have been registered. Petitioners filed a certiorari petition before the CA, which upheld the DARAB, finding that it had jurisdiction and that the deed of sale was void.",The Court of Appeals (CA) in CA G.R. SP No. 01018 dismissed petitioners' petition for certiorari and denied their motion for reconsideration.,"The petition is meritorious. The CA committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in dismissing petitioners' certiorari action and effectively affirming the DARAB's Decision, because the DARAB decision was a patent nullity as respondents' petition before the Provincial Adjudicator constituted an impermissible collateral attack on petitioners' Torrens certificates of title, which is prohibited by law.","WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED. The Court of Appeals' May 31, 2012 Decision and March 18, 2013 Resolution in CA G.R. SP No. 01018 are SET ASIDE.

"G.R. No. 225159, March 21, 2022","REYNALDO REYES, AS HEIR OF VITALIANO REYES, PETITIONER, VS. SPS. WILFREDO AND MELITA GARCIA, RESPONDENTS.","Petitioner Reynaldo Reyes (petitioner) claimed that Julian Reyes (Julian) is the owner of an unregistered parcel of land located in Quezon St., Bagumbayan, Taguig with a total area of 463 square meters (sqm) as per Tax Declaration No. 9700 (5277). Julian and his spouse, Marcela Reyes (Marcela) had nine children. On August 30, 1975, the heirs of Julian and Marcela executed a ""Partihan At Bilihan Nang Kalahating Bahagi ng Lupang Tirahan Sa Labas ng Hukuman,"" and sold half of the subject property, i.e., 231.5 sqm, to one of the heirs, Anastacio. The remaining quarter of the subject property, i.e., 116 sqm, was occupied by Vitaliano's children, namely, petitioner and Fermin Reyes (Fermin), while the other quarter was sold by Isidoro (another heir) to respondents Wilfredo and Melita Garcia (spouses Garcia), as per Deed of Sale dated August 16, 1989. Sometime in 1997, petitioner filed a complaint for recovery of ownership, quieting of title and annulment of deed of sale against the spouses Garcia alleging that the Deed of Sale dated August 16, 1989 is void since Isidoro is not the true and real owner of the subject property which originally belongs to Julian's estate. The spouses Garcia countered that the sale was valid as the portion sold was Isidoro's share in the subject property.","The Regional Trial Court (RTC) dismissed petitioner's complaint, holding that while the property was still co-owned by the heirs, Isidoro may validly sell his pro indiviso share. The RTC ruled that the proper action should be partition and not nullification or recovery of possession. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the RTC's ruling, finding that the subject property remains to be co-owned by the heirs. The CA ruled that the ruling in the present case can only be limited to a recognition that a co-ownership exists, and the parties' proper remedy is to file an action for partition under Rule 69 of the Rules of Court. The CA Decision dated February 16, 2016, affirmed the RTC Decision dated April 12, 2013.","The Court found the petition to be without merit. Isidoro, as one of the heirs, has the right to alienate his pro indiviso share in the co-owned property even without the consent of the other co-heirs, but he cannot alienate the shares of the other co-owners. Hence, Isidoro's sale of the remaining half of the subject property will only affect his own share but not those of the other co-owners who did not consent to the sale, making the spouses Garcia co-owners of Isidoro's undivided share. Petitioner's recourse of filing a complaint for nullification of sale and recovery of ownership is not the proper action. The appropriate remedy, under Bailon-Casilao v. Court of Appeals, is an action for partition under Rule 69 of the Revised Rules of Court, as a sale of an undivided share by a co-owner is not null and void, but transfers only the rights of the co-owner-seller.

The February 16, 2016 Decision and June 9, 2016 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 101161 are hereby AFFIRMED. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 218344, March 21, 2022","JESSICA P. MAITIM A.K.A. ""JEAN GARCIA,"" PETITIONER, VS. MARIA THERESA P. AGUILA, RESPONDENT.","Petitioner Jessica Maitim (Maitim) and respondent Maria Theresa P. Aguila (Aguila) were residents of Grand Pacific Manor Townhouse. Their respective townhouse units are approximately nine meters apart, separated only by a driveway jointly used by the townhouse unit owners. On April 25, 2006, Maitim was on board her vehicle, a Ford W-150 Chateau Wagon registered under her name, which was being driven by Restituto Santos (Santos), her driver for 12 years. While they were driving along the common driveway, Angela Aserehet P. Aguila (Angela), the six-year old daughter of Aguila, was sideswiped by Maitim's vehicle. Angela was dragged for about three meters resulting to her right leg being fractured. Maitim and Santos did not immediately take Angela to the hospital after the incident; she was only brought to St. Luke's Medical Center after the insistence of Angela's grandmother, Lirio Aguila. Angela was diagnosed to have suffered swelling, hematoma, multiple abrasions, and displaced, complete fracture on the right leg. Thus, she underwent operation at Asian Hospital and was in a wheelchair from April 25, 2006 to July 18, 2006. The incident was referred to the barangay for conciliation but only Aguila appeared. At this point, Aguila's actual expenses amounted to P169,187.32. Aguila then sent demand letters to Maitim and Santos to no avail. Thus, Aguila filed the instant action for damages based on quasi-delict before the Regional Trial Court (RTC). In her defense, Maitim denied Aguila's accusations and claimed that on April 25, 2006, while she was in her vehicle being driven slowly by Santos, Angela suddenly came running and due to this, the latter's right leg was sideswiped and got fractured. Maitim alleged that her vehicle was covered by a comprehensive insurance that included third-party liability, but she was not able to file for insurance claim due to Aguila's refusal to submit the necessary documents, i.e., police report, medical report, and receipts of actual expenses. Furthermore, Maitim maintained that Santos, who was her driver for 12 years, was driving with care at the time of the incident, and thus, Maitim should not be made liable for vicarious liability because she exercised due diligence in the selection and supervision of her employee.","Ruling of the Regional Trial Court: In its Decision dated July 27, 2012, the RTC rendered judgment in favor of Aguila. The RTC held that Santos was presumed to be negligent, applying the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, and that Maitim was vicariously liable for her failure to prove that she exercised due diligence in the selection and supervision of her employee, Santos. The dispositive portion of the Decision reads: WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiff. Accordingly, defendants Jessica P. Maitim and Restituto A. Santos are ordered to solidarily pay the plaintiff the following: 1. the amount of One Hundred Sixty-Nine Thousand One Hundred Eighty-Seven Pesos and 32/100 (P169,187.32) as and for actual damages; 2. the amount of Twenty Thousand Pesos (P20,000.00) as and for moral damages; and 3. the amount of Twenty-Five Thousand Pesos (P25,000.00) as and for attorney's fees. SO ORDERED. Aggrieved, Maitim appealed with the CA. Ruling of the Court of Appeals: On June 30, 2014, the CA denied Maitim's appeal and affirmed the RTC decision in toto. The dispositive portion of the CA Decision reads: WHEREFORE, the Decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 100, of Quezon City dated July 27, 2012 is AFFIRMED in toto. SO ORDERED. In its Decision, the CA ruled that Maitim and Santos are solidarily liable for damages, and that there was no contributory negligence on the part of Aguila and her daughter. Moreover, the CA cited the case of Jarco Marketing Corporation v. Court of Appeals, which established that children under nine years of age are conclusively presumed in our jurisdiction to be incapable of contributory negligence. This supported its conclusion that Angela, being merely six-years old at the time of the incident, cannot be liable for contributory negligence as she is conclusively presumed to be incapable of contributory negligence. Maitim moved for reconsideration but it was denied in a Resolution dated May 19, 2015 by the CA. Hence, the instant petition.","The CA committed no reversible error in affirming the RTC Decision. The petition raises the lone issue of whether or not the CA committed a reversible error when it affirmed the RTC Decision finding Maitim solidarity liable under the doctrine of vicarious liability. This Court rules in the negative. First, it must be noted that the RTC correctly applied the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur when it ruled that Santos should be presumed negligent, and thus, had the burden of proving such presumption otherwise. As applied in the instant case, the fact that Angela was hit by a moving vehicle owned by Maitim and driven by Santos is undisputed, and the same is supported by the Traffic Accident Investigation Report dated April 25, 2006. The fact that Angela sustained injuries in her collision with Maitim's vehicle is also not in question. Thus, since it is clearly established that there was a vehicular accident that caused injuries, then the rule on res ipsa loquitur shall apply. An inference of negligence on the part of Santos, the person who controls the instrumentality (vehicle) causing the injury, arises, and he has the burden of presenting proof to the contrary. As will be discussed below, this Court finds that the lower courts justly held that Santos failed to discharge this burden and consequently, the presumption of negligence lodged towards him shall stand. ... Thus, both the RTC and CA were right in finding negligence on the part of Santos. Furthermore, the presumption of negligence on the part of Santos was not overcome by Maitim, who presented no rebuttal evidence and instead merely alleged that Santos was driving with due care and was not speeding. ... Maitim failed to prove that she was not vicariously liable in this case. ... Applying these concepts to the present case, the finding of negligence against Santos gave rise to the presumption of negligence on the part of Maitim in the latter's selection and/or supervision of the former. Therefore, it is incumbent upon Maitim to prove that she exercised the diligence of a good father of a family in the selection and supervision of her employee, Santos. ... Given the above, Maitim's attempt to deflect liability clearly falls short as she was not able to present concrete proof that she exercised the care and diligence of a good father of a family in the selection and supervision of her employee, Santos. Therefore, the presumption of negligence against her stands, and she must be held solidarily liable with Santos. There was no contributory negligence on the part of Aguila. ... The evidence on record shows that the driveway was a common area to both parties' townhouse units, which meant that the driveway is as much a part of Aguila's residence as it is of Maitim's. It was also found that Angela was not just running or loitering around but was actually on her way to board their car. ... Therefore, there being no contributory negligence on the part of Angela and Aguila, and with Maitim and Santos being unable to rebut the presumption of negligence lodged towards them in their respective capacities, this Court sees no reason to depart from the findings of the lower courts finding Maitim solidarily liable with Santos.","WHEREFORE, the instant petition is DENIED. The assailed Decision dated June 30, 2014, and Resolution dated May 19, 2015 of the Court of Appeals, in CA-G.R. CV No. 100354 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION in that all monetary awards shall earn interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from date of finality of this Decision until fully paid."
"G.R. No. 240053, March 21, 2022","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PETITIONER, VS. MARIA CRISTINA P. SERGIO AND JULIUS L. LACANILAO, RESPONDENTS.","Mary Jane Veloso (Mary Jane) was arrested upon her arrival at Adisucipto International Airport in Yogyakarta, Indonesia for carrying 2.6 kilograms of heroin in her travel luggage. She was tried and later convicted for drug trafficking under Indonesian jurisdiction and sentenced to death by firing squad. Mary Jane traveled to Indonesia upon Maria Cristina Sergio (Cristina) and Julius Lacanilao's (Julius) false promise of work abroad. Cristina and Julius were eventually charged before a Philippine court with Qualified Trafficking in Persons under Republic Act No. (RA) 9208, Illegal Recruitment under RA 8042, and Estafa under the Revised Penal Code. The prosecution requested and was allowed by the Regional Trial Court, Branch 88 of Sto. Domingo, Nueva Ecija, to take Mary Jane's testimony by deposition upon written interrogatories. The Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the trial court, but the Supreme Court (on October 9, 2019) affirmed the trial court, allowing the deposition with modification that it be taken before the Philippine Consular Office and officials in Indonesia. The October 9, 2019 Decision attained finality on March 4, 2020. The People of the Philippines, through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), now brings before the Court an Urgent Omnibus Motion, seeking to supplement the October 9, 2019 Decision with specific instructions as to the conduct of the taking of depositions by Mary Jane by written interrogatories, as the Government of Indonesia per its letter dated December 4, 2020, imposed new conditions: a) The deposition taking will be conducted by the Indonesian Attorney General or official/officials appointed by the Attorney General. The presence of the consular officer of the Philippine Embassy in Jakarta and the Presiding Judge during the deposition taking is possible; b) The deposition taking will be conducted in the prison facility in Wirogunan, Indonesia, where [Mary Jane] is currently detained.",The Court resolves to note the Motion without action.,"In general, final and executory judgments are immutable, unalterable in any respect, and irreversible even if correctible. The Motion cannot be treated as an exception to the general rule. What the OSG requests is a formulation of guidelines in the conduct of the taking of Mary Jane's deposition to adapt to the conditions set by Indonesia. This task is not at all a mere correction of clerical error but an amendment of the October 9, 2019 Decision. Neither can it be addressed with a judgment nunc pro tunc, as that power is restricted to placing upon the record evidence of judicial action which has been actually taken, not supplying omitted action. The Court, even being the highest court of the land, cannot alter what is already rendered absolute. It remains entirely within the prerogative of the executive department to handle matters and fill in the details of foreign policy and negotiations. The Court leaves it up to the Department of Justice and the involved executive department agencies to discuss the technicalities of implementation with the Indonesian authorities and yield to their sound demands, bearing in mind the spirit of the October 9, 2019 Decision, the applicable international treatises, the real circumstances of Mary Jane's detention, and the fact that we are the requesting state, and Indonesia is the requested state.","WHEREFORE, the Urgent Omnibus Motion is NOTED WITHOUT ACTION."

RUSSEL BORINGOT, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","In an Information dated May 5, 2008, Russel was indicted for the crime of Robbery with Homicide, the accusatory portions of which state: That on or about 19 October 2007 at Ceris III, Canlubang Calamba City, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring and confederating, with intent to gain, by means of violence against and intimidation of persons, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously take and steal the valuables of the victims Ronald Catindig, Raymond Hernandez, Christian Catindig and Joel Tenorio against the consent of the said victims and on the occasion and by reason of the robbery, with intent to kill, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously stab to death Sheryl Catindig to the damage and prejudice of the said victims and heirs of the said Sheryl Catindig. Contrary to law. Calamba City, Laguna. 5 May 2008. Sometime in May 2008, Russel was arrested. When arraigned, he pleaded ""not guilty"" to the charge. After the pre-trial was concluded, trial on the merits then ensued. Version of the Prosecution The prosecution presented Ronald Catindig, Ponciana Catindig, Christian Catindig, Bealt Cesar Catindig, Raymond Hernandez, Michael Hernandez, and Dr. Roy Camarillo, whose combined testimonies as culled from the Brief for the Appellee, filed by the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), runs in this wise: On October 19, 2007, between 6:40 and 7:00 o'clock in the evening, Ronald Catindig (Ronald) with his friends, namely, Joel Tenorio (Joel), Raymond Hernandez (Raymond), Michael Hernandez (Michael) and Christian Catindig (Christian), fetched his sister Sheryl Catinding from work and walked back together along the streets of Ceris III, Barangay Canlubang, Calamba City. On their way home, Christian observed that there were five men following them. Despite the attempt to cover their faces by pulling their shirts up to their noses, he and Ronald were able to identify the five individuals as Edmund Gallardo (Edmund), Marlon Natividad (Marlon), Ronald Oña (Oña), Ruel Boringot (Ruel), and Russel. While they were in the middle of the street, Edmund ran ahead of the group and prodded them with sumpak, an improvised gun, declaring ""mga pare walang kikilos may dala akong sumpak."" Thereafter, Russel held Christian up and told him to bring out his things, while the rest were standing behind. Shortly after, Marlon kicked Ronald from behind and poked a knife on his neck forcing him to bring his mobile phone out. Ronald complied and handed his phone. Then a tricycle passed by, which prompted Christian to shout for help and told Sheryl to run. But Sheryl did not budge, out of extreme fear, and the tricycle sped off after Edmund fired his sumpak. Meanwhile, Ronald managed to free himself from Marlon when he saw Russel stabbing Christian. He tried to help Christian and was about to hit Russel but he was also stabbed by Russel on his chest then swiftly shifted to Raymond. While Ronald went back looking for his sister Sheryl, he saw Edmund stabbing Joel's left arm after the latter handed his phone. Edmund went after Raymond then to Sheryl. He witnessed how Edmund repeatedly stabbed Sheryl after she gave her phone. He tried to save Sheryl but as soon as he drew near, he too was stabbed by Edmund until he fell on his knees. After Ronald fell down, Russel and his group left off. Another tricycle passed by and they asked the driver to bring them to the nearest hospital. Upon arrival at the San Jose Hospital and Trauma Center of Calamba, they were treated but Sheryl died. Ronald stayed at the same hospital for one month and one week. Ponciana Catindig, Ronald and Sheryl's mother, said that their family incurred a total of P78,679.00 for Sheryl's hospital and funeral expenses and P141,222.00 for Ronald's hospitalization, all backed with receipts. To prove the fact of Sheryl's death, Dr. Roy Camarillo examined the cadaver, issued Medico Legal Certificate, and explained that the cause of death was hemorrhage secondary to three stab wounds in her right face and chest. Version of the Defense In contrast, the defense presented Russel, Leony Boringot, Ruel Boringot, Ronaldo Ona, and Adriano Perez whose combined testimonies, as gathered from the Brief for the Accused-Appellant, filed by the Public Attorney's Office (PAO), tended to establish the following: On October 19, 2007, Russel was in the (sic) Barangay Parian, Calamba City, visiting his younger sister. When he returned home at around 7:00 o'clock in the evening, Russel rested and slept in his house. He had no clue as to why he was accused of Robbery with Homicide. It was when the policemen came to his house on October 21, 2007, that he was informed of the accusation against him. He did not even know the private complainants Joel, Ronald, Raymond, Christian and the deceased Sheryl. After the October 21, 2007 police visit, Russel did not leave his house. He was thereafter arrested on May 27, 2008. ADRIANO PEREZ (Perez) testified that he saw Russel in Barangay Parian at around 6:00 o'clock to 7:00 o'clock p.m. on October 17, 2007. The sister of the accused LEONY BORINGOT (Leony), also testified that his brother, Russel and co-accused Ronald Ona, visited her in her house at around 6:00 o'clock p.m. on October 17, 2007[,] because she just delivered her baby. It was already dark, at past 6:00 o'clock that the Russel left, together with accused Ona.","After due consideration, the Court affirms accused-appellant's conviction for robbery with homicide but modifies the award of damages. I. The prosecution proved all the elements of the crime beyond reasonable doubt. Robbery with homicide is a special complex crime penalized under Article 294 (1) of the RPC, which states: ARTICLE 294. Robbery with Violence Against or Intimidation of Persons — Penalties. — Any person guilty of robbery with the use of violence against or intimidation of any person shall suffer: 1. The penalty of reclusion perpetua to death, when by reason or on occasion of the robbery, the crime of homicide shall have been committed. The Court affirms accused-appellant's conviction for robbery with homicide.

BRAULIO YARANON IN HIS CAPACITY AS THE CITY MAYOR OF BAGUIO, THE CITY COUNCIL OF BAGUIO, THELMA MANAOIS IN HER CAPACITY AS THE CITY TREASURER OF BAGUIO, OSCAR FLORES IN HIS CAPACITY AS THE CITY BUILDING OFFICIAL OF BAGUIO AND THE SECRETARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS AND HIGHWAYS, RESPONDENTS.","On January 1, 2004, the Sangguniang Panglungsod of the City Government of Baguio enacted Ordinance No. 01, series of 2004 (Ordinance No. 01) for the appropriation of available funds in the amount of P713,579,000.00 for the purpose of reorganization or restructuring of its local departments. Pursuant to Ordinance No. 01, the city mayor of Baguio, Yaranon, issued on September 9, 2004 Administrative Order No. 171, Series of 2004 (AO 171), otherwise known as ""An Administrative Order Designating Engineer Oscar V. Flores, City Government Department Head II, City Government of Baguio, as Acting Building Official of the City of Baguio Pending his Appointment of Building Official of the City of Baguio."" Petitioner, being the City Engineer at that time, filed on December 1, 2004, a complaint for declaration of nullity of AO No. 171, Series of 2004 with prayer for issuance of a temporary restraining order and writ of preliminary prohibitory injunction and mandamus before the RTC. [Petitioner] assails the validity of [AO No. 171], Series of 2004, designating [Engineer (Engr.)] Oscar Flores as Acting Building Official of Baguio City. It is claimed that the functions adverted to in AO No. 171 usurped and divested [petitioner] of his functions as City Engineer. It alleged that AO No. 171 violates the spirit and intent of the Local Government Code under Article VII, Section 477 paragraph (a) thereof. Respondents averred that AO 171 is a valid act executed by Yaranon to give effect to the restructuring of the local departments of the City Government of Baguio pursuant to Republic Act No. (RA) 7160 or the Local Government Code of 1991 (LGC), as approved by the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) and the Civil Service Commission (CSC), and that the implementation of AO 171 did not result in the termination, diminution of salary, benefits, and rank of petitioner. The RTC initially granted the prayer for a temporary restraining order but the same was later lifted. The RTC denied petitioner's application for writ of preliminary mandatory injunction. Thereafter, trial ensued.","In a Decision dated May 8, 2009, the RTC dismissed the instant complaint filed by petitioner. The RTC held that the validity of Ordinance No. 01 cannot be a subject of a collateral attack. Since Ordinance No. 01 is valid, the RTC ruled that the AO 171 is also deemed valid. Moreover, the RTC agreed with the respondents that AO 171 was issued pursuant to the provisions of the LGC which gave the City Mayor of Baguio the power to create other offices as may be necessary to carry out the functions of its office. In any case, the issue as to the validity or invalidity of AO 171 was rendered moot and academic due to the subsequent appointment of Flores as Department Head of the City Buildings and Architecture Office (CBAO). On January 31, 2011, the CA issued the assailed Decision, the dispositive portion of which reads as follows: WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant appeal is denied. Accordingly, the Decision of the Regional Trial Court Branch 6 of Baguio City dated May 8, 2009 in Civil Case No. 5935-R is hereby AFFIRMED. Citing provisions under the LGC, and the NBC including its implementing rules and regulations (IRR), the CA held that the appointment by the City Mayor of Baguio of a separate and distinct Building Official from its City Engineer is authorized especially since the functions of the local Building Official and City Engineer are distinct and clearly delineated under the NBC.","The subject matter of AO 171 pertains to the designation of Flores as acting Building Official of the City of Baguio pending the appointment of a Department Head of the newly created CBAO. With the appointment of Flores as Department Head of CBAO, this Court finds that the issues raised by petitioner in the instant complaint – whether AO 171, and the designation of Flores as acting Building Official by the DPWH pursuant to AO 171, are valid or null and void – have become moot. It would be futile for the Court to pass upon the validity or invalidity of AO 171, which, as it stands, is no longer operative. We agree with the ruling of the RTC that a collateral attack on Ordinance No. 01 is proscribed. We disagree with Petitioner's contention that the LGC only allows for the appointment of a City and Municipal Engineer who shall simultaneously act as the local Building Official. While Section 477 of the LGC states that the City Engineer shall also act as the Building Official, the appointment of a separate Building Official, vis-à-vis the creation of the CBAO in this case, is not without legal basis. The LGC itself empowers City Governments to implement an organizational structure and create staffing patterns. In relation to the foregoing, the appointment of a Building Official separate and distinct from a City Engineer is supported by law pursuant to the IRR of the NBC, specifically: RULE II - ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT, SECTION 203. General Powers and Functions of the Secretary... 6. Appoint a Building Official, separate and distinct from the Office of the City/Municipal Engineers in all Cities and Municipalities. This Court holds that while city or municipal engineers shall also act as local building officials of their respective cities or municipalities, it is still within the legislative discretion of city or municipal governments to create and organize the office of the local Building Official separate and distinct from the Office of the City Engineer pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions and limitations set by law, particularly the LGC and NBC, including their respective IRRs.","WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED.

"G.R. Nos. 250100-02, March 21, 2022","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. ROMMEL C. ARNADO, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","Accused-appellant, then Mayor of the Municipality of Kauswagan, together with Rey A. Camanian (Camanian) and Lauro R. Diputado (Diputado), were charged with three counts of the crime of Grave Coercion punishable under Article 286 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC). The three Informations are identically worded except for the dates when the offenses were allegedly committed: [6] SB-17-CRM-0677 That on 21 October 2013 or sometime prior or subsequent thereto, in Brgy. Tacub, Municipality of Kauswagan, Province of Lanao del Norte, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of the Honorable Court, accused ROMMEL C. ARNADO (Arnado), being then the Mayor of the Municipality of Kauswagan, REY A. CAMANIAN (Camanian), LAURO R. DIPUTADO (Diputado), and SEVEN (7) ""JOHN DOES"" , being then members of the Civil Service Unit (CSU) of the Municipality of Kauswagan PNP, all public officers, taking undue advantage of their respective official positions, conspiring and confederating with one another, did then and there willfully, unlawfully, criminally prevent IBRA C. SAMBUAT, OSAMA C. SAMBUAT, FARHANA C. SAMBUAT and their relatives (the Sambuats) from having shelter and peaceful living and forcing them by means of violence, threats, and intimidation to leave against their will the land over which they claim ownership and where their houses and shelters were built, when accused Camanian, Diputado and Seven (7) John Does, upon the command of accused Arnado, without lawful authority, entered and took control of the land where the houses and shelters of the Sambuats were located, and demolished said shelters and took their materials. CONTRARY TO LAW. [7] Initially, accused-appellant, Camanian, and Diputado were also charged with three counts of Malicious Mischief. However, these charges were dropped after the filing of a Motion to Quash by the accused. [8] The Sandiganbayan granted such Motion on the basis that the presence of intent in one crime necessarily negates the existence thereof in the other. [9] Any damages which may have been caused due to the alleged commission of malicious mischief are considered as incidental, and should be absorbed in the crime of Grave Coercion. Upon being arraigned for the charges of Grave Coercion, accused-appellant pleaded not guilty thereto. [10] On 18 April 2017, accused-appellant posted his cash bail bond in the amount of Php 60,000.00. [11] This was approved by the Sandiganbayan through its Resolution issued on the same date. [12] Meanwhile, Camanian and Diputado remained at large. Hence, the cases against them were ordered archived in the meantime. [13] In support of the charges, the prosecution presented the testimonies of complainants, siblings Ibra C. Sambuat (Ibra), Osama C. Sambuat (Osama), and Farhana C. Sambuat (Farhana) (collectively, ""the Sambuats""). They claimed ownership over a parcel of land located at Tacub, Kauswagan, Lanao del Norte, allegedly covered by Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. P-3033 under their grandparents' names (Subject Property). [14] The Sambuats explained that their family was originally residing in the property, but left Kauswagan when a feud broke out therein. In the meantime, they stayed in Marawi City, Lanao del Sur. [15] They alleged that the acts of coercion happened during three incidents, on 21 October 2013, 30 October 2013, and 18 November 2013. [16] For the first incident, several members of the Citizen Security Unit (CSU) of the Office of the Mayor of Kauswagan, among whom were Camanian and Diputado, entered their property and threatened to kill anyone if they will not be allowed to enter. The CSU members allegedly shouted at the Sambuats demanding them to leave at once and destroyed their shanties in the presence of the Kauswagan Philippine National Police (PNP). They did this despite explanation by the Sambuats that they are the owners of the property. [17] According to the Sambuats, they asked Camanian why they were being forced to leave, and he only answered "" utos sa taas ."" Hence, they concluded that the incident happened upon the instruction of accused-appellant. Thereafter, the Sambuats put up their houses and caused the incident to be recorded in the police blotter. [18] Similar incidents occurred for the second and third time. The Sambuats also caused both incidents to be recorded in the police blotter. [19] The Sambuats also alleged that they were invited to dialogues by accused-appellant through the PNP, which occurred on 21 October 2013 and 30 October 2013. [20] For the first dialogue, Farhana and Osama attended as Ibra was not available. When they arrived, they saw accused-appellant together with then Provincial Director of Lanao del Norte PNP, PS/Insp. Madrid Paitao (Paitao), and a certain lawyer. They claimed that accused-appellant asked them if they had documents to prove that they are owners of the property, to which they replied that they have the original title. Accused-appellant however showed them a document stating that the true owners are the group of then Vice Mayor of Iligan City, Henry Dy (Dy), with Atty. Voltaire Rovira (Atty. Rovira) and Sotero Trinidad (Trinidad). As they were not able to agree, the Sambuats left the office. [21] For the second dialogue, Ibra was able to attend. He claimed that accused-appellant instructed him to leave the property as they are not the owners. He, however, refused to comply and showed his title. He informed accused-appellant that the property is subject of a case for quieting of title before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) against Dy, et al. [22] On the other hand, the defense presented the testimonies of Atty. Rovira, Chief of Police PS/Insp. Mark Ian E. Quieta (Quieta), and accused-appellant. [23] Atty. Rovira testified that Dy, Trinidad, and himself are the owners of certain parcels of land in Brgy . Tacub, Kauswagan, Lanao del Norte, including the 12-hectare property currently claimed by the Sambuats. He claimed that originally, the Sambuats sold the property to Guimba Shipping and Development Corporation (Guimba Shipping) through a Deed of Extrajudicial Settlement with Deed of Absolute Sale. Hence, OCT No. O-17 was cancelled and Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-4406 was issued on 04 October 1972 in the name of Guimba Shipping. [24] The parcels of land, including the property claimed by the Sambuats, were purchased by Dy as the highest bidder in a tax delinquency sale held on 01 September 1989 by the Province of Lanao del Norte. Since 1989, Dy, et al. have been in lawful possession of the parcels of land. As they have not received the final deed of sale even after the one-year redemption period, they filed a case for mandamus with RTC Iligan against the Provincial Treasurer of Lanao del Norte (mandamus case). The RTC ruled in their favor through its Decision dated 19 June 2014, [25] which was also affirmed by the Court of Appeals on 29 June 2017. [26] Sometime in October 2013, they received reports from their tenants that the Sambuats were trying to enter the southern portion of the property covered by TCT No. T-4406. It was subject of a case filed by the Sambuats on 05 September 2013 for quieting of title, which was held in abeyance while the mandamus case was pending. Hence, Atty. Rovira sent letters to accused-appellant and Quieta to request for assistance in maintaining peace and order. [27] As to the testimony of accused-appellant, he confirmed that there was a dispute as to the ownership of the Subject Property between the Sambuats and Dy, et al. In response to the letter of Atty. Rovira, he invited the Sambuats, the group of Atty. Rovira, Paitao, and Quieta for a dialogue. He was concerned with the previous hostilities between Muslims and Christians in their municipality, which may happen again due to the ownership dispute. However, the group of Atty. Rovira was not able to attend. [28] During the dialogue, accused-appellant informed the Sambuats that the group of Atty. Rovira sent him a letter asking for assistance as they purportedly entered the property. Accused-appellant claimed that he encouraged the parties to settle the issue during the dialogue. Therefore, they agreed that the Sambuats cannot occupy the Subject Property without any court order. Accused-appellant suggested that pending the quieting of title case, the Sambuats should leave the area to avoid any heated confrontation. Although he referred the same to the municipal police, who was already informed by Atty. Rovira through Quieta, it was only to maintain peace and order. On the same day, he called the municipal assessor to investigate on the matter, and was shown a Certificate of Sale and Tax Declaration in favor of Dy, et al. [29] Accused-appellant further mentioned that no demolition took place. Instead, the Sambuats agreed to dismantle their tents with the CSU's help. He recalled asking someone from the CSU how it went, and he was assured that it was done peacefully. Therefore, he was surprised that cases were filed against him and he confronted the CSU regarding the incidents. Accused-appellant also averred that the cases may have been politically motivated as in one occasion, he saw Boy Agawen, a political opponent, come out of the tent of the Sambuats. [30] With regard to Quieta, he confirmed receipt of the letter from Atty. Rovira requesting for their assistance. The following day, he visited Atty. Rovira to clarify the matter and to validate documents on the Subject Property. On 21 October 2013, he sent police officers to the Subject Property with the assistance of Camanian. The police officers reported that the Sambuats had tents and shelters, which were what they dismantled with CSU's help. [31] However, the Sambuats again reassembled their tents as they needed shelter, which the PNP allowed. On 30 October 2013, the group of Atty. Rovira requested the dismantling of the tents, which he asked his police officers to supervise. Thereafter, some of the Sambuats left for Lanao del Sur, while the rest were allowed to stay in the Subject Property for lack of funds to go home. [32] On rebuttal, the Sambuats stated that they tried to pay real property taxes but they were refused to be issued a tax declaration as the existing one is already under the name of Guimba Shipping. They raised doubt as to the authenticity of the OCT No. O-17. In support of this, they presented a Certification issued by the Provincial Treasurer of Lanao del Norte, stating that there are no records or documents pertaining to the alleged tax delinquency sale. [33] The prosecution argued in its Memorandum [34] with the Sandiganbayan that there was no court order nor demolition order when the shelters of the Sambuats were destroyed. Hence, it was maintained that the elements for grave coercion are present. [35] On the other hand, accused-appellant asserted in his Memorandum [36] that he was merely complying with his duty to protect the welfare of his constituents by calling the parties to the dialogues, after receiving reports on the intrusion of the Sambuats. He asserted that his only participation was to amicably resolve the issue of ownership, and he had no participation in the demolition of the houses. The Sambuats merely assumed that he was the one who ordered the demolition, due to his invitations to have the dialogues. [37] Finally, accused-appellant mentioned that the Sambuats admitted that their family was not in possession of the Subject Property from 1971 until October 2013. Hence, they cannot claim that they were prevented from having shelter and peaceful living. In any case, title over the Subject Property was not awarded to them by the courts, thus, no right was restrained without authority of law. [38]","The Sandiganbayan issued its assailed Decision dated 26 April 2019 convicting accused-appellant of three counts of Grave Coercion, viz.: WHEREFORE, in light of the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered finding the accused, Rommel Cagoco Arnado, GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of three (3) counts of the crime of grave coercion. There being no aggravating nor mitigating circumstance the accused is hereby sentenced to suffer the indeterminate penalty of imprisonment of six (6) months of arresto mayor as minimum to three (3) years and six (6) months of prision correccional medium as maximum for each count. SO ORDERED. [39] The Sandiganbayan found that all the elements of Grave Coercion are present. It did not give credence to the assertion that the Sambuats voluntarily dismantled their properties, as this is contrary to human experience. Further, it emphasized that since the Subject Property is a private land, proper directive from the courts should have been obtained first before forcing the Sambuats to leave and removing the structures. [40] It was noted that accused-appellant was not present during the incidents. However, the Sandiganbayan considered accused-appellant's arrangement of the dialogues with the Sambuats. It also observed that the CSU is under the Office of the Mayor, and it can be inferred from Camanian's statement "" utos sa taas "" that accused-appellant instructed the personnel. Lastly, the Sandiganbayan took into account that some of the vehicles used during the incidents bore government plates and a Toyota Hilux Pickup allegedly belonged to accused-appellant. [41] In response, accused-appellant filed a Motion for Reconsideration. [42] However, the same was denied by the Sandiganbayan through its Resolution [43] dated 14 October 2019. Hence, the instant appeal.","We GRANT the appeal. It is established that in any criminal case, an accused enjoys the constitutionally protected right of presumption of innocence until the contrary is proved. [44] His guilt must be proven beyond reasonable doubt, meaning, such degree of proof which produces a moral certainty, or that which produces conviction in an unprejudiced mind. [45] The elements of Grave Coercion are as follows: ""(1) that a person is prevented by another from doing something not prohibited by law, or compelled to do something against his will, be it right or wrong; (2) that the prevention or compulsion is effected by violence, threats, or intimidation; and (3) that the person who restrains the will and liberty of another has no right to do so, or in other words, that the restraint is not made under authority of law or in the exercise of any lawful right."" [46] In this case, the Sambuats narrate that it was the CSU personnel, including Camanian and Diputado, who allegedly entered their property, forced them to leave with threats, and destroyed their houses/shanties. As noted by the Sandiganbayan , it is undisputed that accused-appellant was not present during the three incidents when the acts of coercion supposedly occurred. However, the Sambuats allege that there is conspiracy, as they contend that the incidents happened upon accused-appellant's instruction. Article 8 of the RPC states that ""conspiracy exists when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it. It has been consistently held that conspiracy must also be proven by proof beyond reasonable doubt, the same degree of proof required to establish the crime itself. [47] The Sambuats assert that the following circumstances purportedly confirm accused-appellant's involvement: (1) accused-appellant's arrangement of dialogues with them to discuss the ownership dispute; (2) Camanian's statement "" utos sa itaas ""; and (2) the vehicles used during the incidents bore government plates and a Toyota Hilux Pick-up allegedly owned by accused-appellant. We deem it proper to tackle each if sufficient to establish the existence of Conspiracy. First , accused-appellant's act of inviting the complainants to his office for dialogues to discuss the ownership dispute is not sufficient to prove conspiracy... Second , Camanian's statement "" utos sa itaas ,"" is likewise insufficient to clearly establish accused-appellant's involvement with the alleged acts of coercion. It is unclear whether he was referring to accused-appellant, as he may have referred to any of those in the higher ranks when he uttered this statement. In fact, Camanian clarified in his Judicial Affidavit [48] that it was the Chief of Police, Quieta, who gave him the instruction: [Quotes Judicial Affidavit of Camanian] ... This was also admitted by Atty. Rovira in his Judicial Affidavit [50] dated 05 July 2018. Likewise, Quieta confirmed this in his Judicial Affidavit [51] dated 12 July 2018. Relevantly, Ibra admitted that it was Atty. Rovira who contacted Quieta... Lastly , the Sambuats assert that during the incidents, vehicles bearing government plates and a Toyota Hilux Pick-up allegedly owned by accused-appellant were used. However, other than unclear pictures of these vehicles, no other proof was offered to establish that accused-appellant authorized the use of the vehicles, or that he owns the Toyota Hilux. The Sambuats, therefore failed to support this allegation... Here, the involvement of accused-appellant is certain only as regards the dialogues he arranged with them. Other than that, his participation in the alleged acts of coercion is merely presumed from the statement of Camanian "" utos sa taas "" and from the vehicles used, which did not even establish that they have been used with his authority nor proven to be owned by him. It is settled that proof beyond reasonable doubt is demanded by the due process clause enshrined in the Constitution. [58] It is the prosecution which has the burden of proof, and mere speculations and conjectures are not sufficient. [59] In all criminal cases, the conscience must be satisfied that the accused is responsible for the crime charged. [60] If there is doubt, the accused must be favored. From the foregoing, it is clear that the prosecution failed to discharge its burden to prove accused-appellant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt.","WHEREFORE , the appeal is hereby GRANTED . The assailed Decision [61] dated 26 April 2019 and Resolution [62] dated 14 October 2019 of the Sandiganbayan in Criminal Case No. SB-17-CRM-0677 to 0679 are REVERSED AND SET ASIDE . Accordingly, accused-appellant Rommel C. Arnado is ACQUITTED of the crime of three counts of Grave Coercion under Article 286 of the Revised Penal Code, for the prosecution's failure to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The bail bond posted for the provisional liberty of accused-appellant is hereby CANCELLED . Let entry of judgment be immediately released. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 207853, March 20, 2022","CLARK DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION, PETITIONER, AND GOVERNANCE COMMISSION FOR GOCCS (GOVERNMENT-OWNED AND-CONTROLLED CORPORATIONS), PETITIONER-INTERVENOR, VS. ASSOCIATION OF CDC SUPERVISORY PERSONNEL UNION, RESPONDENT.","On March 20, 2012, the Clark Development Corporation (CDC), the operating arm of the Bases Conversion Development Authority (BCDA), tasked to manage the Clark Special Economic Zone, [2] executed a renegotiated CBA with its supervisory employees union Association of CDC Supervisory Personnel (ACSP). The CBA granted the supervisory employees additional benefits, to wit: SALIENT ECONOMIC GRANTS AGREED BY CDC AND ACSP: Additional annual union leave from ten (10) to fifteen (15) days with the condition of no more than eleven (11) union members and/or members shall be allowed to use the union leave at any one time[;] Additional bereavement leave (death of an immediate family member - parent, brother, sister, child[,] or spouse) from three (3) to five (5) days[;] Free use of CDC guesthouses for eleven (11) days per year during weekdays subject to availability of the unit[;] Allow ACSP the use of a service vehicle subject to the existing policies and guidelines in the use of vehicle[;] Salary increase of 8% on the first year and 4% on the second year[;] Additional uniform allowance of [P]500.00 every year until 2016[;] Additional monthly Personal Economic Relief Allowance (PERA) of [P]500.00[;] Onetime signing bonus of[P]25,000.00[;] [and] Reproduction and distribution of Agreement to all ACSP members[.] [3] On the other hand, the Governance Commission for Government-Owned and-Controlled Corporations (GCG) opined that the CBA violated Section 9 of Executive Order (EO) No. 7, signed on September 8, 2010 [4] which imposed a moratorium on increases in the salaries, allowances, incentives and other benefits in Government-Owned and-Controlled Corporations (GOCCs) unless specifically authorized by the President of the Republic of the Philippines (President). Yet, the President did not give CDC the authority to renegotiate the CBA with ACSP and grant its members increases and/or additional benefits. [5] Meantime, the BCDA recommended the deferment or renegotiation of the CBA unless CDC can prove financial sustainability of its economic terms. [6] On August 1, 2012, ACSP filed a complaint against CDC before the National Conciliation and Mediation Board, Department of Labor and Employment, San Fernando, Pampanga, for failure to implement the CBA docketed as NCMB-AC25-RB3-08-01-01-2012. [7] On November 5, 2012, the Accredited Voluntary Arbitrator (AVA) pointed out that Section 10 of EO No. 7, Series of 2010 suspended the grant of allowances, bonuses, incentives, and other perks to the members of the boards of directors/trustees of GOCCs only until December 31, 2010. [8] Moreover, the AVA held that the President's approval in the grant of additional benefits was presumed pursuant to the rule on liberal construction in favor of labor, [9] thus: WHEREFORE, premises considered, the [AVA] resolves to issue a decision favorable to the members of the ASSOCIATION OF CDC SUPERVISORY UNION in recognition of their Constitutional Right to Collective Bargaining and Negotiation as provided in Article XIII Sec. 3 of the Constitution. The Accredited Voluntary Arbitrator believes that the President of the Philippines to whom was submitted the economic provisions for approval namely: 1) Article IV, Section 10. Union Leave 2) Article IV, Section 11. Policy on Attendance 3) Article IV, Section 13. Union Service Vehicle 4) Article VI, Section 5. Procedure 5) Article VII, Section 7. Arbitration 6) Article X, Section 3. Paternity Leave 7) Article X, Section 5. Birthday Leave 8) Article X, Section 6. Bereavement Leave 9) Article X, Section 12. Personal Economic Relief Allowance 10) Article X, Section 17. Clothing Allowance 11) Article X, Section 22. Salary Increase 12) Article XII, Section 1. Provident and Retirement Fund[,] and 13) Article XIII[,] Signing Bonus[.] Such approval should be presumed considering the Labor Code provision: ART. 4. Construction in favor of labor. - All doubts in the implementation and interpretation of the provisions of this Code, including its implementing rules and regulations, shall be resolved in favor of labor. So ordered. [10] (Emphases and italization in the original) Aggrieved, CDC elevated the case to the CA through a Petition for Review [11] docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 127560. On April 8, 2013, the CA affirmed the AVA's findings and explained that EO No. 7, Series of 2010 does not apply to CDC since it is a GOCC without original charter, as well as to ACSP because it is composed of supervisory employees. The CA echoed that the President's approval as to additional benefits was presumed in line with the principle that all doubts should be resolved in favor of labor. [12] Unsuccessful at a reconsideration, [13] CDC filed this petition for review on certiorari ascribing reversible error on the part of the CA and the AVA in allowing the grant of additional benefits. CDC maintained that the CBA's economic terms was invalid and cannot be enforced because they were renegotiated without the President's approval and the GCG and BCDA's favorable recommendations. Moreover, Republic Act (RA) No. 10149 known as the 'GOCC Governance Act of 2011,' gave the President the authority to fix the GOCCs' compensation framework. Corollarily, the President's approval of additional benefits cannot be presumed. In contrast, ACSP contended that the CBA was the law between the parties and must be respected. Also, the CBA was renegotiated consistent with the employees' rights to organization and collective bargaining. Lastly, ACSP reiterated that EO No. 7, Series of 2010 was not applicable to GOCCs without original charter and that RA No. 10149 recognized the vested rights of government employees to their salaries. [14] Meanwhile, GCG moved to intervene in the proceedings and alleged that the CBA contravened EO No. 7, Series of 2010 and RA No. 10149. GCG averred that the moratorium on the grant of additional benefits remained effective pending the promulgation and approval of the compensation and position classification system for GOCCs. In any event, there were no factual and legal bases to presume the President's consent on the CBA's economic provisions. [15]","The validity of the terms and conditions of government employment fixed in the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) is the core issue in this petition for review on certiorari assailing the Decision [1] of the Court of Appeals (CA) dated April 8, 2013 in CA-G.R. SP No. 127560. On April 8, 2013, the CA affirmed the AVA's findings and explained that EO No. 7, Series of 2010 does not apply to CDC since it is a GOCC without original charter, as well as to ACSP because it is composed of supervisory employees. The CA echoed that the President's approval as to additional benefits was presumed in line with the principle that all doubts should be resolved in favor of labor. [12]","The petition is meritorious. Prefatorily, the Court grants GCG's motion for intervention. GCG established a legal interest in the matter being litigated and the outcome of the case as the central advisory, monitoring and oversight body authorized to formulate, implement, and coordinate policies for GOCCs. Further, the intervention of GCG will not prejudice the rights of CDC and ACSP, or delay the resolution of the case. Indeed, GCG raised similar issues as the original parties, hence, its claims were incapable of being properly decided in a separate proceeding. [16] Anent the merits of the case, it is settled that 'the right of government employees to self-organization is not as extensive as in the [right] of private [employees.]' [17] Likewise, the right of government employees to collective bargaining and negotiation is subject to limitations. Only the terms and conditions of government employment not fixed by law can be negotiated. [18] Notably, EO No. 7, Series of 2010, directed the rationalization of the compensation and position classification system in all GOCCs, and imposed a '[m]oratorium on increases in the rates of salaries, and the grant of new increases in the rates of allowances, incentives and other benefits, except salary adjustments pursuant to [EO] No. 811 dated June 17, 2009 and [EO] No. 900 dated June 23, 2010, are hereby imposed until specifically authorized by the President.' [19] The prohibition is broadly worded and reveals the clear stance to halt the grant of additional salaries and allowances to GOCCs' employees and officers. The moratorium is intended 'to strengthen supervision over the compensation levels of GOCCs x x x, in order to control the grant of excessive salaries, allowances, incentives, and other benefits.' [20] The only exception is when the increase of salary is pursuant to the implementation of the first and second tranches of the Salary Standardization Law (SSL). Obviously, the renegotiated economic provisions of the CBA between CDC and ACSP are outside the SSL. In Small Business Corporation v. Commission on Audit, [21] the Court explained that the clause 'until specifically authorized by the President' [22] is not in the nature of an exception. Rather, the clause provides for the situation where the President, under the same authority by which the moratorium is imposed, deems it proper to lift the moratorium. The use of the preposition 'until' before the phrase 'specifically authorized by the President' denotes that the moratorium continues up to a particular time, i.e., when the President authorizes anew the grant of the prohibited increases. On this score, the Court takes judicial notice that the President never lifted the moratorium from the time it was issued on September 8, 2010. As such, the economic terms of the CBA executed on March 20, 2012 are void for violating the law. The CA and the AVA heavily relied on Section 10 of EO No. 7, Series of 2010, which provides that '[t]he grant of allowances, bonuses, incentives, and other perks to members of the board of directors/trustees of GOCCs and GFIs, except reasonable per diems, is hereby suspended for until December 31, 2010, pending the issuance of new policies and guidelines on the compensation of these board members.' However, Section 10 pertains to the suspension of all allowances, bonuses, and incentives for members of the GOCCs' Board of Directors/Trustees, which is distinct from Section 9 on the moratorium on increases in salaries, allowances, incentives, and other benefits. Suffice it to say that Section 10 is inapplicable to ACSP which is a union composed of supervisory employees who can hardly be considered as members of CDC's board of directors. Worse, the CA and the AVA erred in declaring that EO No. 7, Series of 2010, does not cover CDC since it is a GOCC without original charter. Yet, there is nothing in the law that makes any express distinction between GOCCs with original charter, and those incorporated under the Corporation Code. Hence, EO No. 7, Series of 2010 applies to all GOCCs regardless of the manner of creation. 'Ubi lex non distinguit nec nos distinguire debemus. When the law does not distinguish, we must not distinguish.' [23] More telling is that RA No. 10149 [24] removes the authority of GOCCs to determine their own compensation system. The law authorizes the GCG to develop a compensation and position classification system applicable to all GOCCs' officers and employees, whether under the SSL or exempt, for approval of the President. [25] 'The GCG may recommend to the President, incentives for certain position titles in consideration of the good performance of the GOCC: x x x.' [26] However, the GCG did not give its favorable recommendation to CDC and ACSP before they renegotiated the CBA for additional benefits. As intimated earlier, GCG even opined that the CBA violated Section 9 [27] of EO No. 7, Series of 2010, while the BCDA suggested the deferment or renegotiation of the CBA. Furthermore, it was on March 22, 2016, that the President issued EO No. 203, [28] Series of 2016, adopting the compensation and position classification system as well as the index of occupational services for GOCCs. Section 2 of EO No. 203, Series of 2016, is explicit that '[w]hile recognizing the constitutional right of workers to self-organization, collective bargaining and negotiations, the Governing Boards of all covered GOCCs, whether Chartered or Non-chartered, may not negotiate with their officers and employees the economic terms of their CBAs.' This provision supports the GCG's position that the moratorium under EO No. 7, Series of 2010 on the grant of additional benefits remains effective pending the promulgation and approval of the compensation framework for all the GOCCs. Quite the contrary, the Court finds no factual and legal bases for the CA and the AVA to presume that the President approved the renegotiated economic provisions of the CBA between CDC and ACSP. To be sure, the construction in favor of labor only applies when there are doubts in the interpretation and implementation of the provisions of the Labor Code and its implementing rules and regulations. [29] As explained above, however, the language of Section 9 of EO No. 7, Series of 2010 on the moratorium on increases in rates of salaries and other benefits is unambiguous. Consequently, the law must be interpreted following its plain and obvious meaning, and applied according to its express terms. [30] Again, the law requires the President's consent as to additional benefits effectively lifting the moratorium, and any presumption of such approval is unwarranted. In sum, the CDC has valid reason not to implement the increases in salaries and benefits as provided in the renegotiated CBA. The Court reminds that the law fixed the terms and conditions of government employment, [35] and any contract that violates the law is void and cannot be a source of rights and obligations. [36]","FOR THESE REASONS , the petition is GRANTED. The Court of Appeals' Decision dated April 8, 2013 in CA-G.R. SP No. 127560 is REVERSED.

"G.R. No. 240331, March 16, 2022","REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, REPRESENTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION (DOTr), PETITIONER, VS. GUILLERMA LAMACLAMAC AND THE LAND REGISTRATION AUTHORITY, RESPONDENTS.","The present case stemmed from a Complaint for Cancellation of Decree filed by the Republic of the Philippines, represented by the DOTr, against Lamaclamac and the LRA, before the RTC of Initao, Misamis Oriental, Branch 44 and docketed as MC Case No. 2008-736. The subject of the complaint is a parcel of land located at Alubijid, Misamis Oriental, which was brought under cadastral proceedings, and designated as Lot No. 12446, Cadastral No. 27, with an area of 9,386 square meters (subject lot). On August 26, 1941, the cadastral court issued Decree No. 756523 in favor of Lamaclamac. Thereafter, the LRA recorded Decree No. 756523, in its book. Sadly, Lamaclamac died in 1947. She was survived by her heirs who later on sold the subject lot to the government. At present, the subject lot is being utilized for the fulfillment of the Laguindingan Airport Development Project. On July 7, 2006, the DOTr secured a Certification (LRA Certification) from the LRA Administrator which states, among others, that Decree No. 756523, issued in the name of Lamaclamac, is not among those salvaged decrees on file, and thus, is presumed to have been lost or destroyed as a consequence of the last World War... On August 17, 2007, the Registrar of Deeds of Misamis Oriental issued a similarly worded Certification (RD Certification) which reads: 'This is to CERTIFY that per records and file of this registry, Decree Nos. listed on the attached document, all lots located at Alubijid, Laguindingan, Misamis Oriental, Philippines are not and can no longer be located in this registry. It is deduced that if ever Original Certificates of Titles were previously issued and delivered to this registry, the same, had not survived the passage of time...' On the strength of these documents, the Republic of the Philippines, represented by the DOTr, filed the above-mentioned Complaint, alleging that Lamaclamac abandoned her right over the subject lot, as borne by the fact that she failed to secure a certificate of title over the same after more than 65 years. Meanwhile, no one filed any responsive pleading on behalf of Lamaclamac, which led the RTC to declare her in default. In contrast, the LRA, by way of a Manifestation in lieu of an Answer, asserted that the tenor of the RD Certification did not categorically state that no original certificate of title was ever issued pursuant to the decrees instituted thereon. After due proceedings, the RTC rendered a Decision dated June 26, 2015, which dismissed the complaint for Cancellation of Decree due to insufficiency of evidence. The RTC pointed out that DOTr failed to prove that Lamaclamac did not secure an original certificate of title over the subject lot, since she obtained a decree in her favor. Not satisfied, the Republic, through the OSG, filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which was denied by the RTC, in its Order dated July 12, 2016. Unyielding, the OSG appealed before the CA. In its Decision dated June 21, 2018, the CA affirmed the ruling of the RTC. Hence, the instant petition.","Decision dated June 21, 2018 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 04462-MIN, which affirmed the Decision dated June 26, 2015 and Order dated July 12, 2016 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Initao, Misamis Oriental, Branch 44, that dismissed the complaint for Cancellation of Decree filed by the Republic of the Philippines, represented by the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTr), against Guillerma Lamaclamac (Lamaclamac) and the Land Registration Authority (LRA), for insufficiency of evidence.","The petition is bereft of merit. The Cadastral System established by Act No. 2259, is an offspring of the Torrens System, which 'aims to serve public interest by requiring titles to any lands be settled and adjudicated and by decreeing land titles to be final, irrevocable and indisputable.' Title of ownership over the adjudicated lot is vested upon the adjudicatee when the decision of the cadastral court attains finality, which takes place when the 30-day reglementary period to appeal from such decision or adjudication had lapsed. The issuance of the said decree creates a strong presumption that the decision in the cadastral case had become final and executory and made it incumbent upon the oppositor to prove otherwise... A land becomes registered land once the decision of the cadastral court declaring the adjudicatee as owner of the subject lot attains finality. Once the title of ownership is vested upon the adjudicatee, the land, for all intents and purposes, had become, from that time, registered property, which could not be acquired by adverse possession. After the judgment has become final and executory, Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1529 enjoins the court to cause the issuance of the corresponding certificate of title in favor of the person adjudged entitled to registration. The failure on the part of the administrative authorities to do their part in the issuance of the decree of registration cannot oust the prevailing party from ownership of the land. Neither laches nor the statute of limitations applies to a decision in a land registration case... The Sta. Ana doctrine on the inapplicability of the rules on prescription and laches to land registration cases has been repeatedly affirmed. It is logical for this Court to presume that the subject decree had been issued by accountable public officers who enjoy the presumption of regularity in the performance of their functions, only that it was destroyed or lost during the last World War. To put it differently will impair vested rights and undermine the fundamental purpose of our land registration laws.","the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED. The Decision dated June 21, 2018 in CA-G.R. CV No. 04462-MIN, is hereby AFFIRMED. Accordingly, the Complaint for Cancellation of Decree filed by the Republic of the Philippines, represented by the Department of Transportation and Communications against Guillerma Lamaclamac in MC Case No. 2008-736 is DISMISSED."

PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES AND HAFTI TOURS, INC., RESPONDENTS.","The spouses Wu are Taiwan nationals residing in the Philippines under a Special Resident Retiree's Visa (SRRV) upon their investment and deposit of $90,000.00 with the Philippine Retirement Authority (PRA) of the Board of Investments (BOI). In 2002, at the solicitation of HTI, the spouses Wu sought to transfer their dollar time deposit investment plus accrued interests with the PRA, and invest the money with HTI, representing their capital contribution, in exchange for the issuance of 47,440 shares of stock of HTI. On August 21, 2002, pending approval by the PRA of the spouses Wu's dollar time deposit, HTI issued a board resolution certified by its corporate secretary, Sandra G. Dy, listing petitioners as two of four persons authorized to deposit and withdraw from HTI's Globalbank deposit account. Upon approval of the conversion of the spouses Wu's dollar time deposit, the PRA, on September 9, 2002, deposited the peso equivalent thereof i.e., P4,622,508.00, to HTI's deposit account with Metrobank. However, HTI failed to issue the promised shares of stock in Eric and Chen's names. Immediately thereafter, the relationship between HTI and the spouses Wu turned sour. On separate occasions, Eric and Chen issued checks to various payees, for different amounts, drawn from HTI's corporate bank deposit accounts leading to the litigation between the parties. Two of those checks are the subject matter of Criminal Case Nos. 06-1263 - CFM (P17,524.00) and 07-0254-CFM (P291,000.00) for Estafa against the Wu couple. The spouses Wu filed separate motions to quash before the RTC Branches 112 and 114, on the following grounds: (1) In Criminal Case No. 06-1263-CFM, the facts alleged in the Information do not constitute an offense; and (2) suspension of the proceedings due to the existence of a prejudicial question. (2) In Criminal Case No. 07-0254-CFM, duplicity of offenses charged considering that the misappropriated amount of P17,524.00 covered by Metrobank Check No. 6100011274 had been the subject of prosecution in IS No. 03-H-3320 subsequently filed as Criminal Case No. 03-1293, before RTC, Branch 195, Parañaque City. The RTC Branches 112 and 114, in separate Orders, quashed the Informations for Estafa against the Wus on the ground of duplicity of offenses charged. HTI filed separate appeals to the CA.","The Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR Nos. 31063 and 31921 granted private respondent's HAFTI Tours, Inc.'s (HTI's) consolidated appeals of the December 7, 2006 and April 2, 2007 Orders of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branches 112 and 114, Pasay City in Criminal Case Nos. 06-1263-CFM and 07-0254-CFM, respectively, reversing and setting aside the assailed Orders of the RTC which separately quashed the Informations for Estafa.","The CA correctly reversed the RTC Branches 112 and 114's quashal of the Informations for Estafa. Absence of probable cause is not a ground of a motion to quash Information, and the Wus' claim that the RTC dismissed the cases for lack of probable cause is decimated by specific provisions of the Rules of Court. The Wus prior prosecution in Criminal Case No. 03-1293 where they were not arraigned is not a bar to another or subsequent prosecution, as duplicity of actions is not the same as duplicity of offenses or double jeopardy. The facts charged constitute the offense of Estafa under Article 315, paragraph 1(b) of the RPC. The essential elements of the offense charged are sufficiently alleged in the Informations, as the Wus, while authorized signatories, may still be held liable for Estafa if they expended corporate funds for their personal use.","WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED. The November 27, 2012 Decision and May 17, 2013 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR Nos. 31063 and 31921 are hereby AFFIRMED. The cases are remanded to the respective Branch of the RTC for [petitioners'] arraignment and trial."
"A.C. No. 11219, March 16, 2022","SPOUSES ANTONIO AND JOSEFA PERLA TAN, COMPLAINANTS, VS. ATTY. MARIA JOHANNA N. VALLEJO, RESPONDENT.","In their Joint Complaint-Affidavit dated March 3, 2016, complainants Spouses Antonio Tan and Josefa Perla Tan charged respondent Atty. Maria Johanna N. Vallejo for alleged violation of Section 3(c), Rule IV of A.M. No. 02-8-13-SC or the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice. Complainants averred that on September 21, 2012, respondent notarized a Deed of Absolute Sale and an Affidavit of Confirmation of Sale in which they purportedly sold, conveyed, and transferred ownership of their property to respondent's paternal uncle Arnold C. Vallejo, Sr. (Vallejo, Sr.). They further averred that under Section 3(c), Rule IV of A.M. No. 02-8-13-SC, respondent was disqualified from notarizing the documents because the vendee, Vallejo, Sr. is her uncle (brother of her father), a relative within the fourth civil degree. They also claimed they never appeared nor signed the documents before respondent, asserting Vallejo, Sr. alone prepared the documents and persuaded them to sign under the pretense that he would only use the documents to facilitate his loan application. Respondent countered that on September 21, 2012, complainants and her uncle Vallejo, Sr. went to her law office, presented the documents, and asked her to notarize the same. She acceded after reading and explaining the terms to complainants. She asserted she did not violate the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice because her uncle was not a signatory to the documents. The IBP-Commission on Bar Discipline recommended that the complaint be dismissed for lack of merit, holding that since the Deed of Absolute Sale and Confirmation of Sale bore only the signatures of complainants, sans the signature of respondent's uncle, she cannot be deemed to have violated the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice. The IBP-Board of Governors adopted this finding.","We rule in the affirmative. Verily, therefore, we find respondent liable for violation of Section 3 (c) Rule IV of A.M. No. 02-8-13-SC, otherwise known as the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice.","Verily, it is incorrect for respondent to claim that the 'principals' in the Deed of Absolute Sale and Affidavit of Confirmation of Sale are complainants only simply because they were the only ones who signed the documents in question. For sure, what we have here is a unilateral contract of sale which need only be signed by complainants as the vendors, sans the signature of respondent's uncle as the vendee. But this does not alter the fact that respondent's uncle, being the vendee, is also a 'principal' party to the sale and its confirmatory document. Without the vendee, there can be no contract of sale to speak of. Indeed, what respondent did here – notarizing a document where one of the contracting parties was her relative within the fourth civil degree is a clear circumvention of the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice. To accept her argument that the prohibition did not attach to her because her uncle's signature did not appear on the sale documents would definitely set a dangerous precedent that will erode the integrity of the system of notary in the country.","Respondent Atty. Maria Johanna N. Vallejo is found liable for violation of Section 3(c) Rule IV of A.M. No. 02-8-13-SC otherwise known as the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice. Respondent is REPRIMANDED with stern warning that a repetition of the same or similar infraction will be dealt with more severely. Further, respondent is DISQUALIFIED from being commissioned as a notary public, or from performing any notarial act if she is presently commissioned as a notary public, for a period of three (3) months. She is DIRECTED to INFORM the Court, under oath, of the exact date of receipt of this Decision."

MAMANWA TRIBES OF BARANGAY TAGANITO AND URBIZTONDO, MUNICIPALITY OF CLAVER, SURIGAO DEL NORTE (AS REPRESENTED BY DATU REYNANTE BUKLAS AND DATU ALICIO PATAC) AND THE NATIONAL COMMISSION ON INDIGENOUS PEOPLES, RESPONDENTS.","The Mamanwa Tribes, whose ancestral domain is recognized under Certificate of Ancestral Domain Title No. R13-CLA-0906-048, executed a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with Shenzhou Mining Group Corporation (Shenzhou) for the development of mineral resources. Commissioner Masagnay subsequently issued Compliance Certificate Control No. CCRXIII-19-02-13 to Shenzhou, certifying compliance with requirements for free and prior informed consent (FPIC). The Mamanwa Tribes later discovered that Shenzhou was not the true contractor of the pertinent Mineral Production Sharing Agreement and that Shenzhou failed to pay royalties. The Tribes filed a Petition for cancellation with the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP). The NCIP En Banc declared the Compliance Certificate VOID AB INITIO, finding that Commissioner Masagnay signed it under an invalid delegation of authority from then Chairperson Eugenio A. Insigne. The Court of Appeals affirmed the NCIP Resolution. Shenzhou appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that Masagnay should be considered a de facto officer whose acts were valid.",The Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED. The Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 123186 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION.,"The Supreme Court ruled against petitioner Shenzhou. The power to issue a certification precondition is vested in the NCIP as a body (Section 59 of Republic Act No. 8371), and this power was delegated to the NCIP Chairperson. The Chairperson's subsequent authorization to Commissioner Masagnay to sign on his behalf constituted a redelegation of a delegated power, which is void under the principle of *potestas delegata non delegari potest*, as there was no showing that the NCIP En Banc allowed such redelegation. Therefore, the Compliance Certificate Control No. CCRXIII-19-02-13 is void ab initio. The doctrine of *de facto* officer does not apply because Masagnay was merely designated as an officer-in-charge and was not appointed or elected to the position he temporarily occupied. The NCIP correctly voided the certificate and ordered Shenzhou to cease operations, in keeping with its mandate to protect the interest and wellbeing of indigenous cultural communities.","The Compliance Certificate issued in favor of petitioner Shenzhou Mining Group Corp. with Control No. CCRXIII-19-02-13 is DECLARED void ab initio. All other agreements, licenses, and similar issuances premised on the said compliance certificate are also DEEMED VOID. Petitioner Shenzhou Mining Group Corp is ORDERED to cease and desist with its mining operations within the area covered by the aforesaid compliance certificate, ENJOINED from undertaking further activities in the area without the appropriate free, prior, and informed consent of the indigenous cultural communities/indigenous peoples concerned, and DIRECTED to return possession of the subject matter premises to the rightful owners under the Certificate of Ancestral Domain Title No. R13-CLA-0906-048. Petitioner Shenzhou Mining Group Corp. is ORDERED to pay respondent Mamanwa Tribes the agreed royalties and the stipulated interest, if any, until such time when it would have returned the possession of the premises to the rightful owners. If no interest is stipulated, the agreed royalties shall earn 6% per annum computed from the time of filing of the cancellation petition. Further, these shall earn 6% interest per annum from finality of this Decision until fully paid. The amount of P4,658,950.00 deposited in escrow with the Development Bank of the Philippines is hereby ORDERED released in favor of respondent Mamanwa Tribes. Costs against petitioner."
"G.R. No. 216453, March 16, 2022","OLIGARIO TURALBA Y VILLEGAS, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","Oligario was charged with Carnapping under the following Information: That on or about the twentieth (20th) day of November 2007, in the City of Olongapo, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with intent of gain and without the knowledge and consent of Gregorio Calimag [Gregorio], did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously carnap, take, steal, and carry away one (1) 1996 model CRV Honda Wagon with Plate No. RFC-269, belonging to [Gregorio], to the damage and prejudice of the latter. However, said CRV Honda Wagon was recovered. CONTRARY TO LAW. [5] When arraigned, Oligario pleaded ""not guilty."" Trial on the merits then ensued. [6] The facts for the prosecution, as synthesized by the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) in their brief filed with the CA, are as follows: On November 20, 2007 at around 3:45 in the afternoon, [Gregorio] was driving his Honda CRV with Plate No. RFC-269 from Kalaklan, Olongapo City and headed to Mulawain Bakery Shop at 18th Street corner Caron Street, West Bajac-Bajac, Olongapo City, to buy some bread. Upon arriving at 18th Street, he parked his car ten (10) meters away across Mulawain Bakery but he left the car key inside the vehicle. After about two minutes and while he was about to get hold of the bread he bought, he turned around to check on his car but he noticed that his car was already moving towards Peping Mami along Caron Street. He immediately flagged down and boarded a tricy[c]le to pursue his car. In the course of the pursuit, Gregorio continuously shouted, "" Carnaper yan harangin ninyo yan sasakyan, akin yan, carnaper yan harangin ninyo yan sasakyan, akin iyan! "" until the car was caught on a traffic congestion along Brill Street corner 20th Street, West Bajac Bajac, Olongapo City. Thereat, Gregorio immediately rushed inside his car and got hold of [Oligario] for the latter not to be able to escape. He also instructed the tricycle drive to immediately call the police. It was around 3:50 x x x in the afternoon of November 20, 2007 when PO2 George Esmillarin of PNP Station 1, Olongapo City, received a call from a concerned citizen informing their office that a carnapped vehicle was being chased along Brill Street going to the direction of the Old Public Market. Upon receiving said call, PO2 Reychard V. Valencia, together with SPO4 Danilo Cañutal, on board their service mobile, immediately proceeded to the area to verify the report. Upon passing by Brill Street corner 20th Street, concerned citizens flagged them down and pointed to the carnapped vehicle. When they proceeded to the car, they saw [Oligario] being cornered by Gregorio. Upon seeing the police officers, Gregorio turned over [Oligario] to them. SPO4 Cañutal informed [Oligario] of his constitutional rights. Thereafter, PO2 Valencia conducted a body search on [Oligario] where a butterfly knife of about seven inches in length was recovered from him. They then brought [Oligario] and Gregorio to the police station for further investigation. [7] In defense, Dr. Ma. Lourdes Labarcon Evangelista (Dr. Evangelista) testified and narrated that she first met Oligario on October 24, 2007 at the Mariveles Mental Hospital for evaluation and management of his mental condition. After tests, Dr. Evangelista assessed Oligario with psychosis ("" nawawala sa sarili "") due to use of alcohol and methamphetamine. She prescribed medication and scheduled a follow-up checkup, but Oligario was not able to come back as he was already detained for the carnapping incident. [8] In its Decision [9] dated December 6, 2012, the Regional Trial Court, Branch 75, Olongapo City (RTC), convicted Oligario of Carnapping. On appeal, the CA affirmed the conviction, [12] and confirmed that Oligario's psychosis cannot exculpate him from criminal liability. Oligario then filed a motion for reconsideration, [14] which was denied by the CA in its Resolution [15] dated December 10, 2014; hence, this petition.","The petition is DENIED. The August 28, 2014 Decision and December 10, 2014 Resolution of the Court of Appeals are AFFIRMED. Petitioner Oligario Turalba y Villegas is sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of fourteen (14) years and eight (8) months, as minimum, to seventeen (17) years and four (4) months, as maximum.","The Court ruled that Oligario failed to establish his mental state, much less his insanity, because the defense did not present clear and convincing evidence that he suffered a complete deprivation of intelligence at the time of the commission of the crime. Dr. Evangelista’s assessment was inconclusive as she met him only once. The Court further rejected the argument that his mental condition could be considered a mitigating circumstance under Article 13 (9) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC). Citing People v. Simon, the Court held that RA No. 6539 (Carnapping) is a special law, and the rules on penalties and mitigating circumstances under the RPC do not apply thereto. Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the penalty imposed by the lower courts was deemed correct.","Petitioner Oligario Turalba y Villegas is found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Carnapping under Republic Act No. 6539, as amended."
"G.R. No. 244076, March 16, 2022","FELIX CHINGKOE AND ROSITA CHINGKOE, PETITIONERS, VS. FAUSTINO CHINGKOE AND GLORIA CHINGKOE, RESPONDENTS.","Faustino Chingkoe (Faustino) and his wife, Gloria Chingkoe (Gloria), were the registered owners of a parcel of land in Lopez Jaena St., Ayala Heights, Quezon City covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 8283 (subject property). Faustino alleged that sometime in 1990, he allowed his brother, Felix Chingkoe (Felix), to occupy the subject property. Upon the request of Tan Po Chu, their mother, Faustino signed an undated Deed of Sale over the subject property in favor of Felix. Tan Po Chu assured Faustino that she will keep the undated Deed of Sale because she just wanted to appease Felix who was then becoming an alcoholic. On the other hand, Felix averred that he had been in possession of the subject property since 1989. After five years of occupying the subject property or on October 10, 1994, Felix purchased it from Faustino for P3,130,000.00. Both parties then signed the Deed of Sale before a notary public, Atty. Reynaldo Z. Calabio (Atty. Calabio). Despite repeated demands, Faustino refused to surrender the Owner's Duplicate of TCT No. 8283 which prevented Felix from having it transferred to his name. Felix later discovered that Faustino had mortgaged the subject property to Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation (RCBC). This discovery prompted Felix to file a complaint for specific performance with damages to compel Faustino to turn over the TCT, and facilitate its transfer pursuant to the Deed of Sale. In its Decision dated May 12, 2014, the RTC ruled in favor of Felix and held that the testimony of Tan Po Chu failed to overturn the presumption of regularity of the notarized Deed of Sale. The RTC ruled, thus: WHEREFORE, the Court hereby finds for the plaintiffs, Spouses Felix and Rosita Chingkoe, and declares the existence and due execution of the Deed of Absolute Sale, over real property as described in and covered by TCT No. 8283 registered under the name of the defendants, Spouses Faustino and Gloria Chingkoe, as acknowledged on October 10, 1994 before notary public Reynaldo Z. Calabio. As and by way of attorney's fees, the Spouses Faustino and Gloria Chingkoe are ordered to pay the Spouses Felix and Rosita Chingkoe the amount of P50,000.00. Felix filed a motion for partial reconsideration of the RTC's ruling to include an order to surrender the TCT, which the RTC granted. Meanwhile, Faustino filed an appeal before the CA seeking the reversal of the RTC's Decision. In its assailed Decision dated April 30, 2018, the CA granted Faustino's appeal and gave credence to the testimony of Tan Po Chu that Faustino only signed the Deed of Absolute Sale to appease Felix without the intention to sell the subject property. The CA held that Felix failed to prove that he paid the contract price of P3,130,000.00 rendering the contract void for lack of consideration, reversing the RTC Decision and Order. Felix sought reconsideration but the CA denied his motion. Hence, this petition.","The Supreme Court found that the records do not support the CA's findings. The Court held that the CA erred in overturning the presumption of regularity of the notarized Deed of Sale based solely on the testimony of Tan Po Chu, who was incompetent on the matter, and in declaring the contract void for alleged lack of consideration. The Court upheld the validity of the Deed of Sale but denied the petitioners' claim for actual damages for lack of proof.","Settled is the rule that notarized documents enjoy the presumption of regularity which can be overturned only by clear and convincing evidence. Tan Po Chu's testimony was insufficient to overturn this presumption as she could not read the document, did not know the contract price, and admitted she did not pay too much attention to it, rendering her testimony hearsay. In contrast, the notary public attested that both parties appeared, and Faustino admitted causing the preparation and voluntary signing of the document, showing the intention to be bound. The CA erred in declaring the Deed of Sale void for lack of consideration. Failure to pay consideration is different from lack of consideration; non-payment only renders a contract rescissible, not void. Furthermore, the Deed of Sale itself stated: 'for and in consideration of the sum of THREE MILLION ONE HUDRED THIRTY THOUSAND ONLY (P3,130,000.00) Philippine currency, paid in full by the VENDEE, receipt is hereby acknowledged by the VENDORS, to the full satisfaction.' Faustino failed to overturn the presumption of regularity in favor of this attestation of payment. However, the claim for actual damages based on unrealized profits was denied because actual or compensatory damages must be duly proved with a reasonable degree of certainty (Article 2199 of the Civil Code), and Felix's testimony alone, without receipts or documents, was insufficient.","FOR THESE REASONS, the petition is GRANTED. The Court of Appeals' Decision dated April 30, 2018, in CA-G.R. CV No. 106434 is REVERSED. The Decision of the Regional Trial Court Branch 101, Quezon City dated May 12, 2014, and its Order dated July 30, 2015 in Civil Case No. Q-95-22865 are REINSTATED."

PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","On February 15, 2010, a criminal complaint was filed against petitioner Pedrito Garma y Miguel alias ""Willy"" together with his twin brother Reynaldo Garma, (hereafter the ""Garma twins"") for Grave Threats defined and penalized under Article 282 of The Revised Penal Code, viz. : That on or about 9:30 in the morning of February 11, 2010 in Barangay Mabuno, Municipality of Gattaran, Province of Cagayan, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused by confederating and helping one another, moved by personal re[s]entment which they entertained against Barangay Captain Roseller Ballon and with the infliction upon the latter of a wrong amounting to a crime, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously inform the farm helpers of the said Barangay Official that they shall kill him by telling the following, to wit: ""PATAYEN MI KOMAN"" if he was with them, as consequence of which, it caused great fear to the offended party. During the trial, prosecution witness Timple, Jr. testified that on February 11, 2010, he and two other farmers working for Barangay Captain Ballon were loading a water pump when they saw the Garma twins chasing illegal fishers. The twins stopped, asked the farmers if Barangay Captain Ballon was with them, and upon learning he was not, petitioner supposedly uttered: ""Patayen mi koman"" (We should have killed him). Barangay Captain Ballon claimed he was terrified because the Garma twins opposed a water impounding project he was implementing. Petitioner Pedrito Garma denied the allegation, stating that he and his brother were looking for the Barangay Captain to report illegal fishing and property damage they had suffered, and only asked the farmers for his location before proceeding to the PNP-Gattaran. He claimed the case was a harassment suit.","By Decision [20] dated June 28, 2016, the MTC found petitioner guilty of Grave Threats under Article 282, paragraph 2 of the Revised Penal Code, viz. : WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered finding accused Pedrito Garma y Miguel GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT of the offense of grave threat, defined and penalized under paragraph no. 2 of Article 282, RPC, and there being no mitigating or aggravating circumstance, the Court hereby imposes upon him the penalty of medium period of arresto mayor or two (2) months and one (1) day imprisonment and fine in the amount of five hundred (P500.00) pesos and to pay the costs of suit. SO ORDERED. On appeal, the Regional Trial Court - Branch 6, Aparri, Cagayan affirmed under Decision [23] dated January 3, 2017. The Court of Appeals, by Decision [24] dated December 11, 2018, affirmed in the main, but modified the imposed penalty, viz. : WHEREFORE , premises considered, the appeal is DENIED. The Decision dated January 3, 2017 that was issued by the Regional Trial Court of Aparri, Cagayan Branch 6 in Criminal Case No. II-13288 is MODIFIED. Petitioner Pedrito Garma y Miguel alias ""Willy"" is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of imprisonment of four (4) months and [one] (1) day as minimum to six (6) months as maximum, pay a fine of five hundred (P500.00) pesos and to pay costs of suit. SO ORDERED. Petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration was subsequently denied under its Amended Decision [26] dated June 18, 2019, albeit the penalty was modified anew, thus: WHEREFORE, premises considered, the appeal is DENIED. The Decision dated January 3, 2017 that was issued by the Regional Trial Court of Aparri, Cagayan Branch 6 in Criminal Case No. II-13288 is MODIFIED. Petitioner Pedrito Garma y Miguel alias ""Willy"" is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of imprisonment of four (4) months and one (1) day, pay a fine of five hundred (P500.00) pesos and to pay the costs of suit. (Emphasis supplied)","The Court acquits the petitioner, finding that the evidence presented by the prosecution fails to establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt regarding the elements of Grave Threats (Article 282, paragraph 2). The Court found the evidence of the actus reus (the actual speaking or uttering of the threats) to be reasonably doubtful. Specifically, the prosecution witness's testimony that petitioner and his brother suddenly stopped chasing illegal fishers just to ask for the barangay captain and utter the threat ""Patayen mi koman"" was found to be incredible as it ""defies reason and leaves much to the imagination."" The Court also found the evidence on the mens rea (intent to intimidate or be taken seriously) to be reasonably doubtful, noting that the complainant (Barangay Captain Ballon) admitted there was no other instance of threat and was not even sure if petitioner intended to carry the threat into effect. Since both the actus reus and the mens rea were wanting, reasonable doubt persists, necessitating acquittal.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is GRANTED. The Amended Decision dated June 18, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 39545 is REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

"G.R. No. 220657, March 16, 2022","CELESTINO M. JUNIO, PETITIONER, VS. PACIFIC OCEAN MANNING, INC., MEGA CHEMICAL TANKER, AND ERLINDA S. AZUCENA, RESPONDENTS.","Celestino M. Junio (Celestino) worked for Pacific Ocean Manning, Inc. (Pacific Manning) for 16 years. On January 24, 2011, he entered into a nine (9)-month employment contract to serve as a Fitter onboard MCT Monte Rosa. On June 15, 2011, Celestino claimed he suffered an injury to his left eye when a hose accidentally detached and hit it. On September 11, 2011, he collapsed while changing the fuel injector in the engine room and was referred to an offshore physician, Dr. Daniel Jenkins III (Dr. Jenkins). An MRI showed Asymmetrical Mild Exophithalmos of the eye associated with residual chronic [l]ymphedema of the retrobulbar fatty tissues, including slightly increased signal intensity around the left optic nerve as well as perio[r]bital soft tissue swelling and lymphedema; suspicions of partial tear of the posterior retina as well as minimal residual posttraumatic contusive edema of the sclera and choroid posterior along eye globe on the left. Dr. Jenkins indicated in the health insurance claim form that Celestino's illnesses were not work-related. On September 21, 2011, Celestino was repatriated, two days later he reported to Pacific Manning and requested medical treatment but was not referred to a company-designated physician. This prompted him to file a complaint on February 10, 2012 against respondents Pacific Manning, Mega Tanker, and Erlinda S. Azucena, for payment of permanent total disability benefits, sickness allowance, damages, and attorney's fees. The Labor Arbiter (LA) dismissed the complaint for failure to comply with the mandatory three (3)-day reporting requirement. On appeal, the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) reversed the LA's Decision, awarded permanent total disability benefits, sickness allowance, and attorney's fees. The Court of Appeals (CA) in a Decision dated January 5, 2015 reversed the NLRC ruling and reinstated the LA's Decision, echoing the LA's findings that Celestino failed to observe the mandatory three (3)-day reporting requirement. Celestino filed the instant petition for review on certiorari.","The Court GRANTS the petition. The Decision dated January 5, 2015 and Resolution dated August 26, 2015 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 130892 are REVERSED.","The Court found the petition meritorious, noting that the conflicting findings between the NLRC and the LA/CA necessitated a review of facts. The Court ruled that Celestino was medically repatriated because he was only on the 8th month of his nine (9)-month contract when he was sent home, and the employer failed to provide justification for the pre-termination. Respondents could not feign ignorance of Celestino's medical conditions to justify its non-referral to a post-employment medical examination because it had access to Celestino's files and the diagnosis of the offshore physicians. The Court held that Celestino complied with the mandatory three (3)-day reporting requirement under the POEA-SEC, as he reported within two (2) days but was not referred to a company-designated physician. The absence of a post-employment medical examination cannot bar Celestino's claim for disability benefits and sickness allowance. The Court further ruled that because there was no medical assessment issued by a company doctor, Celestino has no obligation to secure the opinion of his own doctor and is deemed totally and permanently disabled as of the date of the expiration of the 120-day period counted from his repatriation. An employee is entitled to the award of attorney's fees in actions for indemnity under the employer's liability laws.","The Decision dated January 5, 2015 and Resolution dated August 26, 2015 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

Thereafter, Regina received placement fees of P65,000.00 from Maelene, P35,000.00 from Geraldine, and P55,000.00 from Gloria. The payments were likewise recorded in index cards. In these transactions, Regina and Darwin assured Milagros, Maelene, Geraldine, and Gloria that they will earn high compensation and instructed them to await their deployment. Unfortunately, Milagros, Maelene, Geraldine, and Gloria neither got to leave for Canada nor get their money back. The National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) conducted an entrapment operation and arrested Regina for illegal recruitment activities. The operatives recovered from Regina several index cards with notes on the payments from Milagros, Maelene, Gloria, and Geraldine. Accordingly, Regina and Darwin were charged with large scale illegal recruitment and three (3) counts of estafa before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) docketed as Criminal Case Nos. 12160, 12161, 12162, and 12163, respectively, to wit: Criminal Case No. 12160 for: Large Scale Illegal Recruitment That sometime in September, 2011 to January 2012 in the City of Legazpi, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court the above named accused conspiring, confederating, and helping each other for a common purpose, representing to have the capacity, authority or license to contract, enlist and deploy or transport workers for overseas employment, did then and there willfully, unlawfully, and criminally recruit, contract, and promise to deploy for a fee [sic] Maelene Canaveral y Hesita, Geraldine Ojano, Gloria B. Mape and Milagros Osila for work overseas, [sic] specially Canada without first obtaining the required license and/or authority from the POEA, accused are neither licensed nor authorized from the POEA to recruit workers for overseas employment, to the damage and prejudice of the above-mentioned persons. CONTRARY TO LAW. Criminal Case No. 12161 for: Estafa That sometime in January 2012, in the City of Legazpi, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court the above named accused conspiring, confederating, and helping each other for a common purpose, representing to have the capacity, authority or license to contract, enlist and deploy or transport workers for overseas employment, with intent to defraud and by means of false pretenses and fraudulent representation, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously entice Geraldine Ojano to work abroad and then collected the sum of money allegedly for processing fees to which said Geraldine Ojano had given the total amount of thirty-five thousand (P35,000.00) pesos, when in truth and in fact accused have no authority to recruit and after obtaining the said amount accused failed to comply with their obligation nor return the said amount despite repeated demands, to her damage and prejudice. ACTS CONTRARY TO LAW. Criminal Case No. 12162 for: Estafa That on or about the 10th day of September 2011, in the City of Legazpi, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court the above named accused conspiring, confederating, and helping each other for a common purpose, representing to have the capacity, authority or license to contract, enlist and deploy or transport workers for overseas employment, with intent to defraud and by means of false pretenses and fraudulent representation, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously entice Milagros Osila to work abroad and then collected the sum of money allegedly for processing fees to which said Milagros Osila had given the total amount of ten thousand eight hundred (P10,800.00) pesos, when in truth and in fact accused have no authority to recruit and after obtaining the said amount accused failed to comply with their obligation nor return the said amount despite repeated demands, to her damage and prejudice. ACTS CONTRARY TO LAW. Criminal Case No. 12163 for: Estafa That sometime on October, 2011, in the City of Legazpi, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court the above named accused conspiring, confederating, and helping each other for a common purpose, representing to have the capacity, authority or license to contract, enlist and deploy or transport workers for overseas employment, with intent to defraud and by means of false pretenses and fraudulent representation, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously entice Gloria B. Mape to work abroad and then collected the sum of money allegedly for processing fees to which said Gloria B. Mape had given the total amount of fifty-thousand (P55,000.00) pesos, when in truth and in fact accused have no authority to recruit and after obtaining the said amount accused failed to comply with their obligation nor return the said amount despite repeated demands, to her damage and prejudice. ACTS CONTRARY TO LAW. Only Regina was brought to the jurisdiction of the RTC while Darwin remained at large. During arraignment, Regina pleaded ""not guilty"" to the crimes charged. Thereafter, joint trial of the cases ensued. The prosecution presented the testimonies of Milagros, Maelene, Geraldine, and Gloria. Also, the prosecution offered in evidence a certification from the Philippines Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) stating that Regina and Darwin had no license to recruit workers abroad. On the other hand, Regina denied the accusations and claimed that she did not promise overseas employment nor receive money from Milagros, Maelene, Geraldine, and Gloria. Regina insisted that she was also a victim of Darwin who offered her work as caregiver in British Columbia, Canada. On December 4, 2017, the RTC convicted Regina of large scale illegal recruitment and three (3) counts of estafa. The RTC ruled that Regina represented having authority to send the complainants abroad but the promise never materialized. Moreover, the index cards recovered from Regina established that she received various fees from the complainants. The RTC also held that Regina defrauded the complainants and her assurances caused them to part with their money, thus: WHEREFORE, in Criminal Case No. 12160 this court finds REGINA WENDELINA BEGINO GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale and thereby sentences her to life imprisonment and to pay a fine of P500,000.00. In Criminal Case No. 12161, this court finds her guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Estafa and sentences her to imprisonment of two (2) years of Prision Correccional as minimum to eight (8) years of Prision Mayor as maximum. She is likewise directed to pay Geraldine Ojano the amount of P35,000.00 from the finality of this decision with legal interest until fully paid. In Criminal Case No. 12162, this court finds her guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Estafa and sentences her to imprisonment of two (2) years of Prision Correccional as minimum to eight (8) years of Prision Mayor as maximum. She is likewise directed to pay Milagros Osila the amount of P10,800.00 from the finality of this decision with legal interest until fully paid. In Criminal Case No. 12163, this court finds her guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Estafa and sentences her to imprisonment of four (4) years of Prision Correccional as minimum to nine (9) years of Prision Mayor as maximum. She is likewise directed to pay Gloria Mape the amount of P55,000.00 from the finality of this decision with legal interest until fully paid. SO ORDERED. Aggrieved, Regina elevated the case to the Court of Appeals (CA), questioning only her conviction for large scale illegal recruitment. Meantime, Regina filed an omnibus motion before the RTC to avail the benefits of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 10951 and to modify the penalty in the three (3) estafa cases. On December 14, 2017, the RTC granted the motion and reduced the penalty in Criminal Case Nos. 12161 and 12162 to imprisonment of six (6) months because the amount of fraud in each case did not exceed P40,000.00. In Criminal Case No. 12163, the RTC modified the indeterminate penalty to 6 months of arresto mayor, as minimum, to two (2) years of prision correccional, as maximum, to wit: The Omnibus Motion filed by the accused thru counsel is well taken. Hence, the dispositive portion of the decision is corrected as follows: In Criminal Case No. 12161, this court finds her guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Estafa and sentences her to imprisonment of six (6) months. She is likewise directed to pay Geraldine Ojano the amount of P35,000.00 from the finality of the decision with legal interest until fully paid; In Criminal Case No. 12162, this court finds her guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Estafa and sentences her to imprisonment of six (6) months. She is likewise directed to pay Milagros Osila the amount of P10,800.00 from the finality of decision with legal interest until fully paid. In Criminal Case No. 12163, this court finds her guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Estafa and sentences her to imprisonment of six (6) months of arresto mayor as minimum to two (2) years of prision correccional as maximum. She is likewise directed to pay Gloria Mape the amount of P55,000.00 from finality of decision with legal interest until fully paid. The accused had already served the penalty imposed in the three (3) cases because of her detention, the Warden of Albay Provincial Jail, Legazpi City is directed to RELEASE her from custody UNLESS SHE IS BEING DETAINED FOR OTHER LEGAL CAUSES. On March 27, 2019, the CA affirmed Regina's guilt in Criminal Case No. 12160 for large scale illegal recruitment, viz.: WHEREFORE, the instant appeal is hereby DENIED. The Decision dated December 4, 2017 of the Regional Trial Court of Legazpi City, Branch 2 in Criminal Case No. 12160, is hereby AFFIRMED. SO ORDERED. Hence, this appeal. The parties opted not to file supplemental briefs considering that all issues have already been exhaustively discussed in their pleadings before the CA. Thus, Regina reiterates her argument that the prosecution failed to prove the elements of large scale illegal recruitment.",The appeal is unmeritorious.,"Republic Act No. 8042, otherwise known as the Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act of 1995, as amended by R.A. No. 10022, broadened the concept of illegal recruitment under the Labor Code and provided stiffer penalties, especially those that constitute economic sabotage, i.e., illegal recruitment in large scale and illegal recruitment committed by a syndicate. Here, all the elements of large scale illegal recruitment are present, to wit: (1) the offender has no valid license or authority required by law to enable him to lawfully engage in recruitment and placement of workers; (2) the offender undertakes any of the activities within the meaning of ""recruitment and placement"" under Article 13 (b) of the Labor Code, or any of the prohibited practices enumerated under Article 34 of the Labor Code (now Section 6 of RA 8042); (3) the offender commits any of the acts of recruitment and placement against three (3) or more persons, individually or as a group. The prosecution established that Regina engaged in recruitment activities and gave complainants the distinct impression that she had the power or ability to send them abroad for work. Regina directly transacted with the complainants regarding the job prospect in Canada and personally assisted them in completing the requirements for deployment. Regina received money from the complainants as placement fees and gave assurances that they will earn high compensation for their purported jobs abroad. However, the expected employment did not take place. Furthermore, Regina had no authority to engage in recruitment activities. Finally, there are four (4) complainants who testified against Regina which qualified the offense to economic sabotage. To avoid liability, Regina explained that she is a victim of Darwin's machinations. Quite the contrary, the facts reveal that Regina has an active role in perpetrating the crime, including collecting placement fees and possessing index cards detailing payments. The CA and the RTC's assessment on the veracity of the testimonies of the complainants is upheld. Since Regina is a non-licensee or non-holder of authority, R.A. No. 10022 mandates the imposition of the maximum penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of P5,000,000.00. The Court observes that the RTC erred in the computation of penalties imposed in the three estafa cases under R.A. No. 10951, but these penalties can no longer be corrected, even if erroneous, because the judgment of conviction for estafa has become final and executory after Regina chose not to appeal these cases.","FOR THESE REASONS, the appeal is DISMISSED. The Court of Appeals' Decision dated March 27, 2019 in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 10477 is AFFIRMED. The accused-appellant Regina Wendelina Begino y Rogero is found guilty of large scale illegal recruitment and is sentenced to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and to pay a fine of P5,000,000.00."
"G.R. No. 211837, March 16, 2022","THE REAL BANK (A THRIFT BANK), INC., PETITIONER, VS. DALMACIO CRUZ MANINGAS, RESPONDENT.","This case arose from a complaint[6] filed by respondent Dalmacio Cruz Maningas (Maningas) against petitioner The Real Bank (A Thrift Bank), Inc. (Real Bank), and Metropolitan Bank and Trust Co. (Metrobank) for the recovery of a sum of money with damages. Real Bank and Metrobank are domestic corporations engaged in the business of banking. Maningas is a Filipino-British national who was living in London, England at the time material to this case.[7] He maintained a savings account and a checking account with Metrobank Greenhills, Eisenhower branch.[8] On August 22, 2006, while in London, Maningas issued two crossed checks with amounts of P550,000.00 and P602,700.00 (with an aggregate amount of P1,152,700.00) in favor of his friend Bienvenido Rosaria (Rosaria).[9] Maningas issued the checks as payment to Rosaria for a parcel of land he (Maningas) purchased.[10] Notably, however, Maningas wrote the name BIENVINIDO ROSARIA as payee of the two checks.[11] As Rosaria was also in London at that time, he instructed Maningas to mail the checks to Maxima Jumawan, Rosaria's sister, who was residing at that time in Dongalo, Parañaque City, with a request to deposit the checks to Rosaria's account.[12] After a week, Maningas inquired if the checks were received; Rosaria informed him that the checks did not arrive.[13] But when Maningas checked his account balance, he discovered that the amount of the checks was already deducted.[14] He then clarified with Metrobank and learned that the checks were paid when a person named BIENVINIDO ROSARIA used the checks in opening an account with Real Bank in its Bacoor, Cavite branch.[15] Thereafter, the full amount was withdrawn.[16] It was alleged that the person who represented himself as BIENVINIDO ROSARIA was referred by a retired manager of the Real Bank branch for the opening of an account.[17] This person was interviewed and he presented three valid identification cards, which showed no signs of tampering and any adverse findings.[18] The branch manager at that time then approved the opening of the account.[19] The checks were deposited, and Real Bank sent them to Metrobank for clearing. The checks were allowed to be withdrawn only after they were cleared by Metrobank.[20] Maningas alerted Metrobank of the alleged forgeries; so Metrobank attempted to return the checks to Real Bank on the ground of ""forged endorsement,"" but to no avail.[21] Maningas thus sent an electronic mail to Real Bank, informing it that the checks were paid to an impostor using the name BIENVINIDO ROSARIA, who opened an account in the branch; this, however, was also ignored, so he sent a formal demand dated September 15, 2006.[22] This resulted to the filing of Maningas' complaint who contended that both banks were negligent in allowing the unauthorized withdrawal of the amount despite the forged indorsements of the checks.[23] As the depository bank, Metrobank has the obligation to pay the checks to the intended payee only upon a genuine indorsement—the impostor's signature in this case is not a genuine indorsement.[24] He added that Metrobank did not notify him prior to debiting his account.[25] Metrobank should therefore return the amount. For Real Bank, its liability is derived from its implied warranties as a collecting bank and last indorser in guaranteeing all previous indorsements, including the forged indorsement, and the genuineness of the checks.[26] As a result, Real Bank must bear the consequences.[27] Maningas also claimed damages and attorney's fees.[28] Real Bank filed an answer with counterclaim.[29] It argued that Maningas had no legal standing to file as Rosaria, being the intended payee, is the real party in interest who had the authority to file the action.[30] Real Bank insisted that it followed all rules and regulations in allowing the opening of the account, as well as the subsequent deposit and encashment of the checks.[31] The alleged payee, BIENVINIDO ROSARIA, presented the required proofs of identification, and the amount was withdrawn only after the checks were cleared.[32] Maningas was therefore precluded from raising the defense of forgery and had no one to blame but himself for sending the checks to another person knowing that the intended payee was also in London.[33] Real Bank added that the fictitious payee rule is applicable, making the checks bearer instruments; thus, the forgery had no effect.[34] Metrobank also filed an answer with crossclaim.[35] It argued that the claim for reimbursement should be directed solely against Real Bank; as the collecting bank and last indorser, Real Bank was duty bound to ascertain the genuineness of all prior indorsements.[36] When the checks were presented for payment, it was presumed that Real Bank performed its duty.[37] Real Bank, however, was remiss in its duty and it should ultimately be responsible for the unlawful withdrawal by reason of the forged indorsements.[38]","WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED. The November 29, 2013 Decision and March 14, 2014 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV. No. 99817 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION in that legal interest on the amount due is imposed as follows: (a) twelve percent (12%) per annum from the filing of the complaint on February 10, 2009 until June 30, 2013; (b) six percent (6%) per annum from July 1, 2013 until finality of the Decision; and, (c) the total amount of the foregoing shall, in turn, earn interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum, from finality of the Decision until full payment. SO ORDERED.","The Court affirms the rulings of the CA and the RTC. Real Bank is liable to return the amount of the checks to Maningas. ... Metrobank's non-liability has already become final. ... [A]ssuming that Metrobank's non-liability is not yet final and considering the above principles on liability of banks, the Court finds that, considering the circumstances, Metrobank is still not liable. As aptly pointed out by Senior Associate Justice Perlas-Bernabe, Metrobank in fact strictly complied with the drawer's instructions.[93] The bank released payment to the named payee in the checks, although the name was misspelled.[94] ... Notwithstanding Metrobank's non-liability, Maningas can still recover the amount of the checks from Real Bank, the collecting bank. Real Bank guaranteed that the checks were genuine and in all respects what they purport to be, and that the indorser (payee) had good title to them—which Metrobank relied on for the release of payment. As it turned out, the impostor had no good title to the checks as he was not the intended payee; it was proven that Rosaria (through his sister) did not receive the checks. Real Bank's guarantees thus turned out to be false, making it liable to reimburse the drawee the amount of the checks. Further, Real Bank's own negligence, as found by the CA and the RTC, contributed to the improper payment when it failed to detect the impostor in opening the account. ... The Court agrees with the CA that Maningas was not negligent at that time. ... Thus, the Court finds no reason to disturb these findings of fact by the RTC and CA. ... The fictitious payee rule is not applicable in this case. The misspelling of Rosaria's name did not make the payee of the checks fictitious under the law. It must be emphasized that the RTC and CA have determined that Maningas truly intended for the actual Rosaria to be the payee of the checks. ... Thus, the subject checks in the instant case remain to be order instruments. Indorsement is necessary for their valid negotiation. Liability therefore validly attaches to Real Bank. ... The Court finds that the RTC erred in ordering the production of the impostor's bank records [under RA 1405] because Maningas is seeking to recover the mere money equivalent of the checks erroneously paid by the banks, and not the money itself that is already long gone in the hands of the impostor. ... The RTC did not err in allowing the admission of additional evidence not included in the pre-trial order [due to Real Bank's failure to raise timely objections/good cause]. The liabilities of the banks as already determined will not be affected.","The petition is DENIED. Real Bank is liable to return the amount of the checks to Maningas. The November 29, 2013 Decision and March 14, 2014 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV. No. 99817 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION in that legal interest on the amount due is imposed as follows: (a) twelve percent (12%) per annum from the filing of the complaint on February 10, 2009 until June 30, 2013; (b) six percent (6%) per annum from July 1, 2013 until finality of the Decision; and, (c) the total amount of the foregoing shall, in turn, earn interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum, from finality of the Decision until full payment."

PEREZ, ACCUSED, RONALD N. RICKETTS AND GLENN S. PEREZ, ACCUSED-APPELLANTS.","Ricketts was the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Optical Media Board (OMB), while Perez was the Computer Operator in said Board. The other accused were Valenzuela (Executive Director), Mangubat (Head of EID), and Arnaldo (Investigation Agent I). An Information for violation of Section 3(e) of RA No. 3019 was filed against them, alleging that on May 27, 2010, they conspired to give unwarranted benefit, advantage or preference to Sky High Marketing Corporation by allowing and causing the release and reloading into the corporation's vehicle the pirated Digital Video Discs (DVDs) and Video Compact Discs (VCDs) that were confiscated from the establishment in the afternoon of the same day, which compromised the pieces of evidence. On May 27, 2010, Perez, Arnaldo, and Mangubat conducted a raid and confiscated 127 boxes and two (2) sacks of DVDs and VCDs, loading them onto an Isuzu Elf van marked ""Sky High Marketing,"" and bringing them to the OMB compound. At around 10:00 p.m. that same day, the guard-on-duty, Pedro Gazzingan, found Perez re-loading 121 boxes of the seized items back onto the Elf van. When asked for a gate pass, Perez claimed ""Chairman"" Ricketts instructed him to take the items out. The guard sought guidance from Valenzuela who allegedly said, ""kung utos ni Chairman, wala tayong magagawa."" The following day, only four (4) boxes remained. Accused Arnaldo and Mangubat testified in their defense; Ricketts and Perez did not take the witness stand. Mangubat testified that Ricketts knew of the pull-out of the seized items, and allegedly told them in a meeting that the items had been transferred to a safe place. Valenzuela's demurrer to evidence was granted and the case against him dismissed.","On March 15, 2019, the Sandiganbayan Special Fourth Division rendered a Decision acquitting Arnaldo and Mangubat, but finding Ricketts and Perez guilty beyond reasonable doubt of a violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019, i.e., giving unwarranted benefit, advantage, or preference to Sky High Marketing by releasing 121 boxes of pirated optical media, and by not filing charges against Sky High Marketing, to the detriment of the government.","The appeal of Ricketts is meritorious. The Court finds that the evidence against him is mere hearsay. The prosecution failed to prove his participation in the crime beyond reasonable doubt, and failed to prove a conspiracy between Perez and Ricketts, as Gazzingan's report regarding Ricketts' alleged order was inadmissible as hearsay with respect to the truth of the statement. The appeal of Perez is without merit. Perez, a public officer, acted with manifest partiality and evident bad faith by taking out 121 boxes of seized items under custodia legis without written authorization, thereby giving Sky High Marketing an unwarranted benefit and causing prejudice to the government.","WHEREFORE, the appeal of RONALD N. RICKETTS is GRANTED, and the Decision dated March 15, 2019 of the Sandiganbayan (Special Fourth Division) in Case No. SB-15-CRM-0132 for violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019, and its Resolution dated November 15, 2019 denying reconsideration thereof, are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. Accused-appellant RONALD N. RICKETTS is ACQUITTED for failure of the prosecution to prove conspiracy and his guilt of the offense charged beyond reasonable doubt. The Hold Departure Order issued against him is LIFTED and SET ASIDE and his cash bond is RELEASED, subject to the usual accounting and auditing procedures. The Sandiganbayan's Decision finding accused-appellant GLENN S.

"G.R. No. 244206, March 16, 2022","GEROME P. GINTA-ASON, PETITIONER, VS. J.T.A. PACKAGING CORPORATION AND JON TAN ARQUILLA, RESPONDENTS.","On January 30, 2017, Gerome Ginta-Ason (petitioner) filed a complaint for illegal dismissal, non-payment of salary/wages, service incentive leave, 13th month pay, separation pay and ECOLA, with claims for moral and exemplary damages, and attorney's fees against respondents J.T.A. Packaging Corporation (JTA) and Jon Tan Arquilla (Arquilla collectively, respondents). Petitioner alleged that he was hired by JTA on December 26, 2014 as an all-around driver until his constructive dismissal on September 5, 2016. He claimed that on September 5, 2016, Arquilla, under the influence of alcohol, hit petitioner with a gun and kicked him several times, detained him and his live-in partner, Chancie Andea, and threatened to kill them. Out of fear, petitioner decided not to report to work anymore, claiming constructive dismissal because Arquilla made his continued employment impossible, unbearable, and unlikely. JTA averred that petitioner was not its employee. In support thereof, JTA submitted copies of its alpha list of employees as filed with the BIR for the years 2014-2016, payroll monthly reports and 13th month pay, reports on SSS, Philhealth, and Pag-Ibig fund contributions for 2015-2016, none of which included petitioner's name. Further, JTA claimed that Arquilla is not the owner of JTA as evidenced by its articles of incorporation.","On June 28, 2017, the Labor Arbiter (LA) rendered a Decision declaring that complainant was constructively dismissed and ordered respondents, in solidum, to pay backwages, separation pay, moral and exemplary damages, proportionate 13th month pay, accumulated service incentive leave pay, and attorney's fees. On appeal, the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) reversed and set aside the LA Decision, finding neither respondents as the true and actual employer of complainant, dismissing the complaint for lack of employer-employee relationship. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the NLRC's Resolution, holding that petitioner failed to substantiate his claim that he is an employee of JTA.","The Supreme Court ruled in the negative regarding the existence of an employer-employee relationship. Applying the 'four-fold test,' the Court found that petitioner failed to discharge his burden of proof. Petitioner presented no contract, company identification card, or clear evidence of selection and engagement. The pay slips submitted were rejected because they bore no indication of their source, showed compensation dates prior to the alleged hiring date, and lacked standard deductions (SSS, Philhealth, Pag-Ibig). The driver's itineraries presented to prove control were unsigned and contained discrepancies in the company name and address. In contrast, JTA presented voluminous documentary evidence (alpha lists, payroll reports, and remittances to government agencies covering 2014-2016) which consistently showed that petitioner was not among its employees. The Court accorded respect and finality to the factual findings of the NLRC and CA, which were supported by substantial evidence.","WHEREFORE, the instant petition is hereby DENIED. The Decision dated October 11, 2018 and Resolution dated January 24, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 154362 are AFFIRMED."
"G.R. No. 230104, March 16, 2022","BUREAU OF INTERNAL REVENUE, PETITIONER, VS. SAMUEL B. CAGANG, RESPONDENT.","On March 4, 2003, CEDCO received from the BIR a letter of authority (LOA) dated February 20, 2003, purportedly authorizing certain persons named therein to examine CEDCO's books of accounts and other accounting records. ... BIR still issued a Formal Letter of Demand (FLD) dated December 9, 2005, with attached details of the discrepancies and assessment notices of even date, demanding payment by CEDCO of the supposed deficiency taxes in the amount of P126,564,315.98 covering taxable years 2000 and 2001. ... BIR issued a Final Decision on Disputed Assessment (FDDA) dated September 28, 2007, which denied CEDCO's protest... Subsequently, on November 28, 2007, CEDCO availed of the tax amnesty under Republic Act No. (RA) 9480. ... A complaint-affidavit dated August 14, 2009 was filed against Cagang and Paredes for violation of Section 255 of the NIRC... The DOJ-NPS Task Force on Revenue Cases, through its Resolution dated March 12, 2010, resolved to dismiss the complaint against Cagang and Paredes for lack of probable cause. The Secretary of Justice initially denied the BIR's petition for review in a Resolution dated February 27, 2012, but later granted reconsideration in a Resolution dated August 13, 2013, finding probable cause for the filing of an information against Cagang and Paredes for violation of Section 255 of the NIRC. Aggrieved, Cagang filed a petition for certiorari with the CA.","In a Decision dated June 27, 2016, the CA granted Cagang's petition. It held that the Secretary of Justice acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction when it found probable cause to charge Cagang with the violation of Section 255 of the NIRC. The CA found that CEDCO was qualified to avail of the tax amnesty under RA 9480 and that Cagang cannot be held liable.","The Court finds that the tax amnesty under RA 9480 does not extend to CEDCO with respect to its existing withholding tax liabilities, as explicitly provided in the said law [Section 8(a)]. ... However, with respect to the deficiency taxes pertaining to CEDCO's income tax and VAT for taxable years for 2000 and 2001, the Court finds that CEDCO is entitled or qualified to avail of the tax amnesty considering that it had submitted the necessary documents and complied with the requirements under RA 9480, which the BIR does not dispute. ... Anent the second issue as to whether there is probable cause to charge Cagang for the violation of Section 255 of the NIRC, the Court rules in the affirmative. ... A review of the records would reveal that evidence exists that Cagang was appointed by CEDCO's Board of Directors as 'the New Corporate Secretary/Treasurer effective April 1, 1999' per Board Resolution No. 73. ... [T]here exists probable cause to charge Cagang with violation of Section 255 of the NIRC as he was, albeit for short period, the treasurer for CEDCO, to wit: The foregoing evidence shows that respondent Cagang was the treasurer of CEDCO Inc. in April 1999, and that this was only interrupted on June 26, 2000 when Glory Dela Cruz was appointed Treasurer. Under this circumstance, respondent has practically admitted the fact that he was still the Treasurer from January to June 25, 2000. Bearing in mind the above-quoted provisions of the NLRC on withholding tax, it is clear that respondent had the obligation to pay such tax obligation of CEDCO, Inc. for the first quarter of 2000 within twenty-five (25) days from the close of [the] calendar quarter.","WHEREFORE, premises considered, the petition is GRANTED. The June 27, 2016 Decision and the February 6, 2017 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 132453 are ANNULLED AND SET ASIDE. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 223595, March 16, 2022","SHERWIN T. GATCHALIAN, PETITIONER, VS. ROMEO V. URRUTIA, RESPONDENT.","On January 3, 2012, Elizabeth B. Laron (Laron), an on-the-job trainee/student working in the City Government of Valenzuela Employees Cooperative, lodged a complaint[10] against Urrutia for Sexual Harassment committed on December 22, 2011. The complaint, addressed to Gatchalian, and filed before the Women's Desk of the Human Resources and Management Office (HRMO) of the City Government of Valenzuela, was indorsed[11] by the HRMO to the Personnel Complaints and Ethics Board (PCEB) of the City of Valenzuela.[12] On January 10, 2012, Roberto Darilag (Darilag), Chairman of the PCEB, issued a memorandum[13] ordering Urrutia to submit his counter-affidavit/comment under oath. The memorandum likewise mentioned that Gatchalian had previously constituted the PCEB as the Committee on Decorum and Investigation.[14] Before Urrutia could file his counter-affidavit/comment under oath, Darilag sent a letter[15] to Laron on January 11, 2012 advising her to amend her complaint to include the full name, address and position of Urrutia, in accordance with CSC Resolution No. 01-0940, otherwise known as Administrative Discipline Rules on Sexual Harassment Cases (Rules on Sexual Harassment Cases).[16] Thus, on January 12, 2012, Laron filed an amended complaint.[17] On January 16, 2012, Urrutia filed a motion to dismiss,[18] instead of a counter-affidavit/comment under oath, questioning the constitution of the Committee on Decorum and Investigation, and its power and authority to hear the case, claiming that it did not comply with the Rules on Sexual Harassment Cases.[19] Urrutia also alleged that Laron's original complaint failed to comply with the standards set forth in the Rules on Sexual Harassment Cases for failing to state the required details of respondent.[20] On January 26, 2012, the PCEB issued Resolution No. 2012-001,[21] denying Urrutia's motion to dismiss on the following grounds: (1) Gatchalian, in organizing the PCEB as the Committee on Decorum and Investigation, acted very well within the ambit of the law; and (2) Laron, in filing her amended complaint to comply with the requirements of the law, cured it of its defects. In the end, the PCEB advised Urrutia to submit his counter-affidavit/comment under oath on the amended complaint.[22] On January 30, 2012, Urrutia filed a motion for reconsideration,[23] alleging that Resolution No. 2012-001 issued by PCEB was ""a mockery and travesty of administrative due process and utter display of injustice""[24] because the PCEB ceased to function as an impartial body. Urrutia reiterated the allegations in his motion to dismiss, adding that the amended complaint ""was a product of an afterthought,""[25] hence, failed to comply with the Rules on Sexual Harassment Cases as well.[26] On February 13, 2012, the PCEB issued an Order,[27] denying Urrutia's motion for reconsideration for lack of merit and affirming Resolution No. 2012-001. The PCEB again advised Urrutia to submit a counter-affidavit/comment under oath on the amended complaint.[28] On February 15, 2012, Gatchalian issued Executive Order No. (EO) 2012-006[29] creating the City Committee on Decorum and Investigation (CODI) on Sexual Harassment Cases of the City Government of Valenzuela, to implement the Anti-Sexual Harassment Act of 1995,[30] and the Rules on Sexual Harassment Cases.[31] The following day, the CODI adopted Resolution No. 2012-001[32] which in turn adopted the rules and procedures under the Rules on Sexual Harassment Cases, and promulgated other rules, including the division of CODI into two groups: (1) CODI-I, to conduct preliminary investigation; and (2) CODI-II, to conduct formal hearing.[33] On March 2, 2012, in Resolution No. 2012-003,[34] the CODI denied the February 24, 2012 motion to dismiss/terminate investigation of Urrutia for lack of merit. For Urrutia's continuous failure to file his counter-affidavit/comment under oath despite due notice, the CODI ruled that Urrutia waived his right to submit the same, hence, preliminary investigation was set three days from receipt of Resolution No. 2012-003.[35] Preliminary investigation was set to begin on March 9, 2012.[36] However, since the time consumed for the preliminary investigation already exceeded the 15 working days prescribed by the Rules on Sexual Harassment Cases, the members of CODI-I concurred unanimously to terminate the preliminary investigation.[37] Thus, on March 21, 2012, the Secretariat of CODI-I drafted an Investigation Report and Recommendation,[38] the dispositive portion of which reads as follows: IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the Committee on Decorum and Investigation (CODI I) acting as the fact-finding body, that based on the supporting documents submitted to it, as well as the uncontroverted testimony of the complainant, this Committee is convinced that a prima facie case exists; hence, this Committee hereby recommends to the Honorable Mayor Sherwin T. Gatchalian, the filing of FORMAL CHARGE against MR. ROMEO V. URRUTIA for Sexual Harassment classified as GRAVE OFFENSE pursuant to Rule X Section 53 A.1 of Resolution No. 01-0940. Further, this Committee also recommends that Mr. Urrutia be placed under Preventive Suspension immediately upon service of the formal charge.[39] On March 23, 2012, both a formal charge for Sexual Harassment (grave offense)[40] and order of preventive suspension[41] in Adm. Case No. CODI-2012-01 was issued by the Office of the City Mayor. Urrutia was given 72 hours within which to file his answer under oath together with his witnesses' affidavits, and other documentary evidence, with a statement whether he elects to have a formal investigation or waives the same. He was likewise preventively suspended for a period of 60 days effective March 26, 2012,[42] pursuant to the Rules on Sexual Harassment Cases. On March 26, 2012, Urrutia filed with the CODI an urgent omnibus motion[43] (a) for reconsideration; (b) to recall order of preventive suspension; and (c) to dissolve formal charge, in lieu of an answer under oath and other supplemental affidavits and documents.[44] Urrutia questioned the creation of the new CODI and alleged that since only the vice-mayor, not the mayor, has the sole power to appoint officials and employees of the sangguniang panlungsod, thus, the vice-mayor has the sole power of removal, in accordance with Republic Act No. (RA) 7160[45] or the ""Local Government Code of 1991"" and jurisprudence. The CODI denied[46] the omnibus motion filed by Urrutia. Thereupon, the formal investigation on the case ensued. Several oral and written motions were filed by Urrutia to reset or hold in abeyance the proceedings, which were all resolved by the CODI by ordering Urrutia to file the necessary position papers.[47] On May 17, 2012, while the administrative case was pending with the CODI, Urrutia filed a memorandum of appeal[48] with the CSC from the order of preventive suspension of the Office of the City Mayor dated March 23, 2012, questioning the creation and jurisdiction of the CODI.[49] Finally, on July 4, 2012, the CODI issued Resolution No. 2012-008,[50] finding Urrutia liable for Sexual Harassment, which is classified as a grave offense under the Rules on Sexual Harassment Cases and dismissing Urrutia from service.[51] On August 15, 2012, the CODI issued an Order[52] denying Urrutia's motion for reconsideration and affirming Resolution No. 2012-008.[53] Aggrieved, Urrutia filed an appeal[54] before the CSC.","On July 26, 2012, the CSC promulgated a Decision,[55] granting the appeal filed by Urrutia and finding the formal charge and order of suspension by Gatchalian null and void. The pertinent portions of the Decision read: The Commission finds the appeal meritorious. Respondent-appellant is an employee of the Sangguniang Panlungsod as Records Officer. x x x x The power of the city mayor to impose administrative disciplinary action is limited to officials and employees appointed by him/her. x x x [I]n this case, Mayor Gatchalian issued the formal charge and preventively suspended respondent-appellant Urrutia for Sexual Harassment. It must be emphasized that respondent-appellant is an employee of the Sangguniang Panlungsod, thus, he is appointed by the City Vice Mayor pursuant to Section 456 of the Local Government Code of 1991 x x x. Clearly, Mayor Gatchalian is not authorized under the law to issue a formal charge against respondent-appellant, more so to preventively suspend him, as such act obviously violate (sic) the aforementioned provision of the Local Government Code of 1991. Such act of Mayor Gatchalian clearly constituted an encroachment on the appointment power of the Valenzuela City Vice Mayor. x x x x WHEREFORE, the appeal of Romeo V. Urrutia, is hereby GRANTED. The Commission finds the formal charge and order of preventive suspension issued by Valenzuela City Mayor Sherwin T. Gatchalian NULL and VOID. Accordingly, Urrutia is immediately reinstated to his former position with payment of back salaries corresponding to the period of unlawful preventive suspension without awaiting the outcome of the case.[56] On November 26, 2012, the CSC issued Resolution No. 12-02112,[59] denying Gatchalian's Motion for Reconsideration and affirming its July 26, 2012 Decision, reinstating Urrutia to his former position with payment of back salaries. . . In its Decision[65] dated December 11, 2015, the CA ruled that the CSC did not err when it ruled that Gatchalian's formal charge and preventive suspension order issued against Urrutia were null and void. The CA found that Gatchalian, as the Mayor of Valenzuela City, had no power to issue the formal charge and the preventive suspension order.","The Court finds the petition meritorious. Gatchalian, as the former mayor of Valenzuela City, has the power to issue a formal charge and a preventive suspension order against Urrutia, an employee of the sangguniang panlungsod, for committing Sexual Harassment acts. . . Urrutia invokes the doctrine of implication in relation to Section 456(a) (2) of the Local Government Code of 1991,[70] stating that the vice-mayor's power to appoint officials and employees of the sangguniang panlungsod carries with it the power to discipline the same officials and employees, absent any contrary statutory provision. . . The exception applies to the case at bar. There is a clear contrary statutory provision expressed in Section 8(b)(1)(jj) of RA 8526[72] or the Charter of Valenzuela City. The section specifically provides that the city mayor has the duty to ensure that the city's executive officials and employees faithfully discharge their duties and functions, and cause to be instituted administrative or judicial proceedings against any city official or employee who may have committed an offense in the performance of his official duties. This provision is directly lifted from Section 455 (b)(1)(x) of the Local Government Code of 1991 which provides, to wit: Section 455. Chief Executive; Powers, Duties and Compensation. x x x x (b) For efficient, effective and economical governance, the purpose of which is the general welfare of the city and its inhabitants pursuant to Section 16 of this Code, the city mayor shall: (1) Exercise general supervision and control over all programs, projects, services, and activities of the city government and in this connection, shall: x x x x (x) Ensure that all executive officials and employees of the city faithfully discharge their duties and functions as provided by law and this Code, and cause to be instituted administrative or judicial proceedings against any official or employee of the city who may have committed an offense in the performance of his official duties; x x x x (Emphasis supplied) The law is clear and explicit. In this case, Gatchalian, as the city mayor, had the express power to discipline Urrutia, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the City Employees Cooperative, when he committed Sexual Harassment acts against Laron, in accordance with the Local Government Code and the Charter of Valenzuela City. Furthermore, Section 87 of the Local Government Code of 1991 empowers the local chief executive to impose the appropriate penalty on erring subordinate officials and employees under his or her jurisdiction. . . The Rules on Sexual Harassment Cases is categorical. The head office or agency is the entity tasked to create the CODI when none is existing or has been constituted. In this case, the head office or agency responsible for creating a CODI is the office of the city mayor, headed by the mayor himself, Gatchalian, which he did. . . In fine, the CA committed reversible error in dismissing Gatchalian's petition on the basis that the city mayor had no power to discipline Urrutia and that only the vice-mayor has the sole jurisdiction to discipline Urrutia. There is legal basis for not reinstating Urrutia to his former position since Gatchalian, through the CODI, had jurisdiction and authority to try the Sexual Harassment case against Urrutia.","WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED. The December 11, 2015 Decision and March 16, 2016 Resolution of the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the July 26, 2012 Decision of the Civil Service Commission in Case Number 120465, and the November 26, 2012 Resolution in Case Number 1202112, are hereby REVERSED. The formal charge for Sexual Harassment and order of preventive suspension by petitioner Sherwin T. Gatchalian, former City Mayor of Valenzuela City, against respondent Romeo V. Urrutia, Records Officer IV in the Council Secretariat, Sangguniang Panlungsod of Valenzuela City and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the City Government of Valenzuela City Employees Cooperative, are VALID. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 225263, March 16, 2022","U R EMPLOYED INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION AND PAMELA T. MIGUEL, PETITIONERS, VS. MIKE A. PINMILIW, MURPHY P. PACYA, SIMON M. BASTOG, AND RYAN D. AYOCHOK, RESPONDENTS.","On May 11, 2011, UREIC hired Mike A. Pinmiliw (Mike), Murphy P. Pacya, Simon M. Bastog, and Ryan D. Ayochok (Ryan); (collectively, respondents), as construction workers in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia for its principal, The W Construction (TWC). The respondents' contracts were for a duration of two years with a basic monthly salary of RM800.00. Upon the respondents' arrival in Malaysia, the broker who fetched them from the airport took their passports. They were made to live in a place with unsafe living conditions – the living and sleeping quarters were crowded, and there was poor sanitation and poor ventilation causing workers to easily get sick and spread communicable diseases. The respondents worked beyond regular hours without pay. Later, they discovered that they only had tourist visas, and that TWC was hiding them from the authorities because they did not have work permits. The respondents reported their living and working conditions to their broker, but their grievances were unheeded. Left without any other recourse, Ryan sent an e-mail to the editorial of the Baguio Midland Courier on August 14, 2011, narrating their experience and seeking assistance. In the last week of August 2011, TWC's human relations officer summoned the respondents and questioned them about the e-mail sent to the Baguio Midland Courier. On September 13, 2011, the respondents' supervisor informed them that they were terminated and being processed for repatriation. UREIC assured the respondents that they would be sent home on September 15, 2011. However, they were only repatriated sometime in November 2011. Meantime, their food supply was cut off. On December 5, 2011, the respondents filed a complaint for illegal dismissal and money claims against UREIC and Pamela Miguel, as administrators (collectively, petitioners). For their part, petitioners denied the allegations of the respondents, and countered that the respondents voluntarily resigned from their jobs, except for Ryan, who was terminated on the ground of grave misconduct after he wrote derogatory statements to the Baguio Midland Courier, an act or omission that brought disrepute to TWC. Petitioners submitted the summary of respondents' pay slips to prove that they were properly paid based on the average overtime rate of RM295.00, there were no illegal deductions, and that the respondents' wages for the last month they worked were duly paid.","On June 29, 2015, the CA dismissed the certiorari petition, to wit: WHEREFORE, premises considered, the present Petition is DENIED. Accordingly, the assailed the [sic] Resolutions dated 25 September 2012 and 27 December 2012 of the NLRC are hereby AFFIRMED in toto. The CA stressed ""that technical rules [of procedure] are invariably relaxed when it comes to proceedings before the labor tribunals."" Finally, the CA concluded that there was substantial evidence to prove that respondents were illegally dismissed.","We find the petition bereft of merit. In this case, while the respondents alleged the same set of facts and the same affidavits were submitted before the LA and the POEA, the complaints raised different causes of action. The LA complaint involved the issue of illegal dismissal and various money claims, while the POEA complaint involved administrative disciplinary liability for violation of the 2002 POEA Rules and Regulations Governing the Recruitment and Employment of Land-Based Overseas Workers. Thus, the doctrine of primary jurisdiction does not apply. Similarly, the doctrine of immutability of judgments does not apply to this case. Here, the DOLE's Order, which became final on October 25, 2013, settled the issue of whether petitioners violated the 2002 POEA Rules and Regulations Governing the Recruitment and Employment of Land-Based Overseas Workers. It did not involve the issue of respondents' illegal dismissal and money claims lodged with the LA and the NLRC and now pending before this Court. Consequently, the finality of the DOLE Order has no effect to the resolution of the present petition. Besides, the factual findings of the LA and the NLRC conform to evidence and are confirmed by the CA. Hence, they are accorded respect and finality, and are binding upon this Court. Here, the LA, the NLRC, and the CA unanimously ruled that petitioners illegally dismissed the respondents, and that there was no voluntary resignation on the part of the respondents nor just cause for Ryan's dismissal. We see no reason to deviate from these findings.","FOR THE STATED REASONS, the petition is DENIED. The Decision of the Court of Appeals dated June 29, 2015 and the Resolution dated May 18, 2016 in CA-G.R. SP No. 129221 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. The Labor Arbiter's grant of backwages, refund of placement fees and damages in favor of the respondents, and the refund of deductions from respondent Pinmiliw's salary, plus 10% attorneys fees of the total monetary award shall earn legal interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of the finality of this Decision until fully paid.

SUNXIAO XU ALIAS WILLIAM CHUA, WENXIAN HONG ALIAS ANDY HONG, AND XIUQUIN SHI ALIAS KIM SY, SUNXIAO XU ALIAS WILLIAM CHUA, ACCUSED.","By separate Informations dated April 20, 2010, Chua and Sy, together with Hong, were charged with violations of Sections 5 (Illegal Sale) and 11 (Illegal Possession) of RA 9165, the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002. Criminal Case No. 10-0400 alleged possession of one (1) black bag containing 7006.68 grams of Methamphetamine Hydrochloride (shabu), while Criminal Case No. 10-0401 alleged the sale and delivery of 496.73 grams of shabu to Poseur-Buyer SPO3 Elmer Corbe. The prosecution's evidence showed that during the buy-bust operation on April 18, 2010, at 7-Eleven, Parañaque City, Chua transacted with SPO3 Corbe, instructing Hong (front passenger) to hand over the shabu (496.73 grams) in exchange for boodle money. Upon arrest, SPO2 Alcancia recovered fourteen (14) packs of shabu (7006.68 grams) from an open black traveling bag resting on Hong's lap, while Sy (seated at the back) attempted to make a call. The marking and inventory were conducted at Camp Bagong Diwa, Taguig City, in the presence of Barangay Kagawads Padilla and Noble, not at the place of arrest, due to concerns about a follow-up operation and safety. The defense, led by Chua, Hong, and Sy, denied any involvement, claiming they were merely waiting for a cab and were subsequently arrested, tied up, and subjected to extortion by the police officers who allegedly demanded P30,000,000.00. They claimed they were framed and forced to pose for photos with the alleged illegal drugs.","Decision dated June 6, 2016 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-H.C. No. 05511 which affirmed the conviction of Sunxiao Xu alias William Chua and Wenxian Hong alias Andy Hong for violation of Sections 5 and 11 of Republic Act No. (RA) 9165, and the conviction of Xiuquin Shi alias Kim Sy for violation of Section 11 of the same law.","The Court ruled that the prosecution sufficiently established all the elements of illegal sale and illegal possession of dangerous drugs. The positive identification of Chua and Hong as sellers was upheld. All three accused, including Sy, were found to be in constructive possession of the 7006.68 grams of shabu found in Hong's car. Sy failed to refute the presumption of *animus possidendi*, as she was in her husband's car, acquiesced to the shady transaction involving P2,000,000.00 cash, and attempted to make a phone call upon arrest, indicating a guilty mind. The apprehending officers substantially complied with the chain of custody rule (Section 21, RA 9165). The deviation from conducting the inventory/marking at the place of arrest was justified by the immediate need for a follow-up operation, safety concerns in a busy, open area, and the substantial volume of seized items (7,503.41 grams). The absence of media and DOJ representatives was also justified (late hour and need to avoid early publicity). The large volume of drugs further negated the possibility of planting or tampering. The defense of denial and frame-up was unsubstantiated and self-serving.","ACCORDINGLY, the appeal and petition for review on certiorari in G.R. Nos. 228519 and 231363 are DENIED for lack of merit. The Decision dated June 6, 2016 and Resolutions dated September 21, 2016 and November 28, 2016, respectively, in CA-G.R. CR-H.C. No. 05511 are AFFIRMED. In Criminal Case No. 10-0401, SUNXIAO XU alias William Chua is found GUILTY of illegal sale of dangerous drugs in violation of Section 5 of Republic Act No. 9165 and sentenced to LIFE IMPRISONMENT and a fine of P3,000,000.00. In Criminal Case No. 10-0400, SUNXIAO XU alias William Chua is found GUILTY of illegal possession of dangerous drugs in violation of Section 11 of Republic Act No. 9165 and sentenced to LIFE IMPRISONMENT and a fine of P3,000,000.00. In the same Criminal Case No. 10-0400, XIUQUIN SHI alias Kim Sy is found GUILTY of illegal possession of dangerous drugs in violation of Section 11, Republic Act No. 9165 and sentenced to LIFE IMPRISONMENT and a fine of P3,000,000.00."
"G.R. No. 248002, March 15, 2022","SEGUNDINA HELUHANO ARANO, PETITIONER, VS. DELILAH L. PULIDO,* JOSELITO PULIDO, AND TEOFREDO PULIDO, RESPONDENTS.","Rogaciana Roca inherited a 20,000-square-meter unregistered property known as Lot No. 1040. In 1965, Rogaciana sold a 5,000-square-meter portion of Lot No. 1040 (subject property) to Alfredo Pulido via a notarized Affidavit of Quitclaim. Upon Rogaciana's death in 1988, Segundina (petitioner) inherited the remaining 4,172-square-meter portion (Lot No. 1040-Part). In 2005, Alfredo filed a forcible entry case against Segundina and Spouses Makaraya, which he won, leading to their eviction. During the relocation survey in the forcible entry case, Segundina learned about the segregation of Lot No. 1040-Part into Lot Nos. 1 and 2 (now Lot No. 9134). Thus, Segundina and Spouses Makaraya filed a Complaint for Accion Publiciana/Recovery of Possession, and Annulment of Approved Subdivision/Segregation Plan against respondents (Alfredo's children), alleging that respondents employed fraud and stealth in unlawfully taking possession of Lot Nos. 1 and 2, which Segundina inherited. They averred that Alfredo's purchased portion was only 5,000 square meters. Respondents denied the allegations, asserting that Lot Nos. 1 and 2 were within the 5,000-square-meter property purchased by their father and that their possession had ripened into an indefeasible right. The MTCC dismissed the complaint, ruling that Segundina failed to prove prior possession and that the complaint was a veiled appeal of the forcible entry case. The RTC affirmed the MTCC based on res judicata (bar by former judgment). Segundina appealed to the CA, arguing against the application of res judicata and maintaining that the 1,688-square-meter excess portion was not part of the sale.","The CA Decision dated August 31, 2018, found the petition partly meritorious only with respect to the issue on res judicata, disagreeing with the RTC that there was an identity of causes of action between forcible entry and accion publiciana. Nevertheless, the CA affirmed the RTC based on the concept of conclusiveness of judgment regarding respondents' prior possession. With regard to the 1,688-square-meter excess portion, the CA applied extraordinary acquisitive prescription in favor of respondents' actual, adverse, open, and uninterrupted possession thereof in the concept of an owner from 1965 until 2005, or for more than 40 years, the land being unregistered. The CA also applied Article 1542 of the Civil Code, noting that the lot was sold for a lump sum with defined boundaries. The CA denied the Petition for Review, affirming the RTC Decision but not on the ground of res judicata, but for petitioner's failure to show a superior right over the respondents on the possession of the subject property. The CA Resolution dated May 24, 2019, denied Segundina's Motion for Reconsideration.","The Supreme Court found no cogent reason to depart from the findings and conclusions of the MTCC, as affirmed by the RTC and the CA, that respondents have a better right of possession over the 1,688 square meters in excess of the 5,000-square-meter portion of Lot No. 1040. Although the conclusiveness of judgment only applied to the 5,000-square-meter portion, Segundina still failed to establish a better right of possession over the excess area of 1,688 square meters, having failed to adduce sufficient evidence of her prior possession. The evidence (including Alfredo's admission and the relocation survey) bolstered respondents' prior possession of the total occupied area (up to 7,200 sqm/6,788 sqm) since 1965. The Court agreed with the CA that the excess portion was covered by the sale since the property was sold for a lump sum with boundaries (Article 1542). Furthermore, even assuming the 1,688-square-meter portion was not part of the sale (being unregistered land), Segundina's inaction for more than 40 years (1965 until 2005) already barred the instant action for its recovery through extraordinary acquisitive prescription. This determination of possession was provisional, for the purpose of resolving the accion publiciana.","WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED. The Decision dated August 31, 2018 and the Resolution dated May 24, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 07174-MIN are hereby AFFIRMED."

The Amended Information reads as follows: ""That on or about August 30, 2005, in Filinvest II, Quezon City and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above named accused Crispin Araneta y Pelaez, Annabelle Oledan y Araneta, Benjamin Oledan y Erlandez, Godofredo Navanes y Lorezo, Lynfer Bicodo y Baylon, Rogelio Caloring, Rey Alada, PO1 Jose Lonmar Zapatos y Fiel, an active member of the Philippine National Police-Special Action Force (PNP-SAF), PO1 Antonio Castillo y Domingo, likewise (sic) an active member of the Philippine National Police-Aviation Security Group (PNP-ASG), and a certain ""Henry"" conspiring, confederating and mutually helping one another, with the use of firearms, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously kidnapped Vinz Sermania y de la Cruz, (11 years old), Klevwelt Sermonia y dela Cruz (11 years old), Genritz Sermonia y de la Cruz (9 years old) and Eulalia Cuevas y Madara and thereafter demanded ransom money in exchange for the release of the four kidnapped victims to the damage and prejudice of the victims who were rescued by the parents of the three children.” The RTC found all of the accused, except for Navanes (who died), guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the offense charged in the Information and sentenced them to suffer imprisonment with the duration of reclusion perpetua. The CA affirmed the conviction of accused-appellant, Benjamin, and PO1 Zapatos, but modified the ruling of the RTC as to the civil aspect of the case, ordering them to pay solidarily the victims P100,000.00 each as civil indemnity, P100,000.00 each as moral damages; and P100,000.00 each as exemplary damages. Accused-appellant Rogelio Caloring filed an appeal before the Court. Pending disposition of the case, the Court received notice that accused-appellant died on March 10, 2021.","The Court resolves to dismiss the case against accused-appellant considering his death during the pendency of his appeal. Applying paragraph 1, Article 89 of the RPC, his death pending the final disposition of his appeal extinguishes his criminal liability. Accused-appellant's civil liability arising from his criminal liability is also extinguished for the same reason that he died pending appeal. The Court also found that the conviction of co-accused Rey Alada must be overturned because he was never arraigned, rendering his conviction void.","Accused-appellant's death pending appeal extinguished his criminal liability as well as civil liability arising from the criminal liability. The Court ruled in People v. Bayotas: 1. Death of the accused pending appeal of his conviction extinguishes his criminal liability as well as the civil liability based solely thereon. As opined by Justice Regalado, in this regard, ""the death of the accused prior to final judgment terminates his criminal liability and only the civil liability directly arising from and based solely on the offense committed, i.e., civil liability ex delicto in senso strictiore."" Nevertheless, applying Section 11(a), Rule 122 of the Rules of Court, the Court finds it appropriate to overturn the conviction of Alada by the RTC considering that there is nothing in the records to show that he was arraigned. Here, Alada was not arraigned. Thus, his conviction by the RTC is void.","WHEREFORE, the Decision dated June 7, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-GR CR-HC No. 06209 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION as follows: (1) Criminal Case No. Q-05-136632 before Branch 225, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Quezon City is DISMISSED as against accused-appellant Rogelio Caloring on account of his death on March 10, 2021; and (2) the finding of guilt against accused Rey Alada is VACATED without prejudice to his prosecution upon his arrest. SO ORDERED."
"A.M. No. RTJ-09-2183 [Formerly OCA IPI No. 05-2346-RTJ], March 15, 2022","CONCERNED LAWYERS OF BULACAN, COMPLAINANTS, VS. PRESIDING JUDGE VICTORIA VILLALON-PORNILLOS, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, BRANCH 10, MALOLOS CITY, BULACAN, RESPONDENT.","Before the Court is a Petition for Judicial Clemency dated October 5, 2020 filed by Victoria Villalon-Pornillos (respondent), former Presiding Judge of Branch 10, Regional Trial Court, Malolos City, Bulacan. In Concerned Lawyers of Bulacan v. Judge Villalon-Pornillos, the Court dismissed respondent from the service for Gross Misconduct, i.e., borrowing money from a lawyer in a case pending before her court, aggravated by undue delay in rendering decisions or orders, and violation of Supreme Court rules, directives, and circulars. The administrative case arose from an anonymous administrative complaint dated August 31, 2005. The OCA confirmed that respondent obtained loans from court personnel and lawyers, including P5,000.00 from one lawyer who maintained a law office in Malolos City. On July 7, 2009, the Court dismissed her from service. Seven years later, she filed a petition for absolute pardon, which the Court denied on February 14, 2017, for failure to adduce proof of remorse and reformation, noting her attitude of impenitence. On October 6, 2020, respondent filed the subject petition for judicial clemency captioned as 'Petition for Judicial Clemency with Prayer for the Reopening of the Administrative Case Against Her for the Reception of Improperly Excluded Evidence.' She maintains that she was illegally dismissed from the service; thus, she seeks the review of the Court's Decision dated July 7, 2009 and prays for the reopening of the subject administrative case and reception of 'improperly excluded evidence.' Respondent insists that her dismissal from service is null and void for violating her constitutional right to due process.",The Court denies the petition.,"As similarly underscored by the Court in the Resolution dated February 14, 2017, which denied respondent's previous petition for judicial clemency, respondent still fails to exhibit remorse for her past misdeeds. In the subject petition, respondent insists that she was summarily dismissed and even characterizes the Court's Decision dated July 7, 2009, which dismissed her from the service, as null and void on the grounds that she was not given the opportunity to be heard, denied the right to a fair trial, and denied the right to cross-examine the complainants. In In Re: Ong, the Court underscored that clemency should be preceded by an apology, which must likewise be 'preceded by a full and unconditional acceptance of the wrong committed and the justness of the penalty imposed.' To deserve judicial clemency, evidence of remorse and potential must be shown. In fine, respondent's lack of remorse and persistent demonstration of impenitence, self-righteousness, and even, vindictiveness, renders her undeserving of judicial clemency.","WHEREFORE, the petition for judicial clemency is DENIED. SO ORDERED."

AGCAOILI, JR., RESPONDENTS.","In their Complaint dated 10 July 2013 docketed as CBD Case No. 13-3900 before the Commission on Bar Discipline (CBD) of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP ), Fortunato C. Dionisio, Jr. (Fortunato) and Franklin C. Dionisio (Franklin; collectively, complainants) avowed that they founded a partnership named FCD Pawnshop and Merchandising Company (now known as FCDionisio General Merchandising Company) together with their sister, Felicitas Dionisio-Juguilon (Felicitas) and their departed mother, Adelaida C. Dionisio (Adelaida). A parcel of land covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. (168302) S-3664 was then registered under the name of the said partnership. Upon the expiry of its term, complainants entrusted the liquidation and winding up of the partnership's affairs to Atty. Rowena S. Dionisio (Rowena), Franklin's daughter-in-law. At the interstice, Atty. Padernal notarized on 12 February 2010 a Real Estate Mortgage executed by FCDionisio General Merchandising Company and Union Bank of the Philippines (Union Bank) wherein the aforementioned realty was proffered as security for a loan taken out by Sunyang Mining Corporation in the amount of P20,000,000.00. Concomitantly, Atty. Agcaoili, Jr. notarized a Partner's Certificate on even date, authorizing the said mortgage. Much to the astoundment of complainants, they later discovered that the subject lot was foreclosed and sold at public auction with Union Bank emerging as the winning bidder. Contrary to what appeared in both the Real Estate Mortgage and the Partner's Certificate, complainants maintained that they, together with Felicitas, did not personally appear on 12 February 2010 before respondents. Significantly, on the said date, Felicitas was away from the Philippines based on her travel records obtained from the Bureau of Immigration. Complainants also posited that the presentation of community tax certificates, as indicated in the subject documents, should not have passed muster in determining whether they had indeed personally appeared before respondents together with their sister Felicitas. For his part, Atty. Padernal admitted having notarized the Real Estate Mortgage between FCDionisio General Merchandising Company and Union Bank. Still and all, he asserted that he was introduced to complainants and their sister Felicitas by Eduardo V. Enriquez III and Michelle Y. Fulgencio who were from the Business Line Department of Union Bank. Complainants and their sister Felicitas showed their respective identification cards before signing the Real Estate Mortgage in his presence and one Reziel Bo Simo, among others, namely: Franklin's Senior Citizen ID, Fortunato's SSS ID, and Felicitas' Postal ID. Upon the other hand, Atty. Agcaoili, Jr. neither filed his verified Answer and Position Paper nor attended the mandatory conference which was scheduled on 27 February 2014.","After a perspicacious evaluation of the records, this Court affirms respondents' liability for their parallel transgressions of the CPR and the Notarial Rules. The Court found that respondents irrefragably relied on Community Tax Certificate Nos. 28611794, 28611795 and 28611796 when they notarized the documents, which is not competent evidence of identity under the Notarial Rules.

DANNY TAGLUCOP Y HERMOSADA, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","In two separate Informations both dated July 4, 2016, accused-appellant was charged with violation of Secs. 5 and 11, Art. II of R.A. No. 9165. The accusatory portions of which read: Criminal Case No. 21117 That on or about the 2nd day of July 2016, at 4:30 o'clock in the afternoon, more or less, at Sitio Tuhog, Purok-7, Brgy.

CONTRARY TO LAW. Criminal Case No. 21118 That on or about the 2nd day of July 2016, at 4:30 o'clock in the afternoon, more or less, at Sitio Tuhog, Purok-7, Brgy. Cahayagan, Carmen, Agusan del Norte, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named [accused,] did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have in his possession, custody and control[,] two (2) pieces heat[-]sealed transparent plastic sachet, marked as ""JCG 2"" and ""JCG 3"" containing Methamphetamine Hydrochloride totally weighing 0.1288 [gram], commonly known as ""shabu,"" a dangerous drug, without any authority of [the] law therefor. CONTRARY TO LAW. During arraignment, accused-appellant pleaded ""not guilty"" to the charges. Trial ensued thereafter. Evidence for the Prosecution On June 1, 2016, the Carmen Municipal Police Station received information that accused-appellant, a resident of Sitio Tuhog, Purok 7, Barangay Cahayagan, Carmen, Agusan del Norte, was engaged in the rampant selling of prohibited drugs. The police officers in the said station were then tasked to conduct surveillance on accused-appellant. After their surveillance, the police officers confirmed from the community members in Sitio Tuhog that accused-appellant was indeed engaged in illegal drug trade. At around 3:30 p.m. of July 2, 2016, Police Inspector Franklin A. Lacana (P/Insp. Lacana), then Officer-in-Charge of the Carmen Municipal Police Station, planned a buy-bust operation against accused-appellant. The operation was coordinated with the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency. Senior Police Officer II Jay C. Gilbuena (SPO2 Gilbuena) was designated as poseur-buyer... SPO2 Gilbuena was provided with a P200.00 bill bearing Serial Number BX023220 which he marked with his initials ""JCG."" On the same day, at around 4:00 p.m., the buy-bust team proceeded to the designated place... Thereat, the confidential informant (CI) made initial contact with accused-appellant and introduced SPO2 Gilbuena as the shabu buyer. ... SPO2 Gilbuena then handed the P200.00 buy-bust money to accused-appellant, who placed the same inside the left front pocket of his shorts. He then took a sachet of shabu from the right front pocket of his shorts and handed it to SPO2 Gilbuena. At that point, SPO2 Gilbuena took off the hood of his sweatshirt as the pre-arranged signal to the rest of the buy-bust team that the transaction was already consummated. PO1 Llones... immediately approached to arrest accused-appellant and informed him of his constitutional rights. Thereafter, Kagawads Jerlita B. Hermosada (Hermosada) and Minpo L. Villahermosa (Villahermosa), and Purok Chairman Zenaida T. Antipolda (Antipolda) arrived. ... SPO2 Gilbuena showed to the barangay officials the sachet of suspected shabu he bought from accused-appellant and marked the same with his initials ""JCG1."" Thereafter, P/Insp. Lacana instructed SPO2 Gilbuena to conduct a body search on accused-appellant. After the search, SPO2 Gilbuena recovered: 1) two heat-sealed plastic sachets containing white crystalline substance inside a matchbox; 2) a P100.00 bill; and 3) the P200.00 buy-bust money. The marking and taking of photographs were done in the presence of accused-appellant and the barangay officials. SPO2 Gilbuena marked the recovered sachets as ""JCG2"" and ""JCG3;"" the matchbox as ""JCG4,"" and the P100.00 bill as ""JCG5."" SPO2 Gilbuena also prepared the certificate of inventory and took custody of the three sachets containing the suspected shabu. According to SPO2 Gilbuena, P/Insp. Lacana decided to pull out the team from the crime scene as they could no longer wait for the arrival of Department of Justice (DOJ) representative because of the gathering crowd and it was already raining, making the place unsafe. They then immediately proceeded to their station in Carmen. The police officers then brought accused-appellant and the confiscated items to their station where a request for laboratory examination was prepared. At the police station, the DOJ representative, Noel Indonto (Indonto), and media representative, Jeffrey Cloribel (Cloribel), arrived and signed the inventory. The following morning, SPO2 Gilbuena retrieved the specimens from his locker and brought the same together with the request form for laboratory examination to the Philippine Crime Laboratory in Butuan City. ... As per Chemistry Report No. D-605-2016, the three sachets containing white crystalline substance were found to be positive for methamphetamine hydrochloride, a dangerous drug. Evidence for the Defense Accused-appellant denied having sold a sachet of shabu to SPO2 Gilbuena. He also denied having in possession two sachets of shabu on July 2, 2016. Accused-appellant alleged that at the time of the purported sale, he was singing in a videoke at the store of Cabungcal when SPO2 Gilbuena arrived with his companions. After he was done singing, SPO2 Gilbuena approached him and immediately handcuffed him. SPO2 Gilbuena also placed a sealed matchbox in accused-appellant's pocket and a P200.00 bill on the table. He rebuked SPO2 Gilbuena and pleaded, but SPO2 Gilbuena still continued to plant evidence on him.","This is an appeal from the September 4, 2018 Decision of the Court of Appeals, Cagayan de Oro City (CA) in CA-G.R.

In this case, the prosecution was able to establish all the elements of illegal sale of shabu, viz.: (1) SPO2 Gilbuena as the poseur-buyer and accused-appellant as the seller of the shabu; (2) the delivery of the corpus delicti, which is the heat-sealed plastic sachet with white crystalline substance marked with the initials ""JCG1"" and later confirmed by PCI Banogon... to be positive for methamphetamine hydrochloride or shabu, a dangerous drug; and (3) the P200.00 marked money as consideration for the sale. ... The Court finds that the procedure laid down by Sec. 21 of R.A. No. 9165, as amended, was complied with. The first and second parts of Sec. 21(1) – presence of the insulating witnesses during the inventory and taking of photographs, and the conduct thereof at the nearest police station – were satisfactorily fulfilled. ... The police officers considered that the inventory at the nearest police station would better provide effective measures to ensure the integrity of the seized drugs since a safe location makes it more probable for the inventory and photography of the seized drugs to be done properly. This is in contrast to the public place where the buy-bust operation was done, considering the gathering crowd and the rain, rendering the place unsafe. ... The prosecution was able to establish that the inventory of the seized items was done at the police station and in the presence of the required witnesses under Sec. 21: accused-appellant, elected barangay officials Hermosada, Villahermosa, and Antipolda, DOJ representative Indonto, and media representative Cloribel. ... The evidence established beyond cavil that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items were preserved. The prosecution was able to prove that, from the time of seizure and confiscation, SPO2 Gilbuena remained in possession of the drugs, until their marking and inventory, and their delivery to the crime laboratory for examination, constituting the first and second links. The confiscated drugs were received by PO1 Paltep who later turned over the same to PCI Banogon who conducted a qualitative and quantitative examination, which constituted the third link. ... The defenses of denial and frame-up have been invariably viewed by the Court with disfavor for these can easily be concocted and are common and standard defense ploys in prosecutions for violations of the Dangerous Drugs Act. ... The Court finds no reason to deviate from the ruling of the lower courts finding accused-appellant guilty of violation of Secs. 5 and 11, Art. II of R.A.

"[ A.C. No. 13163, March 15, 2022 ]","MARIA FELICISIMA GONZAGA, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. EDGARDO H. ABAD, RESPONDENT.","Maria Felisicima Gonzaga (Gonzaga) and Atty. Edgardo Abad (Atty. Abad) were colleagues in the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP). In 2008, Gonzaga mentioned to Atty. Abad her marital problems with her husband Francisco Rivera. Atty. Abad advised Gonzaga to file a petition for declaration of nullity of marriage on the ground of psychological incapacity. Thus, Gonzaga engaged Atty. Abad as counsel and the services of his wife clinical psychologist Ma. Teresita Yumul-Abad. The parties agreed to a total amount of P80,000.00 inclusive of professional and filing fees, psychological tests, and other expenses. Thereafter, Gonzaga paid Atty. Abad P12,000.00 for the psychological tests and P10,000.00 filing fees. Atty. Abad assured Gonzaga that there will be no hearings because he knew the judge who will handle the case. On February 5, 2010, Atty. Abad informed Gonzaga through text: messages that the judge granted her petition for declaration of nullity of marriage, to wit: ""May decision na. Kailangan iregster yun. Bka pwde mo sbhan ang mother mo. Need na kc byaran yun."" Atty. Abad likewise asked Gonzaga for P50,000.00 to register the decision with the local civil registrar, thus: ""Gud mrng. Nakausap ko yung tao. Ok na yung decision. Kayalang[sic] humihingi ng downpaymt para umandar ang regstratn. 50k daw. Pero kahit 25k muna sa Monday para di tyo mapending."" Gonzaga replied that she will pay upon receipt of a copy of the decision. In June 2010, Atty. Abad handed to Gonzaga a photocopy of the decision of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 261, Pasig City dated April 12, 2010 in JDRC Case No. 6952 signed by Judge Agnes Reyes-Carpio. Likewise, Atty. Abad gave Gonzaga a copy of the entry of judgment certified by Atty. Reynaldo Bautista as clerk of court. Gonzaga paid Atty. Abad P15,000.00 as partial professional fees. In October 2010, Atty. Abad explained to Gonzaga that the decision could not be recorded unless she paid the balance of the agreed P80,000.00. Yet, Gonzaga insisted that she will give the complete payment after the decision is registered. Atty. Abad then recommended to file a similar case in another province where it is easier to record a decree of nullity of marriage. However, Gonzaga got suspicious and turned down the suggestion. Afterwards, Gonzaga consulted a different lawyer who verified with the clerk of court of RTC Branch 261 that ""there is NO Petition for Declaration of Nullity of Marriage between Maria Felicisima Gonzaga-Rivera and Francisco P. Rivera with JDRC Case No. 6952 in the dockets of this court."" Gonzaga also discovered that Judge Reyes-Carpio was already promoted to the Court of Appeals in November 2009 or before the purported decision was rendered, and that Atty. Bautista who certified the supposed entry of judgment is a clerk of court of the Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC) of Pasig City, and not of the RTC Branch 261. Aggrieved, Gonzaga confronted Atty. Abad and demanded the recovery of her total payments amounting to P37,000.00. Initially, Atty. Abad refused but he returned all the money after Gonzaga filed a criminal case for estafa through falsification and an administrative complaint before the AFP. Similarly, Gonzaga instituted a disbarment complaint against Atty. Abad before the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) for gross misconduct, malpractice, and deceit when he obtained a forged court decision and used it to the prejudice of his client. Meantime, the public prosecutor dismissed the criminal complaint for lack of probable cause, while the AFP dismissed the administrative case for insufficiency of evidence. On the other hand, Atty. Abad denied the charges and claimed that he is not the author of the fake decision. Atty. Abad admitted that Gonzaga engaged him as counsel as well as the professional services of his wife. Nonetheless, Gonzaga did not like the result of the psychological tests which diagnosed her with downright incapacity to comply with essential marital obligations. Gonzaga decided not to pursue the case because it might affect her employment. As such, Atty. Abad no longer filed a petition for declaration of nullity of marriage. The IBP Commission on Bar Discipline reported that Atty. Abad authored the fake court decision which warrants the penalty of disbarment. The Commission noted that the spurious judgment granting the nullity of Gonzaga's marriage quoted in verbatim the psychological report prepared by Atty. Abad's wife. Lastly, the Commission ratiocinated that the general denial of Atty. Abad cannot prevail over Gonzaga's documentary evidence, viz.: xxx it is the considered view of this Commission that as between the blanket denial made by Respondent completely denying his participation on [sic] the existence and production of the falsified court judgment and the positive declaration made by the Complainant that the falsified documents were handed and provide by herein Respondent, Complainant's positive declaration prevails over the respondent's bare denial. x x x x First, we find no motive on the part of the complainant to charge herein Respondent of this very serious offense against her fellow officers with the rank of Captain in the Armed Forces in the Philippines; Second, the blanket denial by Respondent of the authorship of the falsified decision is belied by the contents of the falsified decision wherein the Clinical Psychological Report of his own wife, Ma. Teresita C. Yumul-Abad was substantially, if not verbatimly [sic] quoted and contained in the falsified decision itself. Third, by Respondent's admission, while Complainant was on deployment at the Golan Heights, he tried his very best to explain to Complainant that the Psychological Assessment Report pertains only to her incapacity as a wife in complying with the essential marital obligations xxx Fourth, the spurious court judgment x x x contains the substantial portion of Psychological Report xxx prepared by the Respondent's wife x x x. x x x x Seventh, the pendency of the criminal case against the Respondent x x x and the Respondent's observation on [sic] the alleged weakness of the prosecution x x x will not entirely affect the outcome of the investigation before this Commission. Similarly, the dismissal by the AFP of the charges against the Respondent based on lack of jurisdiction will neither strengthen Respondent's evidence. Eight, the return of the amount of [P]37,000 by the Respondent to the Complainant did not absolve the Respondent of his administrative liability. Neither will it erase the fact of his authorship of the spurious court judgment. x x x x Having breached the foundation of his moral character, Respondent has forfeited the privilege of his continued membership in the Integrated Bar of the Philippines and has lost his status as an officer of the Court. RECOMMENDATION WHEREFORE, premises considered, it is respectfully recommended that Respondent ATTY. EDGARDO H. ABAD be DISBARRED and his name stricken off from the Roll of Attorneys. RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED. On February 2, 2018, the IBP Board of Governors adopted the Commission's findings, thus: RESOLVED to ADOPT the findings of fact and recommendation of the Investigating Commissioner imposing the penalty of DISBARMENT upon the Respondent Atty. Edgardo H. Abad, and that his name be stricken off from the Roll of Attorneys. Atty. Abad sought reconsideration but was denied. Hence, the records of the case were transmitted to the Court.","At the outset, we clarify that a disbarment case does not involve a trial but only an investigation into the conduct of lawyers. The only issue is their fitness to continue in the practice of law. Hence, the findings have no material bearing on other judicial, quasi-judicial, or administrative actions that the parties may choose to file against each other. Specifically, a disbarment proceeding is separate and distinct from a criminal action and other administrative cases filed against a lawyer. These cases may proceed independently of each other. A conviction in the criminal case, or existence of probable cause, or guilt in quasi-judicial bodies does not necessarily mean a finding of liability in the disbarment case. In the same way, the dismissal of a criminal case, lack of probable cause, or innocence in other quasi-judicial actions does not automatically exculpate the lawyer from administrative liability. The quantum of evidence is different. Proof beyond reasonable doubt is necessary in criminal cases. Only prima facie evidence of guilt and substantial evidence is required in preliminary investigation and other quasi-judicial proceedings, respectively. In an administrative case against a lawyer, substantial evidence is necessary or the amount of relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion. More importantly, the burden of proof rests upon the complainant. The lawyer's presumption of innocence subsists absent contrary evidence. Notably, Canon 1, Rule 1.01 and Canon 7, Rule 7.03 of the Code of Professional Responsibility mandate all lawyers to possess good moral character at the time of their application for admission to the Bar, and require them to maintain such character until their retirement from the practice of law. Also, members of the bar took their oath to conduct themselves according to the best of their knowledge and discretion with all good fidelity as well to the courts as to their clients. These mandates apply especially to dealings of lawyers with their clients considering the highly fiduciary nature of their relationship. Indeed, the possession of good moral character is both a condition precedent and a continuing requirement for membership in the legal profession. These proceeds from the bounden duty of lawyers to safeguard the Bar's integrity, free from misdeeds and acts constitutive of malpractice. Their exalted positions as officers of the court demand no less than the highest degree of morality. Corollarily, any errant behavior of a lawyer, be it in his public or private activities, which tends to show a deficiency in moral character, honesty, probity, or good demeanor, is sufficient to warrant suspension or disbarment. Here, Atty. Abad fell below the standards of morality, integrity, and honesty required of a lawyer. It is undisputed that Atty. Abad misrepresented to Gonzaga that he filed a petition for nullity of marriage on the ground of psychological incapacity before the RTC. Atty. Abad even received money from Gonzaga representing the professional and filing fees as well as the expenses for psychological evaluation. Also, Atty. Abad assured that there will be no hearings and maliciously suggested that he can influence the RTC judge who will handle the case. Thereafter, Atty. Abad informed Gonzaga through text messages that the RTC judge declared void her marriage and that the decree of nullity must be recorded. The text messages were sent on February 5, 2010 or months before the purported RTC decision was rendered on April 12, 2010. This fact strongly reveals that Atty. Abad had firsthand information regarding the source of the decision. Also, it was Atty. Abad who furnished Gonzaga with a copy of the decision that starkly adopted the psychological report prepared by his wife clinical psychologist Ma. Teresita Yumul-Abad. Glaringly, Atty. Abad did not give any credible explanation regarding the similarity of the decision and the psychological report. Later, Atty. Abad recommended to file a similar case in another province where it is easier to record a decree of nullity of marriage which alerted Gonzaga to investigate the regularity of the proceedings. Upon inquiry, Gonzaga discovered that the RTC decision and its entry of judgment were spurious. The petition for nullity of marriage docketed as JDRC Case No. 6952 was non-existent. The signature of the judge was forged because she was already promoted to the Court of Appeals in November 2009 or before the supposed decision was rendered. The clerk of court who certified the purported entry of judgment was not assigned to the RTC but to the MeTC. Worse, Atty. Abad defrauded Gonzaga into believing that he won the legal battle in her favor, and disrespected the concerned members of the judiciary by wrongfully involving their names in the fraudulent scheme, both in exchange for monetary consideration. In contrast, Atty. Abad simply offered a blanket denial that he did not fabricate any decision or its entry of judgment. Atty. Abad failed to substantiate how the spurious documents came into his possession. Absent satisfactory explanation, a person in possession or control of a falsified document and who makes use of it is presumed to be the author of the forgery. Verily, the presumption of authorship against Atty. Abad is warranted because he benefited from the use of simulated court issuances. In these circumstances, the Court concludes that Atty. Abad authored the fake decision and placed his personal interest above the integrity of the judiciary and its processes. Atty. Abad's infractions not only tarnished the noble image of the legal profession but also tainted the faith of the people in the courts, casting serious doubt as to their ability to effectively administer justice. Doubtless, Atty. Abad had a clear intent to violate the law and a patent propensity to trample upon the canons of legal ethics. In determining the imposable penalty against an erring lawyer, the purpose of disciplinary proceedings must be considered which is to protect the administration of justice by requiring that those who exercise this important function shall be competent, honorable, and reliable men in whom courts and clients may repose confidence. While the assessment of disciplinary sanction is primarily addressed to the Court's sound discretion, the penalty should neither be arbitrary or despotic nor motivated by personal animosity or prejudice. Rather, it should ever be controlled by the imperative need to scrupulously guard the purity and independence of the bar. Thus, the supreme penalty of disbarment is meted out only in clear cases of misconduct that seriously affect the standing and character of the lawyer as an officer of the court and member of the bar. The Court will not hesitate to remove an erring attorney from the esteemed brotherhood of lawyers where the evidence calls for it. Notably, we disbarred lawyers who simulated court documents and found guilty of misrepresentation and deception of their clients and the courts in Manalong v. Atty. Buendia, Reyes, Jr. v. Rivera, Gatchalian Promotions Talents Pool, Inc. v. Atty. Naldoza, Peralta v. Ramon, Billanes v. Atty. Latido, Taday v. Atty. Apoya, Madria v. Atty. Rivera Krursel v. Atty. Abion, Tan v. Diamante, and Sitaca v. Palomares, Jr. In Manalang, the Court disbarred the respondent for fabricating a decision for her client in a petition for nullity of marriage case in violation of the sworn duties under the Lawyer's Oath and the Code of Professional Responsibility. In Reyes, Jr., the Court ordered the respondent's name stricken off the Roll of Attorneys for his reprehensible acts of misrepresenting to have filed a petition for declaration of nullity of marriage and furnishing his client with a fake decision despite due receipt of professional fees. In Gatchalian Promotions, the respondent obtained from the complainant money allegedly for a ""cash bond"" in connection with an appealed case and falsified an official receipt from the Court to conceal the misappropriation of the amount entrusted to him. In Lampas-Peralta, the respondent falsified a decision of the Court of Appeals and demanded exorbitant professional fees from her clients. The respondent was even caught in an entrapment operation by the National Bureau of Investigation. In Billanes, the Court also disbarred the respondent for manufacturing a fake decision in an annulment case which caused great prejudice to his client. In Taday, we disbarred the respondent who notarized a petition for annulment of marriage without the appearance of the complainant. Thereafter, the respondent authored a fake decision to deceive the complainant that her petition was granted. The Court observed that the falsified decision is strikingly similar to the petition that the respondent drafted. The respondent then retaliated against the complainant for confronting him with the fake decision by withdrawing the petition in the court resulting in the dropping of the case from the civil docket. The Court held that the respondent ""committed unlawful, dishonest, immoral[,] and deceitful conduct, and lessened the confidence of the public in the legal system."" In Madria, the Court held that falsifying or simulating the court papers amounted to deceit, malpractice or misconduct in office, any of which was already a ground sufficient for disbarment. In that case, the respondent acknowledged authorship of the simulated court decision and certificate of finality in a case for annulment of marriage. The Court rejected the explanation of the respondent that he forged the documents only upon the persistent prodding of the complainant. In Krursel, the complainant paid substantial amounts of money to the respondent in relation to the filing of the complaint for injunction. The respondent did not issue any receipt or accounting despite demands. Instead, the respondent drafted a fake order from the Court to deceive the complainant. The Court held that the respondent made a mockery of trie judicial sytem and that her conduct degraded the administration oi justice and weakened the people's faith in the judicial system. In Tan, the respondent falsified a court order purportedly directing the submission of DNA results in order to misrepresent to his client that he still had an available remedy, when in reality, his case had long been dismissed for failure to timely file an appeal. The Court considered the acts of the respondent so reprehensible and flagrant exhibiting moral unfitness and inability to discharge his duties as a member of the bar. In Sitaca, the combination of all the circumstances produced the indubitable conclusion that it was respondent who conceptualized, planned, and implemented the falsified bail bond and release order for his son's temporary liberty. As the counsel of record for his son, the respondent knew that there was no petition or an order granting and fixing the amount of bail. Corollarily, the respondent cannot feign ignorance of The spurious documents which he presented to the clerk of court with the goal of securing his son's liberty.","In the above-cited cases, the respondents committed falsification or forgery and that they benefitted from the use of fake documents. The present case is no exception. As intimated earlier, Atty. Abad possessed a forged decision and entry of judgment. Atty. Abad made use and benefited from these simulated court documents. Circumstantial evidence exists that Atty. Abad was involved in the falsification. Lastly, Atty. Abad failed to explain his possession of the bogus court decision. In sum, Atty. Abad is guilty of gross misconduct and is unfit to continue his membership in the bar when he deceived his client and the court. The acts of Atty. Abad reveal his moral flaws that bring intolerable dishonor to the legal profession. On this point, we reiterate that lawyers are duty-bound to observe the highest degree of morality and integrity not only upon admission to the Bar but also throughout their career in order to safeguard the reputation of the legal profession. Time and again, the Court reminds the members of the bar that the practice of law is not a right but a mere privilege subject to the inherent regulatory power of the Court, thus: The practice of law is a privilege burdened with conditions. Adherence to the rigid standards of mental fitness, maintenance of the highest degree of morality and faithful compliance with the rules of the legal profession are the conditions required for remaining a member of good standing of the bar and for enjoying the privilege to practice law.","FOR THESE REASONS, Atty. Edgardo H. Abad is DISBARRED from the practice of law and his name is ORDERED STRICKEN from the Roll of Attorneys. Let a copy of this Decision be furnished to the Office of the Bar Confidant to be entered into Atty. Edgardo H. Abad's records. Copies shall likewise be furnished to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines and the Office of the Court Administrator for circulation to all courts concerned. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 252173, March 15, 2022","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. LORENZO MAYOGBA CEREZO AND EDWIN GODINEZ CASTILLO, ACCUSED, EDWIN GODINEZ CASTILLO, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","The criminal cases involve 16 out of 21 lease contracts (the lease contracts) for heavy equipment entered into by and between the Municipality of Binmaley, Pangasinan through its then mayor, Cerezo, with MTAC's Merchandising, a business owned and operated by Castillo, from 2011 to 2013, purportedly to be used for the hauling of garbage and debris in Binmaley brought about by typhoons and monsoon rains. Anita U. Urbano filed an affidavit-complaint dated November 27, 2013 with the Office of the Ombudsman against Cerezo and Castillo, among others, alleging violation of R.A. No. 9184 because the lease contracts were entered into without the benefit of public bidding. The Office of the Ombudsman filed 21 Informations (SB-15-CRM-0320 to 0340) against Cerezo and Castillo for violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019, alleging that they acted 'WITH EVIDENT BAD FAITH, MANIFEST PARTIALITY OR GROSS INEXCUSABLE NEGLIGENCE' by entering into contracts without public bidding, thereby giving unwarranted benefit, advantage or preference to Castillo. The Sandiganbayan, in its Decision dated February 27, 2020, found Cerezo and Castillo guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019 in 16 out of the 21 cases, holding that Cerezo acted with manifest partiality and gross inexcusable negligence and that he and Castillo conspired to commit the offenses charged.","The appeal is meritorious. Contrary to the ruling of the Sandiganbayan, there is reasonable doubt to hold Castillo liable for violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019. The prosecution failed to establish beyond reasonable doubt the existence of a conspiracy between Cerezo and Castillo. Likewise, the prosecution failed to establish beyond reasonable doubt that Cerezo's acts caused undue injury to the government or gave unwarranted benefits, advantage and preference to a private party, as there was no finding that Cerezo's act of entering into the lease contracts was animated by any corrupt intent, dishonest design, or any unethical interest.","The existence of conspiracy must be proven beyond reasonable doubt; the mere consent to the lease contracts does not ipso facto show that Castillo intentionally participated in the transaction with a view to the furtherance of the common criminal design and purpose. Furthermore, in order to successfully prosecute the accused under Section 3(e) of R.A. 3019 based on a violation of procurement laws, the prosecution cannot solely rely on the fact that a violation of procurement laws has been committed. The granting of unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference or the causing of undue injury to the government must be inextricably linked to the existence of fraudulent or corrupt motive on the part of the accused, which was not proven in this case. Undue injury must be specified, quantified and proven to the point of moral certainty, which the prosecution failed to do.","The appeal is GRANTED. The Decision dated February 27, 2020 issued by the Sandiganbayan in SB-15-CRM-0320 to 0329, 0333 to 0336, and 0338 to 0339 is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Accordingly, accused-appellant EDWIN GODINEZ CASTILLLO and accused LORENZO MAYOGSA CEREZO are ACQUITTED of sixteen (16) counts of violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019 or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act."

MASANGCAY, TEAM SUPERVISOR, RESPONDENTS.","The present case stems from SAO's audit of the operations of the Office of the Regional Governor, Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ORG-ARMM). In Audit Report No. 2010-01, [6] the SAO made the following observations, among others: From January 2008 to September 2009, ORG-ARMM issued checks in the aggregate amount of P1,083,502,563.35 [7] in favor of various payees. P866,512,945.54 [8] of the amount represented cash advances granted for the own operations of the ORG-ARMM. P854,748,736.38 [9] of the total cash advances were granted to three accountable officers of the ORG-ARMM, viz.: ORG-ARMM Officer Cash Advances Received Patadon, Supply Officer V, then Chief Administrative Officer/Special Disbursing Officer P744,559,272.19 Nelia N. Garde, Administrative Officer V 83,128,851.18 Tahirodin Benzar A. Ampatuan, Security Officer V, then Executive Assistant VI 27,060,613.01 Total P854,748,736.38 According to the SAO, the magnitude of cash advances of the ORG-ARMM indicated that it failed to observe the general rule that payments must be made by check, unless it is impossible and impractical to do so. [10] Furthermore, after an examination of the documents submitted to liquidate the cash advances made out to Patadon (P744,559,272.19), it found that a portion thereof pertained to successive purchases of various relief goods and office supplies from Superama. [11] Based on the foregoing findings, the COA Auditor issued ND No. ORG-12-002-MDS/LF (08 & 09) dated January 13, 2012 to disallow cash advances released to Patadon and used in relation to the alleged purchases from Superama amounting to P79,162,435.00 computed as follows: Check No. Date Amount 1572812 May 14, 2009 P50,000.00 1572938 June 8, 2009 15,000.00 1573106 July 21, 2009 15,000.00 1573210 August 19, 2009 15,000.00 1573363 September 18, 2009 15,000.00 726181* January 21, 2008 5,000,000.00 1496871* January 23, 2008 5,000,000.00 1496872* January 23, 2008 5,000,000.00 1496873* January 23, 2008 1,772,000.00 726257* February 1, 2008 5,000,000.00 1497021* February 26, 2008 5,000,000.00 726752* March 10, 2008 2,000,000.00 1497130* March 10, 2008 5,000,000.00 1497131* March 10, 2008 5,000,000.00 1497133* March 10, 2008 5,000,000.00 1497281* April 9, 2008 2,000,000.00 729520* June 2, 2008 2,676,712.00 729852* July 1, 2008 500,000.00 730170* July 23, 2008 750,000.00 1503619 November 12, 2008 250,000.00 734002* January 8, 2009 330,181.00 1572172* January 26, 2009 5,000,000.00 734239-40* January 26, 2009 3,369,874.00 1572306* February 17, 2009 5,000,000.00 1572307* February 17, 2009 2,668,578.00 734941* March 26, 2009 1,568,317.00 1572622* April 7, 2009 5,000,000.00 1572694* May 6, 2009 5,000,000.00 738268* July 28, 2009 1,166,773.00 Total P79,162,435.00 [12] ============== *23 out of 29 checks, in the aggregate amount of P78,802,435.00 (99.55%), issued above the limits set under Section 52 [13] of Republic Act No. (RA) 9184. The COA Auditor explained the disallowance and echoed the SAO's findings in its Audit Report No. 2010-01, viz.: The cash advances were granted to Mr. Patadon without specific purpose in violation of COA Circular No. 97-002. The transactions ranging from P15,000 to P5,000,000 were paid in cash in violation of COA Circular No. 97-002 limiting the payments in cash to P15,000 per transaction. As procurements reaching as high as [P]5,000,000 were paid out of cash advances, these were not subjected to public bidding in violation of the provisions of RA 9184. These were merely supported with invitation to bid/canvass which were all issued by Mr. Patadon. The transactions were supported with spurious and inadequate documents. The owner of the establishment denied transacting business with the [ORG-ARMM] during the period January 2008 to December 2009, issuing the purported invoices and receiving the corresponding payments made by the [ORG-ARMM]. The needs for relief goods were not established as there were no documents submitted to the team despite repeated request to prove the occurrence of any calamity or requisition from end-users or concerned patties. The specific areas and the number of affected families/individuals were not even indicated in the Purchase Request which were all signed by Mr. Patadon as requisitioner. There were no evidences [ sic ] that the goods which were all received by Mr. Patadon were indeed distributed to and received by the intended beneficiaries as there were no distribution lists duly acknowledged by the recipients indicating their names, addresses and signatures attached to the liquidation reports. As appearing on the Cash Invoices, the BIR purportedly authorized Superama to print the series 85001-105000 on October 11, 2006 under [A]uthority [N]o. RDO 107-913-2006. Subsequently, on September 10, 2007, the BIR purportedly issued another authority to print as many as ten (10) series of invoices, with three (3) series overlapping with those previously authorized. On August 10, 2008, another BIR authority to print was purportedly issued which also covered series previously authorized, which is very unlikely. x x x x x x x Four (4) cash invoices amounting to P11,734,835 bore serial numbers outside the supposed authorized series to be printed as appearing on the invoices themselves x x x[.] x x x x Series of cash invoices issued to the [ORG-ARMM] were not dated in sequential order such that invoices with higher numbers were issued earlier than those with lower numbers which is not normal in a legitimate business transaction x x x[.] x x x x The invoices were purportedly printed by Angelica Press as printed on the face of the invoice. The Manager of [Superama] informed the team that their establishment has not contracted Angelica Press for printing their invoices. [14] In sum, the COA observed that the cash advances contravened the law and regulations in that: (a) these were paid without any specific purpose; (b) payments out of the cash advances exceeded the P15,000.00 ceiling per transaction under COA Circular No. 97-002; [15] (c) these were used to purchase relief goods and office supplies which should have been procured via public bidding in accordance with the government procurement rules and guidelines; and (d) the documents submitted to liquidate the advances were questionable, spurious, and inadequate. The COA found the following persons liable for the disallowed amount: [16] 1) Zaldy Uy Ampatuan (Ampatuan), then Regional Governor: For failure to monitor the activities undertaken by Adham Patadon considering the amounts and frequency of cash advances drawn. As Head of ORG-ARMM, for failure to ensure that all resources of the government are managed, expended, or utilized in accordance with the law and regulations, and safeguarded against loss or wastage through illegal or improper disposition, with a view to ensuring efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the operations of government. (Sec. 2, PD 1445) 2) Patadon, Chief, Supply Division/Special Disbursing Officer: For drawing cash advances without specific purpose. For submitting spurious and inadequate liquidation documents. For signing Purchase Request as requisitioner, Invitation to Bid/Canvass as canvasser and Inspection and Acceptance Report as recipient of alleged items procured. For making payments ranging from P15,000.00 to P5,000,000.00 in cash which exceeded the P15,000.00 limitation. For procuring without the benefits of public bidding. 3) Ulama M. Acad (Acad), Chief of Staff, and Oscar A. Sampaluna (Sampaluna), Executive Secretary: For approving disbursement voucher on the granting of cash advance without liquidating previous cash advances and without specific purpose. For certifying in the Liquidation Report that the purpose of cash advance was served when there were no evidences that items were delivered as alleged procurements were supported with spurious and inadequate documents. For allowing payment in cash of transactions exceeding P15,000.00 and procurement without the benefits of public bidding. 4) Batolacongan D. Abdullah (Abdullah), Director, Finance, Budget, and Management Services: For certifying in the disbursement voucher that the supporting documents are complete and proper when there were no documents attached and the specific purpose of the cash advances was not even indicated. For certifying in the Liquidation Report that the supporting documents are complete and proper when the same were spurious and inadequate. For allowing payment in cash of transactions exceeding P15,000.00 and procurement without the benefits of public bidding. 5) Frederick C. Dedicatoria (Dedicatoria), Financial Audit Analyst III: For signing the Inspection and Acceptance Reports when there were no evidence that goods were delivered as supporting documents were spurious and inadequate. 6) Superama, being the payee. [17] These findings prompted Ampatuan, Patadon, Acad, Sampaluna, Abdullah, and Dedicatoria to appeal to the COA Director. Ruling of the COA Director In SAO Decision No. 2013-011 [18] dated September 16, 2013, Susan P. Garcia, Director IV, affirmed the disallowance. She emphasized the following: first , the ORG-ARMM granted the cash advances successively and used the proceeds to pay for transactions amounting to as much as P5,000,000.00 in violation of the COA guidelines on the utilization of cash advances. Second , all procurements were not subjected to public bidding, in violation of RA 9184. Third , the transactions were spurious and questionable considering that (a) the purchases were paid out of cash advances, not by checks, and (b) the supposed supplier, Superama, even denied having entered into these transactions with the ORG-ARMM. Fourth , the outright cash payment to a supplier of as much as P5,000,000.00 was not within the meaning of ""shopping,"" which is a valid mode of procurement under Section 52 of the rules implementing RA 9184. [19] Aggrieved, Ampatuan, Patadon, Acad, Sampaluna, Abdullah, and Dedicatoria elevated the matter to the COA Proper via a Petition for Review. [20] Ruling of the COA Proper In the assailed Decision No. 2014-244, [21] the COA Proper denied the petition for being filed out of time. [22] It observed as follows: first , the appeal before the COA Director was filed beyond the six-month appeal period under the 2009 COA Rules, although the COA Director took cognizance of the appeal and rendered her ruling; and second , after receiving a copy of the Director's adverse SAO Decision No. 2013-011 on October 4, 2013, Dedicatoria, joined by his co-petitioners, filed a Petition for Review before the COA Proper on October 22, 2014. [23] Moreover, the COA Proper found that the petition raised the same arguments as those raised on appeal to the Director. As the petitioners failed to present novel and substantive issues, the COA Proper found no reason to reverse or modify the Director's ruling. [24] The COA Proper also denied the subsequent motion for reconsideration. [25] Among those found liable for the disallowance, only Patadon, Acad, Abdullah, and Dedicatoria filed the present petition. [26]","The petition is unmeritorious. The Court finds as follows: First , petitioners were given ample opportunity to be heard on their case. Second , the audit findings are supported by sufficient and credible evidence. Third , the disallowance is proper. Fourth , petitioners and other personnel named in the subject ND are liable therefor.","Petitioners were given ample opportunity to be heard. It is settled that the essence of due process lies in the opportunity to be heard. In disallowance cases, which are in the nature of administrative proceedings, ""one is heard when he is accorded a fair and reasonable opportunity to explain his case or is given the chance to have the ruling complained of reconsidered."" [36] Procedural due process requirements in disallowance cases are satisfied when the person held liable for a disallowance: (a) is notified of the auditor's conclusions, recommendations or dispositions, and the applicable laws, regulations, jurisprudence, and the generally accepted accounting arid auditing principles upon which the audit findings were based; [37] and (b) interposes an appeal therefrom, as allowed under the law [38] and the COA Rules. [39] According to petitioners, they were deprived of an opportunity to rebut the charges against them, particularly when they were not allowed to file a comment on the audit report and confront the COA's witnesses prior to the issuance of the ND. These accusations do not amount to due process violations in disallowance cases. First , the COA is not mandated to conduct a trial to hear a party's claims, defenses, and arguments in disallowance cases. Parties cannot compel the COA to conduct formal hearings for the specific purpose of receiving oral testimonies and cross-examination of witnesses. Second , petitioners offer no proof that the COA deliberately prevented them from responding to the findings in the audit report. Their argument is inconsistent with the following undisputed facts: (a) the complete audit findings were communicated to petitioners through SAO Audit Report No. 2010-01, and petitioners admitted that they were able to submit documents to rebut the allegations in the report, [40] and (b) the audit findings and petitioners' corresponding liability were reiterated in ND No. ORG-12-002-MDS/LF (08 & 09), and petitioners received their individual copies of the NDs. [41] Third , they appealed the ND to the COA Director. [42] Additionally, they sought a review of the COA Director's adverse decision before the COA Proper. [43] The Court finds that petitioners' appeal to the COA Director and petition for review before the COA Proper were adequate opportunities to set up their defense. Parenthetically, the COA already found that their appeal was filed out of time. That the COA Director nevertheless entertained it and ruled on the merits of the case [44] only underscores that the petitioners were accorded their right to be heard. The COA's findings are supported by sufficient and credible evidence. Petitioners allege that the audit findings were not supported by sufficient and credible evidence [45] and were arrived at without due consideration of their defenses. [46] The accusations are misplaced. First , petitioners' bare allegations, absent clear and convincing proof therefor, cannot impeach the presumption that COA audit reports/findings are issued as a result of the regular performance of COA's duties : that these were prepared in line with the reporting standards set forth in Presidential Decree No. (PD) 1445, otherwise known as the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines, founded on sufficient evidence , and duly communicated to the concerned officials. [47] Second , that the COA found petitioners' explanations unmeritorious did not diminish the credibility of the findings in the audit report which were reproduced in the ND. Verily, the COA Auditor is duty-bound to obtain sufficient evidence in support of his findings and conclusions. Conversely, he or she cannot be compelled to rule favorably on all defenses raised by officials made .to answer in the course of an audit. The auditor was vested with sufficient discretion to weigh all the evidence before him or her and issue an ND after finding that the officials responsible for government funds have failed to settle their account. [48] Third , contrary to petitioners' stance, the audit findings are supported by sufficient evidence, viz .: (a) the SAO Audit Report No. 2010-01 provided a detailed explanation of the audit findings in relation to the cash advances subject of the present controversy. The SAO stated the factual bases of its findings ( e.g. , examination of ORG-ARMM's general ledger, checks disbursement journal, and other supporting documents and records such as bank statements, disbursement vouchers, cash advance liquidation reports, etc.) and cited the law and regulations breached; and (b) In ND No. ORG-12-002-MDS/LF (08 & 09), the COA reiterated those audit findings and identified with particularity the check number, date, and amount of each item of cash advance being disallowed. At this juncture, it is clear that petitioners failed to establish any grave abuse of discretion on the part of the COA. The settled rule is that the Court shall not brush aside the COA's findings and ruling when there is no proof that it gravely abused its discretion or acted without or in excess of its jurisdiction. [49] Be that as it may, the Court finds the disallowance to be in accord with the law and prevailing jurisprudence. The disallowance was proper. a) ORG-ARMM's purchases of relief goods and office supplies violated prevailing government procurement law, rules, and regulations. The general rule requires government agencies and instrumentalities to procure all goods and services only through competitive bidding. [50] Verily, by exception, a government agency or instrumentality may resort to Shopping —an alternative mode of procurement that allows the purchase of goods directly from suppliers of known qualification. [51] However, the Court agrees with the COA that the subject purchases did not meet the requirements set forth under RA 9184 and its implementing rules, viz.: SECTION 52. Shopping . — Shopping may be resorted to under any of the following instances: (a) When there is an unforeseen contingency requiring immediate purchase: Provided, however , That the amount shall not exceed Fifty thousand pesos (P50,000); or (b) Procurement of ordinary or regular office supplies and equipment not available in the Procurement Service involving an amount not exceeding Two hundred fifty thousand pesos (P250,000): Provided, however , That the Procurement does not result in Splitting of Contracts: Provided, further , That at least three (3) price quotations from bona fide suppliers shall be obtained. The above amounts shall be subject to a periodic review by the GPPB. For this purpose, the GPPB shall be authorized to increase or decrease the said amount in order to reflect changes in economic conditions and for other justifiable reasons. Stated differently, Shopping is justified only upon the concurrence of four requisites. First , the items subject of the procurement are readily available off-the-shelf goods or ordinary/regular equipment. [52] Second , the items are procured in relation to one of these instances: (a) there is an unforeseen contingency requiring immediate purchase (first instance), or (b) the ordinary or regular office supplies and equipment are not available in the Procurement Service (second instance). Third, the amount of procurement does not exceed P50,000.00 or P250,000.00 , in the case of the first and second instances, respectively. Fourth , three price quotations are obtained from bona fide suppliers, in the case of the second instance. ORG-ARMM's glaring violation lies in the excessive amounts of its acquisitions. As noted earlier, 23 out of 29 items/checks enumerated in ND No. ORG-12-002-MDS/LF (08 & 09) were issued with amounts ranging from P330,181.00 to P5,000,000.00. It is clear that these disbursements, in the aggregate value of P78,802,435:00, [53] went beyond the limits set for Shopping transactions. b) The subject cash advances violated the audit code and COA regulations. The fundamental policies governing cash advances in government agencies and instrumentalities are embodied in PD 1445 and COA Circular No. 97-002, [54] viz.: • PD 1445 SECTION 89. Limitations on cash advance . — No cash advance shall be given unless for a legally authorized specific purpose. A cash advance shall be reported on and liquidated as soon as the purpose for which it was given has been served. No additional cash advance shall be allowed to any official or employee unless the previous cash advance given to him is first settled or a proper accounting thereof is made. (Italics supplied) • COA Circular No. 97-002 3. DEFINITIONS AND SCOPE Cash Advance shall be of two types, namely, the regular cash advances, and the special cash advances. 3.1 Regular cash advances are those granted to cashiers, disbursing officers, paymasters, and/or property/supply officers for any of the following purposes: 3.1.1 Salaries and Wages 3.1.2 Commutable allowances 3.1.3 Honoraria and other similar payments to officials and employees 3.1.4 Petty operating expenses consisting of small payments for maintenance and operating expenses which cannot be paid conveniently by check or are required to be paid immediately. 3.2 Special cash advances are those granted on the explicit authority of the Head of the Agency only to duly designated disbursing officers or employees for other legally authorized purposes, as follows: 3.2.1 Current operating expenditures of the agency field office or of the activity of the agency undertaken in the field when it is impractical to pay the same by check, such as - - Salaries, Wages and Allowances - Maintenance and other operating expenses 3.2.2 Travel expenditures, including transportation fare, travel allowance, hotel room/lodging expenses and other expenses incurred by officials and employees in connection with official travel. 4. GRANTING AND UTILIZATION OF CASH ADVANCES x x x x 4.3 Petty Operating Expenses 4.3.1 The cash advance shall be sufficient for the recurring expenses of the agency for one month. The AO may request replenishment of the cash advance when the disbursements reach at least 75%, or as the need requires, by submitting a replenishment voucher with all supporting documents duly summarized in a report of disbursements. 4.3.2 The cash advance shall not be used for payment or regular expenses, such as rentals, subscriptions, light and water and the like. Payments out of the cash advance shall be allowed only for amounts not exceeding P15,000.00 for each transaction, except when a higher amount is allowed by law and/or specific authority by the Commission on Audit. Splitting of transactions to avoid exceeding the ceiling shall not be allowed. 4.3.3 The cash advance shall be supported by the following documents: - Copy of authority by the Agency Head (attachment to initial cash advance) - Copy of approved application for bond (attachment to initial cash advance) - Estimate of expenses. (Italics supplied) The Local Government Code also stresses compliance with the above-cited COA rules, viz.: SECTION 339. Cash Advances . — No cash advance shall be granted to any local official or employee, elective or appointive, unless made in accordance with the rules and regulations as the COA may prescribe. The Court agrees with the COA that the subject cash advances violated the above-cited law and regulations, viz.: First , the grant of cash advances is limited to the purposes specifically identified and authorized in the rules, to wit: (a) for the payment of salaries and wages, commutable allowances, honoraria to officials and employees, and petty operating expenses (regular cash advances); and (b) for the payment of field/activity current operating expenses and official travel-related expenses (special cash advances). On the other hand, the purpose of the subject cash advances—which were granted to Patadon for the payment of relief goods and office supplies purchased from Superama—does not fall squarely among any of those authorized under the COA regulation. Even if the Court assumes that there had been regular cash advances for the payment of petty operating expenses, once again, the excessive amounts of each disbursement reveal an outright defiance of the P15,000.00 ceiling under the circular. [55] Second , the grant of additional cash advances to an official is prohibited unless he or she has duly accounted for and liquidated those granted to him or her previously. In the present controversy, there is no showing that Patadon settled any cash advance before he was granted successive cash advances thereafter. The violation is more evident in the cash advances relating to January 23, 2008, March 10, 2008, January 26, 2009, and February 17, 2009, on which ORG-ARMM issued multiple checks in Patadon's name within the same day. [56] In sum, ORG-ARMM's defiance of prevailing laws, rules, and regulations on government procurement and cash advances warrants the disallowance of the subject disbursements. Patadon, Acad, Sampaluna, Abdullah, and Dedicatoria are liable for the disallowed amount. On the one hand, public officers are presumed to have performed their duties regularly and in good faith. [57] Consequently, they shall be liable in case of a disallowance only when their participation in the transaction is attended by negligence, bad faith, or malice. [58] At the same time, each civil servant takes an oath to uphold the Constitution, obey the law, and discharge his or her official duties faithfully and to the best of his or her ability. [59] Thus, he or she is bound to know the prevailing laws and regulations, most especially those pertaining to the functions of his or her office. To recall, the following ORG-ARMM officials were charged in ND No. ORG-12-002-MDS/LF (08 & 09): (a) Ampatuan, Regional Governor, (b) Patadon, Chief, Supply Division/Special Disbursing Officer, (c) Acad, Chief of Staff, (d) Sampaluna, Executive Secretary, (e) Abdullah, Director, Finance, Budget, and Management Services, and (f) Dedicatoria, Financial Audit Analyst III. By the nature of their participation in requesting or approving/certifying cash advances, [60] and utilizing the proceeds thereof, these officials are regarded as persons accountable for local government funds . [61] Necessarily, they must be conversant [62] with and are duty-bound to observe the pertinent laws and COA regulations governing these transactions. Petitioners anchor their defense on the presumption of regularity and, at the same time, argue the audit findings' lack of credibility. However, their attempts to escape liability are unacceptable, especially when measured against the great responsibility attached to transactions involving the disbursement of public funds. [63] A closer look at the nature, frequency, and extent of the ORG-ARMM officials' infractions reveal their unjustified and repeated disregard of even the most basic of principles embodied in RA 9184, PD 1445, and COA Circular No. 97-002. These indicate that these officers had been grossly negligent in the performance of their duties [64] and are notoriously undesirable . [65] For his part, Patadon was charged for drawing cash advances without a specific purpose, submitting spurious and inadequate documents during liquidation, and knowingly disbursing amounts that were in excess of the established limits. Certainly, the subject transactions' blatant infirmities should have been readily apparent to Patadon, the Chief, Supply Division/Special Disbursing Officer , whose integral function relates to cash disbursements. However, all of the disallowed disbursements in this case were-requested/processed by and paid out to Patadon , the proceeds therefrom he used to procure goods without the benefit of public bidding. Patadon is regarded as a custodian of public funds and yet he failed 'to ensure that such funds are safely guarded against loss or damage; that they are expended, utilized, disposed of or transferred in accordance with law and regulations, and on the basis of prescribed documents and necessary records.' [66] On the other hand, Acad, Sampaluna, Abdullah , and Dedicatoria were held liable for their participation as approving/certifying officers. Verily, an approving/certifying official's signature on a document, by itself, does not give rise to liability in case the disbursement is eventually adjudged as unlawful. [67] For instance, the head of an agency/office is allowed to rely to a reasonable extent on the good faith of his or her subordinates. [68] In particular, he or she may presume that those who have certified/signed off on the transaction ahead of him and/or those who have prepared and/or verified the supporting documents have performed their duties regularly. [69] Significantly, this defense is available only to a head of an agency/office . In any case, that a superior officer/higher approving authority may be permitted on occasion to so rely on his subordinates cannot be construed to mean that his role in the disbursement approval process is perfunctory or a mere formality. The basic rule is that all approving officers must discharge their duties pertinent to the disbursement process with the diligence of a good father of a family. [70] In connection with the disbursement of government funds, all those exercising authority shall share fiscal responsibility over the financial affairs, transactions, and operations of the government agency, [71] which includes ensuring that all disbursements are legal and in conformity with laws, rules, and regulations. [72] Thus, before any approving official affixes his signature on the document, he is expected to perform basic verification procedures to inquire into the legality and regularity of the transaction, independent from those done by other lower-ranking approving officials. For instance, if it shall become apparent on the face of the document that the transaction violates prevailing laws and regulations or that the document under review lacks key supporting documents, a prudent official is expected to withhold his approval. To be sure, he cannot rely completely on existing approvals or certifications. Otherwise, his function would be reduced to mere rubber stamping. In the Court's view, it is reasonable to expect the approving officers in the present case to have at least taken note of primary information such as the transaction date, payee name, transaction amount, and prior signatures/certifications, all of which are evident from the face of the document . This procedure does not require technical expertise or a detailed examination of supporting attachments. That the cash advances were paid out to the same person, simultaneously, and excessively were apparent from the face of the documents. Had they been prudent in the discharge of their role in the disbursement process, these information should have already stirred suspicion that the transactions have violated the above-discussed rules on cash advances, which, to repeat, they are also expected to know. Based on these considerations, the Court is certain that herein petitioners in the present case cannot benefit from the presumption of regularity and must answer for the disallowance. Their liability shall be solidary , as prescribed by the Administrative Code of 1987 [73] and the Rules and Regulations on Settlement of Accounts. [74] To be clear, this pronouncement covers the liabilities of Patadon, Acad, Sampaluna, Abdullah, and Dedicatoria only. The liability of the Regional Governor, who availed himself of other remedies separate from the above-enumerated approving/certifying officials, is dealt with in Hon. Zaldy Uy Ampatuan v. Commission on Audit . [75] Lastly, Superama was also named as a person liable under the ND. However, the Court observes that the COA already: (a) gave weight to Superama's denial of ever transacting with ORG-ARMM to supply the goods in question, (b) acknowledged as spurious the liquidation documents submitted by Patadon, consisting of Superama official receipts and/or cash invoices, [76] and (c) regarded as fictitious ORG-ARMM's receipt of the goods and subsequent distribution. [77] To be sure, the proceeds from the cash advances were all released to Patadon as the payee in all of the checks. Inasmuch as there is no sufficient evidence that it benefited from the proceeds or participated in the illegal disbursements, it is only proper to absolve Superama formally from liability.","WHEREFORE , the instant petition is DISMISSED . The Commission on Audit Decision No. 2014-244 dated September 11, 2014 and the Resolution dated March 9, 2015 in COA CP Case No. 2013-394 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION . Superama is absolved from liability due to lack of sufficient evidence as to its participation in the disallowed transactions. SO ORDERED."

Tayengco, Administratrix"" [7] and (2) Special Proceeding No. 2809 entitled ""In the Matter of the Petition to Approve the Will of the Deceased Jose C. Tayengco, Elizabeth S. Tayengco, Executrix.""[8] The Law Office represented the Heirs of Tayengco in the cases until its withdrawal as counsel on October 17, 1997.[9] On April 30, 1999, the Law Office, through Atty. Arturo M. Alinio (Atty. Alinio), filed in the RTC a motion to: (1) fix the attorney's fees, and (2) direct the administratrix/executrix to pay the attorney's fees. The Law Office claimed that while it had no written contract with respect to the attorney's fees, it is entitled thereto on a quantum meruit basis. Thus, on March 30, 1998 and July 14, 1998, Atty. Alinio and Atty. Tirol (petitioners) sent a billing to Elizabeth S. Tayengco (Elizabeth), the administratrix/executrix of the estate, for its attorney's fees in the amount of P13,463,500.00, equivalent to 7% of the fair market value of the estates. However, Elizabeth ignored the billing. Atty. Tayengco, one of the heirs, filed a Formal Entry of Appearance with Motions: To Set Aside Order to Hear Motion to Fix Attorney's Fees With Prayer to Deny/Dismiss the Same Instead and To Quash Subpoena Duces Tecum Ad Testificandum Addressed to Elizabeth S. Tayengco and Marilyn Tardagueda. Atty. Tayengco argued that the motion filed by the Law Office should be denied on the ground of nonpayment of docket fees. In an Order dated August 23, 2000, the RTC dismissed the motion on the ground of lack of jurisdiction for failure of the Law Office to pay the docket fees. The latter sought reconsideration and the RTC granted it in an Order dated August 1, 2005, ruling that the motion was not in the nature of an action but a claim for attorney's fees against the estates under settlement. On June 9, 2006, the RTC reinstated its Order dated August 23, 2000 and directed the Law Office to pay the corresponding docket fees before it takes cognizance of its claim for attorney's fees. It held that the claim of the Law Office was directed against its client, the administratrix/executrix, and not against the Estates of Spouses Tayengco. Petitioners went to the CA on a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court. The CA denied the Rule 65 petition in the assailed Decision dated November 29, 2012. While the CA agreed with petitioners that their motion to fix attorney's fees was filed against the estates involved, and thus, they need not pay separate docket fees for it, the CA, however, declared that the error on the part of the RTC cannot be corrected by way of the petition for certiorari.","Before the Court is a Petition [1] for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assailing the Decision [2] dated November 29, 2012 and the Resolution [3] dated December 6, 2013 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 03098. The assailed Decision upheld the Orders dated June 9, 2006 [4] and May 16, 2007 [5] of Branch 29, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Iloilo City in Special Proceeding Nos. 2186 and 2809 that directed Tirol & Tirol Law Office (Law Office) to pay the docket fees for its Motion (To Fix Attorney's Fees and To Direct Administratrix/Executrix to Pay It) [6] filed in the cases... The CA denied the Rule 65 petition in the assailed Decision [31] dated November 29, 2012. While the CA agreed with petitioners that their motion to fix attorney's fees was filed against the estates involved, and thus, they need not pay separate docket fees for it, the CA, however, declared that the error on the part of the RTC cannot be corrected by way of the petition for certiorari.","Following the ruling of the Court in the case of Pascual, as reiterated in Sheker, it is clear that separate docket fees need not be paid by petitioners for their motion to fix the amount of attorney's fees. . . In Ocampo v. Rear Admiral Enriquez [58] (Ocampo), the Court held that 'there is grave abuse of discretion when an act is (1) done contrary to the Constitution, the law or jurisprudence or (2) executed whimsically, capriciously or arbitrarily, out of malice, ill will or personal bias.' Verily, the RTC adamantly relied on Lacson despite the repeated submissions of the petitioner that the Pascual case should be applied in accordance with jurisprudence. Per Ocampo, an act done contrary to the Constitution, the law, or jurisprudence constitutes grave abuse of discretion that warrants the grant of the extraordinary writ of certiorari in petitioners' favor. . . In conclusion, the Court holds that the CA committed grave abuse of discretion when it declared that the error on the part of the RTC cannot be corrected by way of a petition for certiorari. As earlier stated, an act done contrary to jurisprudence constitutes grave abuse of discretion that warrants the grant of the extraordinary writ of certiorari.","WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED.

"G.R. No. 218068, March 15, 2022","PHILIPPINE DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON AUDIT, RESPONDENT.","The controversy involving Westmont Bank (formerly, Associated Bank; now, United Overseas Bank of the Philippines) spawned from the 1st Indorsement dated August 24, 2000 issued by the PDIC Corporate Auditor. In brief, the Corporate Auditor found upon post-audit that PDIC granted financial assistance to Westmont Bank, and condoned certain portions of it, amounting to P1,656,830,000.00. The amount consists of: 1) the waived buyback agreement amounting to P1,085,000,000.00; 2) early buyback incentives in the form of discounts, amounting to P76,470,000.00; 3) deferred regular interest amounting to P461,540,000.00; 4) refund of regular interest amounting to P31,220,000.00; and 5) abolition of PDIC interest spread amounting to P2,600,000.00. The Corporate Auditor opined that these measures are tantamount to an outright release or condonation of Westmont Bank's principal obligation and accrued interests, which is prejudicial to the interests of the PDIC. On the other hand, the KMSB case is rooted from the Corporate Auditor's issuance of Notice of Suspension (NS) No. 98-10 (97) dated September 17, 1998, suspending in audit the amount of P325,000,000.00 that was charged to PDIC's Expense-Cost for the Rehabilitation of then distressed KMSB. The amount was a portion of the P1,500,000,000.00-worth of non-performing loans purchased by PDIC from KMSB as a form of financial assistance, which were later reclassified as an expense account due to being uncollectible. Upon review, the Supervising Auditor and the COA CGS Director recommended the write-off of the P325,000,000.00. However, the CGS Assistant Commissioner opined that the difficulty in collecting the non-performing loans and the high cost of collection are not sufficient bases to write off the account. The matter was elevated to the COA Proper.","WHEREFORE, foregoing premises considered, this Commission DENIES to recommend the condonation of the [financial assistance] granted by PDIC to [Westmont Bank] in the amount of [P]1,656,830,000.00 on the ground that it includes the principal loan thereof. Likewise, the request to write off the account of KMSB is DENIED since that said account does not appear to be uncollectible. Considering, however, that the account no longer exists in the books because it was subsequently taken up as an outright expense, the [Supervising Auditor] [in] PDIC is hereby directed to issue the necessary notice of disallowance.","The COA is authorized and duty-bound to issue a recommendation on the condonations and release of claims, as Section 20(1) of the Administrative Code of 1987 lodged the power to compromise claims exceeding P100,000.00 with Congress upon recommendation of the COA and the President, superseding PDIC’s prior ""exclusive"" authority. The COA correctly ruled that its recommendation was mandatory and PDIC cannot motu proprio compromise a claim or liability. The Supreme Court accorded respect and finality to the COA's factual findings: 1) the condonation of P1,656,830,000.00 granted to Westmont Bank was improper because it included a portion of the principal loan and regular/accumulated interest; and 2) the write-off of the KMSB account was denied because PDIC failed to establish that the non-performing loans were uncollectible, as they were merely difficult to collect, and PDIC failed to exert all necessary efforts. Since the disallowed condonation and write-off were implemented without Congressional approval in patent disregard of the mandatory requirements under the Administrative Code, their illegality is confirmed, warranting disallowance. The COA committed no grave abuse of discretion in holding the PDIC BOD liable for the disallowed amounts as the palpable disregard of laws and established directives amounts to gross negligence, which justifies liability.","the Petition for Certiorari is DISMISSED. Decision No. 2012-120 dated August 2, 2012 and Resolution dated March 9, 2015 of the Commission on Audit Proper, as well as Notice of Disallowance No. 15-001-AFA-98 and Notice of Disallowance No. 15-002-FA-99, both dated July 10, 2015, are AFFIRMED."
"A.M. No. 2017-07-SC, March 14, 2022 [A.C. No. 12323]","PRESIDING JUDGE SUZANNE D. COBARRUBIAS-NABAZA, METROPOLITAN TRIAL COURT, BR. 93, MARIKINA CITY, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. ALBERT N. LAVANDERO, COURT ATTORNEY IV, LEGAL OFFICE, OFFICE OF THE COURT ADMINISTRATOR, RESPONDENT.","Complainant alleged that respondent was a co-plaintiff in a BP 22 case pending before her sala. After promulgating a ruling favorable to respondent, a number of therein defendant's properties, including a Black Hyundai Accent (subject vehicle), were placed under custodia legis for levy, execution, and auction sale. Complainant then discovered that despite the absence of any public auction, respondent had taken the subject vehicle in and out of court premises on three (3) occasions without her prior knowledge and approval, as evinced by various CCTV footages which caught respondent performing such acts. This prompted complainant to write a letter dated October 12, 2016 addressed to the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA), which in turn, referred the same to the Office of Administrative Services – Supreme Court (OAS-SC) for formal investigation, docketed as A.M. No. 2017-17-SC. In defense, respondent maintained that he had the authority to take the subject vehicle, claiming that it underwent a public auction on August 19, 2016 where he was declared as the highest bidder thereof. Respondent then insisted that any perceived irregularities relating to the auction of the subject vehicle should instead be blamed on the sheriff who was negligent in his duties.","The Court adopts the findings and recommendations of the OAS-SC and the OBC, respectively, except for the penalty to be imposed in A.M. No. 2017-07-SC.
I. A.M. No. 2017-07-SC At the outset, it bears pointing out that respondent's supervening resignation during the pendency of an administrative case against him will not prevent the Court from determining his administrative liability and meting the proper penalty therefor. After a punctilious examination of the records, the Court agrees with the findings of the OAS-SC that respondent, in connivance with the sheriff, committed irregularities when he skirted various processes and procedures relating to properties in custodia legis, such as the subject vehicle. The Court found that respondent's acts cannot be officially deemed as either Grave Misconduct or Simple Misconduct since said acts were not committed in relation to his official duties as Court Attorney IV, Legal Office of the OCA, but rather as Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service. Applying Dela Rama v. De Leon, the Court determined that Rule 140 of the Revised Rules of Court would apply because its application would be less prejudicial to respondent than the 2011 RRACCS. II. A.C. No. 12323 The Court found that respondent failed to abide by the tenets of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR) when he committed the acts complained of. He failed to fulfill his solemn oath of upholding and obeying the law and its legal processes, and even misused court processes for his own personal gain. In so doing, he committed an act of falsehood and engaged in an unlawful, dishonest, and deceitful conduct, thus violating Rule 1.01, Canon 1; Rules 10.01 and 10.03, Canon 10; and Rule 12.04, Canon 12 of the CPR.","In A.M.

"A.C. No. 12443, March 14, 2022","BERNALDO E. VALDEZ, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. WINSTON B. HIPE, RESPONDENT.","Complainant alleged that he received a copy of an affidavit[2] executed by respondent in support of a counter-affidavit filed by a certain Atty. Calberito M. Caballero, in response to his complaint-affidavit. He claimed that in said affidavit, respondent stated that he notarized the Verification and Certification of Non-Forum Shopping (
Verification/Certification
) executed by Arnold Pe, Pearl Marjorie Pe, and Evaristo Pe, containing the following notarial details: ""
Doc. No. 379; Page No. 76; Book No. XXXI; Series of 2016
,"" which he might have failed to report in his Notarial Report due to inadvertence.[3] Complainant, however, pointed out, that as per the Certification[4] dated February 9, 2018 issued by the Office of the Clerk of Court of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City (OCC-RTC), the document adverted to by respondent refers to an Affidavit of Circumstances of Death,[5] not the
Verification/Certification, viz
: THIS IS TO CERTIFY that per available records on file with this office as of this date, ATTY. WINSTON B. HIPE has submitted his Notarial Reports (Book No. XXXI) covering the period April 1, 2016 to May 11, 2016. IT IS FURTHER CERTIFIED that Doc. No. 379; Book No. XXXI; Series of 2016 REFERS to an Affidavit (Circumstances of Death) executed by Helen G. Mesa notarized on April 11, 2016 and NOT the requested Verification and Certification of Non-Forum Shopping allegedly executed by Arnold Pe, Evaristo Pe and Pearl Marjorie Pe as shown in the herein attached certified true xerox copy of his Notarial Registry (loose leaf), and the said Affidavit (Circumstances of Death). [6] (Emphases supplied) Thus, he filed the administrative case against respondent for violation of the Notarial Rules. In his Comment dated June 11, 2019,[13] respondent admitted executing the affidavit, as well as notarizing the
Verification/Certification
 on April 11, 2016. He likewise acknowledged that he might have failed to include the Verification/Certification in his notarial report submitted to the OCC-RTC. However, he alleged that said failure was not made in bad faith, but was rather due to mere inadvertence and his heavy volume of work as a legal consultant of the Public Assistance and Legal Aid Office under the Office of the City Mayor of Quezon City.[14] Further, he stressed that the complaint points only to a single incident involving a document over which he had no interest nor participation, and in fact, this was the first time in his more than eighteen (18) years as notary public that he has been administratively charged.[15] Finally, he apologizes for the mistake, and promises to be more circumspect in the performance of his duties as a notary public, and thus prays for the Court's kindness and empathy,[16] especially given his advanced age.[17]","In this case, it is clear that the Verification/Certification was not included in his notarial report for the April 11, 2016 to May 11, 2016 period based on respondent's own admission, as well as on the Certification issued by the OCC-RTC. It is evident, too, that the same notarial details had been assigned to two (2) distinct documents. Given the evidentiary value accorded to notarized documents, respondent's failure to record the document in his notarial register amounts to falsely making it appear that the document was notarized when, in fact, it was not. The non-appearance of the document or instrument in the notarial records without any copy therein creates doubt whether such document or instrument was indeed notarized. It also effectively removed the credit and full faith which notarization generates on notarized documents. Considering the evidence on record, particularly, respondent's own admission of violating the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice, the principle of res ipsa loquitur finds application, making him administratively liable. Indubitably, the foregoing facts and evidence sufficiently convince the Court that respondent was remiss in his duties as a notary public. Respondent's omission caused prejudice and injury to the signatories of the Verification/Certification for purposes of filing an action before the proper court. Undeniably, this failure on the part of respondent constitutes a transgression of the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice, for which he must be held administratively liable. In this case, it is evident that respondent is found guilty of a single infraction for which no malice or bad faith was shown. Additionally, the following circumstances in respondent's case merit the Court's appreciation: (1) respondent has been serving as a notary public for more than eighteen (18) years; (2) this is the first time respondent has been found administratively liable per the available records; (3) respondent has admitted and acknowledged his infraction, and has, in fact, apologized for his violation and vows to be more circumspect in the performance of his duties as a notary public; and (4) respondent's advanced age. Taking these circumstances together and following case law, the Court is convinced to accord respondent a degree of leniency.","WHEREFORE, the Court finds respondent Atty. Winston B. Ripe (respondent) GUILTY of violating the 2004 Rules of Notarial Practice. Accordingly, he is SUSPENDED from the practice of law for a period of one (1) month, effective upon receipt of this Decision.

"G.R. No. 207887, March 14, 2022","LINO DOMILOS, PETITIONER, VS. SPOUSES JOHN AND DOROTHEA PASTOR, AND JOSEPH L. PASTOR, RESPONDENTS.","The history of this long-running case began in 1953 when Victoriano Domilos (Victoriano) acquired possession over a parcel of land along Kms. 4-5, Santo Tomas Road, Baguio City, measuring approximately 15,745 square meters (sq.m.) in size. In 1974, Sergio Nabunat (Nabunat) and his family built a shanty on the land and resided therein for three months. In February 1976, Victoriano transferred all his rights over the property to his son, petitioner Lino Domilos (Lino). A month later or in March 1976, Nabunat and his family, including his mother-in-law, Can-ay Palichang (Palichang), returned to the subject property and constructed a house thereon without Lino's consent. This prompted Lino to file a complaint for forcible entry against Nabunat with the City Court of Baguio (now Municipal Trial Court in Cities) (MTCC), Branch 4, docketed as Civil Case No. 5893. On November 17, 1977, the City Court of Baguio rendered a Decision in favor of Lino, ordering Nabunat and the members of his family to vacate the subject property and remove his house therefrom, among others. The Court of First Instance (now the RTC), Branch 4, in a Decision dated January 6, 1979, sustained the Decision of the City Court of Baguio. A Writ of Execution and Alias Writs of Execution were issued, and Nabunat's house was demolished. Several years after, on November 17, 1986, Lino and Palichang entered into a compromise agreement, dividing the property among five different parties. From the years 1987 to 1989, Lino, Nabunat and Palichang sold different portions of the property to different parties. The Nabunats sold portions of their share to Dorothea L. Pastor, one of the herein respondents; and to Joseph L. Pastor, another respondent, and Jacqueline and Johneva Pastor. On May 9, 1989, Lino sought to execute the November 17, 1977 Decision of the City Court of Baguio by filing a motion for issuance of 4th alias Writ of Execution on Special Order of Demolition and to restore physical possession of land to Lino (motion for 4th Alias Writ of Execution) against Nabunat. On May 15, 1989, Lino and Palichang executed a revocation and cancellation of compromise agreement. The following day, the City Court of Baguio granted Lino's motion for 4th Alias Writ of Execution. On May 20, 1989, the corresponding 4th Alias Writ of Execution on Special Order for Demolition of Improvement was issued resulting in the demolition of some of the properties of the spouses Pastor. Thus, on June 26, 1989, the spouses Pastor and Joseph filed a suit for annulment of Order, 4th Alias Writ of Execution, revocation of compromise agreement, recovery of possession, damages, with petition for issuance of preliminary prohibitory and mandatory injunction (annulment of order) against Lino, Palichang and Soledad Nabunat (Soledad) before the RTC, Branch 3, Baguio City, claiming ownership and possession over the disputed properties, and sought annulment of the order granting the Writ of Execution and the corresponding 4th Alias Writ of Execution. The case was docketed as Civil Case No. 1784-R.","On September 21, 2006, the RTC rendered its Decision, modified on January 22, 2007, finding in favor of the Spouses Pastor and Joseph Pastor and against Lino Domilos, Can-ay Palichang and Soledad P. Nabunat, declaring the Spouses Pastor and Joseph Pastor to have acquired lawful rights over the following properties: a. A parcel of land situated in Res. Sec. ""J"" Lot 12, bounded by Lot 13, Lot 11 and Lot 4-A, containing an area of TWO HUNDRED THIRTY-TWO (232) Square Meters, more or less; b. A parcel of land situated in Res. Sec. ""J"" of Lot 13, bounded by Lot 14, 10 and Lot 12, containing an area of TWO HUNDRED TWENTY-NINE (229) Square Meters, more or less; c. A certain parcel of land destined for residential purposes situated at Sto. Tomas Road, Baguio City, located at Res. Sec. ""J"" Baguio City, containing an area of SIX HUNDRED (600) SQUARE METERS, more or less, which parcel of land is bounded on the North by property sold to Lt. Asto and Company, on the East by the property owned by Mr. Lino Domilos; on the West by our existing property and on the South, by a titled property. The RTC ordered Lino, Palichang and Nabunat to surrender peaceful possession of the above-mentioned properties to the Sps. Pastor and Joseph Pastor having acquired rights thereto by virtue of a valid conveyance. The Court of Appeals, in its March 26, 2013 Decision, dismissed the appeal and affirmed the assailed Decision dated September 21, 2006 and the Resolution dated January 22, 2007 of the Regional Trial Court of Baguio City, in Civil Case No. 1784-R.","The Court denies the petition for review on certiorari and affirms the Decision of the CA and RTC finding the Pastors to be the rightful owners of the subject properties. The Court held that the RTC and CA Decisions were supported by law and jurisprudence (consistent with Article VIII, Section 14 of the 1987 Constitution and Rule 36, Section 1 of the Rules of Court). The subject compromise agreement, being a contract that created real rights (Art. 1312, Civil Code), bound the third persons (the Pastors) who came into possession of the object of the contract. Rescission, or revocation, of the compromise agreement cannot take place because the objects of the contract are already in the legal possession of the Pastors who did not act in bad faith (Art. 1385, Civil Code). Finally, the motion for 4th Alias Writ of Execution filed on May 9, 1989, which sought to execute the RTC Decision dated January 6, 1979, was invalidated because the judgment had already become stale. The five-year period for execution by motion (Rule 39, Section 6) and the ten-year period for execution by action (Article 1144, paragraph (3) of the Civil Code) had already lapsed since the judgment became final in 1979.","WHEREFORE, the Court DENIES the petition. The March 26, 2013 Decision and June 26, 2013 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA G.R. CV No. 89201 are hereby AFFIRMED."
"G.R. No. 227911, March 14, 2022","ARIEL PAOLO A. ANTE, PETITIONER, VS. UNIVERSITY OF THE PHILIPPINES STUDENT DISCIPLINARY TRIBUNAL AND UNIVERSITY OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENTS.","The present case stemmed from seven disciplinary actions filed on September 28, 2007 by UP before the SDT against Ante and others, namely: Marcelino G. Veloso III (Veloso), Keefe Dela Cruz (Dela Cruz), and Armand Lorenze V. Sapitan (Sapitan) (Ante, et al). The disciplinary actions, in the form of formal charges, were prompted by the death of Chris Anthony Mendez (Mendez) allegedly due to hazing activities/initiation rites conducted by the Sigma Rho Fraternity. In particular, the formal charges accused them of participating in the alleged hazing activities/initiation rites, leaving Mendez in the hospital, and failing to give information to the authorities, and to comply with the directives of UP's Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs to give information on the circumstances surrounding Mendez's death. Thereafter, Ante filed his answer with request for production of documents before the SDT. In his answer, Ante emphasized that under Section 1, Rule III of the UP Revised Rules and Regulations Governing Fraternities, Sororities, and other Student Organizations (Rules Governing Fraternities), a valid preliminary inquiry must first be conducted to determine whether a formal charge against any member or officer of a fraternity, sorority, or other student organization is warranted. In separate Orders, these requests were denied by SDT. Thus, on November 20, 2007, Ante filed an omnibus motion seeking for: (a) the quashal of the formal charges and declaration of all the proceedings as void due to an invalid preliminary inquiry; and (b) the inhibition of the members of SDT on the ground of prejudgment. SDT denied the omnibus motion. On March 6, 2008, Ante filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition before the RTC of Quezon City. In its Decision dated November 19, 2009, the RTC found merit in Ante's petition and nullified the proceedings of SDT.","On October 6, 2015, the CA promulgated the herein assailed Decision reversing the RTC Decision. The dispositive portion of the CA Decision reads: WHEREFORE , premises considered, the instant Appeal is GRANTED . The Decision rendered by the trial court on 19 November 2009 nullifying the proceedings of the University of the Philippines and its Student Disciplinary Tribunal concerning the death of Chris Anthony Mendez, of which the Plaintiff-Appellees have allegedly been involved, is NULLIFIED and SET ASIDE . SO ORDERED.","The Court held that the petition for certiorari and prohibition filed by Ante before the RTC should have been summarily dismissed, not because of Ante's failure to file a motion for reconsideration (which was dispensed with as it was prohibited by the Rules Governing Fraternities), but because the denial of a motion to quash is not the proper subject of a petition for certiorari, as the plain, speedy, and adequate remedy is to go to trial. Even brushing aside the procedural faults, the appeal was lacking in merit. The Court ruled that the preliminary inquiry conducted by SDT was valid, disagreeing with Ante's assertion that the terms ""by"" and ""before"" were mutually exclusive in the context of the Rules Governing Fraternities. The Court stated that adopting Ante's interpretation would result in an anomalous situation of a judge (SDT) hearing its own case. Furthermore, the Court found no violation of Ante's right to due process, holding that the finding of a prima facie case against him did not amount to prejudgment, nor did it shift the burden of proof, but only the burden of evidence, which is dependent upon the exigencies of the case.","WHEREFORE, the petition is hereby DISMISSED. The October 6, 2015 Decision and September 27, 2016 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 120280 are AFFIRMED. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 242889, March 14, 2022","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. LENG HAIYUN, DANG HUIYIN, LIU WEN XION A.K.A. ""LUI XIN,"" AND LEI GUANG FENG, ACCUSED-APPELLANTS.","On May 28, 2013, at around 6:30 in the evening, Michael Claveria (Claveria), a gasoline boy on duty at the North Metro Oil Gasoline Station at Pasuquin, Ilocos Norte, noticed a silver gray Toyota Previa parked at the southern portion of the gasoline station. Around 30 minutes later, Claveria saw someone alight from the Toyota Previa and break two bottles at the driver's side. Thereafter, Claveria proceeded to the police station to report the incident. In their patrol car, the police officers followed Claveria back to the gasoline station. Upon arrival at the gasoline station, the police officers spotted the Toyota Previa, but Leng Haiyun et al. noticed the police officers' presence. As a result, Leng Haiyun, et al. fled toward the north direction, and the police officers gave chase. In turn, Police Inspector Joseph Tayaban (PI Tayaban) contacted the police officers at the COMELEC checkpoint in Barangay Davila, Pasuquin, and requested them to intercept the Toyota Previa. When the vehicle stopped at the COMELEC checkpoint, the police officers alighted from the patrol car. PI Tayaban and Police Senior Inspector Joseph Baltazar (PSI Baltazar) approached the driver's side of the Toyota Previa and signaled the driver to lower the tinted window. Upon the driver's compliance, PI Tayaban saw four foreigners later identified as Leng Haiyun, et al. PI Tayaban also saw around six pieces of plate numbers scattered on the floor behind the driver. When asked, Leng Haiyun, et al. failed to show their passports or other documents pertaining to their entry and stay in the country. Thereafter, the driver of the Toyota Previa handed a mobile phone to PI Tayaban. On the other end of the line was a female who identified herself as ""Candy."" She asked PI Tayaban what the transgression of those aboard the Toyota Previa was. PI Tayaban answered that it was just for a light offense – they caused alarm at the gasoline station when they broke bottles. When Candy asked PI Tayaban to release the foreigners, PI Tayaban insisted that Candy should instruct them to go with the police officers, as only a light offense was involved. The occupants of the Toyota Previa complied, and they followed the patrol car. While approaching the police station, PI Tayaban stepped out of the patrol car and boarded the Toyota Previa to prevent the escape of Leng Haiyun, et al. Upon reaching the police station, PI Tayaban instructed Leng Haiyun, et al. to alight from the vehicle. While they were alighting, PI Tayaban and other people saw, in plain view, several butts and barrels of different firearms under the chair of the second row of the car. Thereafter, the police officers cordoned the area and handcuffed Leng Haiyun, et al. Upon PSI Baltazar's request, personnel of the Provincial Police Office headed by Police Superintendent Jerico Baldeo (PS Baldeo) and Police Chief Inspector Jay De Guzman (PCI De Guzman) arrived. Thereafter, PCI De Guzman began the search and in the presence of Leng Haiyun, et al., barangay officials, and members of the media, and with the assistance of Pasuquin police officers, Police Officer 2 Ruel Llamelo (PO2 Llamelo) and Police Officer 3 Lumiowel Bulosan (PO3 Bulosan), opened the sliding door of the right side of the vehicle. PCI De Guzman saw an MP5 submachinegun on the floor of the vehicle and found several other firearms, pieces of explosives, and plate numbers on the floor of the second and third rows of the Toyota Previa. PCI De Guzman handed them to PO2 Llamelo, who listed each item. PO3 Bulosan, in turn, marked each item. For their part, Leng Haiyun, et al. denied the allegations against them. They averred that no firearms and explosives were found inside the Toyota Previa. They maintained that they saw the subject firearms and explosives for the first time on top of a table outside the police station. They also belied the police officers' claim that several plate numbers were found scattered on the floor of the Toyota Previa. After trial, the RTC convicted Leng Haiyun, et al. for illegal possession of explosives and violation of the election gun ban but dismissed the case for illegal possession of firearms.","The appeal is unmeritorious. Given the foregoing, there is no reason for this Court to reverse the RTC's ruling, which the CA Decision affirmed.","Accused-appellants first contend that they cannot be convicted of the offenses of illegal possession of explosives and violation of Section 261 (q) of the Omnibus Election Code, in relation to COMELEC Resolution No. 9561-A, because such will violate their right against double jeopardy; and, second, the prosecution failed to prove animus possidendi. We disagree. There is no double jeopardy and the prosecution has proven accused-appellants' animus possidendi... Contrary to the CA's ruling, the circumstances of the case do not fall within the purview of Section 5 (a), Rule 113 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure, but of Section 5 (b). ... All these circumstances, taken together, point to no other conclusion than that the police officers had personal knowledge that a crime had been committed. ... To this Court's mind, PI Tayaban's reasonable suspicion, coupled with numerous circumstances, such as the immediacy of the police officers' investigation, their presence at the gasoline station that caused accused-appellants to flee, and their chase of accused-appellants' vehicle and subsequent interception at the COMELEC checkpoint, sufficiently support the existence of probable cause to justify accused-appellants' warrantless arrest. ... We find that the police officers' seizure of the evidence was in ""plain view."" ... In addition, the seizure made by PCI de Guzman of the firearms and explosives from accused-appellants also qualify as a search incidental to a lawful arrest. ... Having established that accused-appellants' arrest falls among the instances for a valid warrantless arrest and the evidence seized from accused-appellants was the result of a search of evidence in ""plain view"" and as an incident to accused-appellants' lawful arrest, the contraband seized were admissible in evidence to prove their guilt.","WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant appeal is DENIED. The February 20, 2017 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 07690, which affirmed the July 30, 2015 Decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 14, Laoag City, in Criminal Case Nos. 2131-19 and 2133-19, and its Resolution dated December 12, 2017 are AFFIRMED.

"G.R. No. 218738, March 09, 2022","METROPOLITAN BANK & TRUST COMPANY (METROBANK), PETITIONER, VS. SALAZAR REALTY CORPORATION* REPRESENTED BY INCORPORATORS/ STOCKHOLDERS RAMON ANG SALAZAR, JR., ROBERT ANG SALAZAR, ROGER ANG SALAZAR, AND ROSEMARIE SALAZAR FERNANDEZ,** RESPONDENTS.","On November 5, 2001, SARC filed an action for quieting of title and nullification of contracts (Civil Case No. 2001-11-164) against Metrobank. SARC alleged that Tacloban RAS obtained a loan from Metrobank, secured by a mortgage over five parcels of land owned by SARC, purportedly executed by SARC officers Consuelo and Ralph. SARC claimed the mortgage and subsequent foreclosure proceedings (where Metrobank emerged as the winning bidder) were void because: (1) the loan was secured by properties of a separate, distinct, and unrelated corporation (ultra vires); (2) the transaction constituted an encumbrance of substantially all the corporation's assets without proper stockholder authorization under Section 40 of the Corporation Code; and (3) there were defects in the foreclosure proceedings. Ramon Ang Salazar, Jr., Robert Ang Salazar, Roger Ang Salazar and Rosemarie Salazar Fernandez (Ramon et al.), as incorporators and stockholders, filed the suit on SARC's behalf (derivative suit). Metrobank filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the case was a derivative suit and therefore an intra-corporate controversy over which RTC Branch 9, being a regular trial court and not a special commercial court, had no jurisdiction. The RTC denied the motion, ruling that the case did not involve an intra-corporate controversy, as it was a suit by shareholders against another corporation (Metrobank) and public officers. Metrobank elevated the matter to the CA.","In dismissing Metrobank's petition, the CA ruled that under Rule 1 of A.M. No. 01-2-04-SC, or the Interim Rules of Procedure Governing Intra-Corporate Controversies (2001 IRPIC), derivative suits are also intra-corporate controversies. Therefore, to determine if SARC's petition must be tried under the 2001 IRPIC by a special commercial court, it must pass the two-tier intra-corporate controversy test. The appellate court found that SARC's petition does not pass the two-tier test. It satisfies neither the relationship test, since it does not involve any of the intra-corporate relationships enumerated in Section 5(b) of Presidential Decree No. 902-A; nor the controversy test, since it does not involve a dispute which is intrinsically connected with the regulation of SARC or a dispute which arises out of intra-corporate relations within SARC. Rather, the case involves the removal of the cloud on SARC's titles, which was created by the contracts executed by Ralph and Consuelo allegedly on behalf of Tacloban RAS and SARC.","The Supreme Court ruled that upon the transfer of the SEC's jurisdiction over intra-corporate disputes pursuant to Section 5.2 of the SRC and the 2001 IRPIC, jurisdiction over all derivative suits was returned to the trial courts, specifically the special commercial courts. The Court held that the very act of instituting a derivative suit implies the existence of an intra-corporate dispute, regardless of the relief sought or the parties impleaded. Thus, the CA erred in applying the two-tier test to conclude that jurisdiction resided with the regular courts. The case should have been transferred to the relevant special commercial court in accordance with the Gonzales guidelines. However, the Court found that SARC's suit, while a derivative suit, suffered from fatal defects under the 2001 IRPIC. Specifically, SARC's allegation that the mortgage involved substantially all corporate assets (triggering Section 40 of the Corporation Code) made the availment of appraisal rights available. SARC's petition failed to comply with Rule 1, Section 1(3) of the 2001 IRPIC by failing to make particular allegations regarding the availment of appraisal rights or the impossibility/futility thereof. Furthermore, SARC's petition lacked a categorical statement that it is not a nuisance or harassment suit, as required by Rule 8, Section 1 of the 2001 IRPIC.","WHEREFORE, the present petition is GRANTED. The March 25, 2014 Decision and the May 8, 2015 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 05050 are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

ABARQUEZ, JERRY P. AGNES AND JOANNE B. VITOBINA, PETITIONERS, VS. HEIRS OF THE LATE ANTONIO O. BEATO, REPRESENTED BY HIS WIFE JONABEL D. BEATO, RESPONDENTS.","Antonio was a seafarer engaged by Marlow Navigation Phils., Inc. (Marlow), for and in behalf of its foreign principal, Marlow Navigation Co. Ltd., as an Able Seaman on board the vessel MV Geest Trader for a contract period of 10 months. Prior to embarkation, Antonio underwent a Pre-Employment Medical Examination and was declared ""Fit for Sea Duty."" He departed the Philippines and joined the vessel on July 14, 2012.[5] Sometime in November 2012, Antonio felt severe abdominal pain, back ache, chest pain and had coughs. Due to the absence of medical facilities at the port clinic, he did not receive the proper medical assistance and did not undergo any laboratory test. He was repatriated to the Philippines on December 1, 2012 due to his medical condition.[6] Petitioners referred Antonio to Dr. Orlino F. Hosaka, Jr. (Dr. Hosaka) of the Notre Dame Medico-Dental Clinic, the company-designated physician, who, in turn, referred him to the company specialists, particularly a pulmonologist and a cardiologist. Antonio's x-ray results showed that he has negative infiltrates. He was diagnosed with hypertension secondary to upper respiratory tract infection. Antonio was advised by Dr. Hosaka to return for further treatment and examination on January 8, 2013, but he did not.[7] Meanwhile, on December 14, 2012, Antonio went home to Aklan and was confined at the St. Gabriel Clinic from December 21 to 22, 2012 where he was diagnosed with functional dyspepsia. He was again confined in the same clinic from January 24, 2013 to February 5, 2013 where he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. After his discharge, Antonio was bedridden at home until he died on April 6, 2013. His death certificate indicated that he died due to cardio respiratory failure with underlying cause of pancreatic cancer.[8] Thus, his surviving heirs, through his wife, Jonabel D. Beato, filed a complaint for death benefits, payment for burial expenses, reimbursement of medical expenses, airfare expense, damages and attorney's fees, against Marlow on the ground that the cause of his death, pancreatic cancer, is a work-related illness.[9] On the other hand, Marlow contended that the heirs are not entitled to death benefits because Antonio's death occurred after the termination of his employment contract. Furthermore, he abandoned his treatment, thus, he is not qualified to these benefits. Finally, Antonio did not acquire his illness, pancreatic cancer, while he was on board the vessel, thus, it could not have been a work-related illness.[10]","Overturning the unanimous rulings of the LA and the NLRC, the CA held that the heirs of the late Antonio are entitled to death benefits under existing law and jurisprudence.[19] The pertinent portions of the CA Decision held that: The rule is that a seafarer's right to disability benefits is a matter governed by law, contract and medical findings. What the law requires is a reasonable work-connection and not a direct causal relation. It is enough that the hypothesis on which the workman's claim is based is probable. Medical opinion to the contrary can be disregarded especially where there is some basis in the facts for inferring a work-connection. Probability, not certainty, is the touchstone. It is not required that the employment be the sole factor in the growth, development or acceleration of a claimant's illness to entitle him to the benefits provided for. It is enough that his employment contributed, even if to a small degree, to the development of the disease. x x x x While it is true that medical repatriation has the effect of terminating the seafarer's contract of employment, it is, however, enough that the work-related illness, which eventually becomes the proximate cause of death, occurred while the contract was effective for recovery to be had. WHEREFORE, foregoing considered, the petition is GRANTED. Accordingly, the assailed Decision and Resolution dated May 30, 2014 and July 31, 2014, respectively, of the National Labor Relations Commission in NLRC LAC No. 02-000176-14 are hereby SET ASIDE and REVERSED. Private respondents are ordered to jointly and severally pay petitioners as follows: 1. Death benefits in the amount of Fifty Thousand US dollars (US$50,000.00); 2. Reimbursement of medical and hospitalization expenses, in the amount of Two Hundred Thirty-Six Thousand Eight Hundred Eighty-Three and 31/100 Pesos (P236,883.31); 3. Burial expenses in the amount of One Thousand US dollars (US$1,000.00) 4. Attorney's fees equivalent to 10% of the total amount due. SO ORDERED.[20]","The Court grants the petition. This Court may review factual findings of the LA, NLRC, and CA if they are contradictory. The known and general rule is that this Court may only review questions of law. However, a recognized exception is when there are not only different but contradictory findings between that of the CA and of the labor tribunals.[23] In this case, the factual findings of the CA and the labor tribunals regarding Antonio's medical condition in relation to whether the same is compensable under the law are evidently contradictory. Thus, given the contradictions on the questions of fact that are crucial in determining the applicable laws to the case, it is necessary that the Court must review and re-evaluate the records of the case. A seafarer is entitled to disability benefit claims in accordance with law, his employment contract and medical findings. By law, the seafarer's disability benefits claim is governed by Articles 191 to 193, Chapter VI (Disability Benefits) of the Labor Code, in relation to Rule X, Section 2 of the Rules and Regulations Implementing the Labor Code. By contract, it is governed by the employment contract which the seafarer and his employer or local manning agency executes prior to employment, and the applicable Philippine Overseas Employment Administration-Standard Employment Contract (POEA-SEC) deemed incorporated in the employment contract. Lastly, the medical findings of the company-designated physician, the seafarer's personal physician, and those of the mutually-agreed third physician, pursuant to the POEA-SEC, govern.[24] Since Antonio was employed in 2012, Section 20-A of the 2010 POEA­-SEC[25] applies in determining the factual issues of compensability of his pancreatic cancer, and compliance with the POEA-SEC prescribed procedure for disability determination. The applicable provisions of Section 20-A read in part: SECTION 20. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS A. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS FOR INJURY OR ILLNESS The liabilities of the employer when the seafarer suffers work-related injury or illness during the term of his contract are as follows: 1. x x x 2. If the injury or illness requires medical and/or dental treatment in a foreign port, the employer shall be liable for the full cost of such medical, serious dental, surgical and hospital treatment as well as board and lodging until the seafarer is declared fit to work or to be repatriated. However, if after repatriation, the seafarer still requires medical attention arising from said injury or illness, be shall be so provided at cost to the employer until such time he is declared fit or the degree of his disability has been established by the company­-designated physician. 3. x x x x x x x For this purpose, the seafarer shall submit himself to a post-employment medical examination by a company-designated physician within three working days upon his return except when be is physically incapacitated to do so, in which case, a written notice to the agency within the same period is deemed as compliance. In the course of the treatment, the seafarer shall also report regularly to the company-designated physician specifically on the dates as prescribed by the company-designated physician and agreed to by the seafarer. Failure of the seafarer to comply with the mandatory reporting requirement shall result in his forfeiture of the right to claim the above benefits. If a doctor appointed by the seafarer disagrees with the assessment, a third doctor may be agreed jointly between the Employer and the seafarer. The third doctor's decision shall be final and binding on both parties. 4. Those illnesses not listed in Section 32 of this Contract are disputably presumed as work-related. 5. x x x 6. In case of permanent total or partial disability of the seafarer caused by either injury or illness, the seafarer shall be compensated in accordance with the schedule of benefits enumerated in Section 32 of this Contract. Computation of his benefits arising from an illness or disease shall be governed by the rates and rules of compensation applicable at the time the illness or disease was contracted. x x x x (Emphases supplied) Section 20-A of the 2010 POEA-SEC should be read together with Section 32-A of the same Contract which enumerates the various diseases deemed to be occupational and thus, compensable. In short, in order for a seafarer to be entitled to the compensation and benefits under Section 20-A, the disability causing the illness, injury or death must be one of those listed under Section 32. As regards those diseases not otherwise considered an occupational disease under the POEA-SEC, the law recognizes that these illnesses may nevertheless cause or aggravate the seafarer's working conditions. Hence, the POEA-SEC provides for a disputable presumption of work-relatedness for non-POEA-SEC-listed occupational diseases and the resulting illness, injury or death that the seafarer may have suffered during the term of his employment contract.[26] The non-inclusion of the disease in the list of compensable diseases does not mean absolute exclusion from disability benefits. However, the disputable presumption does also not signify an automatic grant of compensation and/or benefits claim; the seafarer must still prove his entitlement to disability benefits by substantial evidence of his illness' work-relatedness.[27] Thus, to be entitled to benefits under Section 20-A, the seafarer must show that (1) he suffered an illness; (2) during the term of his employment contract; (3) he complied with the procedures prescribed under Section 20-A of the applicable POEA-SEC; (4) his illness is one of the enumerated occupational diseases or that his illness or injury is otherwise work-related; and (5) he complied with the four conditions enumerated under Section 32-A of the POEA-SEC for an occupational disease or a disputably-presumed work-related disease to be compensable, which are as follows: 1. The seafarer's work must involve the risks described herein; 2. The disease was contracted as a result of the seafarer's exposure to the described risks; 3. The disease was contracted within a period of exposure and under such other factors necessary to contract it; and 4. There was no notorious negligence on the part of the seafarer.[28] In this case, the heirs established that Antonio suffered an illness during the term of his employment contract. However, he failed to comply with the procedures prescribed under the POEA-SEC, particularly Section 20-A(3), paragraph 3, which requires the seafarer must submit himself to a post-employment medical examination within three days upon his return. Further, he must report regularly to the company-designated physician specifically on the dates prescribed by the latter. When the seafarer is physically incapacitated to do so, he must submit a written notice to the agency. Otherwise, his failure to do so will result in forfeiture of his right to claim his benefits. Antonio was repatriated on December 1, 2012. He went to Dr. Hosaka of the Notre Dame Medico-Dental Clinic on December 5, 13 and 18, 2012 who diagnosed him with hypertension secondary to upper respiratory tract infection.[29] When he was asked to report back on January 8, 2013 for a follow-up check-up, not only did Antonio fail to do so, he also failed to notify in writing Marlow or Dr. Hosaka that he had already gone home to Aklan. The only defense the heirs gave was that Antonio's worsening condition prevented him from doing so.[30] The law is clear, however, that all that Antonio or his family had to do was make a written notification of his hospitalization, or his physical incapacity to report back to the company-designated physician. This they did not do. Paragraph 4 of the same section further states that if the doctor selected by the seafarer disagrees with the assessment of the company-designated physician, the parties may jointly appoint a third doctor whose decision shall be final and binding on both parties. When Antonio failed to report back to Dr. Hosaka on January 8, 2013, it was because he already went home to Aklan and had himself checked by another physician in a different clinic, St. Gabrielle Medical Clinic, on December 20 to 21, 2012. There, he was diagnosed with functional dyspepsia.[31] A month later, he was again confined in the same clinic and was subsequently diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.[32] The records reveal an indisputable disagreement between the findings of the company-designated physician, on one hand, and the physician Antonio approached in Aklan, on the other hand. Dr. Hosaka even claims that Antonio never made any reference to any other symptom or condition relating to pancreatic cancer because otherwise, he (Dr. Hosaka) would have reported it to Marlow.[33] At this point, it bears stressing that the employee seeking disability benefits carries the responsibility of securing the opinion of a third doctor. In fact, the employee or the seafarer must actively or expressly request for it. The referral to a third doctor has been recognized by this Court to be a mandatory procedure. Failure to comply therewith is considered a breach of the POEA­-SEC, and renders the assessment by the company-designated physician binding on the parties.[34] Secondly, pancreatic cancer is not an occupational disease. Section 32-A of the POEA-SEC only considers two types of cancer as compensable occupational diseases: (1) cancer of the epithelial of the bladder (papilloma of the bladder); and (2) cancer, epithellomatous or ulceration of the skin of the corneal surface of the eye due to tar, pitch, bitumen, mineral oil or paraffin, or compound product or residue of these substances. Although the CA afforded Antonio the benefit of the legal presumption of work-relatedness, this Court disagrees and holds that Antonio or his heirs failed to prove the work-relatedness of his pancreatic cancer. Case law has held time and time again that for a disease not included in the list of compensable diseases to be compensable, the seafarer still has to establish, by substantial evidence that his illness is or was work-related. As stated, the disputable presumption does not amount to an automatic grant of compensation.[35] In this case, Antonio failed to prove that his illness is compensable as he failed to satisfy all the conditions under Section 32-A which are, to repeat: 1. The seafarer's work must involve the risks described herein; 2. The disease was contracted as a result of the seafarer's exposure to the described risks; 3. The disease was contracted within a period of exposure and under such other factors necessary to contract it; and 4. There was no notorious negligence on the part of the seafarer.[36] Firstly, Antonio or his heirs did not enumerate his specific duties as an Able Seaman nor did they list down the specific tasks which Antonio performed on a daily basis. Secondly, they did not show that his duties or tasks caused, contributed to the development of, or aggravated his pancreatic cancer. There was no mention of the specific substances or chemicals which he claimed he was exposed to during his employment contract; how these chemicals could have caused his pancreatic cancer; or measures that Marlow did or did not take to control the hazards. His heirs merely presented general averments and allegations that his 'constant exposure to hazards such as chemicals and the varying temperature, coupled by stressful tasks in his employment caused the aggravation of [his] medical condition.'[37] This Court has ruled in Status Maritime Corp. v. Spouses Delalamon[38] that: At the very least, these general statements surmise mere possibilities but not the probability required by law for disability compensation. Mere possibility will not suffice and a claim will still fail if there is only a possibility that the employment caused or aggravated the disease. Even considering that the respondents have shown probability, their basis is, nonetheless incompetent for being uncorroborated. Probability of work-connection must at least be anchored on credible information and not on self-serving allegations. x x x Certainly, disability compensation cannot rest on mere allegations couched in conjectures and baseless inferences from which work-aggravation or relatedness cannot be presumed. '[B]are allegations do not suffice to discharge the required quantum of proof of compensability. Awards of compensation cannot rest on speculations or presumptions. The beneficiaries must present evidence to prove a positive proposition.'[39] The heirs' further presentation in their memorandum to the CA[40] of studies by the Centre for Occupational and Health Psychology at Cardiff University[41] and by the International Labor Organization (ILO)[42] cannot be considered as substantial evidence of his cancer's work-relatedness. The heirs insist that the studies correlate the symptoms the late Antonio complained of while on board the vessel (high blood pressure and lung problem) to the cause of his death (Acute Pancreatitis and Pancreatic Cancer).[43] Further, a study made by research associates at the same university noted that a seafarer's illness is caused by stress on board the vessel.[44] The ILO also has determined the maximum working hours of a seafarer to be 14 hours per day. These long working days, heat in work places, separation from family, time pressure or hectic activities, and insufficient qualifications of subordinate crew members, add to a seafarer's ongoing elevated stress level which has a negative impact on his physical and mental health.[45] However, these two studies could not serve as sufficient proof that Antonio's working conditions caused, contributed to the development of, or aggravated his pancreatic cancer since they are simply generalizations that infer mere possibilities but not the probability required by law for disability or death compensation. The studies only made general statements about hazards that may typically attach to the duties of a seafarer. However, the specific risks which a seafarer may be exposed to in the performance of his duties will still depend on the specific duties which he may be tasked to perform.[46] Finally, the NLRC also noted that no scintilla of evidence was presented by the heirs to establish the symptoms which Antonio complained of, and which eventually led to the disease that he contracted allegedly as a result of his work. In its Decision, the NLRC stated: As to the illness ""hypertension"" which was also noted to be a cause of the late seafarer's death, it is true that pursuant to the POEA SEC, hypertension classified as primary or essential is considered compensable if it causes impairment of function of body organs like kidneys, heart, eyes and brain, resulting in permanent disability; Provided, that the following documents substantiate it: (a) chest x-ray report, (b) ECG report, (c) blood chemistry report, (d) funduscopy report, and (e) C-T scan. In the given case, however, not a single medical certificate or laboratory report was presented by the complainants, thus, they failed to comply with the mandatory requirements provided under the afore-stated Sec. 32 of the POEA SEC.[47] (Emphasis supplied) In sum, the Court holds that the late Antonio's pancreatic cancer is not work-related and therefore, not compensable because he or his heirs failed to prove, by substantial evidence, its work-relatedness and his compliance with the parameters that the law has set out with regard to claims for disability and death benefits. While this Court adheres to the principle of liberality in favor of the seafarer in construing the POEA-SEC, it cannot allow claims for disability compensation based on surmises. Liberal construction is never a license to disregard the evidence on record and to misapply the law.[48]","WHEREFORE, the Court hereby GRANTS the petition. Accordingly, the Court REVERSES and SETS ASIDE the May 12, 2017 Decision and the August 23, 2017 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP. No. 137624, and REINSTATES the National Labor Relations Commission Decision dated May 30, 2014 in NLRC LAC No. 02-000176-14. The complaint filed by the heirs of the late Antonio O.

"G.R. No. 214781, March 09, 2022","MEGA FISHING CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. ESTATE OF FRANCISCO FELIPE N. GONZALES, RESPONDENT.","Deceased Francisco Felipe Gonzales y Narciso (deceased Francisco) owned a 1,667-square meter property (subject property) located in North Bay Boulevard, C-3 Road, Navotas, Metro Manila covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. (TCT) 280406[5] issued on April 20, 1994. By virtue of a deed of sale in favor of Francisco Gabriel Gonzales III, TCT 280406 was cancelled and TCT 21297[6] was issued on April 30, 1999 at 11:07 a.m. TCT 21297 was also cancelled on the same day and at the exact time and a new TCT 21299[7] was issued in the name of Esperanza G. Consigna (Esperanza). On May 18, 1999, a certain Mercedita Valenciano (Mercedita), acting in a representative capacity for and in behalf of Esperanza, executed an affidavit of loss[8] of TCTs 280406, 280407, and 280409. Claiming to be the beneficial owner of the properties covered by the said titles, Esperanza, through Mercedita, filed a petition[9] for the reconstitution of the owner's duplicate copies of the three titles.[10] Thereafter, the RTC of Malabon, Branch 73, issued an Order[11] dated June 7, 1999 requiring the publication of the notice and initial hearing on the petition for reconstitution pursuant to Section 13 of Republic Act No. (RA) 26.[12] On September 19, 1999, the original copy of TCT 280406 was annotated reflecting the issuance of a new owner's duplicate copy pursuant to the Order dated June 7, 1999.[13] On November 5, 1999, petitioner Mega Fishing Corporation (MFC) purchased the subject property from Esperanza for P9,601,920.00 by virtue of a Kasulatan ng Ganap at Lubos na Bilihan.[14] Accordingly, TCT 21299 was cancelled and TCT 21926[15] was issued in the name of MFC.[16] Records also reveal that as early as 1989, during the lifetime of Francisco, his last will and testament was submitted to probate before the RTC of Manila and letters testamentary were issued in favor of Teresita as the executrix.[17] In May 2000, the estate of Francisco Felipe N. Gonzales (respondent), through Teresita, filed a case against Esperanza, Mercedita, MFC, Vicente Garcia (Garcia), and Sarah Principe, seeking to annul and cancel TCT 21297, 21299, and 21926, and the reinstatement of TCT No. 280406.[18] In its November 22, 2011 Decision,[19] the RTC ruled in favor of the respondent. The RTC found that the new owner's duplicate copy of TCT 280406 in the name of Francisco Felipe Gonzales was null and void for being fraudulently obtained. The RTC further ruled that TCTs 21297 and 21299 were both invalidly issued, and therefore null and void. Lastly, the RTC found that MFC was not a buyer in good faith for its failure to discharge the burden of proving the same. MFC filed a notice of appeal. In a notice[26] dated August 15, 2013, the CA required MFC to file its appellant's brief. MFC filed a motion to be given the opportunity to file its file appeal brief.[27] MFC asked for an additional period of 30 days from December 19, 2013, or until January 19, 2014, within which to file its brief, which the CA later granted.[28] On February 6, 2014, MFC filed its motion to admit appellant's brief (with attached copy of the appellant's brief).[29] In its first assailed March 28, 2014 Resolution,[30] the CA denied MFC's motion. It held that MFC failed to file its brief within the reglementary period. On July 22, 2014, the CA issued a Resolution[32] closing and terminating the case. MFC filed a motion for reconsideration and a supplemental motion for reconsideration which the CA later denied in its October 14, 2014 Resolution.[35] MFC filed the present petition for review on certiorari assailing the CA resolutions.",The petition is meritorious. The Supreme Court found that MFC should be afforded the amplest opportunity for its case to be decided on the merits and not on mere technicalities. This Court noted that MFC stands to lose its property rights due to a technicality for the belated filing of its appellant's brief attributed to its former counsel's negligence. The Court viewed the belated filing of its brief as an honest mistake and not an attempt to delay the proceedings of the case.,"WHEREFORE, the instant petition is hereby GRANTED. Petitioner Mega Fishing Corporation's Appellant's Brief is ADMITTED. The case is REMANDED to the Court of Appeals which is DIRECTED to proceed with the proceedings with dispatch.",Petition GRANTED.

RUFINO RAMOY AND DENNIS PADILLA, RESPONDENTS.","The petitioners served as pollwatchers during the 2010 Barangay Elections. On October 25, 2010, a complaint was filed by petitioners Mischaella and Marlon against one Paul Ramones Borja (Borja) for soliciting votes and distributing election paraphernalia inside the polling place. On January 17, 2011, petitioners Mischaella and Marlon, joined by petitioner Juan-Barrameda, filed another complaint charging respondents Rufino Ramoy and Dennis Padilla, along with five (5) others, for acting in conspiracy with Borja. Assistant City Prosecutor Irene S. Resurreccion found probable cause for filing three criminal Informations (Criminal Case Nos. Q-11-169067, Q-11-169068, and Q-11-169069) for violation of Sec. 80 (premature campaign) and Sec. 261 (k) in relation to Art. 266, cc (g) and Sec. 192 (unlawful electioneering/soliciting votes on election day inside the polling place) of the Omnibus Election Code. The defendants, including respondents, filed an Omnibus Motion before the RTC of Quezon City, Branch 101, seeking to quash the Informations on the grounds that they charge more than one offense and that the facts stated therein do not constitute an offense. The RTC denied the Omnibus Motion in its Orders dated February 15, 2012 and November 28, 2012. Respondents filed a petition for certiorari with the Court of Appeals (CA). The CA granted the petition, reversed the RTC Orders, and ordered the quashal of all three Informations, finding that they were duplicitous (charged more than one offense). The petitioners then filed this petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45.",The petition is partly meritorious.,"The Court disagreed with the CA's rationale for quashing Criminal Case Nos. Q-11-169068 and Q-11-169069 on the ground of duplicity, but nonetheless held that these Informations must be quashed because the facts charged do not constitute an offense. Citing jurisprudence (Penera v. COMELEC), the Court affirmed that premature campaigning (Section 80 of the Omnibus Election Code) is no longer punishable since a person is considered a 'candidate' only at the start of the campaign period. As for Criminal Case No. Q-11-169067 (unlawful electioneering and unlawful presence inside the polling place), the Court ruled that the Information must be upheld. While the alleged acts could fall under two provisions (Section 261 cc (6) and Section 192), the act of 'unlawful presence' is deemed absorbed by the crime of 'unlawful campaign' when committed simultaneously on the same occasion, as the offender's presence inside the polling place becomes a means and an element of committing the election offense of unlawful campaign. Thus, the Information for Q-11-169067 is not duplicitous. The quashal of the Informations in Criminal Cases Nos. Q-11-169068 and Q-11-169069 inures to the benefit of all the accused, even those who did not appeal.","WHEREFORE, the instant petition for review on certiorari is PARTLY GRANTED. The Decision dated September 27, 2013 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 128470, and its Resolution dated May 27, 2014 are modified as follows: The Informations in Criminal Case Nos. Q-11-169068 and Q-11-169069 are QUASHED and the criminal cases against all the accused therein are DISMISSED; The Motion to Quash the Information in Criminal Case No. Q-11-169067 is DENIED. With respect thereto, the Orders dated February 15, 2012 and November 28, 2012 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 101 are REINSTATED.

"G.R. No. 205659, March 09, 2022","PSI DARWIN D. VALDERAS, PETITIONER, VS. VILMA O. SULSE, RESPONDENT.","The instant controversy was born in the aftermath of an alleged mauling incident involving Vilma O. Sulse (respondent), former Secretary of the Sangguniang Bayan of the Municipality of Taft, Eastern Samar, and Mayor Francisco Adalim (Mayor Adalim), then mayor of the said municipality, inside the Taft Police Station on May 9, 2006. Petitioner was the Chief of Police of Taft, Eastern Samar. Respondent claimed that on May 9, 2006, she went to the Taft Police Station to report that her office had been ransacked. While reporting to SPO1 Neceas Lusico, Mayor Adalim arrived and struck respondent several times on the head with an open palm and banged her head against the wall. Respondent claimed that the incident was witnessed by several police officers who did nothing to stop Mayor Adalim. When petitioner arrived, respondent asked that the mauling incident be recorded in the police blotter, but petitioner denied her request. Respondent was detained upon Mayor Adalim's order and released after surrendering two envelopes. Petitioner averred in his Counter-Affidavit that he arrived after the alleged mauling, that an incident between Sulse and Mayor Adalim (regarding Sulse stealing office records) was recorded in the police blotter, but the entry makes no mention of mauling, and that respondent never requested to have her version recorded.","The Office of the Ombudsman issued a Joint Decision dated January 5, 2007, finding petitioner and his fellow police officers guilty of Simple Neglect of Duty and meting the penalty of suspension without pay for two months (OMB-P-A-06-0735-H). On October 26, 2010, the Ombudsman issued an Order modifying the ruling: it exonerated petitioner's colleagues as the mauling claim was unsubstantiated, but maintained that petitioner Valderas was still liable for Simple Neglect of Duty because the police blotter did not contain a record of the alleged mauling incident. Petitioner's penalty was reduced to suspension without pay for one month. The Court of Appeals, in its Decision dated September 17, 2012 and Resolution dated January 23, 2013, affirmed the Ombudsman, ruling that even if the mauling incident never occurred, the police blotter should have at least contained a statement that Mayor Adalim and Vice Mayor Adel castigated or rebuked respondent inside the police station.","The Court found the petition impressed with merit, noting that the conclusion reached by the CA is grounded entirely on speculation, surmises, and conjectures, and based on a misapprehension of facts. In administrative proceedings, the quantum of proof necessary for a finding of guilt is substantial evidence. The Ombudsman and the CA both erred trying to set the standards on what should appear in a police blotter, which is meant to record criminal incidents, official summaries of arrest, and other significant events. The Court finds it difficult to sanction petitioner for not recording in the police blotter a mauling incident which, as far as the records show, never occurred. Assuming arguendo that respondent was severely rebuked or castigated, the same does not automatically constitute a criminal incident or a related significant event that must be recorded. More importantly, there is no evidence that respondent's request for recording was made upon petitioner alone, to the exclusion of all the other police officers who were present at the police station. Accordingly, the Court finds petitioner not guilty of Simple Neglect of Duty.","WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated September 17, 2012 and the Resolution dated January 23, 2013 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 120981 are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The complaint filed against petitioner PSI Darwin D. Valderas before the Office of the Ombudsman, docketed as OMB-P-A-06-0735-H, is hereby DISMISSED."
"G.R. No. 216723, March 09, 2022","REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, REPRESENTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS AND HIGHWAYS (DPWH), PETITIONER, VS. PACITA VILLAO AND CARMIENETT JAVIER, RESPONDENTS.","On March 18, 2004, petitioner Republic of the Philippines, through the DPWH, filed a Complaint for expropriation of a 550-square meter parcel of land owned by Pacita Villao (Villao) and improvements owned by Carmienett Javier (Javier) for the Manila-Cavite Tollways Expressway Project (MCTEP). Petitioner deposited P1,045,000.00 for the land and P81,868.50 and P186,343.30 for the improvements as initial payment. The Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Imus, Cavite granted petitioner's Motion for Issuance of a Writ of Possession on November 25, 2004. The RTC created a Board of Commissioners (BOC) to determine just compensation. On August 15, 2011, the BOC submitted a Report recommending P9,000.00 per square meter, primarily relying on the valuation arrived at in a similar case (Republic v. Tapawan), finding the subject property of similar nature and within the immediate vicinity. The RTC adopted this valuation, fixing just compensation for the lot at P4,950,000.00 and ordering petitioner to pay an additional P3,905,000.00 with legal interest.","The Court of Appeals (CA) denied petitioner's appeal and affirmed in toto the RTC Decision, finding that the observations in the Commissioners' Report were satisfactorily supported with evidence, as the Commissioners had made personal verification, conducted ocular inspections, and considered the surrounding properties and developments.","The Supreme Court found the Petition meritorious. The Court ruled that just compensation must be reckoned from the date of filing of the complaint on March 18, 2004. The BOC's recommended valuation of P9,000.00 per square meter was erroneous because it hinged completely on the RTC Decision in Tapawan without ensuring that the market values used were representative of the fair market value in 2004. The Commissioners' Report failed to indicate the date of the 'current market offerings' cited, rendering the data an inaccurate gauge. Citing jurisprudence, the Court held that just compensation must be based on evidence reflecting the property value at the time of taking or filing of the complaint. Thus, a remand of the case to the RTC for proper determination of just compensation was ordered. The unpaid balance of the just compensation shall earn legal interest at the rate of 12% per annum from November 25, 2004 (date of Writ of Possession) until June 30, 2013; and beginning July 1, 2013, at the rate of 6% per annum until finality of the decision fixing the just compensation. Thereafter, the total amount shall earn legal interest of 6% per annum from finality until full payment.","WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated July 31, 2014 and the Resolution dated February 4, 2015 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 98304 are hereby REVERSED.

"G.R. No. 249563, March 09, 2022","ENCARNACION GO, PETITIONER, VS. THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","In an Information[4] dated January 12, 2006, Encarnacion Go (petitioner) and ASB Fishing Development Corporation (ASB) were charged with violation of Section 92 of Republic Act No. (RA) 8550,[5] or The Philippine Fisheries Code of 1998. The relevant portion of the Information reads as follows: That on or about the 20th day of November 1999, more or less 10:30 o'clock in the morning, in the Municipality of Brooke's Point, Province of Palawan and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously, while on board Fishing Vessel Prince Arnold, fished off the waters of Brooke's Point using the method of ""Muro-Ami"" which required diving and other physical and mechanical acts to pound and destroy coral reefs and other fishery marine habitats to entrap, gather or catch fish and other fishery species. CONTRARY TO LAW.[6] In the pre-trial conference held on April 19, 2007, petitioner and the prosecution stipulated on the following facts: That [ASB] was engaged in the business of fishing thru pa-aling in the year 1999; That the fishing vessel F/B Prince Arnold [ sic ] is owned and managed, and its fishing operation is operated by ASB in the year 1999; That F/B Prince Arnold [ sic ] was apprehended at the Municipal Water of Brooke's Point, Palawan in November 1999 without warrant while conducting a fishing operation; That the fishing vessel F/B Prince Arnold [ sic ] was licensed; and That by virtue of the inventory, an investigation report was submitted by [the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR)] in Manila and likewise in the Office of the Provincial Prosecutor during the conduct of the preliminary investigation.[7] Joegie Baldado (Baldado), a witness for the prosecution, testified that when he was about 16 or 17 years old, he was recruited by Roger Cortes, his neighbor in Bais City, Negros Occidental, to engage in muro-ami fishing. According to Baldado, there were about 400 people, some of whom were minors, who were involved in the operation. About 180 to 190 of them were assigned as surface swimmers, while about 200 were tasked as divers.[9] Essentially, the surface swimmers, using hose devices with about five kilos of weight at the end, would pound the seabed to scare the fish away from their habitats and into an awaiting fish net. On the other hand, the divers were employed to ensure that the hoses do not get entangled in the seabed during the pounding.[10] Baldado narrated that their group had already gone to three such operations when on November 20, 1999, their boat captain, Jose Cabulao, ordered the operation to be stopped because authorities had already discovered them. They tried to escape, but members of the Philippine Navy were able to overtake their vessel.[11] Meanwhile, based on the Joint Affidavit[14] dated November 22, 1999, members of the Philippine Navy who conducted the operation against F/V Prince Arnold, including Boarding Officer Arnulfo C. Tintero, said that they were on board the BRP Ismael Lomibao when they spotted F/V Prince Arnold with seven small boats in tow. When they were about to draw closer to F/V Prince Arnold for a routine check, it tried to evade inspection, prompting them to give chase. They were eventually able to accost it.[15] The joint affidavit mentioned that F/V Prince Arnold was owned and operated by ASB. Aside from said joint affidavit, the Philippine Navy likewise issued a ""Boarding Certificate""[16] and receipts for confiscated or seized articles,""[17] said documents listing petitioner as owner of F/V Prince Arnold. After the prosecution rested its case, petitioner testified on her own behalf. She admitted to being one of the stockholders of ASB, owner of the F/V Prince Arnold. However, she denied that the vessel was engaged in muro-ami fishing, insisting instead that it employed the pa-aling system of fishing.[18] Petitioner said that in 1999, she was appointed as treasurer of ASB but only for the purpose of facilitating the business of the corporation. However, in actuality, she did not perform the functions of her position. She also did not have a, hand in the hiring of the vessel's employees, pointing to her brothers who supposedly were the ones who engaged the boat's workers.[19] Finally, she denied being on board F/V Prince Arnold at the time it was apprehended by the Philippine Navy.[20]","On September 9, 2015, the RTC rendered its Decision,[21] the dispositive portion of which reads: WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, judgment is hereby rendered finding both accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 92 of R.A. No. 8550 and accordingly sentencing them as follows: accused ASB Fishing Development Corporation is hereby fined in the amount of Php500,000.00; accused Encarnacion Go is hereby meted the indeterminate sentence of imprisonment of three (3) years as minimum to five (5) years as maximum; The catch and the destructive fishing gear used in the muro-ami fishing conducted by the accused are confiscated; Let the corresponding mittimus issue for the transmittal of accused Encarnacion Go to the National Correction for Women [ sic ][22] in Mandaluyong City, Metro Manila for the service of her sentence. Accordingly, the cash bond posted by the said accused for her provisional liberty endowed by O.R. No. 21469492 is hereby cancelled. IT IS SO ORDERED.[23] ... On March 14, 2019, the CA rendered its Decision[36] affirming the conviction of petitioner.","We agree with the RTC and the CA that F/V Prince Arnold employed muro-ami. Section 4 of the Fishery Administrative Code, No. 90, Series of 1994, imposes restrictions on pa-aling, including the number of fisherfolks at a maximum of 250; the mesh size of the net which should not be less than 3.38 centimeters; and that no person below eighteen (18) years of age should be engaged as a fisherfolk. Prosecution witness Baldado testified that during the time that he worked in F/V Prince Arnold, there were about 400 other people in the said boat, some of whom were minors. He likewise testified that they utilized a net with a mesh size of a ten-centavo coin, which is narrower than the minimum 3.38 centimeters prescribed by law. They worked by pounding the seabed with their hoses, to which five (5) kilos of weight were attached at the end. The process resulted in fishes being driven away from their habitat and into a waiting net. This is essentially the essence of muro-ami and not pa-aling fishing, a matter that this Court can take judicial notice of. However, despite the clear commission of muro-ami by the crew of F/V Prince Arnold, this Court cannot sustain the conviction of petitioner, certainly not without violating her constitutional right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against her. ... The Information against petitioner described the charges against her as follows: That on or about the 20th day of November 1999, more or less 10:30 o'clock in the morning, in the Municipality of Brooke's Point, Province of Palawan and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously, while on board Fishing Vessel Prince Arnold, fished off the waters of Brooke's Point using the method of 'Muro-Ami' which required diving and other physical and mechanical, acts to pound and destroy coral reefs and other fishery marine habitats to entrap, gather or catch fish and other fishery species. There is no mistaking that the foregoing excerpt from the Information charges petitioner with taking a direct part in the commission of muro-ami fishing by allegedly being on board the vessel. She was not indicted as an officer or a director of ASB nor as the owner of the said vessel. ... As the Information had charged her with active participation in the offense, allegedly having been on board the vessel at the time of its commission, her defense should naturally revolve around her actual and physical role in the commission thereof. During trial, she was able to establish that she did not have a direct hand in the commission of the offense. Contrary to the allegation in the Information, petitioner was not even on board the vessel when the offense was committed. This should thus suffice to acquit her of the charges. ... Nowhere in the Information was she charged as treasurer, director, operator, or owner of F/V Prince Arnold, and thus she could not be convicted in such capacity. To do otherwise would be the same as disregarding her constitutional rights as an accused in a criminal prosecution.","WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant petition is hereby GRANTED. The Decision dated March 14, 2019 and the Resolution dated September 20, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 39682 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Petitioner Encarnacion Go is ACQUITTED of the crime of violation of Section 92 of Republic Act No. 8550."
"G.R. No. 248852, March 09, 2022","ATTY. RIZA S. FERNANDEZ, PETITIONER, VS. WILLIE FERNANDO MAALIW, RESPONDENT.","On September 28, 1999, respondent Willie Fernando Maaliw (Maaliw) filed a Complaint [6] for grave misconduct, oppression, dishonesty, negligence, and violation of Republic Act No. (RA) 6713 [7] and the Civil Service Law [8] against Danilo A. Longasa (Longasa), his co-employee and a Special Investigator assigned at the Security and Transport Department of the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) in Makati City. The complaint was submitted for decision on January 21, 2000 after Longasa appeared and submitted his affidavit. [9] On June 16, 2014, or more than 14 years after the complaint was submitted for decision, the CSC-National Capital Region (CSC-NCR) rendered a Decision [10] dismissing Maaliw's complaint for being insufficient in form. By reason of the delay in the promulgation of his complaint against Longasa, respondent Maaliw filed a Complaint Affidavit [11] dated November 9, 2015 against Fernandez and Dir. Castillo for neglect of duty and violation of RA 6713. On August 31, 2016, the CSC rendered the assailed Decision [13] dismissing Maaliw's complaint against Fernandez and Dir. Castillo. Maaliw moved for reconsideration [14] but the same was denied in a Resolution [15] dated December 16, 2016. This prompted Maaliw to file a Petition for Review [16] with the CA. On January 14, 2019, the CA rendered its Decision, [17] finding respondents Director Lydia Alba-Castillo and Atty. Riza S. Fernandez GUILTY of SIMPLE NEGLECT OF DUTY and is ( sic ) directed to pay a FINE equivalent to their salary for three (3) months in lieu of suspension.","WHEREFORE , the petition for review on certiorari is GRANTED. The Decision dated January 14, 2019 and Resolution dated July 26, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 149279 are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The Decision dated August 31, 2016 and the Resolution dated December 16, 2016 of the Civil Service Commission in CC-D-2015-021 are hereby REINSTATED.","The Petition is impressed with merit. x x x This Court finds that Maaliw availed of the correct remedy to question the CSC Decision and Resolution. x x x Respondent Maaliw has the requisite personality to file an appeal before the CA to question the CSC Decision and Resolution x x x However, the Court of Appeals deprived petitioner Fernandez of due process when she was administratively sanctioned despite the lack of a Formal Charge, as required by the CSC's RRACCS. x x x This notwithstanding, We deem it proper to absolve Fernandez of liability for the 14-year delay in resolving Maaliw's complaint against Longasa, in view of the attendant undisputed facts of the instant case.

"A.M. No. MTJ-22-007 (Formerly OCA IPI No. 19-3026-MTJ), March 09, 2022","MARCELINO ESPEJON[•] AND ERICKSON CABONITA,[••] COMPLAINANTS, VS. HON. JORGE EMMANUEL M. LORREDO, PRESIDING JUDGE, METROPOLITAN TRIAL COURT, MANILA, BRANCH 26, RESPONDENT.","In their verified Complaint[1] dated January 7, 2019, complainants Marcelino Espejon and Erickson Cabonita (complainants) charged Judge Jorge Emmanuel M. Lorredo (Judge Lorredo), Presiding Judge of Branch 26 of the Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC) of Manila of prejudging Civil Case No. M-MNL-18-08450-SC,[2] and of bias and partiality. Civil Case No. M-MNL-18-08450-SC involved a case for unlawful detainer filed by Myrna Alcantara,[3] et al. against herein complainants and was presided by Judge Lorredo.[4] Complainants alleged that during the preliminary conference, Judge Lorredo made remarks showing his prejudgment of the case and obvious bias and partiality against them and their sexual orientation. They also averred that Judge Lorredo's treatment and conduct of Civil Case No. M-MNL-18-08450-SC was heavily influenced by his religious beliefs and impressions about homosexuality which he irrelevantly tried to relate to the case.[5] Consequently, complainants filed a Motion for Voluntary Inhibition[6] against Judge Lorredo on the charge of bias and partiality. Judge Lorredo, however, denied the motion.[7] Subsequently, he issued a Decision[8] on Civil Case No. M-MNL-18-08450-SC which was unfavorable to complainants. While said decision was duly appealed by complainants,[9] they also filed the instant case against the actions of Judge Lorredo, particularly in the conduct of the preliminary conference in Civil Case No. M-MNL-18-08450-SC, for allegedly being contrary to Rule 1.02, Canon 1 of the Code of Judicial Conduct, as well as Sections 1, 4 and 5 of Canon 3 and Sections 1 and 2 of Canon 5 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct for the Philippine Judiciary[10] (New Code of Judicial Conduct).[11] In his Comment,[12] Judge Lorredo denied that he had prejudged Civil Case No. M-MNL-18-08450-SC during the preliminary conference and that he expressed the view that complainants were in a homosexual relationship. He maintained that as a Christian, he merely tries his best to guide lawyers and litigants who appear before his court to arrive at a settlement with the help of the Bible. He claimed further that he had, so far, settled 101 cases using the Bible.[13] Judge Lorredo expounded that the transcript of stenographic notes (TSN) would reveal that he was only warning complainants about God's punishment for those who violate His commandments. Citing Biblical passages, Judge Lorredo said he explained to complainants that refusing to vacate the property was tantamount to stealing the property rights of their landlord because they were depriving the latter of the enjoyment of his or her property rights.[14] Moreover, Judge Lorredo pointed out that complainants' own admission about the tolerance by their landlord of their possession of the property was evidence against them and was his basis in saying that they should therefore vacate the property.[15] Citing Biblical passages again, Judge Lorredo likewise argued that he merely reminded complainants that God hates homosexuality. He denied that it was he who expressed the view that complainants were in a homosexual relationship, but that, in fact the TSN would show it was one of the complainants who pointed to the other as a homosexual.[16]","The Court adopts the findings and recommendation of the JIB as to the administrative liability of Judge Lorredo, with modifications. While the Court agrees with the JIB that Judge Lorredo committed violations of the New Code of Judicial Conduct when he presided over the preliminary conference in Civil Case No. M-MNL-18-08450-SC, these violations do not amount to the grave offense of gross misconduct. Instead, the Court finds that the proper nomenclatures of the violations of Judge Lorredo are conduct unbecoming and simple misconduct, as well as work-related sexual harassment under Civil Service Commission (CSC) Resolution No. 01-0940.[22] ... The Court finds Judge Lorredo administratively liable for his improper remarks and overbearing demeanor and unwarranted acts during the preliminary conference in Civil Case No. M-MNL-18-08450-SC; and for allowing his religious beliefs to impair his judicial functions. While these offenses violate relevant Canons of the New Code of Judicial Conduct, the Court, to reiterate, does not find that they rise to the level of gross misconduct.","The Court finds Judge Lorredo administratively liable for his improper remarks and overbearing demeanor and unwarranted acts during the preliminary conference in Civil Case No. M-MNL-18-08450-SC; and for allowing his religious beliefs to impair his judicial functions. While these offenses violate relevant Canons of the New Code of Judicial Conduct, the Court, to reiterate, does not find that they rise to the level of gross misconduct. ... Judge Lorredo's overbearing demeanor and unwarranted acts during the preliminary conference in Civil Case No. M-MNL-18-08450-SC and improper foisting of his religious beliefs in the conduct of his judicial functions constitute simple misconduct. On the other hand, his inappropriate remarks during the same proceedings and in his Comment in this case constitute conduct unbecoming and work-related sexual harassment under CSC Resolution No. 01-0940. ... Considering that this is Judge Lorredo's second administrative offense, the Court deems it reasonable to impose against him the penalties of fine in the amounts of P40,000.00 for simple misconduct, and P10,000.00 for conduct unbecoming and for failing to live up once again to the degree of propriety required of him under Canon 4 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct. The Court farther resolves to suspend Judge Lorredo for thirty (30) days without pay, in accordance with CSC Resolution No. 01-0940.","WHEREFORE, the Court finds respondent Judge Jorge Emmanuel M. Lorredo, Presiding Judge, Metropolitan Trial Court, Manila, Branch 26, GUILTY of simple misconduct for which he is FINED in the amount of P40,000.00; and of conduct unbecoming of a judge for which he is FINED in the amount of P10,000.00. Judge Jorge Emmanuel M. Lorredo is also found GUILTY of sexual harassment classified as a less grave offense under Section 53(B)(3), Rule X of Civil Service Commission Resolution No. 01-0940, and is accordingly SUSPENDED for thirty (30) days without pay. He is further STERNLY WARNED that a repetition of the same or similar acts in the future shall be dealt with more severely. SO ORDERED."
"A.C. No. 10297, March 09, 2022","GERTRUDES MAHUNOT ANG @ GERTRUDES M. SIMONETTI, COMPLAINANT , VS. ATTY. LORD M. MARAPAO, RESPONDENT .","In the years 1998 and 1999, Atty. Marapao represented Gertrudes' husband, Venancio Ang (Venancio), in the various criminal cases filed by Venancio against Gertrudes for bigamy, adultery, concubinage, perjury, libel, numerous counts of violation of Commonwealth Act No. 142, and several counts of falsification of public and commercial documents. The cases were eventually dismissed as Gertrudes and Venancio reconciled, paving the way for Gertrudes to hire Atty. Marapao as her lawyer in the two cases of Estafa and/or violation of Batas Pambansa (BP) No. 22 which she filed against Rosita Mawili (Rosita) and Genera Legetimas (Genera) on 3 December 2001 and 10 December 2001, respectively. Eight years later, or, on 1 December 2009, Gertrudes was entangled in another court litigation. This time, she was sued by Eufronia Estaca Guitan (Eufronia) and Victoria Huan (Victoria) for Declaration of Nullity of a Public Document (Deed of Absolute Sale) and a Private Document (Acknowledgment Receipt of Partial Payment with Undertaking), Subrogation, and Damages with Urgent Prayers for the Issuance of the Writs of Preliminary Prohibitory and Mandatory Injunction, docketed as Civil Case No. 7688 before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Tagbilaran City, Bohol. As it happened, Gertrudes discovered that Atty. Marapao appeared as counsel for Eufronia and Victoria in the said civil case. Meanwhile, from 2009 to 2011, Atty. Marapao continued to render legal services in favor of Eufronia and the latter's niece, Rosario Galao Leyson (Rosario). More tellingly, Atty. Marapao had assisted Eufronia and Rosario in lodging more than thirty (30) criminal cases against Gertrudes – again for various crimes involving falsification of public and private documents, perjury, violation of the ""Anti-Alias Law,"" and violation of the National Building Code. Dismayed, Gertrudes denounced Atty. Marapao's propensity of filing frivolous suits. She accused him of violating the Lawyer's Oath, decrying that his act of representing Eufronia, Victoria, and Rosario in the cases filed against her transgressed the ethical injunction which prohibits lawyers from engaging in any conflict of interest given that she was a former client of Atty. Marapao. Gertrudes bemoaned Atty. Marapao's failure to preserve the confidence and secrets of a client when he used privileged information to file cases against her eight years later. Atty. Marapao countered that the cases filed by Eufronia, Rosario, and Victoria against Gertrudes from 2009 to 2011 were clearly separate and distinct from the earlier cases filed by Gertrudes against Rosita and Genera in 2001, and different as well from the old cases filed by Venancio against Gertrudes in 1998 and 1999. Thus, any privileged communication reposed upon Atty. Marapao by Gertrudes was not used, utilized, or availed of by him in acting as lawyer for Eufronia, Rosario, and Victoria in the later cases. The IBP Board of Governors recommended the suspension of Atty. Marapao from the practice of law for one (1) year but only for the charge of conflict of interest.","The Court finds that there is dearth of evidence to prove that Atty. Marapao violated the rule on privileged communication. So, too, there is insufficient evidence to warrant a finding that he represented clients with conflicting interests. However, his established predilection to file numerous cases against his client's adversary is deplorable and cannot be countenanced. The Court punctiliously observed that Atty. Marapao failed to exhibit that degree of ethical temperament in the manner by which he facilitated the bombardment of civil and criminal cases against Gertrudes. The sheer number of cases filed by Atty. Marapao against his clients' adversaries unfortunately bordered on harassment and power play.","IN LIGHT OF THE FOREGOING DISQUISITION, petitioner Atty. Lord M. Marapao is hereby ADMONISHED to be more circumspect in the performance of his duties as an officer of the Court. He is STERNLY WARNED that a similar infraction in the future shall be dealt with more severely.",SO ORDERED.
"A.C. No. 7121 (Formerly CBD Case No. 04-1244), March 08, 2022","EMILIANI WILFREDO R. CRUZ AND CARLOS R. CRUZ, COMPLAINANTS, V. ATTY. EVELYN BRUL-CRUZ AND ATTY. GRACELDA N. ANDRES, RESPONDENTS.","Complainants are among the compulsory heirs of the spouses Carlos Galman Cruz, Sr. (Carlos, Sr.) and Emiliana de la Rosa Cruz (Emiliana) (collectively, spouses Cruz). During their lifetime, the spouses Cruz acquired several properties including seven parcel of lands located in Meycauayan, Bulacan and covered by Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. (TCT) T-93571, T-93572, T-93573, T-93574, T-93575, T-93576, and T-93577 (Meycauayan properties). These titles were registered in the names of the spouses Cruz since 1968. [2] On May 29, 1974, Emiliana died intestate. Four years after her demise, or in 1978, Carlos, Sr. married respondent Atty. Evelyn. [3] When Carlos, Sr. died on January 14, 1988, the properties in his and Emiliana's names remained undivided as neither a judicial nor an extrajudicial partition was executed by their heirs. [4] However, complainants discovered sometime in 2000 that the Meycauayan properties became subjects of an expropriation case entitled ""Republic of the Philippines represented by the Toll Regulatory Board v. Sps. Engracio & Ana Angeles, et al."" filed before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Malolos, Bulacan and docketed as Civil Case No. 771-M-2000. [5] Among the respondents in Civil Case No. 771-M-2000 were the spouses Cruz. Complainants were surprised when they found out that Atty. Evelyn knew about the case, and yet, she did not inform them. Instead, she actively participated and misrepresented herself and her own children with Carlos, Sr. as the alleged sole heirs. [6] Complainants were also surprised to know that respondent Atty. Gracelda, a relative of Atty. Evelyn, acted as counsel of their parents in the proceedings without their authority. They claimed that it was highly impossible for Atty. Gracelda to represent the spouses Cruz since they had long passed away. Notably, Atty. Gracelda filed an Answer [7] dated January 9, 2001, a Compliance [8] dated October 17, 2002, and a Manifestation [9] dated November 6, 2002 on behalf of the spouses Cruz. Atty. Evelyn, represented by Atty. Gracelda, also filed a petition for issuance of owner's duplicate title of the Meycauayan properties. [10] In the petition, she alleged that the said lands were assigned to her pursuant to an agreement among the heirs of the spouses Cruz. Atty. Evelyn further claimed that she possessed the titles of the subject properties but she lost them when she transferred residence. She presented an affidavit of loss to support her claim. [11] Interestingly, Atty. Evelyn did not testify during the trial. Instead, it was her daughter, Evecar Cruz, who took the witness stand on her behalf by virtue of a purported Special Power of Attorney [12] dated June 6, 2002. [13] Complainants claimed that they never assigned the subject lands to Atty. Evelyn. Moreso, the titles of the Meycauyan properties remained in the possession of Carlos Cruz, Jr. (Carlos, Jr.) hence, were not lost as claimed by Atty. Evelyn and Atty. Gracelda. Complainants also insisted the lands had not been partitioned among the heirs. [14] Complainants, thus, subsequently filed criminal complaints for perjury and an administrative complaint against Atty. Evelyn for making false testimonies in the affidavit of loss, which was the basis of the petition for issuance of owner's duplicate of titles. [15] The petition for issuance of duplicate title was eventually dismissed by the trial court pursuant to an ex-parte motion for its withdrawal by Atty. Evelyn. [16] Consequently, complainants sought the disbarment of respondents. Complainants also averred that a complaint against Atty. Evelyn was filed before the Presidential Anti-Graft Commission (PAGC) for falsification of her Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Net Worth (SALN) for failure to declare her property located at Las Piñas City in violation of Republic Act No. (RA) 3019 (RA 3019) or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, and RA 6713 or the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Employees. The PAGC later found Atty. Evelyn guilty of falsification of her 1999, 2000 and 2002 SALNs and meted her the penalty of dismissal from service, which dismissal was subsequently downgraded to a mere suspension. [17] Complainants also claimed: that Atty. Gracelda, being the Deputy Executive Director of the Legal Affairs Bureau in the House of Representatives, unlawfully appeared in the expropriation case as the opposing party is the government itself which employed her. [18] In a Joint Answer, [19] Atty. Evelyn asserted that she owned the Meycauayan properties. These were her share in the inheritance from her late husband, Carlos, Sr., as stated in a June 1, 1991 letter [20] written by Carlos, Jr. Hence, Atty. Evelyn had been diligently paying their real property taxes from the time her possession thereof commenced. [21] Atty. Evelyn also admitted that complainants were not aware of the expropriation proceedings of the Meycauayan properties as these were already under her administration even while Carlos, Sr. was still alive. [22] On the charge of perjury, Atty. Evelyn averred that she did not falsify her affidavit of loss that was attached to the petition for issuance of duplicate of titles as she believed that the titles of the subject properties were in her possession. [23] On the other hand, Atty. Gracelda claimed that she represented Atty. Evelyn and not the spouses Cruz in the expropriation case. The spouses Cruz' names were only inadvertently included in the manifestation and compliance by her secretary who merely copied their names in the computer file while preparing the pleadings. [24]","The Court adopts the findings of the OBC but modifies its recommended penalties against Atty. Evelyn and Atty. Gracelda. A thorough evaluation of the records of the case at bench shows substantial evidence that both respondents are administratively liable. The Court is not convinced by Atty. Evelyn's claim that she owned the Meycauayan properties. Her assertion that the properties were part of her inheritance was solely anchored on the June 1, 1991 letter of Carlos, Jr. to the heirs. However, a reading of the letter disclosed that it was a mere proposal to partition the properties of the spouses Cruz, which include the Meycauayan properties. [55] Atty. Evelyn's claim that the heirs have already arrived at a settlement was a bare allegation and unsupported by any proof. By filing a petition for issuance of duplicate copies of titles of the Meycauayan properties, Atty. Evelyn misled the court when she stated that the subject properties were already appropriated to her. She even consented to her daughter testifying on her behalf on the purported assertions that the titles were in her (Atty. Evelyn's) possession but were lost when she transferred residence. However, this was wholly negated by the complainants who showed that the titles were actually their possession. Confronted with this, Atty. Evelyn immediately caused the withdrawal of the petition and sought to finalize the partition of the estate. These acts of Atty. Evelyn, as correctly observed by the OBC, clearly show that Atty. Evelyn resorted to lying in order to mislead the court that the Meycauayan properties were already appropriated to her. Clearly, Atty. Evelyn intentionally and deliberately made untruthful statements. Her willful attempt to deceive the courts, especially this Court, in making it appear that she already owned the Meycauayan properties through inheritance when she was fully aware that no final partition of the estate has yet been made, is a mockery of the administration of justice, which we cannot condone. She intentionally employed deceit and lies to deceive the court. She used her legal knowledge and expertise as weapons to advance her own interests and selfish motives, and not to protect the integrity and trust of the public in the law and the courts. Atty. Evelyn's contemptuous acts constitute grave misconduct which is defined as ""improper or wrong conduct, the transgression of some established and definite rule of action, a forbidden act, a dereliction of duty, willful in character, and implies a wrongful intent and not mere error in judgment."" [60] Her acts do not only speak of grave misconduct, but are also tantamount to deception, falsehood, and misuse of court processes. It is therefore clear that she transgressed Canons 1, 7, and 10, and Rules 1.01, 1.02, 7.03, 10.01, 10.02, and 10.03 of the CPR, to wit: CANON 1 — A LAWYER SHALL UPHOLD THE CONSTITUTION, OBEY THE LAWS OF THE LAND AND PROMOTE RESPECT FOR LAW AND FOR LEGAL PROCESSES. Rule 1.01 — A lawyer shall not engage in unlawful, dishonest, immoral or deceitful conduct. Rule 1.02 — A lawyer shall not counsel or abet activities aimed at defiance of the law or at lessening confidence in the legal system. x x x x CANON 7 — A LAWYER SHALL AT ALL TIMES UPHOLD THE INTEGRITY AND DIGNITY OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION, AND SUPPORT THE ACTIVITIES OF THE INTEGRATED BAR. x x x x Rule 7.03 — A lawyer shall not engage in conduct that adversely reflects on his fitness to practice law, nor shall he, whether in public or private life, behave in a scandalous manner to the discredit of the legal profession. CANON 10 — A LAWYER OWES CANDOR, FAIRNESS AND GOOD FAITH TO THE COURT. Rule 10.01 — A lawyer shall not do any falsehood, nor consent to the doing of any in Court; nor shall he mislead or allow the Court to be misled by any artifice. Rule 10.02 — A lawyer shall not knowingly misquote or misrepresent the contents of a paper, the language or the argument of opposing counsel, or the text of a decision or authority, or knowingly cite as law a provision already rendered inoperative by repeal or amendment or assert as a fact that which has not been proved. Rule 10.03 — A lawyer shall observe the rules of procedure and shall not misuse them to defeat the ends of justice. Further, Atty. Evelyn breached the Lawyer's Oath as she failed to adhere to her sworn duties. The Court, on the other hand, finds Atty. Gracelda guilty of engaging in the practice of law without the written authority from the House of Representatives (HoR). There is no evidence on record showing that Atty. Gracelda was authorized to engage in private practice and to represent the spouses Cruz and/or Atty. Evelyn in the expropriation proceedings and the petition for issuance of duplicate titles cases. Thus, the Court could only surmise that Atty. Gracelda did not have the requisite authority to engage in a limited practice of law during the periods she filed the pleadings on behalf of Atty. Evelyn. Undoubtedly, Atty. Gracelda engaged in an unauthorized practice of law in violation not only of the CPR but pertinent laws. Anent the allegation that Atty. Gracelda appeared as counsel of the spouses Cruz without authority, the Court finds the same to be simply misplaced. The Court determined that the wordings that she was the ""Counsel for Defendant Sps. Carlos Cruz and Emiliana Cruz"" were mere inadvertence and typing errors on the part of Atty. Gracelda's secretary. Thus, Atty. Gracelda is only administratively liable for unauthorized practice of law.","WHEREFORE, the Court finds respondent Atty. Evelyn Brul-Cruz GUILTY of grave misconduct in violation of Canons 1, 7, and 10, and Rules 1.01, 1.02, 7.03, 10.01, 10.02, and 10.03 of the Code of Professional Responsibility and the Lawyer's Oath. She is, thus, hereby SUSPENDED from the practice of law for a period of six months effective immediately upon receipt of this Decision. Respondent Atty. Evelyn Brul-Cruz is DIRECTED to immediately file a Manifestation to the Court that her suspension has started, copy furnished all courts and quasi-judicial bodies where she has entered her appearance as counsel.

"G.R. No. 215925, March 07, 2022","ESPERANZA P. GAOIRAN, PETITIONER, VS. THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS, BRANCH 12 OF THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT OF ILOCOS NORTE, SPS. TIMOTEO S. PABLO AND PERLITA PABLO, MARY NYRE DAWN S. ALCANTARA, AND REGISTER OF DEEDS OF LAOAG CITY, RESPONDENTS.","The property subject of the instant petition is a 275-square meter parcel of land situated in Barangay Poblacion San Miguel & San Pedro, City of Laoag, covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. (TCT) T-34540 issued under the name of respondent Perlita S. Pablo (Perlita), married to Timoteo Pablo (Timoteo). Petitioner alleged that on September 22, 2009, her friends introduced to her a certain Timoteo H. Pablo, Jr. who was allegedly looking for a buyer of a land registered under the name of his wife, Perlita S. Pablo. Timoteo offered for sale the subject property to petitioner and her husband. Timoteo was able to convince petitioner to purchase the said property upon the representation that he was authorized by his wife, Perlita to sell the same. On the same day, petitioner delivered the purchase price to Timoteo in the amount of P500,000.00 and in exchange, Timoteo surrendered the first owner's duplicate copy of TCT T-34540 to petitioner and undertook to deliver a deed of absolute sale signed by his wife on or before October 22, 2009. Timoteo, however, did not make good his promise. Demands were made by petitioner upon Timoteo to return the amount of P500,000.00 or to deliver the appropriate deed of conveyance, but to no vail. This prompted petitioner to institute before the Office of the City Prosecutor of Laoag City a complaint for Estafa against Timoteo. On June 8, 2012, petitioner executed an affidavit of possession with notice of lis pendens and brought the same to the Register of Deeds of Laoag City (RD-Laoag) for annotation of an adverse claim in TCT T-34540. However, the RD-Laoag advised her that the said complaint, being criminal and not civil in nature, cannot be annotated in the original certificate of title. Meanwhile, on the claim that the owner's duplicate copy of the subject property's title was missing, respondent Mary Nyre Dawn Alcantara (Mary), representing herself as the niece of respondent Perlita, and the latter's trustee of TCT T-34540, filed before the RTC of Laoag City on June 25, 2012 a petition praying that the owner's duplicate copy of TCT T-34540 that had been lost be declared as null and void. She likewise prayed for the issuance of a second owner's duplicate copy of TCT T-34540. Finding sufficient, competent and credible evidence in support of the petition for issuance of a new owner's duplicate certificate of title, the RTC of Laoag City, Branch 12, in a Decision dated August 28, 2012, ordering the issuance of a second owner's duplicate copy of TCT T-34540. Pursuant to which, the RTC of Laoag City declared the lost owner's duplicate copy as null and void. On May 17, 2013, petitioner instituted before the CA a petition for annulment of judgment seeking to annul the August 28, 2012 Decision of the RTC of Laoag City, which granted Mary's petition for the issuance of a second owner's duplicate copy of TCT T-34540. Petitioner averred that it was only on April 10, 2013, upon her inquiry with the RD-Laoag about the status of the aforesaid title, that she discovered that a second owner's duplicate copy of TCT T-34540 was issued in favor of Perlita pursuant to an affidavit of loss executed by Mary on June 14, 2012, attesting to the loss of the first owner's duplicate copy of TCT T-34540, which she registered with the RD-Laoag. In view of the foregoing incidents, petitioner filed the aforesaid petition for annulment of judgment before the CA on the grounds of extrinsic fraud and lack of jurisdiction. Essentially, she contended that the reconstituted title was obtained by the respondents by means of fraud and deceit. She further argued that the RTC had no jurisdiction to issue a new title as the first owner's duplicate copy of TCT T-34540 was never lost, and in fact, is in her possession all along.","On August 15, 2014, the CA dismissed the petition for annulment of judgment declaring that a petition under Rule 47 of the Rules of Court cannot be used to impugn the second owner's duplicate certificate of title which was issued in the reconstitution proceeding before the trial court for to do so would constitute a collateral attack upon the issued certificate of title which is sanctioned by Section 48 of Presidential Decree No. (PD) 1529. The dispositive portion of the CA's Decision reads: Accordingly, in view of the foregoing premises, and consistent with the caveat in the first paragraph of Section 5, Rule 47 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, the Petition for Annulment of Judgment is hereby DISMISSED.","The petition is meritorious. The Court resolves to give due course to her petition and rule on the merits thereof, notwithstanding the procedural lapse of filing a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 instead of Rule 45, in the interest of justice. The Court finds that the CA erred in denying petitioner's petition for annulment of judgment. Under Section 109 of PD 1529, for an order of reconstitution to be issued, it must be clearly shown that the certificate of title had been lost or destroyed. If a certificate of title has not been lost, but is in fact in the possession of another person, then the reconstituted title is void and the court that rendered the decision had no jurisdiction. Indubitably, the fact of loss or destruction of the owner's duplicate certificate of title is crucial in clothing the RTC with jurisdiction over the judicial reconstitution proceedings. Petitioner clearly alleged in her petition before the CA that, contrary to the claim of Mary in the reconstitution proceeding, the owner's duplicate copy of TCT T-34540 was not really lost, as the same was surrendered to her by Timoteo and was in her possession all along. The alleged lost TCT was in fact offered in evidence by petitioner before the CA and private respondents did not contest the genuineness and authenticity of the same. Thus, with evidence that the first owner's duplicate copy of TCT No. T-34540 was not lost but was actually in the possession of another, the RTC decision was null and void for lack of jurisdiction. The CA's application of the ruling in Sps. Lim was plainly misplaced because the issue here did not involve a collateral attack on ownership, but an annulment of judgment based on the RTC's lack of jurisdiction.","WHEREFORE, the petition is hereby GRANTED. The August 15, 2014 Decision and November 14, 2014 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 129945 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The August 28, 2012 Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Laoag City, Branch 12, in CAD Case No. 47-12 is ANNULLED and the new owner's duplicate certificate of title issued by authority of the said proceedings in lieu of Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-34540 is declared VOID. No costs. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 205189, March 07, 2022","HARTE-HANKS PHILIPPINES, INC., PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, RESPONDENT.","Harte-Hanks Philippines, Inc. (petitioner) is a domestic corporation providing outsourcing customer relationship management solutions. On March 23, 2010, petitioner filed a written application for refund or issuance of a tax credit for its excess and unutilized input value-added tax (VAT) for the first to second quarters of 2008 in the total amount of P5,471,506.55 with respondent CIR. The CIR did not act on the application. On June 29, 2010, petitioner filed a petition for review with the CTA Second Division, praying for the refund or issuance of a tax credit for P2,535,459.48. On October 4, 2010, the CIR filed a supplemental answer, praying that the petition for review be dismissed for failure of petitioner to exhaust administrative remedies, pursuant to Section 112 (C) of the 1997 Tax Code, and for lack of jurisdiction, as there has been no decision or inaction that is tantamount to a denial by the CIR and appealable to the CTA. The CTA Second Division dismissed the petition for review in a Resolution dated June 1, 2011, for having been prematurely filed, citing Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Aichi Forging Company of Asia, Inc., noting that the petition was filed before the lapse of the 120-day period. The CTA En Banc affirmed the dismissal in its Decision dated August 16, 2012.","The August 16, 2012 Decision and the December 11, 2012 Resolution of the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) En Banc in CTA EB Case No. 813 affirmed the CTA Second Division Resolutions in CTA Case No. 8124 dated June 1, 2011 and July 27, 2011, respectively, which affirmed the Commissioner of Internal Revenue's (CIR) motion to dismiss on the ground of premature filing.","The Court grants the petition for review. While the general rule under Section 112 (C) of the Tax Code, as explained in Aichi, mandates the observance of the 120 and 30-day periods as jurisdictional, there is an exception established by BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03, which is a general interpretative rule. This ruling created a 'window period' from December 10, 2003 up to October 6, 2010 (the date of promulgation of Aichi), during which taxpayers need not wait for the lapse of the 120-day period before filing a judicial claim with the CTA. Since the petitioner filed its written application on March 23, 2010 and its judicial claim on June 29, 2010 (98 days later), its filing occurred within the window period. Citing San Roque, the Court held that the BIR Ruling applies to all taxpayers who filed their judicial claims within the window period, even if they did not actually invoke BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 in any of their pleadings, and therefore, the CTA has jurisdiction over the judicial claim.","WHEREFORE, the petition for review is GRANTED.

"G.R. No. 205832, March 07, 2022","GORGONIO P. PALAJOS, PETITIONER, VS. JOSE MANOLO E. ABAD, RESPONDENT.","On February 25, 2006, Manolo and his siblings, namely, Ma. Jasmin E. Abad and Jose Roman E. Abad (collectively, plaintiffs), filed a complaint for forcible entry against Palajos, along with other individuals, namely, Geraldine Palarca, Fe Pilapil, Evelyn Adamiro, Henry Gutierrez, Michael Dagooc, Amaro Emberga, Francisco Oyao, Victor Bayudang, Simon Ayson, Ben Diaz, Nards Boagas, Gemina or ""Mina"" Tapid and Everlie Eguia (collectively, defendants), with the Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC) of Quezon City, Branch 38, docketed as Civil Case No. 06-35654. Plaintiffs claimed that they are the registered owners of three adjacent and contiguous parcels of land, more particularly described as Lot Nos. 5, 7 and 9 of Block 73, located at Pound Street, Phase 8, North Fairview, Quezon City, covered by Transfer Certificate of Title Nos. (TCT) N-213030, N-213028 and N-213029, with an aggregate area of 1,200 square meters (subject property), which they acquired from their parents in 1999. Sometime in September or October 2001, they took actual possession of the subject property and constructed a concrete perimeter fence around it. Plaintiffs claimed that on the third week of January 2006, they discovered that defendants, by means of force upon things, strategy and stealth and without their knowledge and consent, destroyed portions of the perimeter fence, entered the subject property and constructed their houses thereon, depriving plaintiffs of their possession. On the other hand, Palajos claimed that he entered Lot No. 5 of the subject property by virtue of a May 4, 1988 deed of absolute sale which B.C. Regalado & Co. executed in his favor. To further substantiate his claim of prior physical possession of Lot No. 5, he averred that: (i) he paid real property taxes as evidenced by receipt of payment on February 17, 2005 and January 21, 2006; (ii) he possesses proofs of billing of his Bayantel telephone which he had installed in his residence in the year 2004; and (iii) he was able to procure a Commission on Elections (COMELEC) registration application of his son, Ronald C. Palajos, dated October 24, 2003. The MeTC ruled in favor of plaintiffs finding that they had prior physical possession of the subject property since they constructed a concrete perimeter fence thereon sometime in September to October 2001. The Regional Trial Court (RTC) reversed the MeTC ruling, finding that the plaintiffs failed to prove prior actual physical possession. The Court of Appeals (CA) granted Manolo's petition and reversed the RTC ruling, reinstating the MeTC decision, finding that Manolo sufficiently proved that he had prior physical possession over the subject property. Aggrieved, Palajos filed the instant petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.","Challenged in this Petition for Review on
Certiorari
[1]
is the September 4, 2012 Decision
[2]
and the February 7, 2013 Resolution
[3]
of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 111323 holding that respondent Jose Manolo E. Abad (Manolo) had prior possession of the subject property than petitioner Gorgonio P. Palajos (Palajos) in the ejectment suit of forcible entry.","This Court finds that it is necessary to provisionally determine ownership of the subject property for purposes of determining prior possession. In the instant case, both the MeTC and the CA correctly found that Manolo and his siblings were able to establish that they are the registered owners of the subject property which they acquired from their parents in 1999. Although they did not immediately put the same to active use, but viewed in the light of the foregoing juridical acts, Manolo had been occupying the land since 1999. On the other hand, Palajos claims that his right to enter Lot No. 5 of the subject property was by virtue of a May 4, 1988 Deed of Absolute Sale which B.C. Regalado & Co. executed in his favor. However, We find that Palajos failed to substantially prove the same. With regard to the issue of prior physical possession, sometime in September or October 2001, Manolo and his siblings took actual possession of the subject property and constructed a concrete perimeter fence around it. On the other hand, Palajos' evidence of alleged prior possession of Lot No. 5 of the subject property - such as payment of real property taxes on February 17, 2005 and January 21, 2006, or proofs of billing of his Bayantel telephone which he had installed in his residence in the year 2004, or that he was able to procure a COMELEC registration application of his son on October 24, 2003 - are incidents that occurred after Manolo took possession of the subject property. Thus, this Court finds that Manolo had prior physical possession of the subject property. Anent the claim of prescriptive period, We find that the same was filed within one year from the time Manolo and his sibling discovered the clandestine entry of the defendants on the third week of January while the complaint was filed on February 23, 2006.","ACCORDINGLY, the instant petition is DENIED. The assailed September 4, 2012 Decision and February 7, 2013 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 111323 are hereby AFFIRMED."

JORGE BRUAL CONTRERAS, LOURDES BRUAL-NAZARIO, ERLINDA BRUAL-BINAY, RODOLFO BRUAL, RENATO BRUAL, VIOLETA BRUAL, DAVID DE JESUS AND ANTONIO DE JESUS, RESPONDENTS.","Fausta Brual (Fausta) remained single during her lifetime and was under the care of her nephew, Ireneo Brual, and his wife Elizabeth Brual (Elizabeth; petitioner). On July 22, 2009, Elizabeth, as instituted heir and co-executor, filed before the RTC a petition for probate of the last will and testament of the late Fausta. The special proceedings ensued. However, Jorge Brual Contreras, Lourdes Brual-Nazario, Erlinda Brual-Binay, Rodolfo Brual, Renato Brual, Violeta Brual, David De Jesus and Antonio De Jesus (respondents, collectively), as nephews and nieces of Fausta, filed a manifestation and motion for intervention and supplemental allegations (in support of the manifestation and motion to intervene) before the probate court. The respondents alleged that Fausta's testamentary act of supposedly leaving all her properties to Elizabeth and her husband was dubious. Elizabeth was a mere niece by affinity and a de facto guardian of the decedent. Hence, she and her husband should not have been made heir or executor. Respondents also averred that the petition for probate was defective in form since it did not contain the names, ages and addresses of decedent's blood relatives. Elizabeth filed her opposition to the motion and manifestation. The respondents answered it with a reply which Elizabeth countered with a rejoinder. On November 4, 2010, the RTC issued an Order/Resolution denying the respondents' motion for intervention and supplemental allegation. Respondents then filed their motion for reconsideration but it was denied by the RTC in its January 14, 2011 Order. Hence, on February 3, 2011, the respondents filed their notice of appeal of the November 4, 2010 Resolution/Order and January 14, 2011 Order. On April 27, 2011, the RTC issued an Order dismissing respondents' appeal due to their failure to file a record on appeal pursuant to Sections 2 and 3 of Rule 41 of the Rules of Court. Apart from respondents' procedural misstep, the RTC likewise held that a motion for intervention is addressed to the sound discretion of the court and, after its exercise of discretion, it cannot be reviewed by certiorari or controlled by mandamus, except when it was exercised in an arbitrary or capricious manner. Respondents filed their omnibus motion for reconsideration and admit records on appeal. They reasoned that their failure to submit a record on appeal together with their notice of appeal was due to inadvertence and excusable negligence. In its July 27, 2011 Resolution/Order, the RTC ultimately denied respondents' omnibus motion. Undeterred by the ruling of the RTC, respondents filed a petition for certiorari before the CA ascribing grave abuse of discretion on the part of the RTC in denying their appeal. The CA granted respondents' petition and reversed and set aside the RTC's dismissal of respondents' appeal, holding that an appeal must not be dismissed based on mere procedural technicalities. Elizabeth filed a motion for reconsideration but it was denied by the CA in its January 16, 2013 Resolution. Hence, this instant petition.","The CA granted respondents' petition and reversed and set aside the RTC's dismissal of respondents' appeal. It held that an appeal must not be dismissed based on mere procedural technicalities. The CA gave weight to respondents' admission that they were of the honest belief that the submission of a record of appeal would only come after the submission of a notice of appeal. The CA opined that the RTC should have instead required the respondents to complete their record on appeal. The CA also found that the respondents were not negligent and took into account their subsequent filing of a record on appeal. The dispositive portion of the assailed July 2, 2012 Decision reads: ""WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant petition is GRANTED. The Resolution/Order dated July 27, 2011 and the Order of the Regional Trial Court dated April 27, 2011 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. SO ORDERED.""","The Supreme Court ruled that the CA erred in liberally interpreting the mandatory rules of procedure on appeals. Under the Rules of Court applicable to special proceedings, specifically Rule 41, Sections 2 and 3, a party appealing a final order (such as the denial of a motion for intervention) must file both a notice of appeal and a record on appeal within thirty (30) days from notice of the judgment or final order. Respondents failed to file the record on appeal within the reglementary period (which expired on February 23, 2011, applying the fresh period rule). Their subsequent attempt to submit the record on appeal on June 27, 2011, claiming mere inadvertence and lack of knowledge, was deemed unacceptable, as compliance with rules on appeal is mandatory and jurisdictional. The failure to perfect the appeal within the prescribed time rendered the RTC's dismissal of the appeal final and immutable. The CA thus erred in finding that the RTC gravely abused its discretion.","WHEREFORE, the instant petition for review on certiorari is hereby GRANTED. The July 2, 2012 Decision and January 16, 2013 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 121515 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

"G.R. No. 214662, March 02, 2022","PHILIPPINE AIRLINES, INC. (PAL), PETITIONER, VS. FREDERICK YAÑEZ, RESPONDENT.","On May 7, 2008, Frederick Yañez, Supervisor of PAL Passenger Handling Division, received a notice regarding an alleged incident on May 6, 2008, where flight attendant Nova Sarte (Sarte) reported that Yañez inserted his hand in her right armpit, pressed her arm repeatedly, and touched the side of her breast. Sarte also claimed prior incidents of inappropriate touching. Yañez vehemently denied the charges, claiming he only tapped Sarte's shoulder twice. Yañez was formally charged with violating Article 51 of PAL's Revised Code of Discipline on Sexual Harassment. Yañez refused to apologize and requested transfer of venue for the administrative hearing from Pasay City to Mactan, Cebu. PAL offered airfare and accommodation but denied the venue transfer; Yañez did not attend the first hearing. At a subsequent hearing in Mactan, Yañez and his lawyers refused to testify and walked out after being denied a copy of the transcript from the Pasay hearing. The investigating committee found Yañez liable and recommended a three-month suspension, which PAL adopted. Yañez filed a Complaint for illegal suspension. The labor arbiter (LA) declared the suspension valid and reasonable, which the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) affirmed in toto. Yañez elevated the case. On March 14, 2013, the Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the NLRC, finding that PAL failed to observe procedural due process and did not comply with the requirements of RA No. 7877 (Anti-Sexual Harassment Act), noting that Yañez did not exercise authority or moral ascendancy over Sarte. PAL then elevated the case to the Supreme Court.","The Court finds that the CA erred in reversing the NLRC, and the NLRC did not gravely abuse of its discretion when it affirmed the findings of the LA. PAL observed due process and complied with the requirements of RA No. 7877 on the procedure for investigating sexual harassment complaints.","The Court ruled that PAL observed due process as Yañez was adequately apprised of the charges and given an opportunity to explain his side, but he chose not to be heard by refusing to attend or testify in scheduled hearings. The Court emphasized that the instant case is an administrative case, and under PAL's Revised Code of Discipline (Article 51), it is not necessary that sexual favors or advances are made to constitute sexual harassment; it is enough that the inappropriate conduct created a hostile, offensive, intimidating or uncomfortable work environment for Sarte. PAL substantially complied with Section 4 of RA No. 7877 by having its own Sexual Harassment Policy and Revised Code of Discipline and by creating an investigating committee following the parameters set forth by the law. The imposition of the three-month suspension was a valid exercise of management prerogative.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is GRANTED. The Court of Appeals Decision dated March 14, 2013, and Resolution dated September 25, 2014, in CA G.R. SP No. 05657 are REVERSED. Accordingly, the Decision dated September 22, 2010, and Resolution dated October 28, 2010 of the National Labor Relations Commission in NLRC Case No. VAC-07-000385-2010 are REINSTATED. Frederick Yañez's suspension for three (3) months is legal, and his claim for salary during the period of suspension as well as damages are dismissed."
"G.R. No. 251894, March 02, 2022","JOHNNY PAGAL Y LAVARIAS, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","In two separate Informations, Pagal was charged with violating Sections 11 and 12 of Republic Act No. 9165 (illegal possession of dangerous drugs and paraphernalia) under Crim. Case No. L-11269 and Crim. Case No. L-11270, respectively. The charges stemmed from a search and seizure conducted on October 17, 2016, at his residence in Basing, Lingayen, Pangasinan, based on Search Warrant No. 33-2016-L. The prosecution alleged that the search team found atop the television in the living room a Marlboro cigarette pack containing four small heat-sealed transparent plastic sachets with white crystalline substances (shabu, totaling 0.1 gram). They also found drug paraphernalia in his nephew's room. PO1 Saringan marked the items and conducted the inventory in the presence of Pagal, Kagawad Manuel, and media representative Toledo (who arrived late). The seized substances tested positive for shabu. Pagal denied the charges, claiming that at 5:00 a.m. on October 17, 2016, police officers ordered him, his nephew, and niece out of the house at gunpoint. He denied owning the seized items or smoking the specific cigarette brand. In a Joint Decision, the Regional Trial Court convicted Pagal only of illegal possession of dangerous drugs (Section 11, R.A. No. 9165) in Criminal Case No. L-11269, sentencing him to imprisonment ranging from twelve (12) years and one (1) day to seventeen (17) years and a fine of P300,000.00, applying the doctrine of constructive possession. He was acquitted in Criminal Case No. L-11270 (illegal possession of drug paraphernalia) because the RTC invalidated the search of the nephew's room due to failure to comply with the two-witness requirement under Rule 126, Section 8 of the Rules of Court. Pagal appealed, but the Court of Appeals affirmed the RTC's ruling, finding that he had full control and dominion over the seized items and dismissing his defense of denial and frame-up. The CA also found no significant break in the chain of custody despite deviations. Pagal filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari arguing that the Search Warrant lacked particularity, the prosecution failed to prove his knowledge of the drugs (found in a common area), and that the chain of custody was fatally broken.","The August 19, 2019 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 40744 affirmed the assailed Decision dated 20 September 2017 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 69 of Lingayen, Pangasinan convicting appellant for violation of Section 11, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165 in Criminal Case No. L-11269.","The Court upheld the validity of the Search Warrant, finding that petitioner waived his objection to its alleged lack of specific details since he failed to raise it before the trial court, and the description of the place was reasonably particular. The Court also noted that all the elements of illegal possession of dangerous drugs were technically present, as the confiscated drugs were found inside petitioner's house, raising the presumption of constructive possession. However, the Court ruled that the prosecution failed to discharge its burden of establishing guilt beyond reasonable doubt because the identity and integrity of the corpus delicti were not preserved, citing significant lapses in the chain of custody requirements under Section 21 of Republic Act No. 9165, as amended. Specifically, the Court found: (1) the two required witnesses (elected public official and media/NPS representative) were not present during the confiscation, tainting the seizure and marking; media representative Toledo arrived only 'when the search was about to finish.' (2) The marking was done 'outside the house'—a clear deviation from the requirement that inventory and photographing be conducted at the place where the search warrant is served, without justifiable explanation. (3) There was a gap in the second and third links, as the designated investigating officer (PO3 Naungayan) had no participation, and the seizing officer (PO1 Saringan) delivered the items. (4) The fourth link was not established, as there was no testimony from the interim records custodian (PO3 Manuel) regarding how the integrity of the corpus delicti was preserved prior to presentation in Court. Since the prosecution failed to provide a justifiable explanation for these deviations to invoke the saving clause, the integrity of the corpus delicti was compromised.","WHEREFORE, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is GRANTED. The August 19, 2019 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 40744 is REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Petitioner Johnny Pagal y Lavarias is ACQUITTED."
"G.R. No. 157719, March 02, 2022","REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, PETITIONER, VS. CLEMENTE TAPAY AND ALBERTO T. BARRION, AS THE LEGAL REPRESENTATIVE OF THE HEIRS OF THE DECEASED FLORA L. TAPAY,[1] RESPONDENTS.","Sometime in 1980, Flora and Clemente Tapay (respondents) filed an application for registration of Lot No. 10786, with an area of 684 square meters, before the RTC of Lipa City. They alleged that a certain Francisca Cueto had been in possession of the property since 1925 until it was sold to Teofila Lindog (Teofila), respondents' predecessor. When Teofila died intestate in 1971, respondents inherited the property. Respondents' application for registration was opposed by the Republic of the Philippines (petitioner) through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG). Petitioner argued that: (1) the documents submitted by respondents (such as the muniments of title, tax declaration, and receipt of tax payments) did not constitute competent evidence of acquisition of property; (2) neither did respondents' open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession of the land in the concept of an owner constitute the same; (3) respondents' claim of ownership based on a Spanish title or grant can no longer be availed of since respondents failed to file the appropriate application within the period set by Presidential Decree No. 892; and (4) the parcel of land applied for is part of public domain. During the course of the proceedings, the Land Registration Commission or LRC (now the Land Registration Authority or LRA) issued a report stating that based on the Books of Cadastral Lots, the lot was previously the subject of registration in another case—Cadastral Case No. 33, LRC (GLRO) Cadastral Record No. 1305—and had already been adjudicated to another person, but the cadastral court has yet to issue a decree of registration. The LRC, however, was unable to determine the identity of the person to whom the property was adjudicated to because the records of the case, including a copy of the decision, were not available. Despite the report of the LRC, the RTC adjudicated the land to the respondents in its May 28, 1982 Decision. After the Decision became final, the RTC directed the LRC to issue the decree of registration and the corresponding certificate of title. The LRC then submitted a supplemental report reiterating that the subject land was previously the subject of registration proceedings in Cadastral Case No. 33 and recommended that the cadastral court's decision be nullified so that it can issue a decree of registration in favor of respondents. Accordingly, respondents filed a motion to set aside the decision in Cadastral Case No. 33, which was granted in the August 14, 1996 Order of the RTC. Aggrieved, petitioner appealed to the CA, arguing that the RTC had no authority to set aside the decision of the cadastral court as it amounted to interference with the authority of another co-equal court.","The CA agreed with petitioner that generally, the RTC has no authority to nullify the decision of a co-equal court. However, the CA opined that this doctrine finds no application in this case considering that: (1) petitioner was unable to present the records of the cadastral case, (2) LRC admitted that it could not determine the identity of the party to whom the subject lot was adjudicated to, and (3) because the LRC, knowing that it could not execute the decision in the cadastral proceedings as it never attained finality, recommended that the decision be nullified by the RTC. The CA also considered that except for petitioner, no other person claimed ownership over the subject property. The fallo of the assailed Decision reads: WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing and finding no reversible error in the assailed August 14, 1996 Order of Branch 12, Regional Trial Court of Lipa City, Batangas, the herein appeal is DISMISSED for lack of merit and said Order is UPHELD and AFFIRMED.","The Court agrees with petitioner that a regional trial court has no power to nullify or interfere with the decision of a co-equal court pursuant to the law and the doctrine of judicial stability. However, the foregoing presupposes that Cadastral Case No. 33 really existed and that there actually is a decision in that case. Unfortunately for petitioner, aside from the single entry ""Cadastral Case No. 33, LRC (GLRO) Cadastral Record No. 1305,"" no other record, including a copy of the decision, exists to support the theory. Key information, such as the identity of the parties in the case and of the court that rendered the decision, as well as the outcome thereof, has remained unknown despite the lapse of more than 40 years since the LRC submitted its report. No one, aside from the Republic, has even come forward to claim any interest arising from the supposed case. The Court therefore agrees with the CA that the doctrine of judicial stability finds no application in this case. Practical considerations now demand that the proceedings in the RTC be no longer disturbed and the August 14, 1996 Order no longer set aside. Furthermore, the Court held that res judicata does not bar respondents' subsequent application, as petitioner failed to establish the elements of res judicata. Also, the August 14, 1996 Order of the RTC merely effectuated the May 28, 1982 Decision of the RTC; it did not amend the same, thus negating the argument regarding immutability of judgment.","WHEREFORE, the petition is hereby DENIED. The March 20, 2003 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 54088, is AFFIRMED. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 213673, March 02, 2022","IN RE: EX PARTE PETITION FOR ISSUANCE OF WRIT OF POSSESSION PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK, PETITIONER, VS. ALMA T. PLACENCIA FONTANOZA, RESPONDENT.","Spouses Salvador and Alma (Alma) Fontanoza obtained a loan from the Ozamiz Branch of the Philippine National Bank (PNB). To secure the loan, they mortgaged a parcel of land located at Barangay Dao, Mahayag, Zamboanga del Sur covered by Original Certificate of Title No. P-29979. Since the Fontanozas failed to pay, PNB foreclosed the property. On January 8, 2002, as the sole bidder in the public auction, PNB acquired the lot for P236,000.00. PNB registered the sale on January 28, 2002. However, the Fontanozas failed to redeem the property. More than nine years later, specifically on July 18, 2011, PNB filed an ex-parte petition for issuance of writ of possession before the RTC, which was docketed as SP Case No. 2011-50-090.","WHEREFORE, the appeal is GRANTED. The Order dated February 21, 2012 of the Regional Trial Court, 9th Judicial Region, Branch 23, Molave, Zamboanga del Sur, in Special Case No. 2011-50-090 is SET ASIDE. SO ORDERED.","The petition has merit. Generally, ""once title to the property has been consolidated in the buyer's name upon failure of the mortgagor to redeem the property within the one-year redemption period, the writ of possession becomes a matter of right belonging to the buyer. Consequently, the buyer can demand possession of the property at any time. Its right of possession has then ripened into the right of a confirmed absolute owner and the issuance of the writ becomes a ministerial function that does not admit of the exercise of the court's discretion. The court, acting on an application for its issuance, should issue the writ as a matter of course and without any delay."" In view of this finding, We find that the CA's reliance on the Barican case was indeed misplaced. To stress, although Alma is supposedly in possession of the property, she cannot be considered as a third party who held the property adversely to the judgment debtor or mortgagor simply because she herself was the mortgagor who failed to redeem the lot. This is notwithstanding PNB's delay, for reasons only known to it, in filing a petition for the issuance of a writ of possession. More importantly, PNB's right to the writ of possession is solidified by the fact that the RTC's order issuing the said writ has already become final and executory.","WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED. The assailed January 23, 2014 Decision and July 28, 2014 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 02836 are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

"G.R. No. 246929, March 02, 2022","NELSON M. CELESTINO, PETITIONER, VS. BELCHEM PHILIPPINES, INC., BELCHEM SINGAPORE PTE., AND/OR JASMIN D. SALVADOR, RESPONDENTS.","On June 22, 2012, respondent Belchem Singapore Pte. Ltd., through its local agent, respondent Belchem Philippines, Inc., hired petitioner Nelson M. Celestino as third officer for a period of nine months. Prior to his deployment, petitioner underwent routinary pre-employment medical examination (PEME). When asked whether he had or had been told he had suffered from, among others, any of the following conditions: heart trouble, diabetes mellitus, endocrine disorders, kidney or bladder trouble, he answered in the negative. He then got deployed on July 1, 2012. As third officer on board M/T Gandhi, petitioner maintained the operational readiness of life rafts and firefighting equipment, wrote navigational logs, operated navigational equipment, placed ship-to-shore communication, trained other seafarers to properly operate lifesaving and firefighting equipment, and supervised seafarers to clean, paint, and maintain the vessel. On December 8, 2012, petitioner experienced severe body discomfort with high fever, chills, and convulsions. Because his condition persisted despite medication, petitioner was admitted on December 11, 2012, at the Fiden Medical Center in Tema, Ghana, West Africa, where he was diagnosed as a ""Diabetic de Novo,"" or someone in the early stages of diabetes. After confinement and medication, he was repatriated on December 14, 2012. On the same day he arrived in the country, petitioner reported to Belchem Philippines, Inc. for post employment medical examination. He got referred to the company-designated medical facility, the Metropolitan Medical Center, Manila, where Dr. Kharen Frances Hao-Quan (Dr. Quan) attended to him. After the requisite laboratory examination, Dr. Quan issued an initial impression on December 18, 2012, noting that petitioner was suffering from ""Diabetes Mellitus"" and prescribing medication to manage the illness. Dr. Quan then advised him to return on January 3, 2013 for further treatment, and accordingly informed Belchem of his condition: Under the care of an endocrinologist, petitioner continued his treatment on January 8, 2013, and consulted a nephrologist on January 22, 2013. His laboratory examinations on both days showed elevated fasting blood sugar. Petitioner was, thus, advised to undergo continuous monitoring and check-up by the company-designated physicians until August 31, 2013. He consulted these physicians on March 5, April 22, May 21, and June 4, 2013. In the interim, or on May 9, 2013, Dr. Quan confirmed that petitioner was suffering from ""Diabetes Mellitus"" with incidental finding of ""Ureterolithiasis"". On July 1, 2013, petitioner filed a complaint for total and permanent disability benefits, damages, and attorney's fees against respondents. On September 2, 2013, or two months after filing the complaint, petitioner decided to consult his own physician, Dr. May S. Donato-Tan (Dr. Tan), who issued a medical certificate diagnosing him with permanent disability, thus: [Seafarer] Celestino had Extracorporeal Shockwave Lithotripsy Left and the procedure does not guarantee that the stones will not recur and a possibility of a recurrent stone formation can damage the parenchyma of the kidney's ureters, that's why the [Seafarer] Celestino is very apprehensive. He is also with BP Elevation coupled with the presence of DM Type II. He already had chest pain and the occurrence/presence of elevated BP and diabetes puts [Seafarer] Celestino at a high-risk situation. He is therefore given a permanent disability for he will not be able to do his job effectively, efficiently, and productively as a [Seafarer]. Petitioner alleged that his illnesses were work-related, having been acquired in the performance of his strenuous duties. Notably, his PEME initially declared him ""fit to work,"" but he is now unable to carry out his job as seafarer for more than 120 days from repatriation. Therefore, he should be deemed to have suffered total and permanent disability. Respondents, on the other hand, maintained that diabetes is a metabolic and genetic disease that is not work-related and not considered an occupational disease under settled jurisprudence, hence, not compensable. There is nothing in petitioner's work conditions or duties that would make him prone to either illness. Consequently, he would have developed those diseases regardless of whether he was deployed at sea as third officer. Petitioner also prematurely filed his claim since he did so without yet even seeking the opinion of his own physician; in fact, he was still undergoing treatment when he filed his complaint.",Is petitioner entitled to total and permanent disability benefits?,"At the outset, we note that the issue involves a question of fact and a recalibration of evidence. As a rule, the Court is not a trier of facts. It is not the Court's function to analyze evidence all over again because of the legal precept that factual findings of the Court of Appeals are conclusive and binding on this Court. As an exception though, the Court may proceed to resolve both factual and legal issues, when the factual findings of the Court of Appeals and the NLRC are contrary to the findings of the labor arbiter, as here. The complaint was not prematurely filed To recall, petitioner filed his complaint on July 1, 2013, which was only the 199th day from when he was first referred to the company-designated physician upon his repatriation on December 14, 2012. The Court of Appeals ruled that for failure of petitioner to wait for the final assessment of the company-designated physician within the 240-day period, no cause of action for total and permanent disability benefits had yet accrued. We do not agree. Orient Hope Agencies v. Jara [29] set out the guidelines to determine a seafarer's disability, viz.: The company-designated physician must issue a final medical assessment on the seafarer's disability grading within a period of 120 days from the time the seafarer reported to [them]; If the company-designated physician fails to give [their] assessment within the period of 120 days, without any justifiable reason, then the seafarer's disability becomes (total and permanent); If the company-designated physician fails to give [their] assessment within the period of 120 days with a sufficient justification (e.g., seafarer required further medical treatment or seafarer was uncooperative), then the period of diagnosis and treatment shall be extended to 240 days. The employer has the burden to prove that the company-designated physician has sufficient justification to extend the period; and If the company-designated physician still fails to give [their] assessment within the extended period of 240 days, then the seafarer's disability becomes permanent and total, regardless of any justification. Verily, if the company-designated physician still fails to give their assessment within the extended period of 240 days, then the seafarer's disability becomes permanent and total, regardless of any justification, as in this case. Here, petitioner got repatriated and referred to one of the company-designated physicians on December 14, 2012. He was told to return regularly during the succeeding months, which he heeded conscientiously. Thus, he went and consulted with at least three company-designated physicians on the same days set by the latter for that purpose. Thereafter, he was eventually told that his ""ongoing treatment"" shall last until August 31, 2013. Notably, however, the 240-day maximum period for assessment of petitioner's disability grading started on December 14, 2012, and already ended on August 11, 2013. The advice therefore of the company-designated physicians for petitioner to undergo further treatment to last until August 31, 2013, or 20 days beyond the 240-day period, was an effective declaration that his ""Diabetes Mellitus and Ureterolithiasis"" are permanent, and his disability, total. All told, petitioner cannot be faulted for filing his complaint on the 199th day of his ongoing treatment even before the lapse of the 240-day period, nor can he be faulted for acquiring a second opinion from his own physician only after he had already initiated his complaint. For even prior to such date, he was already deemed to be suffering from total and permanent disability when the company-designated physicians assessed that his treatment shall last well- beyond the 240-day maximum period. Petitioner is entitled to total and permanent disability benefits The employment of seafarers is governed by the contracts they enter into at the time of their engagement. So long as the contract is not contrary to law, morals, public order, or public policy, they have the force of law as between the parties themselves. The POEA Rules and Regulations require that the POEA-SEC be integrated in every seafarer's contract, therefore, it is also integrated into the provisions of petitioner's employment contract with respondents. The POEA-SEC provides that if the employee is suffering from any of the occupational diseases or illnesses listed under its Section 32(A), such disease is deemed to be work-related, provided the conditions set therein are satisfied. Section 20(B)(4) of the POEA-SEC, on the other hand, states that if the illness, such as ""Diabetes Mellitus,"" is not listed as an occupational disease under Section 32(A), there is still a disputable presumption that the ailment is work-related. This means that there is a legal presumption in favor of the seafarer that their illness is work-related, and the employer has the burden of presenting evidence to overcome such presumption. As third officer for respondents, petitioner performed duties that exposed him to various hazards and stresses. He was constantly placed in harsh conditions and exposed to perils of the sea. His work consisted of physically strenuous tasks that lasted anywhere from eight to sixteen hours a day. He was constrained to eat only food from the vessel that regularly consisted of preserved meats high in fats and cholesterol. On December 8, 2012, or after more than five months of rendering services for respondents, his body finally broke. He experienced severe fever, body aches, chills, and convulsions until he had to be brought to a hospital where he was diagnosed as ""Diabetic De Novo."" He was confined there for three days and had to be medically-repatriated back to the Philippines on December 18, 2012, where he was diagnosed by company-designated physicians with ""Diabetes Mellitus and Ureterolithiasis"" and was thereafter advised to undergo monitoring and check-up for the next several months until August 31, 2013, a span of 260 days. Notably, prior to assuming his duties as third officer, he was declared ""fit to work"" in his PEME. It was only during his work therein that he was diagnosed with ""Diabetes Mellitus"" and ""Ureterolithiasis"". While these illnesses are not listed as occupational diseases under Section 32(A) of the POEA-SEC, said ailments are still presumed to be work-related under Section 20(B)(4) of the contract. Respondents have the burden of overcoming such presumption. For their part, respondents merely argued that since it was petitioner who was claiming for total and permanent disability benefits, it was he (petitioner) who had the burden of evidence of proving such claim. In Zonio v. 88 Aces Maritime Services , [34] the Court ruled in favor of the compensability of ""Diabetes Mellitus"" that afflicted the seafarer, thus: As earlier stated, respondents herein failed to adduce any contrary medical findings from the company-designated physician to show that Apolinario's illness was not caused or aggravated by his working conditions on board the vessel. There was also no showing that Apolinario is predisposed to the illness by reason of genetics, obesity or old age. Such being the case, this Court considers that the stress and strains he was exposed to on board contributed, even to a small degree, to the development of his disease. Inasmuch as, compensability is the entitlement to receive disability compensation upon a showing that a seafarer's work conditions caused or at least increased the risk of contracting the disease, We find Apolinario's disease as compensable at bar. Similarly, during his employment as third officer, petitioner was assigned duties which were physically, mentally, and emotionally taxing due to its long hours of work. Too, during the 9-month duration of his employment, he was constrained to eat the high-fat, high-cholesterol food served in the ship. It was during this time that he developed his illnesses and had to be medically-repatriated due to its severity. As held in Flores v. Workmen's Compensation Commission , [36] ""Diabetes Mellitus"" is generally not compensable. It is, however, compensable in instances when it is complicated with other illnesses. Here, petitioner was diagnosed by the company-designated physicians with ""Diabetes Mellitus"" complicated with ""Ureterolithiasis"", [37] another illness previously deemed as compensable in GSIS v. Court of Appeals and Lilia S. Arreola . [38] Finally, respondents argue that the PEME presented by petitioner does not ipso facto mean that his illnesses were acquired during the term of his employment, hence, petitioner is deemed not to have proved that his illnesses are work-related. We disagree. Although a PEME is not conclusive proof to show that a seafarer is free from any ailment, the Court, in previous cases, has referred to the results of a PEME to conclude that a disability only arose during employment. In Magat v. Interorient Maritime Enterprises, Inc. , [39] the Court ruled that petitioner Alfredo Magat was entitled to permanent disability benefits when, after passing his PEME, he developed a heart ailment. Although nothing in the records showed that Magat contracted his illness aboard M/T North Star, the fact that petitioner passed his PEME without any finding that he had a preexisting heart ailment before boarding the vessel strongly indicates that such illness developed while he was on board the same vessel. Here, petitioner, too, passed his PEME prior to embarking on his duties and thereafter developed ""Diabetes Mellitus"" complicated with ""Ureterolithiasis."" This clearly creates the legal presumption that petitioner's illnesses are work-related. Respondents, however, were unable to overcome such presumption in favor of petitioner, thus, his illnesses are deemed work-related and compensable. Petitioner is entitled to attorney's fees Article 2208 of the New Civil Code provides that attorney's fees can be recovered in actions for the recovery of wages of laborers and actions for indemnity under employer's liability laws. It is also recoverable when the respondent's act or omission has compelled the complainant to incur expenses to protect their interest. Since these conditions are present here, the award of attorney's fees in favor of petitioner is warranted. This is in accord with the Court's pronouncement in Pastor v. Bibby Shipping Philippines, Inc . [40] Lastly, pursuant to C.F. Sharp Crew Management, Inc. v. Santos [41] and Nacar v. Gallery Frames [42] the Court imposes on the total monetary award, six percent (6%) legal interest per annum from finality of this Decision until full payment.","ACCORDINGLY, the Decision dated August 17, 2018 and Resolution dated March 12, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 145564 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The Decision dated June 4, 2015 of the Labor Arbiter is REINSTATED. Respondents Belchem Philippines, Inc. and Belchem Singapore Pte. Ltd. are ORDERED TO PAY jointly and solidarity petitioner Nelson M. Celestino the peso equivalent based on the exchange rate at the time of actual payment of US Dollar Ninety Thousand Eight Hundred Eighty-Two (US$90,882.00) representing his total and permanent disability benefits plus ten percent (10%) thereof as attorney's fees. Further, they shall pay six percent (6%) legal interest per annum of the total monetary amount from finality of this Decision until full payment. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 224935, March 02, 2022","ANTONIO U. SIO, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","In 2010, Police Senior Inspector Paulino G. Raguindin applied for a search warrant alleging that Antonio Sio (Sio) possessed shabu and was using a Toyota Camry with plate number ZYR 468 and a Honda Civic with plate number ZGS 763 in illegal trafficking, storing drugs at his Dalahican, Lucena City residence. The Manila Regional Trial Court issued the October 22, 2010 Search Warrant. On October 24, 2010, task force operatives implemented the search warrant, seizing an undetermined quantity of suspected shabu (later testing positive, totaling 116.16 grams), a .45 caliber Remington, two magazines, a CRV Honda vehicle with plate number XPX 792 and a Toyota Camry with plate number ZRY 758. Two separate Informations were filed against Sio for violating Sections 11 and 12 of Republic Act No. 9165. Sio filed an Omnibus Motion for Judicial Determination of Probable Cause and to Hold in Abeyance the Issuance of Warrant of Arrest, pointing to several infirmities, including the non-existence of one vehicle, the wrong plate numbers on the seized vehicles, implementation in Barangay Purok 3A instead of the warrant's specified address (Ilaya Ibaba, Purok 34, Barangay Dalahican, Lucena City), and the absence of Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency operatives, media person or barangay official when the police entered (the witnesses arrived three hours later). The Regional Trial Court denied the Omnibus Motion and ordered Sio's arrest. The Court of Appeals upheld the RTC's denial, finding no grave abuse of discretion. Sio then filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari before the Supreme Court.",The Petition for Review on Certiorari is GRANTED.,"This Court grants the Petition. The pieces of evidence seized from the unreasonable search and seizure are inadmissible. Without these, there is no probable cause for the filing of the Informations against petitioner Antonio U. Sio. The search was unreasonable because the police implemented the warrant at a different location (Barangay Purok 3A instead of Ilaya Ibaba, Purok 34) and seized property (vehicles with different plate numbers) not described in the warrant, defeating the specificity required by Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution. Moreover, the implementation failed to comply with Section 21 of Republic Act No. 9165, which mandates that the physical inventory and photograph be conducted immediately after seizure in the presence of the accused, a representative from the media, the Department of Justice (DOJ), and an elected public official. PS/Insp. Raguindin admitted that the required insulating witnesses (media and barangay officials) were not present when the search began, arriving three hours later, and it was not shown if a DOJ representative was present. Non-compliance with the basic requirements of Section 21, especially when an operation is conducted by virtue of a search warrant, is unjustifiable, rendering the seized evidence inadmissible.","The November 27, 2015 Decision and May 10, 2016 Resolution of the Court of Appeals, Manila, in CA-G.R. SP No. 135996 are REVERSED AND SET ASIDE. The pieces of evidence seized during the implementation of the October 22, 2010 Search Warrant are inadmissible. Consequently, Criminal Case Nos. 2011-789 and 2011-790 before Branch 59 of the Lucena City Regional Trial Court are DISMISSED. All items seized during the search are ordered to be RETURNED to petitioner Antonio U. Sio, except for the shabu and drug paraphernalia which are forfeited in favor of the State."
"G.R. No. 246127, March 02, 2022","ATTY. ROBERTO F. DE LEON, PETITIONER , VS. LOURDES S. ASOMBRADO-LLACUNA, RESPONDENT.","Lot 39 of Block 4 situated at No. 62 St. Mary, Provident Village, Marikina City (the subject property) was originally owned by Eusebio L. Lopez, Jr. (Lopez), as shown by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 186004. It was then developed by Provident Securities Corporation (Prosecor) under the subdivision project known as Provident Village. On July 5, 1983, Lourdes S. Asombrado-Llacuna (Lourdes) purchased the subject property from Prosecor. Thereafter, a Deed of Absolute Sale dated May 27, 1986 was executed by Prosecor... in favor of Lourdes. Notably, Lourdes and her family have lived in the subject property from the time it was acquired from Prosecor and until the present. However, despite full payment and the execution of the Deed of Absolute Sale, Prosecor failed to deliver the title of the subject property to Lourdes. Eventually, Prosecor was dissolved. On May 11, 1993, an Assignment of Mortgage involving the subject property was executed by Provident Savings Bank (PSB), represented by Atty. De Leon, as President thereof. Under the Assignment of Mortgage, PSB, as the assignor, assigned its rights and interests over the real estate mortgage covering the subject property (still under the name of Lopez) to J.M. Tuason & Co., Inc., the assignee. Sometime in the mid-1990s, Atty. De Leon resigned as President of PSB. Thereafter, on June 30, 1996, PSB was dissolved. In February 2012, Lourdes acquired a certified true copy of TCT No. 186004... She was surprised to find an annotation on TCT No. 186004 regarding the Assignment of Mortgage between PSB and J.M. Tuason & Co., Inc. Thereafter, on September 13, 2012 and September 20, 2012, Lourdes' counsel sent demand letters to Atty. De Leon, asking him to deliver TCT No. 186004 to Lourdes within five days. Atty. De Leon did not respond to these demand letters. On September 21, 2012, Lourdes filed a Complaint against Atty. De Leon and PSB before the HLURB, praying for the delivery of Transfer Certificate of Title No. 186004 in favor of Complainant; and payment for moral damages and Attorney's fee. The HLURB, through Arbiter Lorina Rigor, rendered a Decision which dismissed Lourdes' complaint for the following reasons: (1) the complaint was not filed against an indispensable party – Prosecor, the seller/developer of the subject property; and (2) the complaint failed to prove by any evidence that PSB, a banking institution, is the successor-in-interest of Prosecor. The HLURB Board of Commissioners denied Lourdes' verified petition for review. Lourdes filed a petition for review under Rule 43 before the CA.","WHEREFORE, the challenged Decision of HLURB Board of Commissioners is SET ASIDE. Let the case be REMANDED to the HLURB Expanded National Capital Region Field Office for the inclusion of Provident Securities Corporation (Prosecor) as an indispensable party-defendant and for the conduct of appropriate further proceedings.","This Court agrees with the CA that the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies indeed admits certain exceptions... In this case, and as aptly pointed out by the CA, the main issue raised by Lourdes in her petition for review before the CA is purely legal – whether the dismissal of the complaint by the HLURB Arbiter and the Board of Commissioners anchored on the failure of Lourdes to implead an indispensable party is correct or not. Thus, this Court finds that the CA did not err when it did not dismiss Lourdes' petition for review for failure to observe the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies, considering that such non-observance was justified. This Court likewise agrees with the CA's ruling that the failure to implead indispensable parties does not warrant the outright dismissal of the case. However, notwithstanding these correct observations by the CA, this Court finds that the CA erred when it did not affirm the dismissal of the HLURB case, but rather, ordered its remand to the HLURB. First, it is admitted that Prosecor has already been dissolved. Thus, ordering the inclusion of Prosecor as an indispensable party-defendant in the HLURB case is an exercise of futility... Second, there is no evidence that PSB is the successor-in-interest of Prosecor... Third, Lourdes likewise does not have any cause of action against Atty. De Leon, considering that Atty. De Leon was merely acting as the President of PSB, which, to reiterate, had no obligation to issue or deliver the title of the subject property to Lourdes. Following this well-settled rule that officers of a corporation are generally not liable for the obligations of the corporation, it is beyond cavil that Atty. De Leon cannot be made personally liable for Prosecor's failure to issue and deliver the title of the subject property to Lourdes. For these reasons, the Court finds the dismissal of the HLURB case proper.","WHEREFORE, the Petition for Review on Certiorari dated May 14, 2019 filed by Atty. Roberto F. De Leon is GRANTED. The Decision dated June 16, 2016 of the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board Board of Commissioners, insofar as it dismissed the complaint filed by Lourdes S. Asombrado-Llacuna against Atty. Roberto F. De Leon and Provident Savings Bank is REINSTATED."
"G.R. No. 247490, March 02, 2022","MA. LUISA ANNABELLE A. TORRES, RODOLFO A. TORRES, JR., AND RICHARD A. TORRES, PETITIONERS, VS. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, AND REGISTER OF DEEDS OF DAVAO CITY, RESPONDENTS.","On April 5, 1991, the Republic of the Philippines (Republic), through the Solicitor General, filed with Branch 8, Regional Trial Court (RTC Branch 8), Davao City a Complaint for Cancellation of Titles against spouses Leonora R. Caspar (Leonora) and Florencio Gaspar (Florencio) (collectively, Spouses Gaspar) and the Register of Deeds of Davao City praying for the cancellation of the free patents and the original certificates of titles (OCTs) issued pursuant thereto in the names of Spouses Gaspar and docketed as Civil Case No. 20,665-91. The RTC Branch 8, in its Decision dated April 20, 1999, found the free patent applications tainted with fraud and ordered the cancellation of their titles and the reversion of the lots to the government. This decision was affirmed by the CA on January 5, 2011, and the Supreme Court on February 6, 2012, and attained finality. During the execution stage, on June 30, 2015, the RTC Branch 8 issued an Order granting the Republic's motion for the cancellation of all derivative titles, including TCT Nos. T-304045, T-304046, T-304047, T-304048, and T-304050, registered in the names of petitioners Ma. Luisa Annabelle A. Torres, Rodolfo A. Torres, Jr. and Richard A. Torres, which are the derivatives titles of OCT No. P-0221. Petitioners filed a petition for the annulment of judgment under Rule 47 of the Rules of Court with the CA, alleging that they were not parties to the proceedings before the RTC, the RTC had not acquired jurisdiction over them, and they were denied due process. The CA dismissed the petition.","In the assailed Resolution dated July 27, 2018, the CA dismissed the petition for annulment of judgment that assailed the RTC Order dated June 30, 2015. It found the petition unavailing because the Order being assailed was issued during the execution stage for the enforcement of a final and executory decision being carried out by the RTC through its residual authority under Section 6, Rule 135 of the Rules of Court; and such Order is not a final judgment, order, or resolution contemplated under Rule 47. The CA made the ruling based on the doctrine of stare decisis et non quieta movere, citing the similar dismissal in Hsi Pin Liu, et al. v. Republic of the Philippines (CA-G.R. SP No. 07590-MIN). The CA denied petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration in its Resolution dated April 30, 2019.","The Court found no merit in the petition. Preliminarily, the Court held that while petitioners' counsel signed the verification and certification against forum shopping, there was substantial compliance as petitioners were working abroad and had executed Special Powers of Attorney designating counsel to sign on their behalf. As to the merits, the Court applied the doctrine of stare decisis, noting that the facts of the instant case were substantially the same as in Liu v. Republic (G.R. No. 231100), where the Court upheld the cancellation of other derivative titles emanating from the same RTC Order of June 30, 2015. The Court ruled that the RTC Order was not a final judgment, order, or resolution contemplated under Rule 47, but was issued by the RTC in exercising its residual authority under Section 6, Rule 135, necessary to execute its final Decision ordering the reversion of the lots to the government. Since the original titles of Spouses Gaspar were declared void due to fraud and misrepresentation, they had no right to transfer the property, and petitioners, as successors-in-interest, cannot be deprived of a right that does not exist. Furthermore, indefeasibility does not attach to titles secured by fraud.","WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED. The Resolutions dated July 27, 2018 and April 30, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

Version of the Prosecution: The evidence of the prosecution showed that sometime in March 2009, accused-appellant met private complainants, spouses Allan and Carol and spouses Christopher and Jennifer Claudel (Jennifer), and promised them employment abroad... Accused-appellant informed the four complainants that she has a sister in Japan, Evangeline Motosawa, who knew a lot of people who owned noodle factories where they could work as factory workers. Aside from the processing fee and other fees that accused-appellant asked from them, she also demanded from the private complainants the amount of P3,000.00 each or a total amount of P12,000.00 for their visa application. On July 23, 2009, accused-appellant required them to pay the amount of P37,500.00 each or a total amount of P150,000.00 for their visas and plane tickets. On the scheduled date for their departure, accused-appellant went to private complainants' residence at Muntinlupa City and informed them that their flight would be cancelled... It turned out that there were no plane tickets, visas, passports or job orders from the prospective employer in Japan for the private complainants. Accused-appellant did not reimburse any of the amounts given by the private complainants despite the latter's demand. Accused-appellant admitted her receipt of certain amounts from private complainants and promised to repay the said amounts as shown in the barangay blotter. The complainants likewise submitted the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) certification dated September 4, 2012, which certifies that accused-appellant is not licensed or authorized by the POEA to recruit workers for overseas employment. Version of the Defense: For her part, accused-appellant denied the charges against her. She testified that she was introduced to private complainants through her father, a barangay police. While she confirmed that her sister lived in Japan, she stated that her sister was a housewife and not a manager of a noodle factory. She denied that she promised to send complainants abroad for work or that she received any money or documents from them for such purpose.","The appeal is DISMISSED. The January 31, 2017 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 07838 is hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATIONS, viz.:","Accused-appellant is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale. The essential elements for Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale are that: (1) the person charged undertook any recruitment activity as defined under Section 6 of RA 8042; (2) accused did not have the license or the authority to lawfully engage in the recruitment of workers; and (3) accused committed the same against three or more persons individually or as a group. All three elements have been established beyond reasonable doubt by the prosecution... The POEA certification dated September 4, 2012 sufficiently established that accused-appellant is neither licensed nor authorized to recruit workers for overseas employment. The fact that no receipt was issued by the accused-appellant is not fatal to the prosecution's cause... Moreover, the testimony of the prosecution witnesses on the matter is bolstered by the barangay blotter, wherein accused-appellant admitted having received certain amounts from private complainants and promised to repay the said amounts. Accused-appellant is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Estafa under Article 315, par. 2 (a) of the RPC. The prosecution sufficiently established that accused-appellant defrauded the four private complainants by making them believe that she has the capacity to deploy them to Japan as factory workers, even if she did not have the authority or license for the purpose. Consequently, all the victims suffered damages in the amount of P40,500.00 each as the promised employment abroad never materialized, and the said money they parted with were never recovered. [The Court also modified the penalties for Estafa pursuant to RA 10951 and increased the fine for Illegal Recruitment to P1,000,000.00].","1.

PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","At around 12:30 a.m. on March 8, 2006, Police Officer (PO) 2 Wilson Paule (PO2 Paule), along with other officers, conducted an anti-criminality operation xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx, an area notorious for being a hub for rampant sale of drugs. Acting on information that four young individuals were about to have a ""pot session"" in ""Shabu Hotel,"" the officers proceeded to the location. Upon their arrival, PO2 Paule and PO2 Dalagdagan peeked through a slightly opened door and saw four individuals (later identified as CICL XXX, CICL YYY, Jed Barba, and Jonathan Solina) seated on the floor facing each other, with two transparent plastic sachets containing suspected marijuana and an improvised glass tube pipe laid out in front of them. The officers entered the room, confiscated the items, and arrested the suspects, apprising them of their rights. At the police station, PO2 Paule relinquished possession of the seized items to PO2 Michael Holanda (investigator), who marked them in front of the petitioners and Jonathan. PO2 Holanda then prepared an investigation report and a request for laboratory examination. The confiscated items tested positive for marijuana.

Version of the Defense: Petitioners claimed they were waiting outside Jed's rented room. PO2 Paule approached, instructed them to enter, searched the room and the sink, showed them a plastic sachet containing marijuana, and warned them not to escape. They were later ordered to a nearby basketball court where, while a video recording was being taken, they were shown another sachet of marijuana and a glass tube pipe before being transported to the police station. They insisted the police did not conduct an inventory or take photos of the supposed seized items.

The Regional Trial Court (RTC) found all accused GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of violating Sections 11 and 12, Article II of RA 9165 (Illegal Possession of Marijuana and Drug Paraphernalia). The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the conviction, finding that the chain of custody was not broken, but reduced the fine in Criminal Case No. 06-0261 from P100,000.00 to P10,000.00.",The core issue is whether or not petitioners are guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs and Paraphernalia.,"The petition has merit. Although the elements of Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs and Drug Paraphernalia were present, the integrity and evidentiary value of the confiscated items were compromised because the police officers did not follow the stringent requirements of Section 21 (1), Article II of RA 9165 as well as its Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR). Specifically, the police officers did not mark, inventory, or photograph the confiscated items immediately after seizure; no insulating witnesses (media, DOJ representative, and elected public official) were present; and the chain of custody links were riddled with abnormalities (the investigating officer, PO2 Holanda, marked the items instead of the apprehending officer, PO2 Paule, and the identity of the person who received the items at the crime laboratory was not ascertained). The prosecution failed to sufficiently justify its non-compliance. Since proof beyond reasonable doubt is required to secure a conviction in criminal cases, all of the accused should be acquitted, as the chain of custody was broken. Furthermore, accused Jonathan Solina, though he did not sign the verification portion of the petition, shall benefit from the favorable outcome pursuant to Section 11 (a), Rule 122 of the Rules of Court.","WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED. The assailed December 14, 2016 Decision and April 3, 2017 Resolution rendered by the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 35674 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. In Criminal Case Nos. 06-0260 and 06-0261, for violations of Sections 11 and 12, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165, petitioners CICL XXX, CICL YYY, and Jed Barba y Apolonio, as well as accused Jonathan Solina y Solina, are ACQUITTED due to the prosecution's failure to prove their guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

"G.R. No. 227655, April 27, 2022","SKANFIL MARITIME SERVICES, INC., AND/OR CROWN SHIPMANAGEMENT, INC., AND/OR JOSE MARIO C. BUNAG, PETITIONERS, VS. ALMARIO M. CENTENO, RESPONDENT.","In March 2013, Skanfil, on behalf of its foreign principal Crown Shipmanagement, Inc., hired Almario M. Centeno (Almario) as a mess person on board M/V ""DIMI"" POS TOPAS. On September 26, 2013, Almario fell from a seven-step ladder while performing the job. He was diagnosed with a blunt head injury, blunt back injury, lacerated scalp wound, and brain concussion. On October 2, 2013, Almario was repatriated. Skanfil referred Almario to company-designated physicians who assessed his injury as ""S/P Suturing of Lacerated Wound on the Scalp, Fracture S3; Mild L3 - L4 Disc Bulge."" The company doctors, including Dr. Hao-Quan, issued an interim assessment of Grade 8. Dr. Chuasuan (orthopedic surgeon) and Dr. Sumpio (neurosurgeon) eventually cleared him. On February 7, 2014, Dr. Hao-Quan noted ""functional trunk and hips range motion,"" and Almario signed a Certificate of Fitness for Work. Unconvinced, Almario consulted his physician of choice, Dr. Manuel Fidel M. Magtira, who declared him permanently unfit to resume sea duties. On July 14, 2014, Almario filed a complaint against Skanfil for permanent disability benefits. The Labor Arbiter (LA), on July 31, 2015, dismissed the complaint, finding it premature for failure to observe the mandatory third doctor rule. The National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) affirmed the LA's findings on November 16, 2015. The CA reversed the NLRC and LA, giving credence to Almario's claim that a company-designated physician (Dr. Sarmiento) had declared him unfit to work even after the 10th and Final Report. The CA ruled that since there was no final and definitive assessment within the prescribed period, Almario's disability was total and permanent, and awarded him benefits based on the CBA, plus damages and attorney’s fees.","FOR THESE REASONS, the petition is DENIED. The Court of Appeals' Decision dated July 27, 2016, and Resolution dated October 14, 2016, in CA – G.R. SP No. 144697 are AFFIRMED WITH MODIFICATION.","The Court found the petition partly meritorious. The company-designated physicians failed to issue a valid medical assessment within 120 days from Almario's repatriation (October 2, 2013). The 10th and Final Report was issued on February 7, 2014, which was eight days beyond the prescribed 120-day period, and the petitioners failed to provide justifiable reasons to extend the period to 240 days. Consequently, Almario's disability is considered permanent and total under Article 198 (c) (1) of the Labor Code. Moreover, the 10th and Final Report was not a final and valid medical assessment, as it contained advice for ""proper back mechanics to prevent/minimize recurrence of his back pain,"" suggesting Almario's condition was not fully resolved. The Certificate of Fitness for Work, signed by Almario, was not conclusive as Dr. Hao-Quan only signed as a witness, not as the certifying doctor. Since the assessment was not timely or definitive, Almario was not required to refer the case to a third doctor. The CBA provisions awarding higher disability benefits were applicable because the CA categorically found that Skanfil and Crown Shipmanagement, Inc. were represented by Bremer Bereederungsgesellschaft mbH & Co. KG in the CBA, a finding Skanfil failed to deny. However, the awards for moral and exemplary damages were deleted, as Skanfil's refusal to pay was due to a difference in medical opinion and failure to issue a timely assessment, not malice or bad faith. Attorney's fees were retained under Article 2208 (8) of the Civil Code.","Skanfil Maritime Services, Inc., Crown Shipmanagement, Inc., and Jose Mario C. Bunag are jointly and solidarily liable to pay Almario M. Centeno the following amounts: US$125,000.00 as permanent total disability benefits; and 10% of the total judgment award as attorney's fees. The awards for moral and exemplary damages are DELETED. The total monetary awards shall earn legal interest at (6%) per annum from the finality of this Decision until complete payment."

RUMBAWA, RESPONDENTS.","The Province of Rizal was a beneficiary of the Department of Agriculture's Ginintuang Masang Ani program and it received P5,000,000.00 for the implementation of different agricultural development programs. The Province of Rizal came up with two projects for its grant: (1) procurement of irrigation pumps; and (2) procurement of liquid fertilizers. On September 10, 2004, Rumbawa prepared Purchase Request No. 6416 for the purchase of 1,266 bottles of liquid organic fertilizer at P1,500.00 per bottle. On October 12, 2004, through its Resolution No. 69, the Bids and Awards Committee recommended buying Bio Nature from Feshan through direct contracting because it was the exclusive importer and distributor. A second batch was purchased via direct contracting in February 2005. On May 2, 2011, Task Force Abono filed a Complaint for violation of Section 3, paragraphs (e) and (g) of Republic Act No. 3019 or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, and Article 217 of the Revised Penal Code against several of Province of Rizal's local government officials (Bids and Awards Committee members and Almajose). Task Force Abono claimed that the procurement of liquid fertilizers did not comply with Republic Act No. 9184 and was tainted with irregularities because Rizal immediately resorted to direct contracting with Feshan, whose license to operate had expired. Task Force Abono also alleged that the fertilizer purchased from Feshan was overpriced by as much as P3,237,341.00. On June 13, 2014, the Ombudsman found substantial evidence against the charged local government unit officials (Rumbawa, Almajose, Arcilla, Durusan, Olea, Torres, Collantes, and Esguerra) for Dishonesty, Grave Misconduct, and Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service in connection with the procurement of Bio Nature Liquid Fertilizer, meting out the penalty of dismissal. The dismissed local government officials then filed their respective Petitions for Review before the Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals reversed the Ombudsman's finding of substantial evidence, finding that direct contracting was justified due to the specific composition needed, and that the officials acted in good faith relying on Feshan's Certificate of Product Registration and the findings of the Technical Working Group. Task Force Abono moved for reconsideration, which was denied. Task Force Abono filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari before the Supreme Court.",The Petition is partially meritorious.,"The Bids and Awards Committee members (Rumbawa, Durusan, Torres, Arcilla, Olea, and Esguerra) were remiss in their duties and failed to exercise the diligence required of them, showing a deliberate effort to give unwarranted benefits to Feshan by resorting to an unjustified direct contracting of Bio Nature. The Office of the Ombudsman did not abuse its discretion when it found respondents Rumbawa, Durusan, Torres, Arcilla, Olea, and Esguerra liable for dishonesty, grave misconduct, conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service. However, the Office of the Ombudsman gravely abused its discretion in finding respondent Almajose administratively liable, as her duty as Officer in Charge-Provincial Accountant was ministerial (ensuring vouchers tallied with agreed purchase price and quantity/volume coincided with P.O.s) and auditing the procurement process was outside her mandate.","WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Petition is PARTLY GRANTED.

"G.R. No. 208258, April 27, 2022","MARIA VICIA CARULLO-PADUA, PETITIONER, VS. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES AND JOSELITO PADUA, RESPONDENTS.","Maria and Joselito were married in a civil ceremony on February 5, 1982 followed by a church wedding on December 18, 1982. The union produced a son born on March 23, 1986.[6] On July 17, 1997, Maria filed a petition[7] for declaration of absolute nullity of their marriage with the trial court anchored on Article 36 of the Family Code. Maria alleged that at the time of the celebration of their marriage, Joselito was psychologically incapacitated to perform his marital obligations. During their cohabitation, Joselito exhibited excessive sexual desire and forced her to perform oral and anal sex with him;[8] that there were occasions when respondent attempted to sexually molest her sister, nieces and their household help who were staying with them; that respondent admitted to said attempts of molestations but begged her to keep said incidents a secret;[9] that Joselito misrepresented himself as a Roman Catholic when he was actually a born-again christian; that when Maria refused to convert to Joselito's religion, he began insulting her religious beliefs;[10] and that at one point, at the heat of their quarrel, Joselito attempted to kill Maria by threatening to stab her with a letter opener.[11] Maria also alleged that Joselito failed to provide financial support for her and their child; that right after they got married, Joselito insisted that they stay in her parents' house so that he can give half of his salary to his own parents; that they were dependent on Maria's parents for support;[12] and that Joselito never bothered to share in the household expenses while they were living at her parents' house. Maria further claimed that when Joselito lost his job in 1985, he remained unemployed for six months because he did not try to find work until she asked him to look for one.[13] Joselito also failed to provide emotional and psychological support to their child. He preferred staying in their room rather than to spend time with their only son. Occasionally, he would physically harm their child when the latter would attempt to play with him.[14] Maria further averred that in 1990, Joselito left for Italy to work without consulting her. While working abroad, Joselito stopped sending financial support to her and their son after settling the huge debt he incurred here in the Philippines. Consequently, Maria raised and supported their son all by herself. Later, in 1992, Joselito sent a letter admitting to his shortcomings on their marital relationship and making known of his decision to sever ties with her and their son. However, when Joselito returned to the Philippines in 1997, he sought custody of their child who was under her care.[15] Upon the foregoing averments, Maria concluded that there is sufficient basis to declare Joselito psychologically incapacitated to comply with his essential marital obligations. Hence, Maria's marriage with Joselito should be declared null and void pursuant to Article 36 of the Family Code.[16] As Joselito did not file an answer, the court a quo ordered the public prosecutor to conduct an investigation to ensure that no collusion existed between the parties.[17] After the public prosecutor determined that there was no collusion between the parties, trial proceeded in Joselito's absence.[18] In its comment[19] dated December 3, 1997, the Office of the Solicitor General manifested its opposition to the petition. During trial, petitioner presented herself and psychiatrist Dr. Cecilia Villegas (Dr. Villegas) as witnesses. Maria testified on the allegations contained in her petition[20] while Dr. Villegas testified on the personality evaluation[21] report she prepared.[22] Dr. Villegas testified that she diagnosed Joselito with a personality disorder of a sexual deviant or perversion based on Maria's narrations. Joselito's preference for anal and oral sex, as well as the molestations he committed against Maria's relatives and housemaid, were manifestations of Joselito's perversion. The root cause of Joselito's personality disorder is traceable to his wretched childhood. Inasmuch as Joselito spent his youth with a cruel father and a very protective mother, the unbalanced relationship between Joselito's parents developed some emotional confusion on him. As a result, Joselito's sexual development did not mature. Dr. Villegas added that the psychological disorder of Joselito is grave, serious and not clinically curable which rendered him psychologically incapacitated to perform his marital obligations.[23]","Using the foregoing yardsticks, We reviewed the totality of evidence presented by Maria and found that the same was miserably wanting to sustain the conclusion that Joselito was psychologically incapacitated to perform the basic obligations of marriage. The personality evaluation report[48] prepared by Dr. Villegas carried a finding that Joselito suffers from a sexual deviant personality disorder or perversion. Notably, this was based solely on Maria's narrations. ... To emphasize, the testimonies of ordinary witnesses who have been present in the life of the spouses before the latter contracted marriage should include behaviors that they have consistently observed from the supposedly incapacitated spouse.[51] Here, not only was there no interview or psychological test conducted upon Joselito, there was nobody who testified on vital information regarding his personality structure, upbringing and childhood such as members of his family, relatives, friends, and co-workers. The evaluation of Dr. Villegas on Joselito was based merely on information, accounts and descriptions relayed solely by Maria which glaringly and expectedly are biased. Applying the amended guidelines in the Tan-Andal case, Maria should have presented witnesses who have been present in their lives before they contracted marriage and who could very well testify on the respondent's behavior. As it stands, the evidence at hand is insufficient to prove juridical antecedence. ... Anent Dr. Villegas' statement that Joselito's preference for oral and anal sex is a grave and serious personality disorder because it affects the sexual function of Joselito and the sexual life of Maria,[52] We hereby reiterate our pronouncement in Molina that ""mere showing of 'irreconcilable differences' and 'conflicting personalities' [as in the present case,] in no wise constitutes psychological incapacity.""[53] ... With regard to the other grounds relied upon by Maria in support of her petition for the declaration of nullity of her marriage, i.e., sexual infidelity and abandonment, this Court agrees with the CA that said circumstances, assuming that they were true, are grounds for legal separation under Article 55 of the Family Code and not for declaration of nullity of marriage under Article 36 of the Family Code. ... It must be stressed that an unsatisfactory marriage is not a null and void marriage.[60] Time and again, it has been held that the State takes a high stake in the preservation of marriage rooted in its recognition of the sanctity of married life and its mission to protect and strengthen the family as a basic autonomous social institution.[61] Hence, any doubt should be resolved in favor of the existence and preservation of the marriage and against its dissolution and nullity.[62] Presumption is always in favor of the validity of marriage. Semper praesumitur pro matrimonio.[63]","We answer in the negative. Article 36 of the Family Code reads: ART. 36. A marriage contracted by any party who, at the time of the celebration, was psychologically incapacitated to comply with the essential marital obligations of marriage, shall likewise be void even if such incapacity becomes manifest only after its solemnization. Republic v. Iyoy[38] instructs that the psychological incapacity must be characterized by: (a) Gravity - It must be grave or serious such that the party would be incapable of carrying out the ordinary duties required in a marriage; (b) Juridical Antecedence - It must be rooted in the history of the party antedating the marriage, although the overt manifestations may emerge only after the marriage; and (c) Incurability - It must be incurable or, even if it were otherwise, the cure would be beyond the means of the party involved. ... We reviewed the totality of evidence presented by Maria and found that the same was miserably wanting to sustain the conclusion that Joselito was psychologically incapacitated to perform the basic obligations of marriage. ... The evidence at hand is insufficient to prove juridical antecedence. ... Sexual incompatibility is not a ground for declaration of nullity of marriage. ... Irreconcilable differences, conflicting personalities, emotional immaturity and irresponsibility, physical abuse, habitual alcoholism, sexual infidelity or perversion, and abandonment, by themselves, also do not warrant a finding of psychological incapacity under the said Article.[59]","WHEREFORE, the petition is hereby DENIED for lack of merit. The August 28, 2006 Decision and November 14, 2011 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 80952 sustaining the validity of the marriage of Maria Vicia Carullo-Padua with Joselito Padua are hereby AFFIRMED. SO ORDERED."

A dispute arose regarding the specification of glass (tempered glass vs. Low-E glass) and the resulting deduction from the contract price when Toyota awarded the glass and aluminum works to another contractor. ASEC insisted that only P32,504,329.98 should be deducted, while Toyota deducted P58,868,716.00 (later P52,000,000.00). ASEC filed a request for arbitration (CIAC Case Number 07-2014). The arbitral tribunal rendered a Final Award on June 30, 2014 (First Arbitral Award) holding that only P32,504,329.98 should have been deducted, and ordered Toyota to return the differential amount of P19,459,670.02. Toyota appealed this to the Court of Appeals (CA-G.R. SP. No. 136270). Around the same time, Toyota terminated the contract, and ASEC filed a second request for arbitration (CIAC Case No. 03-2015) to determine final payment and unpaid billings. The second arbitral tribunal rendered a Final Award on October 5, 2015 (Second Arbitral Award), which held that P51,022,240.00 should be deducted for glass and aluminum works, contradicting the First Arbitral Award. The Second Arbitral Award also found ASEC in delay and upheld Toyota's termination. ASEC appealed the Second Arbitral Award (CA-G.R. SP No. 142699).

SP Nos. 136270 and 142699 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE.","Given the deference bestowed on the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission's factual findings, the Court of Appeals here erred in setting aside the First Arbitral Award and supplanting the arbitral tribunal's factual findings with its own interpretation of the contract stipulation as regards tempered glass and Low-E glass. The Second Arbitral Award should be vacated in part because it reversed the First Arbitral Award. The two arbitral tribunals are coequal bodies and cannot reverse or render another award on the same issue previously resolved by another tribunal. The finding in the First Arbitral Award that only P32,540,329.98 was deductible from petitioner's scope of works is a finding of fact which this Court will not disturb. For these reasons, the First Arbitral Award's finding should be reinstated. Only P32,540,329.98 should have been deducted for glass and aluminum works. Respondent should still pay the differential amount of P19,000,000.00. The other issues petitioner raises—whether the contract was validly terminated, whether the variation orders were proven, whether respondent was in estoppel in pais, whether petitioner complied with its scope of works, and whether the retention amount should be released—were only addressed in the Second Arbitral Award, which we uphold.","The June 30, 2014 Arbitral Award in CIAC Case No. 07-2014 is REINSTATED. The October 5, 2015 Arbitral Award in CIAC Case No. 03- 2015 is PARTLY VACATED insofar as it ruled on the amount of glass and aluminum works. This case is REMANDED to the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission for a re-computation of the final award due to the parties."
"G.R. No. 214590, April 27, 2022","ESTATE OF SUSANO J. RODRIGUEZ, REPRESENTED BY ITS ATTORNEY-IN-FACT VIRGILIO R. VALENZUELA, PETITIONER, VS. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, REPRESENTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, RESPONDENTS.","On September 12, 1968, Susano J. Rodriguez (Rodriguez) executed a deed of conditional donation in favor of the Republic over a parcel of land covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 7800 located in Barangay Cadlan, Pili, Camarines Sur with an area of 322,839 square meters (sqm), for the purpose of constructing thereon a mental facility, subject to conditions, including that the property shall be used exclusively as site of the Mental Hospital and that the DONEE shall not under any circumstance or in any manner Lease, Let, Convey, Dispose, or Encumber the property herein donated or any part or portion thereof to any person or entity, except with the prior and express knowledge and approval of the DONOR. On September 29, 2008, the estate, represented by its attorney-in-fact Valenzuela, filed a complaint against the Republic for revocation of the donation and forfeiture of improvements, alleging that the Republic allowed a portion of the donated property to be used for residential and commercial purposes in violation of the fifth condition in the deed of conditional donation. The Republic alleged that the RTC had no jurisdiction, the estate’s cause of action had already prescribed (10 years from 1968), and the condition against alienation constituted undue restriction on the rights arising from ownership and was contrary to public policy.","The Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 31 of Pili, Camarines Sur, in its March 14, 2012 Decision, revoked and cancelled the deed of conditional donation in so far as the 27 hectares of the 32 hectares subject of donation are concerned, and ordered the Department of Health to execute a deed of reconveyance for the 27 hectares, representing the unused portion of the land. The RTC held that the action had not prescribed, counting the 10-year period from the failure of the Republic to execute the ejectment judgment (Civil Case No. P-86) which became final in 1995. The Court of Appeals (CA) in its February 20, 2014 Decision, reversed and set aside the RTC's decision and dismissed the complaint. The CA found the estate had legal personality, but ruled that the prohibition against alienation without stating a duration was perpetual or indefinite, and thus illegal. The CA also found that the non-execution of the ejectment decision was not a substantial breach warranting revocation, as the Republic was still operating the mental hospital, fulfilling the main purpose of the donation.","The Supreme Court found the donation to be onerous, governed by contract rules, and while the action for revocation was timely filed, the fifth condition (prohibition against lease/disposal without specifying duration) is void for being an unreasonable restriction on ownership rights, applying by analogy the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Manila v. Court of Appeals case. The Court held that the Republic did not violate the fifth condition because it actively pursued an ejectment case against informal settlers (Civil Case No. P-86), signifying non-tolerance. Furthermore, the donor, Rodriguez, was presumed to be aware of the presence of the informal settlers when he executed the deed. The continued operation of the mental hospital on the five-hectare utilized portion constitutes substantial compliance with the main prestation of the donation, which did not compel construction on every square inch of the 32-hectare property. Thus, revocation was improper and lacked legal basis.","WHEREFORE, the petition for review is hereby DENIED. The assailed February 20, 2014 Decision and September 16, 2014 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 98892, are hereby AFFIRMED. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 238282, April 26, 2022","JOSEPH T. SORIANO, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","George T. Li (Li), owner of San Vicente Dressing Plant (SVDP) and represented by Adora S. Escaño (Escaño), filed on April 23, 2009 a complaint for violation of paragraphs (c) and (e), Section 3 of RA 3019 against petitioner, a team member of the City Veterinary Office; as well as some employees of the City Government of Alaminos, Pangasinan, namely: Dr. Ronaldo B. Abarra (Abarra), City Veterinarian; Ryan R. Pagador (Pagador), Meat Inspector; and Lyndon R. Millan (Millan), Security Officer (collectively, co-accused). The complaint alleged that around 1:30 a.m. on April 17, 2009, the personnel of the City Veterinary Office, headed by Abarra, and the Public and Safety Office (POSO) of Alaminos City flagged down a delivery van owned by Li which was loaded with approximately 2,455 kilograms of meat and by-products worth around P250,000.00. The contents of the delivery van were confiscated for purportedly being 'hot meat.' The reason for the confiscation was that the National Meat Inspection Service (NMIS) Certificate No. 0544131 presented by the employees of SVDP contained incomplete entries. Although the SVDP employees tried to explain that the missing information could be obtained from the documents attached to the certificate, Abarra and his co-accused refused to accept the explanation and insisted that the van be impounded. By 9:00 a.m. that day, the cargo was unloaded and its contents were distributed to the different government agencies in Alaminos City Hall. Subsequently, the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon recommended that petitioner and his co-accused be charged with violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019. The accused argued that Abarra ordered the confiscation because the meat inspector assigned to SVDP (Mejia) admitted she failed to inspect the meat products and fill up the NMIS certificate properly, and the acts were pursuant to City Ordinance No. 2003-31 to keep Alaminos City free from 'hot-meat.' Petitioner Soriano was not presented as a witness but was present at the checkpoint during confiscation.","The Sandiganbayan found Dr. Ronaldo B. Abarra, Joseph T. Soriano, and Lyndon R. Millan GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019, sentencing each of them to imprisonment of six (6) years and one (1) month, as minimum, to ten (10) years, as maximum, perpetual disqualification from public office, and to return, jointly and solidarily, the amount of Two Hundred Twenty-Six Thousand, Nine-Hundred Fifty-Four Pesos and Eighty Centavos (P226,954.80), with interest thereon. The Sandiganbayan found that all the accused acted with evident bad faith when they immediately caused the confiscation of the meat products upon discovery at the Alaminos checkpoint that there were missing entries in the NMIS certificate, and supporting documents were not considered.","The petition is GRANTED. The Supreme Court ruled that the guilt of petitioner was not proven beyond reasonable doubt. While petitioner is a public officer and was discharging an official function, the elements of Section 3(e) of RA 3019, specifically the existence of manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence, were not established. Petitioner's only proven involvement was his mere presence at the checkpoint while performing an official duty, which is insufficient to establish conspiracy or guilt. Furthermore, the accused officials acted well within their authority when they seized the van for failure to present a valid and duly accomplished NMIS Certificate, and their refusal to rely on company-issued 'issue forms' to supply material deficiencies did not amount to evident bad faith, as there was no showing of fraudulent intent or corrupt motive. The monetary loss suffered by the private complainant does not automatically equate to a finding of graft on the part of the accused.","The Decision dated January 19, 2018 and the Resolution dated February 27, 2018 of the Sandiganbayan in SB-14-CRM-0436 are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Petitioner Joseph T. Soriano and his co-accused Dr. Ronaldo B. Abarra and Lyndon R. Millan are ACQUITTED."
"G.R. No. 220996, April 26, 2022","ROI GUZMAN DAVID, PETITIONER, VS. CARIDAD D. BUTAY, RESPONDENT.","The case stemmed from an Amended Complaint[8] for Forcible Entry and Damages with Application for Writ of Preliminary Injunction and Temporary Restraining Order (Amended Complaint) filed by petitioner against defendant Willy and respondent. The facts are as follows: On December 4, 2001, petitioner and defendant Willy entered into a conditional deed of sale over a 3,000-square meter land covered by Assessment of Real Property (ARP) No. 99-001-06218 (subject property) located in Gusaran, Poblacion, Tuba, Benguet. Upon execution of the conditional deed of sale, petitioner immediately took actual possession and occupation of the subject property in the concept of an owner.[9] Sometime in 2004, the adjoining neighbors of petitioner warned him that defendant Willy sold the subject property to other persons. Thus, petitioner put up perimeter fences and a shanty on the subject land to protect his rights and to further establish his possession over it. He also demanded from defendant Willy a deed of absolute sale in his favor but to no avail.[10] In 2006, defendant Willy filed a Complaint for Forcible Entry against petitioner which was dismissed for failure to prosecute on the part of defendant Willy. Since the dismissal of that case, petitioner was in peaceful possession of the subject property for a period of eight years reckoned from 2001 until 2009, or before he filed the forcible entry case against defendant Willy and respondent.[11] In the complaint, petitioner alleged that on November 9, 2009, he learned from his caretaker that defendant Willy, without his permission and in utter disregard of his peaceful possession and ownership, entered the subject property through force, intimidation, strategy, and stealth together with a group of unknown persons to take measurements and to make excavations for the construction of a permanent structure. Because he was in Manila at the time the incident was reported to him, he was able to verify the illegal entry of defendant Willy on the subject property only on November 18, 2009.[12] Thus, on November 19, 2009, petitioner filed an action for forcible entry with damages originally against defendant Willy. However, during the course of the hearing, petitioner learned that defendant Willy sold to respondent a 1,553-square-meter portion of the subject property; that respondent acquired a new tax declaration in her name over the subject land; and that the group of persons conducting the construction on the subject land was respondent's employees. Consequently, after the pre-trial conference, petitioner amended his complaint to implead respondent as an additional defendant.[13] In her answer, respondent averred the following: On July 6, 2009, she and defendant Willy executed a deed of sale of a portion of an unregistered land over 1,553 square meters, which is a portion of the 2,640 square meters parcel of land located at Gusaran, Poblacion, Tuba, Benguet and covered by ARP No. 99-001-06695.[14] At the time of the sale, petitioner or any of his representatives were not seen on the subject property. Also, the tax declaration of defendant Willy had no annotations or any encumbrances. Thus, her purchase of the subject land was in good faith. The corresponding tax declaration with ARP No. 99-001-08183 over that portion of 1,553 square meters was also issued in her favor. Thus, being the owner of the subject land, she has all the rights to put up or construct any structure thereon.[15] Defendant Willy did not file his position paper to the complaint.[16] The Ruling of the MCTC On April 5, 2011, the MCTC rendered a Decision[17] in favor of petitioner declaring that he was able to show his prior physical possession over the subject property. It ruled that: (1) out of the total 5,000 square meters originally owned by defendant Willy, he only sold a portion of 1,553 square meters to respondent; (2) petitioner, on the other hand, acquired the 3,000 square meters which he already delineated by putting up a fence and shanty to protect his possession; (3) respondent could have easily taken possession of the 2,000 square meters that petitioner did not buy, but instead, respondent erected her structure on the 3,000 square meters that petitioner possessed; and (4) respondent forcibly deprived petitioner of his possession and occupation of the 1,553-square-meter portion of the subject property.","On February 12, 2015, the CA granted the petition, accordingly set aside the RTC Decision and Order, and dismissed the Amended Complaint against respondent. The CA ratiocinated that although petitioner was able to prove prior possession considering the earlier ejectment case filed against him by defendant Willy, there was, however, no sufficient evidence adduced to show that respondent unduly deprived him of the same lot he claimed to possess first in time. The CA added that petitioner failed to explain to its satisfaction that the area which he was physically and actually possessing was the same area on which respondent built her structure considering that both parties referred to distinct and separate parcels of land based on the respective lot descriptions contained in their corresponding tax declarations. Thus, petitioner's failure to establish the identity of the land was fatal to his case.","The Court grants the petition. The CA erred in considering the evidence submitted for the first time on appeal by respondent. x x x The CA erred in finding that petitioner failed to prove the identity of the subject land. Petitioner was able to establish prior physical possession of the property. The present case is an action for forcible entry. x x x Thus, a party who can prove prior possession can recover such possession even against the owner himself. Whatever may be the character of his possession, if he has in his favor prior possession in time, he has the security that entitles him to remain on the property until a person with a better right lawfully ejects him. To repeat, the only issue that the court has to settle in an ejectment suit is the right to physical possession. x x x All told, the MCTC and the RTC were correct in ruling in favor of petitioner—the plaintiff in the forcible entry case now before the Court. The award of damages in favor of petitioner must be clarified and/or modified. ... In the case, the Court finds that petitioner is not entitled to any kind of damages except for the reasonable rental for the use and occupation of his property by respondent. ... Thus, the Court deems it proper to remand the case for further proceedings but only for the purpose of determining the amount of reasonable rent to be awarded to petitioner. ... Lastly, the Court sustains the MCTC's award of P20,000.00 as attorney's fees in favor of petitioner.","WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated February 12, 2015 and the Resolution dated September 4, 2015 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 130611 are REVERSED AND SET ASIDE. Accordingly, the Court rules as follows: (1) The Decision dated February 21, 2013 and the Order dated June 11, 2013 of Branch 10, Regional Trial Court, La Trinidad, Benguet which affirmed with modification the Decision dated April 5, 2011 of 5th Municipal Circuit Trial Court, Tuba-Sablan, Benguet are REINSTATED with MODIFICATION in that all monetary awards are DELETED except for the attorney's fees in the amount of P20,000.00 which shall earn legal interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the finality of this Decision until fully paid; (2) The case is REMANDED to the court of origin for further proceedings to determine the amount of reasonable rent that must be paid to petitioner Roi Guzman David from November 19, 2009 up to the time respondent Caridad D. Butay vacated the premises; and (3) The monthly rental to be determined by the 5th Municipal Circuit Trial Court, Tuba-Sablan, Benguet shall earn interest at the rate of 6% per annum, to be computed from the date of demand, i.e., on November 19, 2009, until full payment.

"[ G.R. No. 243818, April 26, 2022 ]","RAOUL C. VILLARETE, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON AUDIT, RESPONDENT.","On November 7, 2003, the Lung Center of the Philippines (Lung Center) entered into a Lease Contract [7] with Himex Corporation (Himex) for various medical equipment amounting to P60,200,000.00 with an option to purchase the equipment within six months. The lease agreement had a duration of 60 months. [8] At that time, Dr. Villarete was the Lung Center's Deputy Director for Medical Services. [9] On January 30, 2004, an Audit Team Leader of the Commission on Audit issued Audit Observation Memorandum No. 2004-004 [10] in connection with the Lung Center's first payment on the medical equipment amounting to P8,723,000.00. It also observed that the Lung Center incurred unnecessary expenses in the amount of P786,352.50 when it established a stand-by letter of credit to guarantee the Lease Contract [11] with Himex. [12] The Lung Center did not file a comment on the Audit Observation Memorandum. Consequently, the Director of the Legal and Adjudication Office issued a May 19, 2004 Notice of Suspension No. LCP-04-001-(03-04) [13] on the said transactions. [14] On August 9, 2004, Dr. Juanito A. Rubio (Dr. Rubio), then-Assistant Secretary of the Department of Health and Officer-in-Charge of the Lung Center, submitted the Lung Center's justifications for the questioned transactions. [15] At the same time, the Lung Center filed a request to lift the Notice of Suspension. [16] On October 10, 2005, Commission on Audit Decision No. 2005-067 [17] denied the Lung Center's request to lift the Notice of Suspension and affirmed the disallowance of the rental paid for failing to comply with the procurement process under Republic Act No. 9184. [18] Among those made liable were: (1) Dr. Villarete, for certifying that the expenses were lawful; (2) Angeline A. Rojas, the Lung Center's Accounting Division Chief, for certifying that the supporting documents were complete and proper; and (3) Dr. Rubio, for approving the transaction. Himex was also held liable as the payee of the Lease Agreement. [22] On April 17, 2006, the Lung Center, Dr. Rubio, and Dr. Villarete filed a Memorandum on Appeal [23] assailing the Notice of Disallowance. [24] On September 13, 2012, the Commission on Audit issued Decision No. 2012-138 [27] (Decision No. 2012-138) denying the Memorandum on Appeal. On September 18, 2012, a copy of Decision No. 2012-138 was personally served to Dr. Rubia's successor, Dr. Jose Luis J. Danguilan (Dr. Danguilan) and Dr. Villarete, through his representative, Nieva Jean Cajipe (Cajipe). [29] Only Dr. Danguilan filed a Motion for Reconsideration [30] on behalf of the Lung Center, but this was denied by the Commission Proper in a December 6, 2013 Resolution. [31] Since no other Motions for Reconsideration were filed, Decision No. 2012-138 became final and executory on September 18, 2012. [32] Subsequently on June 16, 2014, a Notice of Finality of Decision [33] was issued by Director IV and Commission Secretary Nilda B. Planas. It was received by a certain ""Chie"" on behalf of Dr. Villarete, whose signature could be seen on the second page of the Notice. [34] Thereafter, on May 29, 2015, the Commission on Audit issued Order of Execution No. 2015-032. [35] On July 28, 2015, Dr. Villarete, on behalf of the Lung Center, filed a Motion to Lift the Commission on Audit Order of Execution [36] stating that he was not notified of Decision No. 2012-138 and the December 6, 2013 Resolution. [37] The Commission denied the motion in a September 8, 2015 Letter [38] and subsequently denied his Motion for Reconsideration in the Commission on Audit's March 15, 2018 Resolution. [40] Aggrieved, Dr. Villarete filed this Petition for Review [42] under Rule 64 before this Court. On June 20, 2019, respondent Commission on Audit, through the Office of the Solicitor General, filed its Comment [43] on the Petition in compliance with this Court's February 12, 2019 Resolution. [44] Petitioner Dr. Villarete assails the Commission on Audit's September 8, 2015 Letter and March 15, 2018 Resolution for being in violation of due process.","The lone issue for this Court's resolution is whether or not respondent Commission on Audit committed grave abuse of discretion in issuing the September 8, 2015 Letter and March 15, 2018 Resolution for denying petitioner Dr. Villarete of his right to due process.","The Petition is meritorious. . . . Respondent failed to substantiate its claim that petitioner was indeed served a notice of Decision No. 2012-138 and its succeeding orders. Thus, this Court is constrained to conclude that the same were not served on petitioner, thus, violating his right to due process. . . . Proof of service to one's office secretary is not sufficient service to comply with the due process requirement. . . . Undoubtedly, the December 6, 2013 Resolution, September 13, 2012 Decision No. 2012-138, and the June 16, 2014 Notice of Finality of Decision were made in contravention of petitioner's fundamental right to due process. For failing to give petitioner an opportunity to seek reconsideration, the aforementioned are void with regard its finding on petitioner's liability. Consequently, the Writ of Prohibition is issued enjoining respondent from implementing its Order of Execution No. 2015-032.","ACCORDINGLY, premises considered, the Petition is GRANTED and the September 13, 2012 Decision of the Commission on Audit­ Commission Proper is set aside/annulled insofar as it held Dr. Raoul C.

Adriatico (Adriatico), Isagani M. Ubalde (Ubalde), Roland A. Agustin (Agustin), Mario S. Manahan, Jr. (Manahan), and Jesrome C. Siega (Siega; collectively, petitioners) were employed as Machine Operators by respondent Armscor Global Defense, Inc. (Armscor). On separate dates between 2016 and 2017, petitioners filed separate complaints[6] for regularization and payment of benefits against Armscor and respondent Manpower Outsourcing Services, Inc. (MOSI) with the Arbitration Branch of the NLRC alleging that: (a) they are regular employees of Armscor by operation of law after having performed work that is necessary and desirable to Armscor's business for over one (1) year; (b) to prevent them from attaining regular status, Armscor transferred their employment to different manpower agencies, including MOSI, which is a labor-only contractor; and (c) their true employer is Armscor which hired them and paid their salaries, further pointing out that they are performing work under the direct control and supervision of Armscor's managers and supervisors.[7] Based on the records, petitioners filed the following cases before the NLRC, praying to be declared regular employees of Armscor as respondents Armscor, Martin Tuason (Tuason), Atty. Ermilando O. Villafuerte (Villafuerte), MOSI, and Diogenes Jaurique were alleged to be engaged in illegal labor-only contracting, as follows: (a) Paiton and Adriatico filed NCR Case No. NCR-12-14953-16; (b) Siega filed NCR Case No. NCR-11-14762-16; (c) Ubalde filed NCR Case No. NCR-12-14906-16; and (d) Agustin and Manahan filed NLRC Case No. NCR-03-03052-17 (collectively referred to as the regularization cases).[8] At the time the present petition was filed, these regularization cases were on their respective appeals with the CA, with the exception of petitioners Paiton and Adriatico's regularization case which is already pending before the Court.[9] During the pendency of the regularization cases, petitioners alleged that on June 16, 2017, Armscor refused to allow them entry in the work premises as MOSI had pulled them out from the company after the expiration and non­renewal of the service contract between Armscor and MOSI. Thus, on July 6, 2017, petitioners filed the instant illegal constructive dismissal case, NCR Case No. NCR-07-09884-17, with a claim for damages and attorney's fees against respondents before the NLRC. In their complaint, petitioners reiterated their allegation that they are regular employees of Armscor who enjoy security of tenure, and as such, they cannot be terminated without any just or authorized cause.[10] For their part, Armscor and its officers, Tuason and Villafuerte, asserted that petitioners were employed by MOSI, and not by Armscor and that they are not liable to petitioners for their claims of illegal constructive dismissal. They also alleged that the service contract between Armscor and MOSI expired and petitioners were validly pulled out by MOSI.[11] Meanwhile, MOSI prayed for the dismissal of the complaint due to forum shopping, considering that the earlier filed regularization cases with the NLRC shared similar facts, issues, and arguments as that of the illegal constructive dismissal case. It also asserted that it was a legitimate contractor and that petitioners' dismissal was due to redundancy.[12]",the Court finds that the CA erred in not ascribing grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Labor Tribunals when they dismissed the instant illegal constructive dismissal case on ground of litis pendentia or forum shopping as the same contravenes settled case law on the matter.,"Applying Del Rosario, which is on all fours to the instant case, then the Court reaches the conclusion that petitioners did not commit forum shopping in filing the instant illegal constructive dismissal case despite the pendency of the regularization cases which they filed earlier. Pursuant to Del Rosario, there is no identity of causes of action between petitioners' regularization cases and the instant illegal constructive dismissal case, considering that the regularization cases involved a determination of whether petitioners are regular employees of Armscor as respondents were alleged to be engaged in labor-only contracting, and as such, petitioners prayed for the award of payment of benefits from the first day of engagement with Armscor. On the other hand, the instant illegal constructive dismissal case questioned the propriety of petitioners' dismissal and prays for their reinstatement with Armscor. Notably, while the latter case will also inevitably touch upon the issue of whether or not petitioners are indeed regular employees of Armscor, the issue it ultimately seeks to address is whether or not petitioners were constructively dismissed without any just or authorized cause under the law. Otherwise stated, the issue in the regularization cases is merely limited to whether or not petitioners should be deemed as regular employees of Armscor, and hence, entitled to the benefits accorded to regular employees; whereas in the instant illegal constructive dismissal case, the issue is whether or not Armscor constructively dismissed petitioners without any just or authorized causes. It is apparent that the evidence to be presented in these two (2) cases are distinct even if they may overlap in certain points. More importantly, at the time the regularization cases were initiated, the facts which spawned the instant illegal constructive dismissal case have not yet occurred, and therefore, petitioners' only existing cause of action during that time was their entitlement to benefits enjoyed by regular employees. It was only after Armscor refused to allow them entry into the work premises as MOSI had pulled them out from the company after the expiration and non-renewal of the service contract between Arsmscor and MOSI that petitioners were constrained to file the instant illegal constructive dismissal case. Under the foregoing circumstances, petitioners had no choice but to avail of different fora. In fine, the Court finds that the NLRC's ruling affirming the LA's dismissal of the instant illegal constructive dismissal case on the ground of litis pendentia or forum shopping is tainted with grave abuse of discretion; and hence, the CA erred in affirming the same. At this point, the Court recognizes that since the Labor Tribunals and the CA merely dismissed the said case only on the aforementioned procedural ground, there are no factual findings in relation to the substantive merits of the case from which the Court may source any legal conclusions. In this light and further considering that the Court is not a trier of facts, [34] the Court is constrained to remand the case to the Tribunal of origin, i.e., the LA, for a resolution on the merits.","WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated June 30, 2020 and the Resolution dated January 8, 2021 of the Court of Appeals in CA­G.R. SP No. 160018 are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

"G.R. No. 217119, April 25, 2022","SYSTEMS AND PLAN INTEGRATOR AND DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION AND/OR ENGR. JULIETA CUNANAN, PETITIONERS, VS. MICHELLE ELVI C. BALLESTEROS, RESPONDENT.","Ballesteros started working for SPID Corp. on June 15, 2005 as a Customer Service Representative. She was eventually promoted to administrative staff with a basic salary of P9,900.00, Emergency Cost of Living Allowance (ECOLA) of P2,200.00, and transportation allowance of P1,000.00, totaling to P14,300.00. During the first week of February 2011, Kristine Castro (Castro), Personnel Officer of SPID Corp., talked to Ballesteros and told her that Cunanan, President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of SPID Corp., was asking for her resignation because she was pregnant, and was going to have two children to take care of. Castro even told Ballesteros that she was going to be terminated anyway so resignation would be a better option. Disturbed by this imposition, Ballesteros talked to Ronniel Cunanan (Cunanan), SPID Corp.'s Administration and Finance Officer, who confirmed that the company is indeed asking Ballesteros to tender her resignation, saying that although she did not have a bad record that would justify her termination, the company decided to terminate her for the same reasons given above. On March 25, 2011, Ballesteros gave birth and availed of the maternity leave. Sometime in April 2011, she went back to the office and told Castro that she did not want to resign. The following week, she returned and reiterated to Castro her decision not to resign. Castro offered Ballesteros two options: first, she resigns and the company will issue her a clear Certificate of Employment; or second, the company terminates her employment, and gives her salary for one month, and her 13th month pay. When Ballesteros asked again for the reason for her termination, Castro replied that she had received memoranda from the company, one each during the years 2008, 2009 and 2010, which Ballesteros vehemently protested to, as her superiors have always told her that she did not have a bad record during the five and a half years she was employed by the company. Castro told her that she would still be terminated, and she should wait for her impending termination notice. On May 31, 2011, while still on maternity leave, Ballesteros discovered that her salary for the period of May 15 to 31, 2011 was not deposited to her account even if her maternity leave was until June 21, 2011. Alarmed, she contacted Castro and found out that the company withheld her salary and would only be released if Ballesteros would process her SSS maternity benefits and tender her resignation letter. Still, Ballesteros refused to resign. On June 5, 2011, Ballesteros received a letter [12] from the company informing her of her termination from the service. On the other hand, the company alleged that Ballesteros' employment was terminated based on her incompetence and inefficiency in the performance of duties. Also, SPID Corp. lost its confidence and trust in Ballesteros because of her continued neglect of duty and habitual absences and tardiness. The company enumerated the following instances showing Ballesteros' incompetence and inefficiency: (a) On July 7, 2008, Ballesteros was issued a memorandum [14] for habitual absences and for neglect of duty which adversely affected her work and for which she was sternly reminded that continued violation may result in suspension or termination; (b) On February 11, 2009, Ballesteros was again admonished for not following company procedure in the preparation of deposit slips; (c) Her continued neglect of duty as a Customer Service Representative constrained the company to re-assign her to the Accounting Department; (d) On September 24, 2010, Ballesteros was reprimanded for incurring a cash shortage due to her admitted lapses; (e) There were other instances that Ballesteros incurred cash shortages; and (f) On February 21, 2011, the company issued a memorandum [16] to Ballesteros requiring her to explain in writing why she should not be terminated from employment, enumerating therein her violations. SPID Corp. alleged that Ballesteros refused to receive the February 21, 2011 memorandum, but instead requested to talk with Cunanan to plea for leniency considering her impending delivery. The memorandum was not a notice of termination, but a notice to explain in writing why Ballesteros should not be terminated. SPID Corp. further alleged that Ballesteros offered to resign after she gives birth as a graceful exit from the company, and requested to be given a certificate of employment to find a new job. This offer was accepted by Cunanan, subject to the condition that Ballesteros submits a formal response to the memorandum to explain. However, Ballesteros failed to submit the explanation within the given period, thus, was deemed to have waived her right to due process. Thus, on January 16, 2012, Ballesteros filed a Complaint [19] for illegal dismissal, non-payment of wages, service incentive leave pay, 13th month pay, damages, and attorney's fees.","the Petition for Review is hereby DENIED. The June 26, 2014 Decision and February 5, 2015 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 130935, which affirmed with modification the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) January 10, 2013 Decision declaring respondent Michelle Elvi C. Ballesteros (Ballesteros) illegally dismissed, are AFFIRMED.","The company failed to present substantial evidence to prove Ballesteros was terminated for a just cause (gross and habitual neglect of duty, open and willful disobedience, or loss of trust and confidence). As to procedural due process, the Court agreed with the Court of Appeals that the two-notice rule was observed, thus affirming the deletion of the nominal damages award.","Petitioner Systems and Plan Integrator and Development Corporation is ordered to REINSTATE respondent Michelle Elvi C.

RENE MONDEJAR, ARNALDO PARTISALA, FRANCISCO TOLENTINO, ILDEFONSO ESPEJO, MARGARITA GUMAPAS, MANUEL PIOLO, ROBERTO B. VELASCO AND HELEN EDITH LEE TAN, ACCUSED;ARNALDO PARTISALA, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","On June 16, 1996, the Sangguniang Barangay of Naslo, Maasin, Iloilo, enacted Resolution No. 9 requesting International Builders Corporation (IBC) to rechannel the path of the Tigum River, granting it authority to extract surplus sand and gravel. On June 21, 1996, the Sangguniang Bayan (SB) of Maasin, Iloilo allegedly enacted Resolution No. 30-A, which endorsed the resolutions of Barangay Naslo and the Municipal Development Council (MDC), and Resolution No. 30-B, authorizing Mayor Rene Mondejar to use his emergency powers to negotiate with IBC for the rechanneling project. Consequently, a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) was entered into between the Municipality and IBC on June 27, 1996, wherein IBC would get the surplus supply of sand and gravel in lieu of monetary consideration. Following complaints of massive quarrying without proper permits, criminal complaints were filed against accused-appellant Arnaldo Partisala, Municipal Vice Mayor and presiding officer of the SB, and his co-accused for violation of Section 3 (e) of RA 3019 (Anti-Graft) and Falsification of Public Documents (Article 171, RPC), alleging that Resolution Nos. 30-A and 30-B were never taken up, deliberated nor acted upon by the SB on its June 21, 1996 regular session. Partisala, who was at large when the judgment was initially promulgated against his co-accused, was later apprehended, and trial ensued against him. He presented an alleged original copy of the Minutes (Exhibit '8') showing that the resolutions were deliberated upon, contradicting the prosecution's evidence (Exhibit 'B') and testimonies of SB members Trojillo and Albacete, who maintained that the resolutions were fraudulent insertions.","On November 23, 2018, the Sandiganbayan rendered its Decision convicting Partisala of Falsification under Article 171 of the RPC and violation of Section 3 (e) of R.A. No. 3019. Thus, he is hereby sentenced to suffer the following: 1. The indeterminate penalty of imprisonment for six (6) years and one (1) month as minimum and ten (10) years as maximum and to suffer perpetual disqualification from public office for violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 under Criminal Case No. 25674; and 2. The imprisonment for two (2) years, four (4) months and one (1) day to four (4) years and two (2) months as minimum to eight (8) years and one (1) day to ten (10) years as maximum penalty in the absence of mitigating and aggravating circumstances in accordance with the provisions of the Indeterminate Sentence Law, to pay a fine amounting to Five Thousand Pesos (Php5,000), and perpetual special disqualification from the right of suffrage.","After due consideration, We resolve to sustain Partisala's conviction of violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019 and Falsification of Public Documents under Article 171 of the RPC. For Falsification, the Court found that all elements under paragraph 2, Article 171 of the RPC were established: Partisala, a public officer, took advantage of his position as Vice-Mayor and presiding officer to participate in executing the falsified minutes (Exhibit '8'), causing it to appear that SB members participated in enacting Resolution Nos. 30-A and 30-B when they did not. For violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019, the Court found that Partisala acted with manifest partiality and bad faith by signing the falsified minutes, which gave Mondejar authority to execute the MOA with IBC. This MOA granted IBC unwarranted benefits, advantage, or preference, by allowing it to extract sand and gravel from Tigum River without the necessary permit from the Provincial Government, causing undue injury to the government. The Court affirmed the Sandiganbayan’s findings of guilt but corrected the penalty imposed for Falsification using the Indeterminate Sentence Law.","WHEREFORE, the appeal is DISMISSED. The November 23, 2018 Decision and February 14, 2019 Resolution of the Sandiganbayan in Criminal Case Nos. 25674 and 25675, are hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION as to the penalty imposed on accused-appellant Arnaldo Partisala for Falsification of Public Document, defined and penalized under Article 171 of the Revised Penal Code. He is hereby sentenced to suffer an imprisonment of two (2) years of prision correccional, as minimum, to eight (8) years and one (1) day of prision mayor as maximum, and to pay a fine of P5,000.00."

THE HEIRS OF EUSTAQUIO BORRAS, NAMELY: ANGELINA B. GARAY, INOCENCIO BORRAS, ESTER SANTANDER, AMADO BORRAS, AND PORFERIO BORRAS, RESPONDENTS.","Procopio Borras (Procopio) was the owner of Lot No. 5275 covered by Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. [NA] 2097. Upon Procopio’s death, the properties were inherited by his children, including Eustaquio Borras (Eustaquio). In 2004, the Heirs of Eustaquio (respondents) claimed ownership of Lot No. 5275, leading petitioners to discover that the lot was registered in Eustaquio’s name. It was found that Eustaquio, during his lifetime, filed a petition for reconstitution before the then Court of First Instance (CFI) of Albay, Branch II (Cad. Case No. RT-1998), with a prayer for the issuance of a transfer certificate of title (TCT) in his name. On July 7, 1980, the CFI issued an Order directing the reconstitution of OCT No. [NA] 2097 in Procopio's name, and 'thereafter, to cancel the reconstituted title and in lieu thereof, to issue a transfer certificate of title' (TCT No. 21502) in Eustaquio's name. Petitioners filed an action for quieting of title before the RTC which declared TCT No. 21502 null and void. On appeal, the CA reversed the RTC Decision, ruling that the RTC had no jurisdiction in a quieting of title case to declare TCT No. 21502 void, suggesting that the proper remedy was either an action for annulment of judgment under Rule 47 or an action for reconveyance. Petitioners subsequently filed before the CA a petition for annulment of judgment (CA-G.R. SP No. 124946) seeking to annul the July 7, 1980 CFI Order insofar as it ordered the issuance of a TCT in Eustaquio’s favor.","On January 15, 2014, the Court of Appeals dismissed the petition for annulment of judgment on the ground that petitioners failed to prove the existence of extrinsic fraud or lack of jurisdiction of the CFI when it promulgated its July 7, 1980 Order. The CA held that while the trial court had exceeded its jurisdiction in ordering the cancellation of the reconstituted title and the issuance of a new title in Eustaquio Borras' favor in a reconstitution case, this was not sufficient to set aside the order because a petition for annulment of judgment on the ground of lack of jurisdiction requires proving 'absolute lack of jurisdiction,' which the trial court's action in excess of its jurisdiction does not meet. The CA ruled that petitioners' proper remedy was a case for reconveyance.","The Supreme Court ruled that the petition is without merit. Annulment of judgment may only be based on extrinsic fraud or absolute lack of jurisdiction. The concept of lack of jurisdiction for purposes of Rule 47 does not embrace grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. The CFI had jurisdiction over the petition for reconstitution at inception. While the CFI acted in excess of its jurisdiction when it ordered the cancellation of OCT No. [NA] 2097 and directed the issuance of a new TCT in favor of Eustaquio (going beyond the purpose of reconstitution), this error was done in the exercise of jurisdiction, not the lack thereof. Since petitioners failed to show an absolute lack of jurisdiction, the annulment of judgment under Rule 47 was not the proper remedy. The proper recourse for petitioners should have been to file an action for reconveyance, a legal and equitable remedy granted to the rightful owner of land wrongfully or erroneously registered in the name of another.","WHEREFORE, the petition is hereby DENIED. The January 15, 2014 Decision and August 14, 2014 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 124946, are AFFIRMED. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 215175, April 25, 2022","ALJEM'S CREDIT INVESTORS CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. SPOUSES CATALINA AND PORFERIO BAUTISTA, RESPONDENTS.","This case is an offshoot of an action[6] for accion publiciana, rescission of contract to sell, with damages and attorney's fees, filed by petitioner against the spouses Bautista. Petitioner alleged that a parcel of land owned by the spouses Bautista was mortgaged to it as security for a loan.[7] The Bautistas failed to pay the loan; thus, petitioner foreclosed the mortgage.[8] As the spouses Baustista did not redeem the property within the reglementary period, title to the property was consolidated in petitioner's name.[9] When petitioner was about to take possession of the property, Catalina Bautista (Catalina), the wife, offered to repurchase the property.[10] Petitioner accepted the offer, so they entered into a Contract to Sell on August 29, 2000.[11] The Spouses Bautista, however, failed to comply with the Contract to Sell resulting to its cancellation.[12] The parties entered into another Contract to Sell on September 27, 2001; however, despite several demands to pay or vacate the property, the spouses Bautista still failed to comply even with a new contract.[13] Thus, petitioner sent demand letters to Catalina to vacate the property.[14] The last demand letter to vacate was sent on January 18, 2006.[15] All demands were to no avail, resulting to petitioner's filing of the complaint.[16] The spouses Bautista alleged that the mortgage contract is void as it did not bear the conformity of Porferio Bautista (Porferio), the husband.[17] They also contended that the contract to sell contains a provision on pactum commissorium, which is illegal, and that the contract should be considered as an equitable mortgage.[18] They likewise contested the high interest rates imposed.[19] Petitioner filed its Reply.[20] Subsequently, petitioner filed a Motion for Summary Judgment,[21] alleging that there is no genuine issue of fact because: (a) the spouses Bautista admitted that the Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) of the property is in petitioner's name; (b) there were no specific denials of the material allegations of the complaint; (c) the defense of the spouses Bautista are legal issues, not factual; and, (d) there is no genuine issue of fact.[22] The spouses Bautista opposed the motion contending that a full-blown trial is necessary to determine: (a) whether there is an equitable mortgage; (b) the propriety of the imposition of the interest rates; (c) presence of pactum commissorium; and, (d) whether Porferio's signature was forged.[23]","In its September 25, 2013 Decision,[27] the CA affirmed the RTC. It held that the defenses raised by the spouses Bautista are triable issues. One of the defenses raised is the invalidity of the mortgage due to the lack of Porferio's conformity. Pursuant to the Family Code, a disposition of a property without the consent of the other spouse is void. Petitioner's right of ownership on the subject property is linked to the mortgage; if the mortgage is invalid due to the lack of Porferio's conformity, petitioner did not validly acquire ownership over the property.[28] The CA also held that there is a need to receive evidence on the allegation of forgery.[29]","The petition lacks merit. The Court affirms the ruling of the CA; the RTC properly denied the Motion for Summary Judgment. ... Based on the foregoing, it is clear that there are still genuine issues of fact that need to be resolved in the trial. Hence, this Court holds that the denial of petitioner's Motion for Summary Judgment is proper (which, again, is the issue here in this appeal).","WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED. The September 25, 2013 Decision and October 9, 2014 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 02287-MIN are AFFIRMED.

(Aeroplus) is engaged in janitorial and manpower services. It hired petitioner Marlon Butial Agapito in February 2004 as a housekeeper with a daily wage of P466.00 less P200.00 a month as cash bond. On December 30, 2014, Aeroplus conducted a meeting with its employees. During the open forum, petitioner asked his immediate supervisor George Constantino (Constantino), ""Bakit po naman unfair ang treatment niyo sa amin. Bakit yung iba hindi niyo pinagagawa ng explanation gayong kapag kami ang na late kahit 30mins, pinagagawa niyo pa."" Constantino retorted - ""Naninilip ka bang kasamahan mo? Ikaw nga eh hindi mo inaayos ang trabaho mo! Masyado kang ma-reklamo, kung ayaw niyo ang patakaran ko lumayas ka dito!"" petitioner explained that he was merely raising a valid concern. On January 5, 2015, petitioner reported the incident to Aeroplus' personnel office. Constantino, however, found out about it and gave him a letter memorandum for insubordination. On February 13, 2015, Aeroplus suspended him until March 3, 2015. Thereafter, on March 3, 2015, petitioner reported for work, only to be told by Aeroplus' OIC-Personnel Darrel Mendoza (Mendoza), ""Wala na tiwala sayo ang Management kaya tanggal ka na!"" When asked to explain, Mendoza merely responded, ""Basta tanggal ka na!"" and ordered him to get out of the office.

Aeroplus Multi-Services, Inc., Mitzi Therese P. De Guzman docketed as NLRC Case No. NCR-0404098-15. The Labor Arbiter found Aeroplus liable for illegal dismissal. On appeal by Aeroplus, the NLRC reversed the LA decision and ordered petitioner to return to work, giving credence to the respective sworn statements of Mendoza and Constantino submitted only for the first time on appeal, which denied the statements alluded by petitioner.

The verbal termination by Aeroplus OIC-Personnel Mendoza – ""Wala na tiwala sayo ang Management kaya tanggal ka na!"" and ""Basta tanggal ka na!,"" immediately followed by an unequivocal order for petitioner to get out of the office, was an outright termination of employment without just cause and due process.

"G.R. No. 222637, April 20, 2022","ATOK GOLD MINING COMPANY, INC., REPRESENTED BY ITS VICE-PRESIDENT FOR OPERATIONS, ENGINEER ROGELIO G. FLORES, PETITIONER, VS. LILY G. FELIX; THE HEIRS OF LYDIA F. BAHINGAWAN; THE PROVINCIAL ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES OFFICER (PENRO) FOR BENGUET; THE COMMUNITY ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES OFFICER (CENRO) FOR BAGUIO CITY; AND THE REGISTER OF DEEDS FOR BENGUET, RESPONDENTS.","AGMCI filed a complaint for the annulment of the following documents, to wit: ( a ) Patent No. 131106-97-622 and the title issued pursuant thereto, particularly Katibayan ng Orihinal na Titulo Blg. P-6554 in the name of the late Lydia Bahingawan; and ( b ) Patent No. 131106-97-690 and the title issued pursuant thereto, particularly Katibayan ng Orihinal na Titulo Blg. P-6560 in the name of Lily G. Felix. AGMCI alleged that the said free patents and certificates of title were secured or issued through misrepresentation and unlawful methods.[5] AGMCI averred that it is a holder of valid and subsisting mineral claims including the disputed mineral land of Blue Jay Fraction in Itogon, Benguet. Accordingly, Gus Peterson located the Blue Jay Fraction in 1924 under the Philippine Bill of 1902 and thereafter sold his mineral claim to AGMCI's predecessor, Atok Big Wedge Co. Inc ( Atok Big Wedge ). Since the inception of its mining operations sometime in 1935, AGMCI, through its predecessor-in-interest, took possession of the mineral land and has been paying taxes therefor.[6] In 1977, the Bureau of Mines granted Atok Big Wedge's application for the availment of rights and privileges granted by Presidential Decree ( P.D. ) No. 463. Meanwhile, Atok Big Wedge continued to perform work obligations on Blue Jay Fraction under the said decree.[7] Atok Big Wedge thereafter applied for a Mineral Production Sharing Agreement over its mineral claims including the contested mineral land. In 2001, Atok Big Wedge assigned its Application for Production Sharing Agreement ( APSA ) to the AGMCI. Thus, at the time of filing of the complaint, AGMCI held the Blue Jay Fraction as a valid and existing mining claim. The Department of Environment and Natural Resources ( DENR ) even issued an area clearance covering AGMCI's APSA.[8] In their Answer, the Provincial Environment and Natural Resources Office ( PENRO ) for Benguet, and the City Environment and Natural Resources Office ( CENRO ) and Register of Deeds, both for Baguio City, maintained that they have issued the challenged free patents in accordance with law. Furthermore, AGMCI has no right on the mineral claim over which the land covered by the free patents overlap. Lily Felix ( Felix ) and the heirs of Lydia Bahingawan ( heirs of Bahingawan ), on the other hand, filed a motion to dismiss averring that AGMCI has no cause of action against them inasmuch as its complaint is already barred by the statute of limitations. They advanced the following arguments: First , neither the original locator, Gus Peterson, nor Atok Big Wedge obtained patent over the Blue Jay Fraction. Thus, the disputed mineral claim remained patentable until the 1970s. Second , in 1977, Atok Big Wedge applied for and was granted an Order of Availment of Rights over its patentable mining claims. Later on, it filed an amended APSA No. 076 but the same was denied. Third , they assert that their occupation and cultivation of their respective parcels, first through their grandparents and parents, then by themselves, was open, in the concept of owners, continuous, public and known to AGMCI. In 1996, they applied for and was thenceforth issued the corresponding free patents and titles over their respective areas.[9] In a Resolution dated October 26, 2005, Presiding Judge Edgardo B. Diaz de Rivera, Jr. of the RTC, Branch 10, La Trinidad, Benguet, granted the motion to dismiss. AGMCI moved for the reconsideration of the said Resolution, but the same was denied.[10] The case was thereafter elevated to the CA. On November 21, 2007, the CA granted the appeal filed by AGMCI. It ruled that AGMCI is the proper party to institute the complaint. Having legal interest over the subject property, it may file the instant case to protect its alleged pre-existing right of ownership and/or possession over the subject land. Thereafter, the CA denied the motion for reconsideration of Felix and the heirs of Bahingawan.[11] The aforesaid CA Decision and Resolution were affirmed by this Court in a Resolution dated March 30, 2009.[12] With these developments, the case was remanded to the RTC, Branch 62 of La Trinidad, Benguet. In its May 26, 2014 Decision, it dismissed AGMCI's complaint for lack of merit. The pertinent portion of the decision reads: x x x But as discussed above, the contention of plaintiff that it is the absolute owner of Blue Jay Fraction mineral claims is not true under the law. It is not also true that Blue Jay Fraction mineral claim was under the exclusive possession of plaintiff because it was established that the private defendants and their predecessors-in-interest were also in possession of portions thereof and has been in occupation and cultivation of the said portions since even before the Second World War. There is likewise no evidence on record to establish the plaintiff's allegation and contention that in securing their free patent and titles over their parcels of land, the private defendants committed fraud or misrepresentation. To the contrary, it was established that the private defendants complied with all the requirements of the law in the filing of their application, and all the procedural safeguards set under the law were complied with. x x x[13] Aggrieved, AGMCI filed an appeal with the CA. Then in a Decision dated August 14, 2015, the CA affirmed the RTC. The CA did not sustain AGMCI's claim over the mining claims on the basis merely of finding them pursuant to the provisions of the Philippine Bill of 1902. It emphasized that merely finding the location of the mining claims does not mean absolute ownership over the affected land or the mining claim. Moreover, the recording of a mining claim only operates to reserve to the registrant exclusive rights to unde1take mining activities upon the land subject of the claim. The CA further found that AGMCI's complaint partook the nature of an action for reversion, which it had no personality to file. The primary objective of an action for reversion is the annulment or cancellation of the certificate of title and the resulting reversion of the land covered by the title to the State. Thus, even if Felix and the heirs of Bahingawan acquired their free patents and titles in bad faith, as AGMCI stressed in their complaint, only the State can institute such reversion proceedings. Nonetheless, the CA affirmed the RTC when it found nothing fraudulent in the processing and grant of the free patent to Felix and the heirs of Bahingawan. Since AGMCI was not the owner of the disputed property, it had no cause of action in the instant case.[14] AGMCI filed a motion for reconsideration,[15] which was denied by the CA in a Resolution[16] dated January 21, 2016. Thus, resort to this present petition for review on certiorari.","Before this Court is the Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] filed by Atok Gold Mining Company, Inc. ( AGMCI ) challenging the Decision[2] dated August 14, 2015 and the Resolution[3] dated January 21, 2016 of the Court of Appeals ( CA ) in CA-G.R. CV No. 102865, which affirmed the Decision[4] dated May 26, 2014 of the Regional Trial Court ( RTC ), Branch 62, La Trinidad, Benguet, that dismissed its complaint for annulment of title.","At the outset, it bears noting that there are two requirements to successfully pursue a cause of action for declaration of nullity of free patent and certificate of title: (1) the plaintiffs ownership of the contested lot prior to the issuance of such free patent and certificate of title; and (2) the defendant's fraud or mistake, as the case may be, in successfully obtaining these documents of title over the parcel of land claimed by the plaintiff.[25] ... Unfortunately, petitioner failed to satisfy both requirements. As found by the RTC, and later affirmed by the CA, petitioner failed to prove its ownership over the Blue Jay Fraction and private respondents' fraud in obtaining their free patents. This Court, not being a trier of facts, finds nothing in the records to warrant a reversal of the RTC's findings. Petitioner failed to prove its ownership over the Blue Jay Fraction... for well-settled is the rule that mere location does not mean absolute ownership over the affected land or the mining claim.[29] ... Petitioner, however, cannot hide behind the doctrine galvanized by the Court in McDaniel . A mining claim under the Philippine Bill of 1902 does not vest immediately upon mere location thereof.[35] ... In any event, Atok Big Wedge Mining Company v. Intermediate Appellate Court[43] has settled, once and for all, that the rights of a mining claim holder under the Philippine Bill of 1902 ""were not, in the first place, absolute or in the nature of ownership, and neither were they intended to be so.""[44] ... It bears pointing out that petitioner has instituted an action for annulment of certificates of title, which, as earlier intimated, requires it to prove no less than its ownership over the contested lots prior to the issuance of the free patents and certificates of title to private respondents.[47] ... The Court finds no reversible error in the CA's ruling. Even assuming otherwise, public respondents' issuance of the free patents and certificates of title enjoy a presumption of regularity in the performance of their official duties.[58] ... The RTC, however, found that Atok Big Wedge was very much aware of the cadastral survey being conducted in the area which could affect its surface claims.[63] This would have alerted Atok Big Wedge to file its opposition to private respondents' applications.[64] Unfortunately, Atok Big Wedge did nothing to oppose private respondents' applications, which led public respondents to issue the free patents and certificates of title.[65] Accordingly, the Court upholds the presumption of regularity in public respondents' favor. Petitioner failed to prove private respondents' fraud in obtaining their free patents... In sum, the party who alleges a fact has the burden of proving it. Section 1,[71] Rule 131 of the Revised Rules on Evidence provides that the burden of proof is the duty of a party to present evidence on the facts in issue necessary to establish his or her claim or defense by the amount of evidence required by law. Simply put, petitioner failed to satisfy the requirements for an action for annulment of free patents and certificates of title to prosper. Here, petitioner failed to prove their ownership over the Blue Jay Fraction and private respondents' fraud in obtaining their free patents.","WHEREFORE , premises considered, the petition is DENIED . The Decision dated August 14, 2015 and the Resolution dated January 21, 2016 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 102865 are AFFIRMED .

MUNICIPALITY OF SUGPON, ILOCOS SUR, HEREIN REPRESENTED BY MAYOR FERNANDO C. QUITON,* SR., RESPONDENT.","The dispute involved a 1,117.20-ha. parcel of land found within the boundaries of the Municipality of Bakun, Province of Benguet, represented by Mayor Fausto T. Labinio (Bakun), and the Municipality of Sugpon, Province of Ilocos Sur, represented by Mayor Gernando C. Quiton, Sr. (Sugpon). The case was referred to the Sangguniang Panlalawigan, which then created a joint committee to settle the controversy. After due proceedings, on May 12, 2014, the Sangguniang Panlalawigan issued Joint Resolution No. 1, Series of 2014 adjudicating the disputed area to Bakun. Aggrieved, Sugpon appealed to the RTC. On April 28, 2015, the RTC issued a Resolution reversing Joint Resolution No. 1, Series of 2014... and hereby adjudicates the disputed area of 1,117.20 hectares... unto or as part and parcel of the territorial jurisdiction of Petitioner-Appellant Municipality of Sugpon, Ilocos Sur. Unsuccessful at reconsideration, Bakun filed a petition before the CA. In a Decision dated February 1, 2018, the CA denied Bakun's petition and maintained that the disputed land is within the jurisdiction of Sugpon. The CA denied Bakun's Motion for Reconsideration in a Resolution dated July 6, 2018. Hence, this recourse. Bakun proffers that it presented greater weight of evidence that the disputed area belonged to the municipality. Furthermore, Bakun insists that the boundary separating Bakun and Sugpon was already defined by Act Nos. 1646 and 2877.",The petition lacks merit.,"This Court is not a trier of facts. Generally, only questions of law can be raised in a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, subject to limited exceptions. Here, we do not find any of the exceptions present to justify a re-evaluation of the findings of fact of the trial court as affirmed by the appellate court. On the contrary, the CA and RTC's findings are supported by the evidence on record. First, Sugpon presented the Administrative Map of Benguet showing that the disputed area is beyond the territorial area of Benguet and is, in fact, inside the territorial jurisdiction of Sugpon. This was corroborated by other documentary evidence, such as Land Classification Map Nos. 3441 and 1298, the Topographic and Administrative Map of Ilocos Sur, and a certification from the officer-in-charge of the Community Environment and Natural Resources Office of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, which shows that the disputed areas are within the territory of Sugpon. In addition, the Department of Agrarian Reform issued a certification stating that the disputed areas are located in Sugpon... Further, Sugpon submitted a Certificate of Ancestral Domain Title showing that the disputed area has been continuously occupied, possessed, and utilized by the indigenous people and residents of Sugpon. On the other hand, Bakun relies on Act Nos. 1646 and 2877, insisting that these laws define the boundaries of Bakun and Sugpon. We do not agree. ... Act No. 2877, however, did not categorically fix the exact boundaries of the municipalities of Bakun and Sugpon... Bakun simply failed to show, by preponderant evidence, that the conflicted areas are located within the ""new boundary line.""",the petition is DENIED.
"G.R. No. 216655, April 20, 2022","LOVELLE SHELLY S. CAYABYAB-NAVARROSA, PETITIONER, VS. MARK ANTHONY E. NAVARROSA, RESPONDENT, REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, OPPOSITOR.","Petitioner alleged that she met respondent at the Perpetual Help Hospital in Biñan, Laguna where she was an intern in the College of Medicine, while respondent was a nurse at the Emergency Room Department. In 2001, petitioner and respondent became lovers. During the early part of their relationship, respondent would often confide to petitioner about his resentment towards his parents who always favored his eldest sibling. [5] In 2004, respondent went to Singapore to work, and petitioner eventually followed. However, when petitioner became pregnant, they returned to the Philippines to get married. On August 15, 2006, petitioner and respondent were married in Pulang Lupa II, Las Piñas City. After their wedding, they went back to Singapore. Since respondent had lost his job prior to their wedding, petitioner was the only one who continued working. [6] While in Singapore, respondent would always turn off his mobile phone whenever he would go out. When asked about it, he would throw a tantrum and yell at petitioner. At one point, respondent even tried to hit petitioner, but the latter was able to successfully dodge. Usually, respondent would come home late in the evening, or in the wee hours of the morning. He also spent most of his time with his friends instead of petitioner, even on special occasions like Christmas and New Year. Petitioner was often alone and even went to her prenatal checkups by herself. [7] On January 2, 2007, the couple returned to the Philippines in preparation for the birth of their child. During that time, petitioner entrusted respondent with her ATM card. However, upon online monitoring of her bank account, petitioner discovered that respondent withdrew a huge amount of money that she saved for her childbirth, which the latter used to support his parents, niece, and nephew instead. When petitioner confronted respondent about the same, the latter yelled at her and accused her of spying on him. [8] When the couple went back to Singapore a month after petitioner gave birth, they brought along respondent's mother with them to take care of the baby while petitioner was at work. Meanwhile, respondent, despite being jobless, continued to indulge in his vices and party with his friends, and frequently came home late at night. He also verbally abused petitioner in front of his mother. Nevertheless, petitioner tried to patch things up and address the growing gap between them, but respondent told her that he did not love her anymore. [9] In August 2007, petitioner and respondent had their final confrontation. Respondent left their home and petitioner never heard from him again. [10] Petitioner then filed a Petition for Declaration of Absolute Nullity of Marriage dated July 19, 2010, averring that respondent is psychologically incapacitated as manifested by his acts of abandoning her after she gave birth to their child, failing to provide family support, and failing out of love with her. [11] Despite receipt of summons, [12] respondent did not file his answer. [13] Subsequently, the case proceeded to trial, during which petitioner testified, as well as her witnesses, namely: Dr. Maricris Reyes Marucut (Dr. Marucut), a clinical psychologist, and Glenn Caballero (Glenn), a neighbor and former employee of respondent's parents. Dr. Marucut testified and affirmed the contents of her Psychological Evaluation Report. In her report, she concluded that based on the data she gathered from petitioner, petitioner's sister, and two common friends of the couple, respondent is suffering from a personality disorder clinically classified as Passive-Aggressive Personality Disorder with underlying narcissistic traits, a condition deemed to be grave, severe-chronic in proportion, and incurable by any treatment. [14] On the other hand, Glenn testified about the past rumors spreading in their neighborhood that respondent had other girlfriends despite being married to petitioner. He also stated that in one instance, he even saw respondent put his arm on another woman's shoulder and kissed her. [15]","Assailed in this petition for review on certiorari [1] is the Decision [2] dated January 29, 2015 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 97902, which annulled and set aside the Decision [3] dated June 29, 2011 and the Order [4] dated September 5, 2011 of the Regional Trial Court of Guimba, Nueva Ecija, Branch 33 (RTC), declaring the marriage of petitioner Lovelle Shelly S. Cayabyab-Navarrosa and respondent Mark Anthony E. Navarrosa (respondent) null and void on the ground of the latter's psychological incapacity. In a Decision [16] dated June 29, 2011, the RTC declared the marriage between petitioner and respondent null and void on the ground of psychological incapacity. The Republic, through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), moved for reconsideration, but was denied in an Order [19] dated September 5, 2011. Hence, the OSG appealed to the CA. In a Decision [20] dated January 29, 2015, the CA annulled and set aside the RTC ruling, and accordingly, dismissed the complaint for declaration of nullity of marriage filed by petitioner. The CA ruled that the totality of evidence was insufficient to prove respondent's psychological incapacity. Meanwhile, Dr. Marucut's testimony and psychological report failed to conclusively show that respondent is suffering from a psychological illness, noting that the persons that she interviewed were petitioner, petitioner's sister, and the parties' common friends. [22] Aggrieved, petitioner filed the instant petition.","The petition is meritorious. In the recent case of Tan-Andal v. Andal (Tan-Andal), [23] the Court abandoned previous jurisprudence on psychological incapacity and definitively pronounced that psychological incapacity is 'neither a mental incapacity nor a personality disorder that must be proven through expert opinion.' [24] Psychological incapacity consists of clear acts of dysfunctionality that show a lack of understanding and concomitant compliance with one's essential marital obligations due to psychic causes. The Court refined the requisites of juridical antecedence, incurability, and gravity based on the Tan-Andal ruling. Applying this, the Court found that petitioner had sufficiently overcome the burden to prove the nullity of her marriage by clear and convincing evidence. Respondent's acts of abandonment, financial irresponsibility, and falling out of love demonstrated an undeniable pattern of persisting failure to fulfill his essential marital obligations, rendering the incapacity incurable. His failure was rooted in a genuine anomaly in his psychological makeup, satisfying the requisite of gravity. Furthermore, evidence of respondent's history of resentment towards his parents, signs of irresponsibility prior to marriage, and conduct during their 'lived conjugal life' established juridical antecedence, confirming that respondent's psychological incapacity already existed in all reasonable likelihood at the time their marriage was celebrated. The Court held that the psychological report, based on collateral information, was admissible and reliable since Dr. Marucut was qualified as an expert witness and respondent refused to participate in the interview.","WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated January 29, 2015 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 97902 is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The Decision dated June 29, 2011 and the Order dated September 5, 2011 of the Regional Trial Court of Guimba, Nueva Ecija, Branch 33 are hereby REINSTATED. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 213954, April 20, 2022","HANNAMER C. PUGOY-SOLIDUM, PETITIONER, VS. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, * RESPONDENT.","Hannamer and Grant were classmates during their fourth year in high school and eventually became sweethearts. After graduation, Hannamer found work and started living with Grant. At that time, Grant's parents were fond of Hannamer for being hardworking and the breadwinner of Grant's family. However, things changed when she got pregnant and had to stop working. After Hannamer gave birth, her mother convinced her and Grant to get married. On March 12, 2003, Judge Albert S. Abragan of the RTC of Iligan City, solemnized the marriage of Hannamer and Grant. Hannamer spent for their wedding, as well as their child's baptismal expenses. Unemployed, Grant could not contribute a single centavo for their living expenses, which were all shouldered by Hannamer's mother. When Hannamer's mother decided to move in with the couple after quitting her job in Manila, the couple's relationship turned sour culminating to Hannamer leaving their house and staying with Grant's relatives instead. From that time on, Grant never visited nor sent financial support for Hannamer and their child. Eventually, Hannamer lost contact with Grant when she moved to another town with her mother and child. On January 3, 2010, Hannamer filed a petition for declaration of nullity of marriage under Article 36 of the Family Code before the RTC of Tagaytay City. Hannamer alleged that Grant was psychologically incapacitated to comply with all the essential marital obligations. She averred that Grant showed complete lack of understanding of his duties and responsibilities as a husband and father during their marriage. He never worked, and only depended on his older sibling for financial support. Despite not earning, Grant spent most of his time and money on gambling and going to cockfights, instead of taking care of his family. On February 2, 2011, copies of the summons and petition were served on Grant through his uncle, Sonny R. Montano, at their residence. However, on the scheduled date of the hearing, only Hannamer appeared. The Assistant Provincial Prosecutor filed a report dated March 16, 2011, manifesting that she was not in a position to conclude whether or not collusion existed between the parties, due to Grant's absence. Nevertheless, she undertook to actively participate in the proceedings to ensure that evidence is not fabricated. During trial, Hannamer testified on her own behalf. Dr. Visitacion Revita (Dr. Revita) also testified and affirmed the contents of her Judicial Affidavit, as well as her psychological report. Based on the narrations of Hannamer, Dr. Revita diagnosed Grant with narcissistic personality disorder with anti-social and dependent traits that is characterized by an overwhelming and grandiose sense of self-importance. As a result, he expects Hannamer to meet all his demands and expectations. His disorder was considered grave and incurable, rendering him incapacitated to perform the essential marital obligations. Dr. Revita traced back the root of Grant's disorder to ""his childhood; the kind of upbringing, family atmosphere and environmental influences to which he was exposed during his early formative years. His exposure to a tolerant, dysfunctional and permissive family setup has largely contributed to the development of a faulty value system characterized by absence of discipline and respect for others."" Dr. Revita also testified that she was not able to personally examine Grant because the latter failed to respond to her request for a psychological evaluation. Nevertheless, she deemed the marital history narrated by Hannamer reliable and truthful. She also stated that as a corroborating witness, Hannamer's mother fully substantiated Hannamer's narration of her history with Grant.","In its Decision dated June 29, 2011, the RTC granted the petition and declared the marriage between Hannamer and Grant as void ab initio... The Republic, through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), moved for reconsideration, but the same was denied in an Order dated August 26, 2011. Discontented, the OSG filed an appeal with the CA. In its Decision dated March 31,2014, the CA granted the OSG's appeal. The assailed Decision dated June 29, 2011 and Order dated 26 August 2011 of the Regional Trial Court-Branch 18 (Tagaytay City, Cavite) are REVERSED AND SET ASIDE and a new judgment [is] entered DISMISSING the petition for lack of merit. The marriage between Hannamer C. Pugoy-Solidum and Grant C. Solidum remains valid and subsisting.","The petition lacks merit. To render a marriage void ab initio under Article 36 of the Family Code, jurisprudence dictates that psychological incapacity must be characterized by: (1) gravity, i.e., it must be grave and serious such that the party would be incapable of carrying out the ordinary duties required in a marriage; (2) juridical antecedence, i.e., it must be rooted in the history of the party antedating the marriage, although the overt manifestations may emerge only after the marriage; and (3) incurability, i.e., it must be incurable, or even if it were otherwise, the cure would be beyond the means of the party involved. ... Guided by the foregoing measures [Tan-Andal guidelines], this Court finds that Hannamer failed to sufficiently prove that Grant is psychologically incapacitated to comply with one's essential marital obligations. Hannamer's testimony that: (1) she was the breadwinner of Grant's family, while Grant never worked and only spent his time in gambling and cockfighting; (2) their relationship turned sour after she got pregnant; (3) Grant's parents were no longer fond of her for being an additional mouth to feed; (4) that Grant asked her to leave with her mother and child after being instructed by his parents; and (5) even after their forced departure, Grant did not bother to go after her and their child, failed to prove Grant's alleged psychological incapacity. These allegations do not necessarily constitute psychological incapacity. ... We agree with the CA in holding that the psychological report is bereft of any factual basis proving Grant's psychological incapacity. It fails to prove the enduring aspects of Grant's personality called 'personality structure' that manifest itself through clear acts of dysfunctionality that render him unable to discharge the essential marital obligations. Notably, there is no evidence on record proving that Grant's alleged psychological incapacity existed prior to their marriage. Verily, Hannamer also failed to provide any background on Grant's past experiences or environment growing up that could have triggered his behavior. Dr. Revita's findings were not related or linked to Grant's alleged psychological incapacity except in a general way. ... To stress, what is important is that the totality of evidence must support a finding of psychological incapacity. In other words, the totality of evidence must still be sufficient to prove that the incapacity was grave, incurable, and existing prior to the time of the marriage. However, We find the same wanting in this case. Apart from the testimonies of Hannamer and Dr. Revita, and the latter's psychological report, there is no other evidence presented to support the allegation of Grant's psychological incapacity.","WHEREFORE, the instant petition is hereby DENIED. The March 31, 2014 Decision and August 18, 2014 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 97935 sustaining the validity of the marriage of Hannamer C. Pugoy-Solidum with her husband Grant C. Solidum, are AFFIRMED. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 244433, April 19, 2022","ANTONIO R. CRUZ AND LORETO TERESITA CRUZ-DIMAYACYAC, AS HEIRS OF THE LATE SPOUSES DR. PROGEDIO R. CRUZ AND TERESA REYES, PETITIONERS, VS. CARLING CERVANTES AND CELIA CERVANTES SANTOS AND ALL PERSONS CLAIMING RIGHTS UNDER THEM, RESPONDENTS.","The case stemmed from a Complaint[6] for unlawful detainer, dated February 22, 2016, filed with the MTC, Plaridel, Bulacan, by Antonio R. Cruz and Loreto Teresita Cruz-Dimayacyac (petitioners) against Carling Cervantes and Celia Cervantes Santos (respondents). Petitioners alleged that they were the children and surviving heirs of the late spouses Dr. Progedio R. Cruz (Progedio) and Teresa Reyes (Teresa) (collectively, spouses Cruz). During the lifetime of spouses Cruz, they owned a parcel of land (subject property) situated in Bintog, Plaridel, Bulacan. Sometime in 1960, Carling Cervantes' (Carling) father Isidro Sta. Cruz Cervantes (Isidro), accompanied by a close relative of Progedio, went to the residence of spouses Cruz in Oroquieta, Manila, to ask permission if he and his family could temporarily occupy a portion of the subject property and erect a residential house thereon. Teresa granted Isidro's request subject to the condition that he and his family would vacate the property upon the demand of spouses Cruz when the need for the property arises.[8] Progedio and Teresa died in 1966 and 1999, respectively. Petitioners, who became the owners of the subject property by succession, continued to tolerate the occupation of Isidro and his family. In 2005, Isidro passed away. His children, herein respondents Carling and Celia Cervantes Santos (Celia), continued to occupy the subject property with the same condition that such possession would only be temporary and that they would vacate the same upon petitioners' demand.[9] In 2015, petitioners decided to sell the property... Hence, on October 20, 2015, petitioners, through their counsel, sent a demand letter to respondents... The letter formally revoked the permission and tolerance they had extended to respondents... Respondents were directed to vacate the same within fifteen (15) days from receipt of the letter. Notwithstanding receipt of the demand letter, respondents failed and refused to turn over the possession of the subject property to petitioners.[10] Hence, the complaint for unlawful detainer was filed. In respondents' Answer[12] dated March 11, 2016, they averred that the MTC had no jurisdiction over the complaint for unlawful detainer because the subject property is an agricultural land and respondents are tenants thereof. They succeeded in the tenancy rights of their father Isidro who was the tenant of spouses Cruz. As such, it was the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB) which should determine the rights and obligations of the parties over the subject property.[13] Respondents likewise paid compensation to the owners, as shown by a tally sheet issued by C. Adelia Rice Mill showing the following entry: “Name: Mrs. Teresa Reyes Vda de Cruz; Kasama: Isidro Cervante[s];”[14] and a handwritten receipt dated March 31, 1992 with the following notations: “Buwis sa Bakuran x x x ni Sidro Cervantes; Tinanggap ni Kapt. Peping Villalon x x x.”[15] In an Order[18] dated March 29, 2016, MTC... referred the case to the Provincial Agrarian Reform Office (PARO)... On October 28, 2016, Engineer Emmanuel G. Aguinaldo, Provincial Agrarian Reform Program Officer II of PARO Baliuag, Bulacan, issued a Certification[21] to the effect that the case was agrarian in nature because it involves an agricultural land and the cause of action was the ejectment of a farmer, farmworker or a tenant which was within the primary and exclusive jurisdiction of the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR). The PARO recommended the MTC's dismissal of the case for lack of jurisdiction.","The CA decision denied petitioners' appeal, assailing the Decision[4] dated February 28, 2018 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 15, Malolos City, which, in turn, denied petitioners' appeal from, and affirmed, the Order[5] dated February 9, 2017 of the Municipal Trial Court (MTC) of Plaridel, Bulacan, which dismissed the complaint for unlawful detainer filed by petitioners. . . Pursuant thereto, the MTC, Plaridel, Bulacan, issued an Order[23] dated February 9, 2017 dismissing the case for lack of jurisdiction. . . In a Decision[25] dated February 28, 2018, the RTC denied the appeal and affirmed the MTC's ruling. . . In its Decision[27] dated September 27, 2018, the CA denied the appeal and affirmed the RTC decision. It ruled that the MTC correctly referred the action to the PARO of Bulacan pursuant to respondents' allegation that they were agricultural tenants of petitioners' parents, spouses Cruz. Thereafter, the PARO issued a Certification,[28] dated October 28, 2016, that the case is agrarian in nature. . . Pursuant thereto, the MTC correctly dismissed the complaint for unlawful detainer due to lack of jurisdiction.","We rule in the negative. Consequently, we grant the petition and remand the case to the MTC for further proceedings. . . We hold that, pursuant to the relevant provisions of RA No. 6657, as amended, and taking into consideration the issuances appurtenant thereto, the MTC did not err when it referred the case to the PARO. . . Despite the foregoing, We find that the MTC erred in relying on the certification issued by the PARO. . . Specifically, as observed by Justice Perlas-Bernabe during the deliberations, and as reiterated by Justice Caguioa, the certification failed to state the findings of fact upon which the determination by the PARO are based.[43] The Certification leaves the courts with no basis to ascertain the evidence from which its findings were drawn. Thus, the MTC erred when it adopted the PARO's certification and dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction. . . In fine, the Court holds that respondents failed to discharge the burden of proving that Isidro, their predecessor-in-interest, was an agricultural tenant of Spouses Cruz, and that the instant case involves an agrarian dispute cognizable by the DARAB. There being no agricultural tenancy relationship established in this case, the MTC has jurisdiction over the unlawful detainer case filed by the petitioners against the respondents.","WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated September 27, 2018 and the Resolution dated January 21, 2019, of the Court of Appeals, Manila in CA-G.R. SP. No. 155023, are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The case is hereby REMANDED to the Municipal Trial Court of Plaridel, Bulacan, for further proceedings."

COMMISSION ON AUDIT PROPER AND COMMISSION ON AUDIT REGIONAL OFFICE NO. XIII, BUTUAN CITY, RESPONDENTS.","The Department of Budget and Management (DBM) Regional Office No. XIII disapproved the separate item for EME appropriation in the City of Butuan's annual budget for the fiscal year 2000 as it violates Section 325(h)[4] of Republic Act (RA) No. 7160[5] or the Local Government Code of 1991 (LGC), which prohibits appropriations with the same purpose as that of discretionary funds. The DBM explained that the EME is deemed part of the discretionary expenses of the local chief executive; hence, cannot be a separate item of appropriation.[6] The Sangguniang Panlungsod (SP) of Butuan City sought reconsideration, but the DBM affirmed the disapproval of such appropriation in its Legal Opinion No. L-B-2001-10.[7] Nevertheless, the SP of Butuan City enacted SP Ordinance No. 2557-2004,[8] granting EME allowances to certain officials.[9] By virtue of this, a series of EME disbursements were made. On January 12, 2006, the Regional Legal and Adjudication Office, COA Regional Office No. XIII, issued Notice of Disallowance (ND) No. 2006-001 (2004) disallowing the EMEs paid in June and July 2004 in the total amount of P973,409.09 for lack of legal basis. No appeal was taken within the reglementary period, rendering the ND final. Accordingly, a Notice of Finality of Decision (NFD) and Final Order of Adjudication (now COA Order of Execution) were issued on October 26, 2009.[10] Meanwhile, the City Government of Butuan continued to appropriate and grant EME to its officials until 2010.[11] Consequently, eight more NDs[12] (2009 NDs) were issued in March 2009, disallowing the EMEs paid in 2008 for a total amount of P2,177,463.16.[13] An appeal was filed but was denied in COA Regional Office XIII Decision No. 2011-046.[14] On January 24, 2012, 87 more NDs[15] (2012 NDs) were issued, disallowing all other EMEs paid from 2004 to 2009. Petitioners, as recipients held liable to settle the disallowances, appealed all 2012 NDs, together with seven[16] of the 2009 NDs, to the COA Regional Office XIII on July 31, 2012. In its Decision No. 2013-007[17] dated May 6, 2013, the COA Regional Office No. XIII denied the consolidated appeals for lack of merit. The disallowances were sustained in accordance with DBM Legal Opinion No. L-B-2001-10. The Regional Director ruled that the DBM is empowered under Section 326 of the LGC to review appropriation ordinances. Since DBM Legal Opinion No. L-B-2001-10 has never been questioned, it remains valid and effective, leaving the EME disbursements without legal basis. Thus, petitioners cannot claim any legal right over the EMEs paid to them. An appeal was lodged before the COA Proper but was likewise denied for lack of merit in the assailed Decision No. 2016-488.[18] The COA Proper affirmed the COA Regional Office XIII Decision No. 2013-007 as regards the 2012 NDs. On the other hand, the COA Proper found that the 2009 NDs were already affirmed in COA Regional Office XIII Decision No. 2011-046, and no appeal from that decision was filed within the reglementary period; hence, an NFD and an Order of Execution were ordered to be issued therefor.[19] In the present recourse, petitioners invoke their right to speedy disposition of cases since the proceedings before the COA Regional Office XIII took more than one (1) year and four (4) months from the issuance of the NDs on January 24, 2012, up to the time its Decision No. 2013-007 was rendered.[20] Thereafter, it took another three (3) years and seven (7) months for the COA Proper to resolve the appeal. Substantively, petitioners argue that they are not legally bound by the DBM Legal Opinion as it was issued as a response to the SP's query, to which they are not signatories.[21] Petitioners further claim that the EME disallowances are anathema to the city government's constitutionally-guaranteed fiscal autonomy. Lastly, petitioners invoke good faith as passive recipients of the disallowed EMEs to exculpate them from the liability to refund.[22] For its part, the COA Proper maintains that the period dedicated to the resolution of the case did not exceed the reasonable limits for the work involved. It contends that there is no showing that the apparent delay is vexatious, capricious, and oppressive as to violate petitioners' right to speedy disposition of a case.[23] Substantively, the COA Proper contends that DBM Legal Opinion No. L-B-2001-10 was issued upon the City of Butuan's request; thus, binding upon the city and all its officials/employees. It further explains that the disallowances did not subvert the principle of fiscal autonomy as local government units (LGU) are still bound by the state policy of judicious utilization of public funds and properties.[24] Finally, the COA Proper argues that petitioners must refund the EME they received for being given without legal basis.[25]","This Petition for Certiorari[1] under Rule 64, in relation to Rule 65, of the Revised Rules of Court assails the Decision No. 2016-488[2] dated December 29, 2016 of the Commission on Audit (COA) Proper and the Resolution No. 2018-012[3] dated October 26, 2017 of the COA En Banc, which upheld the disallowance of the extraordinary and miscellaneous expenses (EME) paid to several City Government of Butuan officials for calendar years 2004 to 2009, amounting to an aggregate of P8,099,080.66.","The petition lacks merit. I. No violation of the right to speedy disposition of cases. The substantial period taken to resolve the consolidated appeals covering 94 disallowances and complicated by the destruction of pertinent records in a fire, was found not to be capricious or oppressive. Furthermore, petitioners failed to seasonably question the violation of their right throughout the proceedings before the COA. II. EME disbursements properly disallowed. EME appropriations and discretionary funds have the same purpose; thus, the separate amount appropriated in the local budget ordinance is a patent circumvention of the limitation under Section 325(h) of the LGC, which expressly prohibits the appropriation of a separate amount for discretionary purposes other than the two percent (2%) allocated for the local chief executive's discretionary fund. Furthermore, the SP designations of officials to equivalent ranks were made without authorization from the DBM, contravening the General Appropriations Acts. III. Passive recipients are liable to refund. Petitioners' invocation of good faith as passive recipients cannot exonerate their liability to refund, applying the principles of solutio indebiti and unjust enrichment, as the EME grants were solely hinged upon the appropriation in the local ordinance and no vouchers were presented to substantiate the reimbursements. The three-year-period rule for absolution does not apply since sufficient notice on the illegality of the EME disbursements was already available even before the issuance of the 2012 NDs, considering the similar disallowances issued in 2006 and 2009.","FOR THESE REASONS, the Petition for Certiorari is DISMISSED. The Decision No. 2016-488 dated December 29, 2016 and the Resolution No. 2018-012 dated October 26, 2017 of the Commission on Audit Proper are AFFIRMED. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 247916, April 19, 2022","RADM CECIL R. CHEN PCG (RET.), PETITIONER, VS. FIELD INVESTIGATION BUREAU, RESPONDENT.","On September 26, 2016, the Field Investigation Bureau of the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for the Military and Other Law Enforcement Offices (FIB-MOLEO) filed 21 complaints against 25 Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) officials for Serious Dishonesty, Grave Misconduct, and Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service. The case stemmed from an anonymous complaint regarding the utilization of PCG funds, particularly as to the liquidation of cash advances and the reimbursements of expenses submitted in Calendar Year 2014, based on Audit Observation Memorandum No. PCG-2015- 018 (AOM 15-018) dated April 15, 2015 issued by the Commission on Audit (COA). COA's verification showed that cash advances lacked the required office orders duly designating the respective recipients as SDOs. Also, some business establishments were not found in the addresses indicated in their sales invoices (SI), cash invoices (CI) or official receipts (OR). Petitioner was noted for two transactions: DV No. 13-12-7138 (P1,000,000.00) and DV No. 14-02-0320 (P1,000,000.00). Petitioner alleged that he was designated as SDO pursuant to special orders, depended on personnel and the Accounting Department, had no part in procurement, invoked good faith, and denied the authenticity of his purported signature relative to one cash advance. The Ombudsman Special Panel rendered its Consolidated Decision finding all concerned PCG officials, including petitioner, guilty of Serious Dishonesty, Grave Misconduct and Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service and meted the penalty of DISMISSAL. The CA affirmed this ruling.",The petition is DENIED for lack of merit.,"The Court finds no reason to rule differently. Both the Ombudsman and the CA found substantial evidence that petitioner, together with his co-respondents, is guilty of serious dishonesty, grave misconduct, and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service. The Court held that the disbursement of public funds without proper supporting documents, the improper accounting of SCAs before release of additional ones, and the unnecessary resort to Emergency Purchase violated government auditing and procurement rules (COA CN. 97-002, PD 1445, and RA 9184). The defense of reliance on subordinates (Arias doctrine) is unavailing because the irregularities were apparent on the documents’ face, showing a grave abuse of authority and conscious evasion of transparency. In view of the attending circumstances, the Court agrees with the Ombudsman and the CA's findings that petitioner is guilty of Serious Dishonesty, Grave Misconduct, and Conduct Prejudicial to Best Interest of the Service.","The petition is DENIED for lack of merit. The Decision dated July 30, 2018 and the Resolution dated June 20, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 153865 are AFFIRMED. The petitioner is found guilty of Serious Dishonesty, Grave Misconduct, and Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service, and is imposed the penalty of a fine equivalent to his one year salary, deductible from his receivables, along with the accessory penalties of forfeiture of retirement benefits, cancellation of eligibility, and perpetual disqualification to hold public office."
"G.R. No. 236827, April 19, 2022","ELIZABETH A. ALBERTO, PETITIONER, VS. JOSE LUIS R. ALBERTO AND REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENTS.","Elizabeth and Jose Luis R. Alberto (Jose) met in Madrid, Spain in 1995, where Elizabeth was working as Cultural Assistant of the Philippine Embassy and where Jose was studying for a master's degree. After joining several group dates, the two broke up with their respective partners and became sweethearts. They lived together in Madrid from 1996 to 1997; at that time, Jose had to return to the Philippines to look for work. On January 14, 1998, while Elizabeth was on vacation in the Philippines, the two got married in San Fernando, Pampanga. Two days later, Elizabeth flew back to Madrid, while Jose was left behind because of his job. Jose visited Elizabeth in Spain from December 1998 until January 1999. Soon, Elizabeth became pregnant and gave birth to their first child, Joaquin Carlos A. Alberto (Joaquin Carlos), on September 18, 1999. According to Elizabeth, even before they got married, she noticed that Jose was irresponsible—he would get drunk until he passes out; he would also smoke cigarettes and marijuana; and he had bouts of depression. However, she overlooked all these shortcomings and hoped that she could change him for the better. While Elizabeth was working in Madrid, Jose had an affair with a certain Joyce David (Joyce). Elizabeth saw in Jose's cellular phone romantic and erotic messages from Joyce. Joyce also sent letters and a picture of her and Jose to Elizabeth; she told the latter that it was useless for her to stop the affair because Jose ""craves"" for her (Joyce) in bed. Jose confirmed his relationship with Joyce and promised to stop it. But after that, Jose would seldom come home. Elizabeth also learned that Jose and Joyce had sexual intercourse in front of Joaquin Carlos. After Jose confessed and promised to end the affair, Elizabeth gave him another chance. In 2002, they planned to go to Canada where she was assigned. But Jose was unhappy, and his behavior made it difficult for Elizabeth to recover from the hurts of the past. After giving birth to their second child, Ma. Teresa A. Alberto, in April 2003, Elizabeth no longer slept in the same room with Jose and had no sexual contact with him since then. The two eventually parted ways in 2008; Jose stopped communicating and giving support to Elizabeth and their children. Elizabeth asserted that during their cohabitation as husband and wife, Jose fell short of his financial obligations as he was often without a job. He would get depressed and sleep for long hours. He would rely on her to make decisions in the household. He did not care for the children even when they were sick, and he did not attend their school activities. He even physically hurt their eldest child to get him to obey his orders. Clinical psychologist Dr. Rowena R. Belen (Dr. Belen) identified the report she prepared based on tests conducted on Elizabeth, as well as on interviews with Elizabeth and the children. She also tried to get in touch with Jose, but was unable to do so. Based on her evaluation, Dr. Belen concluded that Jose has a Narcissistic Personality Disorder. This is shown by the following: (1) his failure to stay long in any job that did not suit his standards; (2) his defiance to conventional/moral rules, as he engaged in a sexual affair with another woman and disregarded his vow to his wife, just to satisfy his desires; (3) his careless disregard for the rights of others especially those of his wife and children for his constant support; (4) his shameless neglect of his wife and children; (5) his interpersonal exploitative tendencies as he used other people, especially his wife to enhance himself and satisfy his needs; (6) his grandiose sense of self-importance and strong sense of entitlement, as he expects to be recognized and be given special favors without assuming reciprocal responsibilities; and (7) his constant need for attention. Dr. Belen declared that the root cause of Jose's personality can be traced to his childhood. He came from a wealthy and politically influential family; thus, he was pampered with material things. But he was deprived of attention and affection as his parents were too busy. Such personality, which was already in existence since childhood, is grave as it impairs him to handle the demands of interpersonal adjustment. He sees nothing wrong with himself, and thus, he remains impervious to change and improvement. Jenelyn Abeleda (Abeleda), a family friend, also testified that she has known Elizabeth and Jose for a long time and had witnessed how Jose was irresponsible to his wife and children. She also saw Jose outside a club in Manila embracing another woman.","The petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated June 30, 2017 and the Resolution dated January 3, 2018 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 107159 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The Decision dated January 8, 2016 of Branch 94, Regional Trial Court, Quezon City, in Civil Case No. Q-09-65639 is REINSTATED.","Guided by these principles, the Court finds that the RTC was correct in granting Elizabeth's petition. The Court clarified in Tan-Andal v. Andal that psychological incapacity is neither a mental incapacity nor a personality disorder that must be proven through expert opinion, but must be shown to be grave, incurable (in the legal sense), and juridically antecedent. The absence of personal examination of the respondent by a psychologist is not fatal so long as the totality of evidence sufficiently supports a finding of psychological incapacity. Based on the totality of evidence in this case, including the expert testimony that Jose has a Narcissistic Personality Disorder rooted in his childhood environment, Jose's condition was attended by gravity, juridical antecedence, and incurability. Elizabeth was able to show that Jose was psychologically incapacitated at the time he got married to her and remained to be so thereafter. He is non-cognitive of the basic marital covenants such as respect, fidelity, mutual love, help, and support to each other. The RTC was correct in granting Elizabeth's petition to declare her marriage with Jose null and void ab initio on the ground of psychological capacity.","WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED. The marriage between petitioner Elizabeth A. Alberto and respondent Jose Luis R. Alberto is declared void ab initio. The Decision dated June 30, 2017 and the Resolution dated January 3, 2018 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 107159 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

"G.R. No. 246871, April 19, 2022","ALLAN S. NAVARETTE, PETITIONER, VS. VENTIS MARITIME CORPORATION, RESPONDENT.","Petitioner started his employment in 2011 with respondent, a local manning agency. On January 21, 2015, respondent hired him as a chief cook for and on behalf of respondent's foreign principal, K'Line Ship Management (Singapore) Pte., Ltd., for a period of four months. Before his deployment, petitioner underwent a pre-employment medical examination (PEME) wherein he disclosed that he was taking medications for his heart condition. From January to May 2015, petitioner experienced on and off chest pain and tightness on his chest on board and was diagnosed with gastritis and acid reflux. They finally repatriated him on June 12, 2015 and he was referred to the company-designated physician, NGC Medical Specialist Clinic, Inc. (NGC), for further management. After series of examination, the doctor diagnosed him with ischemic heart disease, hypertension, and acute gastritis. After evaluation by Dr. Sison at St. Luke's Medical Center, Dr. Sison declared him to be physically fit to work with the advice to continue his medication. NGC cleared petitioner with the same advice. On November 20, 2015, petitioner signed a Certificate of Fitness for Work wherein he released respondent of all actions and claims in connection with his being released as fit for duty. Petitioner underwent a subsequent PEME on January 19, 2016. However, respondent did not deploy him despite medical clearances and certification that he was fit for sea duty. Confused, petitioner consulted a cardiologist, Dr. Efren R. Vicaldo (Dr. Vicaldo) of the Philippine Heart Center to assess his condition. Dr. Vicaldo declared him unfit to resume work as a seaman in any capacity. In a letter to respondent, petitioner requested for a meeting in order to settle his claim for disability benefits, medical reimbursement and other related benefits, but to no avail. This prompted petitioner to file a Notice to Arbitrate before the NCMB for payment of full disability benefits, sickness allowance, moral and exemplary damages, and attorney's fees.","In the Decision dated February 1, 2017, the NCMB ruled in favor of petitioner and declared him to be totally and permanently disabled and unfit to work. It ordered respondent to pay petitioner USD$60,000.00 as full disability benefits plus 10% of the total monetary award as attorney's fees. Respondent sought reconsideration, but the NCMB denied it. Unperturbed, respondent filed a Petition for Review under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court with the CA. In the assailed Decision dated January 14, 2019, the CA set aside the Decision dated February 1, 2017 of the NCMB and found petitioner as not totally and permanently disabled. The CA reversed the NCMB finding and declared petitioner as not totally and permanently disabled. As such, the award of full disability benefit and attorney's fees to Respondent Allan S. Navarette are hereby DELETED. The CA gave credence to the medical attention given to petitioner by the company-designated physician who gave a more accurate diagnosis of his medical condition and fitness to resume work.","The Court finds the medical assessment that he was fit to work to be conclusive, complete, and definite. While it went beyond the 120-day period, its extension was justified under the circumstances and it was still within the extended 240-day period allowed under Section 2, Rule X of the AREC. The Court notes that petitioner's own physician, Dr. Vicaldo, declared him unfit to resume work as a seaman in any capacity. However, records do not show that petitioner requested to refer the conflicting findings of the company-designated physician and Dr. Vicaldo to a third doctor; he only sent a grievance letter requesting for a meeting in order to settle the payment of his full disability benefits. Thus, as it stands, the failure to refer the conflicting findings between the company-designated physician and the seafarer's physician of choice grants the farmer's medical opinion more weight and probative value over the latter. Lastly, the Court cannot give weight to petitioner's claim that he was only compelled to sign the Certificate of Fitness for Work because of promise of deployment. Given the circumstances, the Court finds that the CA properly reversed the NCMB. Under the circumstances, petitioner is not entitled to total and permanent disability benefits.","the petition is DENIED. The Decision dated January 14, 2019 and the Resolution dated April 29, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 151846 are AFFIRMED."
"G.R. No. 204226, April 18, 2022","BUREAU OF INTERNAL REVENUE, PETITIONER, VS. TICO INSURANCE COMPANY, INC., GLOWIDE ENTERPRISES, INC., AND PACIFIC MILLS, INC., RESPONDENTS.","Respondent TICO Insurance Company, Inc. (TICO) is an insurance company duly organized and existing under Philippine laws. It is engaged in the sale of life insurance until it was placed under liquidation by the Insurance Commission in 2002. Respondents Glowide and PMI are clients of TICO that took out a fire insurance policy over several properties in 1997. On August 7, 2006, respondent TICO filed a Complaint for interpleader with the RTC Makati to determine who between respondents Glowide and PMI, on one hand, and petitioner BIR on the other, has a superior right over Units 7A and 7B of the Trafalgar Plaza Condominium covered by Condominium Certificates of Title (CCT) Nos. 39452 and 39453 and registered under TICO's name. TICO alleged that Glowide and PMI had attached the condominium units to cover their claim for the balance of their insurance proceeds after they had obtained a judgment in their favor, while the BIR issued a warrant of distraint and/or levy on the real and personal properties of TICO, and a notice of tax lien covering the condominium units, to answer for TICO's tax liabilities. While Glowide and PMI's fire insurance policy with TICO over certain properties was in effect, a fire broke out that destroyed the said properties. Due to TICO's failure to pay the full amount of the insurance proceeds despite demand, Glowide and PMI filed a Complaint for sum of money and damages, with prayer for a writ of preliminary attachment against TICO before the RTC of Quezon City, Branch 98 (RTC QC), docketed as Civil Case No. Q-00-42328. The RTC QC, in its November 23, 2000 Order, granted Glowide and PMI's application for the issuance of a writ of preliminary attachment to attach all properties of TICO. On December 22, 2000, the corresponding notice of levy on attachment was issued on TICO's condominium units covered by CCT Nos. 39452 and 39453. In its October 3, 2001 Judgment, the RTC QC ordered TICO to pay Glowide and PMI the amount of P5,442,209.97 plus interest, attorney's fees, and costs of suit. The corresponding writ of execution was issued on June 3, 2002, and the notices of levy on execution were subsequently annotated on CCT Nos. 39452 and 39453 on June 13, 2002. The RTC QC noted that Glowide and PMI's claims are preferred over the BIR's claims since tax assessments are not preferred credits in reference to specific immovable property. The condominium units were sold to Glowide and PMI as the highest bidders on April 14, 2004, and the certificate of sale was annotated on CCT Nos. 39452 and 39453 on April 15, 2004. After the lapse of the redemption period, the sheriff of RTC QC executed the corresponding final deed of sale in favor of Glowide and PMI on April 15, 2005. For its part, the BIR alleged that on January 31, 2000, it served on TICO several final assessment notices for deficiency internal revenue taxes for the calendar years 1996 and 1997, amounting to a total amount of P73,020,590.12 (later reduced to P69,479,440.59). The BIR resorted to the issuance and service of a warrant of distraint and/or levy on TICO's properties, and a notice of tax lien covering CCT Nos. 39452 and 39453. On February 15, 2005, the BIR caused the annotation of the notice of tax lien on CCT Nos. 39452 and 39453. The BIR posited that it has a superior claim over the condominium units, considering its claim for unpaid revenue taxes enjoys absolute preference under Articles 2241(1), 2242(1), and 2246-2249 of the New Civil Code.","On March 25, 2008, RTC Makati rendered a Decision holding that the claim of BIR over the condominium units is superior to that of Glowide and PMI. Glowide and PMI appealed the case to the CA. In its December 16, 2011 Decision, the CA ruled in favor of Glowide and PMI. The dispositive portion states: WHEREFORE, the assailed March 25, 2008 Decision and June 19, 2008 Order of the RTC of Makati City, Branch 145 in Special Civil Case No. 06-667 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. In lieu thereof, a new one is rendered declaring the validity of auction sale of the Condominium Units subject of the instant case, which retroacts to the date of the annotation of the Notice of Levy on Attachment, and that GLOWIDE and PMI, as against BIR, have superior right over the subject condominium units, hence, entitled to the same. The CA further opined that TICO's resort to an action for interpleader is improper since Glowide and PMI had already succeeded in securing a favorable final judgment against TICO. The BIR belatedly filed its Motion for Reconsideration. In its October 22, 2012 Resolution, the CA denied the BIR's Motion for Reconsideration for lack of merit.","The Court denies the petition. The BIR's failure to timely file a motion for reconsideration of the CA's December 16, 2011 Decision rendered the same final and immutable. However, even if the petition is not dismissed due to its procedural infirmity, a careful study of the other issues clearly shows that the petition should be denied for lack of merit. TICO's interpleader complaint is improper since it amounts to a collateral attack on the final and executed judgment in favor of Glowide and PMI. Glowide and PMI's rights over the condominium units are superior to the BIR's claim, and are thus entitled to possession and conveyance of the condominium units. An auction sale conducted pursuant to an order of execution retroacts to the date of annotation of the levy on attachment, and the purchaser in the auction sale has the concomitant right to have a certificate of title issued in his favor on the basis thereof as if it were annotated on the same date. Glowide and PMI's rights over the condominium units retroact to the date of inscription of their notice of levy on December 22, 2000. Under Section 219 of the Tax Code, the tax lien shall not be valid against any judgment creditor until notice of such lien shall be filed by the Commissioner in the office of the Register of Deeds. The BIR's tax lien was annotated on February 15, 2005, already after Glowide and PMI had effective rights over the property. Furthermore, TICO's tax claim is only an ordinary preferred credit under Article 2244 since it is not based on taxes due on the condominium units but on TICO's deficiency in payment of income tax, annual registration fees, etc. Glowide and PMI's claim is a special preferred credit under Article 2242 (7) of the Civil Code, and thus superior to BIR's tax claim which is only an ordinary preferred credit.","WHEREFORE, the petition for review is DENIED. The December 16, 2011 Decision and the October 22, 2012 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV. No. 91856 are hereby AFFIRMED. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 255491, April 18, 2022","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. XXX, [1] ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","On November 3, 2008, accused-appellant was charged with Qualified Statutory Rape for having carnal knowledge of his minor daughter AAA, [6] against the latter's will on three different occasions. Criminal Case No. 33-09 alleged rape on March 13, 2007, when AAA was eleven (11) years old. Criminal Case No. 34-09 alleged rape in 2004, when AAA was nine (9) years old. Criminal Case No. 35-09 alleged rape in 2005, when AAA was ten (10) years old. The prosecution presented AAA who testified that on March 13, 2007, while they were alone, accused-appellant ordered her to wear a skirt, lie on the floor, applied cooking oil on his penis, removed her skirt and underwear, and inserted his penis into her vagina. The same acts occurred in 2004 and 2005. AAA’s brother, CCC, noticed the windows and door covered with tabing during the March 13, 2007 incident, which led to AAA disclosing the abuse to her mother, BBB. Medico-Legal Officer Ebdane found neither laceration nor injury on AAA’s vagina but explained this did not exclude sexual abuse due to factors like the victim’s age, noting the hymen of an 11-year old is like a rubber band that can be stretched without evident injury. Accused-appellant denied the allegations, claimed an alibi for March 13, 2007, and alleged that BBB filed the complaint out of jealousy because he had an affair with another woman.","In an Omnibus Judgment dated August 9, 2017, the Regional Trial Court found accused-appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt for three counts of Qualified Statutory Rape and sentenced him to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua without benefit of parole for each count, and ordered him to pay AAA P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages, and P30,000.00 as exemplary damages for each count. In its September 27, 2019 Decision, the Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction but modified the monetary awards, increasing the amount of civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages to P100,000.00 each for each count.","The appeal lacks merit. This Court affirms the conviction of accused-appellant for Qualified Statutory Rape in Criminal Case No. 33-09, Criminal Case No. 34-09, and Criminal Case No. 35-09. This Court adheres to the well-entrenched principle that the trial court's factual findings, including its pronouncement as to the credibility of the witnesses, should be accorded great weight and respect. The trial court was impressed by AAA’s credibility, finding her testimony straightforward, categorical, and spontaneous, and that alleged minor inconsistencies do not detract from essential credibility. The prosecution established all elements of Qualified Statutory Rape under Article 266-A and 266-B of the RPC, as amended by RA 8353: (1) accused-appellant had carnal knowledge of AAA (confirmed by her credible testimony, as medical reports are merely corroborative and dispensable); and (2) AAA was under 12 years of age during the incidents. The qualifying circumstance that the offender is the parent of the victim (AAA was under 18) was also proven. Accused-appellant’s defenses of alibi, denial, and ill motive cannot overcome AAA’s positive identification and credible testimony.","WHEREFORE, the appeal is DISMISSED. The September 27, 2019 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 09868 is AFFIRMED. Accordingly, accused-appellant XXX is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt for three counts of Qualified Statutory Rape. He is sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua, without eligibility for parole, for each count. He is ordered to pay AAA the following: (1) P100,000.00 as civil indemnity; (2) P100,000.00 as moral damages; and (3) P100,000.00 as exemplary damages. Said amounts shall earn legal interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the finality of this Decision until full satisfaction thereof. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 219755, April 18, 2022","RICHARD N. WAHING, RONALD L. CALAGO AND PABLO P. MAIT, PETITIONERS, VS. SPOUSES AMADOR DAGUIO AND ESING DAGUIO, RESPONDENTS.","Wahing et al. worked as rubber tree tappers for the Daguio Spouses until Mait was ordered to ""stop tapping the rubber tree"" on October 15, 2006. On February 6, 2007, Wahing and Calago were similarly ordered to stop working on the Daguio Spouses' trees. Wahing et al. then filed a complaint for illegal dismissal, reinstatement or separation pay, underpayment of wages, labor standards benefits, damages, and attorney's fees. However, the Labor Arbiter dismissed the complaint ""after finding that the relationship between [the parties] was that of a landlord and tenant and not of employer-employee."" Thereafter, Wahing et al. appealed the Labor Arbiter's ruling before the National Labor Relations Commission which then vacated and set aside their complaint's dismissal and ordered the Labor Arbiter to decide the complaint on the merits. When the Labor Arbiter ordered the parties to submit their respective position papers, only Wahing et al. were able to file theirs, despite the Daguio Spouses being sent several notices to do so. Thus, the Labor Arbiter's September 28, 2010 Decision ruled that Wahing et al. were illegally dismissed from employment. The Labor Arbiter then ordered the Daguio Spouses to pay Wahing et al. a total monetary award of P777,090.52. Afterwards, the Daguio Spouses appealed the Labor Arbiter's findings to the National Labor Relations Commission, arguing that they neither received the Labor Arbiter's Orders to submit their position paper nor Wahing et al.'s position paper. The Daguio Spouses also moved to have their appeal bond reduced, which was partially granted, subject to an additional posting of P50,000.00 in cash or surety, as appeal bond. In view of the Daguio Spouses' appeal, the National Labor Relations Commission issued an August 24, 2011 Resolution, ordering the case remanded once more for reception of the Daguio Spouses' evidence. Wahing et al. then moved for the reconsideration of the August 24, 2011 Resolution, but were denied relief. Thus, they filed a Petition for Certiorari before the Court of Appeals, arguing that: (1) the National Labor Relations Commission had no jurisdiction to render the assailed Resolution because the Daguio Spouses failed to perfect their appeal; and (2) that contrary to the assailed Resolution, the Labor Arbiter respected the Daguio Spouses' right of due process by giving them adequate time and notice to submit their evidence, which they allegedly disregarded. Instead of ruling on the procedural defects raised in the Petition for Certiorari, the Court of Appeals decided the case on the merits because the case had already been remanded multiple times and the parties' evidence had already been attached to the pleadings made part of the record. It found that the Daguio Spouses' evidence adequately refuted the existence of an employer-employee relationship, while Wahing et al. merely relied on procedural technicalities and ""self-serving allegations."" Further, since Wahing et al. failed to overcome their burden of proving the existence of the employer-employee relationship, the Court of Appeals found that they could not have been illegally dismissed from employment.","We grant the Petition. While the Court of Appeals correctly delved into the case's merits, it erroneously ruled that the parties did not have an employer-employee relationship.","The Court of Appeals has the authority to review and decide the case on the merits, consistent with the principle of judicial economy and in avoidance of ""dispensing piecemeal justice[.]"" ... We find no issue with respondents' compliance with the statutory requirement. The Court of Appeals validly decided the issues based on the arguments and evidence provided by both parties, which is more consistent with ""a just and complete resolution of the case[.]"" ... Contrary to the Court of Appeals' findings, respondents employed petitioners as farm workers and are, thus, subject to the rules governing an employer-employee relationship. ... Here, the testimonies submitted by petitioners establish the totality of economic circumstances required by Francisco's economic reality test. Petitioners perform services integral to respondents' business of running a rubber plantation. ... respondents exercised control over petitioners' hours, means, and methods of work. Petitioners were also shown to be economically dependent upon respondents for their livelihood. Thus, there exists an employer-employee relationship between the parties. In any event, both parties offered the same type of evidence in support of their respective claims. Respondents' controverting testimonial evidence, sourced from a ""former caretaker"" and several local government officials, is of equal weight with petitioners' evidence, at best. When the evidence between employer and laborer are of equal weight, the scales must tip in favor of labor, consistent with Philippine National Bank v. Bulatao ... Affording protection to labor and construing doubt in favor of the laborer are not only statutorily required under the Labor Code, but are also consistent with the ""social justice suppositions underlying labor laws[.]"" ... In view of the employer-employee relationship between the parties, respondents illegally terminated petitioners' employment by ordering them to stop their work without just or authorized cause. Petitioners are entitled to reinstatement, and the payment of back wages and labor standards benefits from the time of their dismissal from employment until the finality of this Decision. Should reinstatement be impossible or impractical due to strained relations between the parties, respondents shall pay petitioners separation pay.

"G.R. No. 252507, April 18, 2022","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. BBB AND XXX, ACCUSED, BBB, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","By Information dated December 22, 2016, appellant together with XXX was charged with qualified trafficking in persons as follows: 'That sometime prior to and on July 28, 2014, in the City of Manila, Philippines, the said accused, conspiring and confederating and mutually helping each other, for the purpose of exploitation, which includes at a minimum, the exploitation or the prostitution or other forms of sexual exploitation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully, feloniously and knowingly commit acts of trafficking in person against one AAA, a minor, 14 years old, assisted by her father CCC, by then and there recruiting, obtaining, hiring, providing, offering, transporting, transferring, maintaining, harbouring or receiving her with or without consent and taking advantage of her vulnerability of said AAA, by offering or contracting marriage thru the use of force, coercion, fraud, deception and abuse of power or of position or taking advantage against the vulnerability of said person, or giving or receiving payments or benefits to achieve the consent of the minor for the purpose of acquiring, buying, offering(,) selling or trading the complainant in exchange of said marriage and/or in exchange for engaging in sexual exploitation, to her damage and prejudice. Contrary to law.' AAA was only 13 years old at the time of the incident on July 28, 2014. Prosecution evidence showed that BBB, AAA's mother, deceived AAA into marrying XXX, a 56-year-old foreign national, at the Golden Mosque. BBB had previously coerced AAA into sexual acts with XXX since AAA was nine or ten years old, as XXX provided financial support. Subsequent investigation by the CFO, DSWD, and NBI confirmed the sexual exploitation, noting that AAA's birth date on the marriage certificate was falsified to make her appear 24 years old. AAA was diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). BBB denied the deception and coercion, claiming the marriage was consensual based on AAA's pity for her, and she merely happened upon the marriage ceremony at the Golden Mosque.","This appeal seeks to reverse the Decision dated August 30, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 10743, affirming the trial court's verdict of conviction against appellant BBB for qualified trafficking in persons under Section 4(c) in relation to Section 6(a) and (d) of Republic Act No. (RA) 9208 as amended by RA 10364. The trial court found appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the offense, ruling that all the elements were present because appellant committed the act of 'providing' XXX her minor daughter for sexual exploitation, taking advantage of AAA's vulnerability and moral ascendancy, and conspiring with XXX. The Court of Appeals affirmed the finding of guilt and the applicability of the Rule on Examination of Child Witness on hearsay exception (A.M. No. 004-07-SC), holding that AAA was unavailable due to severe psychological injury.","We affirm. A.M. No. 004-07-SC or the Rule on Examination of Child Witness on hearsay exception applies in this case because AAA was diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and emotionally disturbed, rendering her an 'unavailable' child witness as her presentation in court would expose her to severe psychological injury. Her testimony was corroborated by expert witnesses. The Court found all the elements of qualified trafficking in persons under Section 4(c), in relation to Section 6(a) and (d) of RA 9208, as amended, present. Appellant committed the act of 'providing' her minor daughter for sexual exploitation (the act), by means of fraud and abuse of power (the means), for the purpose of sexual exploitation (the purpose). The offense was qualified because AAA was a child and BBB was her parent. Conspiracy with XXX was proven by BBB's concerted acts, including allowing sexual abuse since AAA was nine, deceiving her into marriage, assisting her in getting a passport using falsified documents, and triggering the consumption of the marriage.","ACCORDINGLY, the appeal is DENIED. The Decision dated August 30, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 10743 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. Appellant BBB is guilty of Qualified Trafficking in Persons as defined and penalized under Section 4(c), in relation to Section 6(a) and (d) of Republic Act No. 9208, as amended by Republic Act No. 10364. She is sentenced to LIFE IMPRISONMENT and a fine of P2,000,000.00. Further, she is ordered to PAY AAA P500,000.00 as moral damages and P100,000.00 as exemplary damages. All monetary awards shall earn interest at the legal rate of six percent (6%) per annum from finality of this Decision until fully paid. SO ORDERED."

Inieto (Inieto) requested for a patrol boat equipped with a 6-cylinder gas engine through Purchase Request No. 442,
[6]
dated June 8, 2005 costing P150,000.00. Thereafter, the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) of Bataan posted an Invitation
[7]
to Apply for Eligibility, and to Bid for the Supply and Delivery of the Equipment. However, the sole bidder failed to pass the post-qualification process
[8]
as indicated in BAC Resolution No. 006-A, S-2005 (Post-Disqualifying the Sole Prospective Bidder Thus Declaring Failure of Bidding and Rescheduling the Same).
[9]
Re-bidding was conducted, but no supplier submitted a letter of intent. Thus, the BAC recommended a Limited Source or Selective Bidding,
[10]
and invited three suppliers, namely: (1) Marcelino G. Rodriguez
[11]
(Rodriguez), (2) Agrifino M. Otor
[12]
(Otor), and (3) accused Ernesto R. Asistin, Jr. (Asistin).
[13]
Asistin offered the lowest bid of P150,000.00 based on quotations
[14]
and a canvass summary.
[15]
Thereafter, the contract was awarded to Asistin
[16]
as evidenced by a Notice of Award
[17]
dated December 14, 2005 signed by Provincial Administrator Rodolfo H. De Mesa (De Mesa). The award pertained to the delivery of a 4-cylinder gas engine patrol boat for P150,000.00. Notably, there was a handwritten correction in terms of the capacity of the gas engine from 6-cylinder to 4-cylinder. After posting the performance bond,
[18]
Asistin and De Mesa entered into a Contract Agreement
[19]
dated January 4, 2006 for the delivery of a 4-cylinder gas engine patrol boat (with a handwritten correction from 6-cylinder to 4-cylinder) for P150,000.00, instead of a 6-cylinder boat as indicated in Purchase Request No. 442. This was followed by a Notice to Proceed
[20]
dated January 9, 2006 likewise with a handwritten correction from 6-cylinder to 4-cylinder. Notably, Inieto prepared a Justification
[21]
dated January 5, 2006 stating that the increase in price of the 6-cylinder gas engine can no longer be covered by Purchase Request No. 442, and that the replacement of the 6-cylinder gas engine to 4-cylinder gives the same performance with cheaper fuel consumption. Hence, De Mesa issued Purchase Order No. 017-A
[22]
dated January 17, 2006 for the delivery of a 6-cylinder gas engine (later substituted with a 4-cylinder) patrol boat for P150,000.00 in favor of Asistin. On January 18, 2006, Inieto requested representatives from the offices of the Provincial Treasurer,
[23]
Provincial Accountant,
[24]
Provincial General Services,
[25]
and Provincial Auditor
[26]
to verify the delivery of the patrol boat equipped with a 4-cylinder gas engine. Inieto accepted the delivery of the patrol boat as reflected in the Acceptance and Inspection Report No. 06-01-022
[27]
dated January 17, 2006.
[28]
It provided for the acceptance of one unit of 4-cylinder gas engine patrol boat after inspection and verification of the quantity and specifications by Pedro Baluyot (Baluyot) (Supply Officer III), Angelina M. Villanueva (Villanueva) (Management and Audit Analyst IV), and Francisco T. Caparas (Caparas) (Local Treasury Operations Officer II). The Memorandum Receipt for Equipment, Semi-Expendable and Non-Expendable Property
[29]
dated January 27, 2006, and signed by Inieto, indicated that Evangeline A. Diaz (Diaz), Provincial General Services Officer, received the patrol boat equipped with 4-cylinder gas engine valued at P150,000.00, and acquired on January 24, 2006 from Asistin. Accused Provincial Treasurer Emerlinda S. Talento (Talento) issued Check No. 788858
[30]
dated February 16, 2006 in the amount of P142,500.00, with a notation that it was being issued for the payment of the 4-cylinder gas engine patrol boat. Asistin acknowledged receipt of the check as evidenced by Disbursement Voucher No. 110-06-0-951
[31]
for P142,500.00, also indicating one unit of 4-cylinder gas engine patrol boat, which was signed by Alicia Magpantay, Provincial Accountant, and De Mesa, representing then Governor Enrique T. Garcia, Jr. (Governor Garcia). The Journal Entry Voucher,
[32]
however, indicated the total amount of P150,000.00 for the patrol boat.
[33]
Eventually, the Field Investigation Office (FIO) of the Office of the Ombudsman filed a Supplemental Complaint
[34]
dated September 29, 2008 before the Ombudsman, recommending the filing of criminal and administrative cases against the involved public officials and individuals for violating Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. (RA) 3019, or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act. The FIO essentially alleged that the purchase of the patrol boat equipped with a 4-cylinder gas engine is tainted with anomalies as the documents related to its procurement were altered, the process occurred without public bidding, and because it gave undue advantage to Asistin. In an Order
[35]
dated February 9, 2009, the Ombudsman directed the involved individuals to file their counter-affidavits within a period of 10 days from receipt of the said directive. The concerned parties eventually complied.","As pointed out by the Ombudsman, the issues concerning the criminal aspect in the petitions (G.R. Nos. 197510-11 and 201347) have been rendered moot, and thus, should be dismissed. With respect to the administrative aspect (in G.R. Nos. 197510-11), the petition should be dismissed due to the petitioners' Province of Bataan's lack of legal standing, and for being the wrong remedy.","As pointed out by the Ombudsman, the issues concerning the criminal aspect in the petitions (G.R. Nos. 197510-11 and 201347) have been rendered moot, and thus, should be dismissed. With respect to the administrative aspect (in G.R. Nos. 197510-11), the petition should be dismissed due to the petitioners' Province of Bataan's lack of legal standing, and for being the wrong remedy. Criminal Aspect of the Petitions Jurisprudence states that ""[a] petition for certiorari, pertaining to the regularity of a preliminary investigation, becomes moot after an information is filed and a trial court issues an arrest warrant upon finding probable cause against the accused.""[149] By analogy, the same rationale should be applied in this case. This is because the Sandigaribayan acts as a ""trial court"" in resolving criminal cases against government officials or employees.[150] ""'The Sandiganbayan is a special court tasked to hear and decide cases against public officers and employees[,] and entrusted with the difficult task of policing and ridding the government ranks of the dishonest and corrupt.'""[151] To stress, the petitions herein assail the finding of probable cause to indict the involved public officers for the criminal charges. However, the attendant circumstances revealed that: (1) Informations have already been filed against the concerned individuals; (2) warrants of arrest have been issued against them; (3) they have been arraigned; and (4) the trials before the Sandiganbayan have begun. These incidents presuppose that the Sandiganbayan already found the existence of probable cause to criminally charge the accused, and put them to trial. Case No. SB-11-CRM-0251 (People v. De Mesa, et. al. / RA 3019 case) has already been submitted for decision while Case Nos. SB-12-CRM-0029 to 0030 (People v. Inieto, et. al. / Falsification of Public Document case) are undergoing trial. Even the motion for leave to file demurrer to evidence has been denied by the Sandiganbayan, holding that the evidence of the prosecution, if unrebutted, would be sufficient to support a conviction for the accused. Thence, with respect to the criminal aspect of the cases, and because of these supervening events, ""this Court is left with no justiciable controversy to resolve, and a declaration on it would be of no practical use or value.""[152] In view of these, ""[n]ow that Informations were already filed in the Sandiganbayan, petitioners have all the opportunity there during the trial proper to dispute the findings of probable cause, and, possibly, to eventually clear their names from the alleged crimes.""[153] It is assumed that the involved personalities have employed efforts to explain their positions, and maximize the legal remedies available to them pending trial. Hence, the decision to dismiss the criminal cases, or to acquit/convict the accused is for the Sandiganbayan to determine at this point. To reiterate, A case is rendered moot when, because of supervening events, this Court is left with no justiciable controversy to resolve, and a declaration on it would be of no practical use or value. In Secretary De Lima v. Reyes, this Court reiterated its ruling in Crespo v. Mogul that once an information is filed before a court, that court acquires jurisdiction over the case. Notably, a petition questioning the preliminary investigation of an accused becomes moot once an information based on the preliminary investigation is filed before a trial court, which, in turn, would complete its own determination of probable cause. After this judicial determination, the question of an accused's guilt or innocence would rest with the trial court's own sound discretion.[154] Simply put, a moot and academic case ceases to present a justiciable controversy by virtue of supervening events,[155] and thus, this Court should refrain from rendering a ruling on the criminal aspect of the petitions. Administrative Aspect of the Petition (G.R. Nos. 197510-11) As pointed out by the OSG, there is a defect in the Province of Bataan's petition (G.R. Nos. 197510-11) as the petitioner does not have the personality to file the same. To be precise, the Province of Bataan is not considered as an aggrieved party, be it in the criminal or administrative aspect of its petitions, which can file a pleading under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court. Consider this: Section 1, Rule 65 essentially provides that a person aggrieved by any act of a tribunal, board or officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions rendered without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction may file a petition for certiorari. An aggrieved party under Section 1, Rule 65 is one who was a party to the original proceedings that gave rise to the original action for certiorari under Rule 65. We had occasion to clarify and explain the 'aggrieved party' requirement in Tang v. Court of Appeals where we said: Although Section 1 of Rule 65 provides that the special civil action of certiorari may be availed of by a 'person aggrieved' by the orders or decisions of a tribunal, the term 'person aggrieved' is not to be construed to mean that any person who feels injured by the lower court's order or decision can question the said court's disposition via certiorari. To sanction a contrary interpretation would open the floodgates to numerous and endless litigations which would undeniably lead to the clogging of court dockets and, more importantly, the harassment of the party who prevailed in the lower court. In a situation wherein the order or decision being questioned underwent adversarial proceedings before a trial court, the 'person aggrieved' referred to under Section 1 of Rule 65 who can avail of the special civil action of certiorari pertains to one who was a party in the proceedings before the lower court. The correctness of this interpretation can be gleaned from the fact that a special civil action for certiorari may be dismissed motu proprio if the party elevating the case failed to file a motion for reconsideration of the questioned order or decision before the lower court. Obviously, only one who was a party in the case before the lower court can file a motion for reconsideration since a stranger to the litigation would not have the legal standing to interfere in the orders or decisions of the said court. In relation to this, if a non-party in the proceedings before the lower court has no standing to file a motion for reconsideration, logic would lead us to the conclusion that he would likewise have no standing to question the said order or decision before the appellate court via certiorari.[156] (Emphasis Supplied) The Province of Bataan is not a ""person aggrieved"" within the contemplation of the Rules which can properly avail of the special civil action of certiorari, prohibition, and mandamus, as it was not a party in the proceedings before the Ombudsman. Consequently, the petition docketed as G.R. Nos. 197510-11 should be dismissed. Even if the Province of Bataan had the standing to file the petitions, it is settled that ""as a quasi-judicial agency, decisions of the Office of the Ombudsman in administrative disciplinary cases may only be appealed to the Court of Appeals through a Rule 43 petition""[157] in order to respect the hierarchy of courts.[158] Withal, it is only proper that the administrative aspect of the cases be resolved by the CA, in proper observance of the hierarchy of courts, and in accordance with prevailing rules and jurisprudence. Similarly, ""an administrative agency performs quasi-judicial functions if it renders awards, determines the rights of opposing parties, or if their decisions have the same effect as the judgment of a court.""[159] When the Ombudsman, in an administrative case, renders a decision and imposes a penalty, it is performing a quasi-judicial function. Its decision has the same effect as a court judgment. Thus, as a ""decision,"" the Ombudsman's ruling (in the performance of its quasi-judicial functions) is appealable to the CA under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court. Simply put, the procedurally correct way to elevate the administrative aspect of the case is to file a petition before the CA. To emphasize, [I]n cases where the respondent is not exonerated and the penalty imposed is not merely public censure or reprimand, or suspension of not more than one (1) month's salary, the Ombudsman's decision is appealable, and the proper remedy is to file an appeal under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court before the Court of Appeals. As stated in Section 7, Rule III of the Ombudsman Rules: Section 7. Finality and execution of decision. — Where the respondent is absolved of the charge, and in case of conviction where the penalty imposed is public censure or reprimand, suspension of not more than one month, or a fine equivalent to one month salary, the decision shall be final, executory and unappealable. In all other cases, the decision may be appealed to the Court of Appeals on a verified petition for review under the requirements and conditions set forth in Rule 43 of the Rules of Court, within fifteen (15) days from receipt of the written Notice of the Decision or Order denying the Motion for Reconsideration. x x x x[160] (Emphases and underscoring supplied) In any case, most of those involved actually appealed their administrative cases to the CA. In fact, some of these cases which were already passed upon by the CA are now the subject of pending cases before this Court. If there is anyone from those involved who did not file a Rule 43 petition before the CA, ""as regards the administrative aspect, the Court held that the Ombudsman's finding 'has already attained finality [due to the failure] to file a petition for certiorari before the [CA].'""[161] Based on the foregoing discussion, the herein consolidated petitions should be dismissed.","WHEREFORE, the Petitions are DISMISSED.

Eventually, Vitarich incurred liabilities it could not meet and filed for corporate rehabilitation in 2006. Kormasinc, Inc. (Kormasinc), successor-in-interest to one creditor, filed a Motion for the Rehabilitation Receiver to Take Possession, Custody and Control of the Mortgage Trust Indenture Properties, arguing that the MTI trustee's duties were redundant to those of the receiver and that the receiver should possess the titles and related documents. The Regional Trial Court (RTC) denied the motion, holding that the receiver's power only pertained to physical possession of assets, not the documents of ownership. The Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the RTC, finding merit in Kormasinc's petition and ordering the MTI Trustee to transfer possession, custody, and control over the MTI properties to the rehabilitation receiver, including all the documents related thereto. The creditors, including Deutsche Bank and Metrobank, filed Petitions for Review on Certiorari (G.R. No. 201700 and G.R. No. 201777) before the Supreme Court, challenging the CA's decision. Meanwhile, on September 8, 2016, the RTC granted Vitarich's Motion for Successful Exit from Corporate Rehabilitation, terminating the rehabilitation proceeding and discharging the receiver. Kormasinc filed a Manifestation for Withdrawal or Dismissal of the Instant Case, arguing that the case had been rendered moot and academic.","In view of the successful rehabilitation of Vitarich, and the termination of the rehabilitation proceedings, as well as the discharge of the rehabilitation receiver from his duties, this Court holds that the instant petitions are now moot and, accordingly, their dismissal are in order.","A moot and academic case is one that ceases to present a justiciable controversy by virtue of supervening events, so that a declaration thereon would be of no practical value. The rehabilitation court's September 16, 2016 Order which terminated Vitarich's rehabilitation proceedings effectively put an end to the judicial controversy between the parties. Considering the termination of the Corporation Rehabilitation of Vitarich Corporation, and the discharge of the Rehabilitation Receiver, there is no longer any Receiver who is tasked to take custody, possession and control of the debtor's assets.

KING & SONS CO., INC., RESPONDENTS.","For resolution is the Consolidated Motion for Reconsideration filed by respondents Spouses Richard and Polly Chua (spouses Chua) of the Court's November 5, 2018 Decision, reversing and setting aside the March 9, 2017 Decision and October 24, 2017 Resolution of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 50922. To recall, the Court, in its November 5, 2018 Decision, found the CA to have committed a reversible error in denying the Amended Petition for Annulment of Judgment of the January 27, 1992 Amended Decision of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Fourth Judicial Region, Branch 18 of Tagaytay City, in Civil Case No. TG-893 that was filed by Marilyn Go Ramos-Yeo, Laurence Go and Montgomery Go (the Gos). In so ruling, We held that the trial court did not acquire jurisdiction over the persons of the Gos because of invalid substituted service of summons. Neither did it have jurisdiction over the subject matter which is within the jurisdiction of a court sitting as a land registration court. This is because the Complaint for Accion Reinvindicatoria filed by Spouses Chua sought, in reality, to re-open, amend, and review the transfer of certificates of titles issued to the Gos and the Multi-Realty Development Corporation (Multi-Realty), and not merely a correction of the exact boundaries of the subject properties. The action is therefore tantamount to an indirect and collateral attack on the validity of their respective certificates of title in violation of Sections 32 and 108 of Presidential Decree No. (PD) 1529. The Court further held that the certificates of title conferred to the Gos and Multi-Realty are already incontrovertible considering that more than one year had lapsed since the decree of registration was issued in their favor. Consequently, We ruled that the Gos and Multi-Realty are not barred by laches. Considering that the trial court had no jurisdiction over their persons and subject matter, the trial court's decision is therefore null and void. In their Consolidated Motion for Reconsideration, Spouses Chua ascribed the following errors on the part of this Court in granting petitioners' petition: First, the arguments raised therein by the Gos and Multi-Realty were the same as those raised in the CA which were already exhaustively discussed and ruled upon by the said appellate court. Second, petitioners raised issues that are factual in nature, which is beyond the purview of a Rule 45 petition. In particular, they contend that the issue on improper substituted service is a question of fact as it requires the re-examination of the evidence for its resolution. In any case, the Spouses Chua argue that strict observance of the rule on substituted service is not warranted as the Gos deliberately avoided to personally receive the summons thereby prompting a resort to a substituted service. Third, the complaint for accion reinvindicatoria of the Chuas did not assail the final decrees of registration that were granted in favor of petitioners Go and Multi-Realty. They never alleged that the final decrees were fraudulently obtained, which is necessary for a court sitting as a land registration court, to acquire jurisdiction. The Spouses Chua further allege that it is the RTC which has jurisdiction not only on applications for original registration of title, but also on all petitions filed after the registration of the same. Hence, the trial court has the authority to alter or amend the technical descriptions of a land which can be brought in an ordinary civil action, such as an accion reinvindicatoria, like in this case, being the correct remedy. Lastly, the Spouses Chua question the promulgation of the Court's Decision and Resolution on the same date.","Anent the other issues raised by the Spouses Chua in their motion, these grounds have already been presented in their pleadings and which the Court has sufficiently exhaustively passed upon, and resolved in the assailed Decision. Nonetheless, the Court reiterates, in brief, Our assailed judgment. Contrary to the Spouses Chua's claim, the determination of the propriety of substituted service effected on the Gos is a question of law. It is a question of what and how the law should be applied. We have already thoroughly discussed in our assailed Decision that Deputy Sheriff Bienvenido Liboro (Sheriff Liboro) did not exert serious efforts to personally serve the summons to the Gos before resorting to substituted service. Neither did he prove that he tried to personally serve the summons to them on, at least, three separate instances, nor did he offer any justification why personal service was ineffectual. Moreover, it must be stressed that Sheriff Liboro did not even validate that ""Patricio Alam pay [Alampay] is a person of suitable age with full legal capacity xxx, and is considered to have enough discernment to comprehend the import of the summons, and fully realize the need to deliver the same to the Gos at the earliest possible time for the person to take appropriate action."" Clearly, the substituted service of summons on the persons of the Gos is improper; hence, the RTC did not acquire jurisdiction over their persons. The Spouses Chua also argue that the rule on substituted service should not be strictly applied as the Gos were guilty of evident avoidance. Their contention is misplaced. Contrary to the findings of the CA, Alampay's receipt of the Spouses Chua's Motion for Reconsideration that was filed on November 23, 1990 does not conclude that the Gos flagrantly refused or avoided to receive the service of summons. This alone does not validate the presence of the requisites prescribed by law so as to effect a valid substituted service. Thus, the impossibility of personal service of summons is clearly wanting in this case to warrant a substituted service. On the Spouses Chua's claim that the RTC has jurisdiction over the subject matter of the case, the Court reiterates that the amended complaint of accion reinvidicatoria is a disguise to review a final decree of registration in the names of the Gos and Multi-Realty in violation of Section 108 of PD 1529. The trial court's judgment in favor of the Chuas materially altered the boundaries of the properties owned by the Gos and Multi-Realty, affecting the integrity of their title over their respective lands. It is, therefore, the trial court sitting as a land registration court which has jurisdiction over the case under PD 1529. Consequently, the RTC Amended Decision is null and void because the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter. The Gos and Multi-Realty are therefore not barred by ]aches. No rights were also conferred in favor of the Spouses Chua or imposed obligations against the parties.

"G.R. No. 229891, April 06, 2022","ADALIA ARMARIO ABELLA, PETITIONER, VS. MARIA ARMARIO VILLAN, RESPONDENT.","Eutiquiano T. Armario (Eutiquiano) was a farmer-beneficiary of four farmlots with an aggregate area of 3.4289 hectares. On August 29, 1989, Municipal Agrarian Reform Officer Victor N. Honrado (MARO Honrado) informed the Provincial Agrarian Reform Officer that the lots awarded to Eutiquiano had an excess area of 0.4289 hectares. MARO Honrado recommended that the excess area be segregated and transferred to Reynaldo Abella (Abella), Eutiquiano's son-in-law. On June 29, 1990, Municipal Agrarian Reform Officer Jose M. Segovia recommended that 0.9712 hectares of the portion allotted to Eutiquiano be transferred to Abella instead. Transfer Certificate of Title No. EP-219 was issued in Abella's name as a farmer beneficiary under Presidential Decree No. 27. However, Eutiquiano continued to allow his daughter Maria Armario Villan (Villan) to occupy a portion of the lot covered by the title. On September 8, 1997, Eutiquiano and Abella executed a joint affidavit of ownership agreeing to bequeath to Villan the portion of Abella's lot where her house was constructed. On January 26, 2000, Abella confirmed in an affidavit that he was transferring 3,831 sq.m. of his lot to Villan. Villan filed a complaint for restoration and/or correction of entries in Transfer Certificate of Title No. EP-219 against Spouses Reynaldo and Adalia Abella before the Department of Agrarian Reform. The Regional Agrarian Reform Adjudicator found that Eutiquiano, as the original farmer beneficiary, did not consent to the reallocation to Abella and directed Spouses Abella to turn over possession of the subject 3,831 sq.m. to Villan. The Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board and the Court of Appeals affirmed this ruling. Adalia Abella filed this Petition for Review, asserting lack of DARAB jurisdiction and claiming her husband was the rightful beneficiary of the 9,712 sq.m.","This Court resolves a Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals which sustained the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board's Judgment directing the transfer of a portion of land covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. EP-219 from Reynaldo Abella to his sister-in-law, Maria Armario Villan. The Petition must fail.","The Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board is best suited to determine who is the rightful farmer-beneficiary in a leasehold due to its technical knowledge and expertise on matters of agrarian reform. Further, the issuance of a certificate of title does not divest the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board of its jurisdiction over issues which hinge on the application of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program. ... Even the ripening of an emancipation patent into a land title does not automatically divest the Board of its jurisdiction. ... Respondent's petition for restoration and/or correction of entries in Transfer Certificate of Title No. EP-219 questioned the correct recipient of a portion of a lot awarded to a farmer beneficiary under Presidential Decree No. 27. Thus, it involved the implementation of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program, putting it well within the jurisdiction of the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board. ... This Court has generally accorded respect to the findings of fact of administrative agencies and quasi-judicial bodies, like the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board, in view of their recognized expertise on technical matters within their jurisdiction. In this case, the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board and its provincial adjudicator's findings were duly supported by the evidence on record. Hence, there is no reason to depart from the general rule.","WHEREFORE, the Petition is DENIED. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 252258, April 06, 2022","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. RICHARD R. ENOJO, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","Enojo was charged with the violation of Section 3(a) of RA 3019 in an Information dated December 27, 2017 which alleges:
That on 7 February 2013, or sometime prior or subsequent thereto, in the Province of Negros Oriental, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, accused RICHARD RAFAL [sic] ENOJO, a high-ranking public official being then the Officer-In-Charge, Provincial Legal Officer/Provincial Administrator of the Province of Negros Oriental, in such capacities, committing the crime in relation to office and taking advantage thereof, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and criminally persuade, induce and influence the Philippine National Police (PNP)-Dauin Police Office/Station to summon Ralph Gavin Hughes, Merlinda A. Regalado and one Atty. Ligaya Rubio Violeta to a conference with the accused regarding a land dispute, which persuasion/inducement the PNP heeded even when such act was beyond its mandate under Section 24 of Republic No. 6975, or the Department of the Interior and Local Government Act of 1990, thereby making such persuasion and inducement a violation of the same statute and its rules and regulations duly promulgated by competent authority, to the damage and prejudice of the government and public interest.
CONTRARY TO LAW.
Upon his arraignment on May 25, 2018, Enojo, acting pro se, pleaded ""not guilty."" After the preliminary conference and pre-trial, trial on the merits ensued, and the following facts were established: Enojo was the Provincial Legal Officer of Negros Oriental from December 31, 2011, until he became the Provincial Administrator starting June 30, 2016. On January 15, 2013, Dauin Point Land Corporation (DPLC), represented by Violeta, bought Lot 394 from Ramon Regalado, represented by Merlinda A. Regalado (Regalado). Subsequently, DPLC, through its stockholder Ralph Gavin Hughes (Hughes), applied for a Fencing Permit. While the application was pending, Rosabell O. Sanchez (Sanchez), the MPDC-Zoning Officer, received a letter dated February 28, 2013 from Enojo, opposing the application and claiming a portion of Lot 394 as payment for his legal services to Ramon Regalado. Sanchez referred the matter to the DILG – Region 7, which stated in a letter dated April 24, 2013, that Enojo's opposition was improperly filed and unsubstantiated, and that the permit should be granted. Consequently, Sanchez issued the required locational clearance. In the meantime, or on February 27, 2013, Enojo went to Dauin Police Station to request a conference with Hughes, Atty. Violeta, and Regalado regarding the land dispute. Senior Police Officer 4 Proculito Alas-as Briones (SPO4 Briones) received Enojo's request, recorded it in the police blotter, and prepared a radio message to Dumaguete City Police Station requesting them to contact and advise the named individuals for a conference with Enojo on March 1, 2013, at 10:00 o'clock in the morning at Dauin Police Station. Aggrieved by Enojo's request and the involvement of the police, Hughes filed criminal and administrative complaints against Enojo on November 16, 2015, for violation of Section 3(a), (e), and (h) of RA 3019 before the Office of the Ombudsman. The criminal complaint, docketed as OMB-V-C-15-0369, was resolved on May 26, 2017: WHEREFORE, finding probable cause for Violation of Section 3(a) of R.A. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act), as amended, against RICHARD RAFAL ENOJO, let the corresponding Information BE FILED against him in the proper court. As to complaint for Violation of Section 3(e) and (h) of R.A. 3019 against respondent is DISMISSED for insufficiency of evidence. The same Resolution, signed by Graft Investigation and Prosecution Officer III Portia A. Pacquiao, was approved by then Ombudsman Conchita Carpio Morales on August 18, 2017. Subsequently, the Information against Enojo was filed with the Sandiganbayan on February 9, 2018.","In a Decision dated October 18, 2019, the Sandiganbayan found Enojo guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Section 3(a) of RA 3019. Enojo had indeed persuaded, induced, or influenced the Dauin Police, through SPO4 Briones, to accede to his personal request of calling in Hughes, Atty. Violeta, and Regalado to join him in a conference, which went beyond the powers and functions of the police under Section 24 of RA 6975, or the DILG Act of 1990. The dispositive portion of the Sandiganbayan Decision reads: WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing, the Court finds accused Richard Rafal Enojo guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 3(a) of RA 3019, as amended, and hereby sentences him to an indeterminate penalty of six (6) years and one (1) month imprisonment, as minimum, up to eight (8) years, maximum, with perpetual disqualification from public office. SO ORDERED. Undeterred, Enojo filed a motion for reconsideration dated October 31, 2019. However, the same was denied by the Sandiganbayan through its Resolution dated January 2, 2020. Further, he also filed a motion to reopen the case to receive further proof dated February 12, 2020, which was likewise denied by the Sandiganbayan.","The appeal is meritorious. The Supreme Court analyzed the three elements of Section 3(a) of RA 3019. The Court agreed that the first element (offender is a public officer) and the third element (act performed constitutes a violation of rules/regulations, specifically Section 24 of RA 6975) were present, as Enojo’s request and SPO4 Briones’s subsequent actions were purely for Enojo’s personal interest in a civil dispute, which is outside police mandate. However, the Court found the second element—that the offender persuades, induces, or influences the other public officer—to be wanting. SPO4 Briones testified that he acted on Enojo's request not because he was persuaded or influenced by Enojo's status, but because he believed it was the standard operating procedure (SOP) of his office to entertain and provide assistance to any civilian request of that nature. SPO4 Briones’s act of sending the invitation was based on a mistaken belief that it was his duty, thereby negating the presence of undue influence or persuasion on the part of Enojo required by Section 3(a). Therefore, the Court concluded that the prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt all the elements of Section 3(a) of RA 3019.","WHEREFORE, the appeal is GRANTED. The Decision dated October 18, 2019 and the Resolution dated January 2, 2020 of the Sandiganbayan in Criminal Case No. 18-CRM-0122 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Accused-appellant Richard R. Enojo is hereby ACQUITTED of violation of Section 3(a) of Republic Act No. 3019 for failure of the prosecution to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. Let the corresponding entry of final judgment be immediately issued. SO ORDERED."

[9]
In Criminal Case Nos. 27555 and 27557, the prosecution alleged that petitioners, during their respective tenures as municipal mayor of Taal, Batangas sometime from January 30, 1998 to July 6, 1999[10] and in conspiracy with Luther, acted with manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence in violating procurement rules under RA 7160,[11] otherwise known as the ""Local Government Code of 1991"" (LGC), thereby giving unwarranted benefits to Diamond Laboratories, Inc. (DLI) and causing undue injury to the government. Allegedly, petitioners made several direct purchases of medicines in the total amounts of P503,920.35 and P1,042,902.46, respectively, from DLI, a corporation owned by relatives by consanguinity of Librado, without the conduct of a competitive public bidding.[12]
Meanwhile, in Criminal Case Nos. 27556 and 27558, the prosecution alleged that petitioners, during their respective tenures as municipal mayor of Taal, Batangas sometime from March 13, 1998 to September 1, 1999,[13] acted with manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence by unduly reimbursing the aggregate amounts of P27,651.83 and P170,987.66, respectively, as travel expenses in connection with unauthorized travels outside the municipality, thereby giving themselves unwarranted benefits, to the damage and prejudice of the government.[14]
In defense, petitioners maintained that they cannot be deemed to have violated procurement rules since the purchases made from DLI can be characterized as emergency purchases from a duly licensed manufacturer; thus, dispensing with the need to conduct a competitive public bidding under the LGC. On the other hand, as to the allegedly improper reimbursement of travel expenses, petitioners claimed that their travels outside the municipality had been verbally authorized by then Governor Hermilando I. Mandanas (Mandanas) in accordance with the LGC and in any case, were subsequently ratified by him in writing. They also argued that the amounts spent for such purpose were absolutely necessary and incidental to the exercise of their public functions.[15]
For his part, Luther asserted that he was not discharging any official administrative, or judicial functions relative to the allegedly illegal procurement as his participation was merely limited to the collection of payments on behalf of DLI.[16]","In a Decision[17] dated November 19, 2009, the SB found petitioners guilty beyond reasonable doubt and accordingly, sentenced each of them to suffer the following penalties: (a) in Criminal Case Nos. 27555 and 27556, for two (2) counts of violation of Section 3 (e) of RA 3019, Librado was sentenced to suffer the penalty of imprisonment of six (6) years and one (1) month to ten (10) years for each count; and (b) in Criminal Case Nos. 27557 and 27558, for two (2) counts of violation of Section 3 (e) of RA 3019, Fe was sentenced to suffer the penalty of imprisonment of six (6) years and one (1) month to ten (10) years for each count. Petitioners were also ordered to respectively pay the amounts of P27,651.83 and P170,987.66 as actual damages in favor of the Municipality of Taal, Batangas.[18] In Criminal Case Nos. 27555 and 27557 involving the purchase of medicines without public bidding, the SB ruled that all the elements of Section 3 (e) of RA 3019 have been duly established, considering that: (a) petitioners were public officers who were performing their administrative and official functions; (b) they acted with manifest partiality in directly purchasing the medicines from DLI, a corporation owned by relatives by consanguinity of Librado, without public bidding and in violation of procurement rules; and (c) DLI was conferred with an unwarranted benefit.[19] Meanwhile, in Criminal Case Nos. 27556 and 27558, pertaining to the improper reimbursements of travel expenses, the SB also found that all elements of Section 3 (e) of RA 3019 were present since: (a) petitioners were public officers who were performing their administrative and official functions; (b) they acted with evident bad faith and gross inexcusable negligence in reimbursing their travel expenses without prior written authorization of their travels outside the municipality; and (c) the government suffered undue injury in the total amounts of P27,651.83 and P170,987.66.[20] For his part, Luther was acquitted on both counts of violation of Section 3 (e) of RA 3019 under Criminal Case Nos. 27555 and 27557 on account of the prosecution's failure to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.[21] The Supreme Court, in a Decision dated July 29, 2019, affirmed the SB ruling in toto.","Upon further review, the Court finds merit in petitioners' motion for reconsideration.
At the onset, it must be emphasized that ""an accused has in his/her favor the presumption of innocence which the Bill of Rights guarantees. Unless his/her guilt is shown beyond reasonable doubt, he/she must be acquitted. This reasonable doubt standard is demanded by the due process clause of the Constitution, which protects the accused from conviction except upon proof beyond reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged. The burden of proof is on the prosecution, and unless it discharges that burden the accused need not even offer evidence in his/her behalf, and he/she would be entitled to an acquittal.""[30] Guided by the foregoing considerations and as will be explained hereunder, the Court finds that petitioners' conviction for the crimes charged must be set aside on the ground of reasonable doubt.
While there is no dispute as to the existence of the first element, a closer look at the records of the case shows that the second element was not established by proof beyond reasonable doubt. Notably, anent the second element, prevailing case law elucidates that ""to constitute evident bad faith or manifest partiality, it must be proven that the accused acted with malicious motive or fraudulent intent. It is not enough that the accused violated a law, committed mistakes or was negligent in his duties. There must be a clear showing that the accused was spurred by a corrupt motive or a deliberate intent to do wrong or cause damage. Thus, as the Court explained about 20 years ago in Sistoza v. Desierto, mere bad faith or partiality per se is not enough for one to be held liable under the law since the act of bad faith or partiality must in the first place be evident or manifest.""[33] In this case, the prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the alleged acts of the accused – while violative of the procurement law and rules – were done with any corrupt intent. On the contrary, records support petitioners' assertion that they merely mistakenly believed that the purchase of medicines was covered by the exceptions to the rule on public bidding (i.e., as emergency purchases and purchases from a duly licensed manufacturer) and that the reimbursement of their travel expenses was valid. To debunk the claim of manifest partiality, petitioners were able to present[39] a Purchase Request[40] from Dr. Adolfo Magistrado (Dr. Magistrado), the Head of the Municipal Health Office of Taal, Batangas, certifying that the need for the purchased medicines was ""exceptionally urgent or absolutely indispensable to prevent imminent and real danger to, or loss of, life or property.""[41] Petitioners also presented as evidence a Resolution[43] dated February 3, 2000 from the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon stating that DLI is a duly licensed manufacturer. The evidence presented by petitioners cast reasonable doubt as to the existence of manifest partiality, as ruled to be attendant by the SB. Ultimately, upon careful reconsideration, the prosecution was not able to show by proof beyond reasonable doubt that the failure to conduct public bidding in this case was ''spurred by a corrupt or ill motive"" so as to fall within the purview of the element of ""manifest partiality"" under Section 3 (e) of RA 3019. Further, the fact that DLI is a corporation owned and managed by petitioners' relatives is not enough to prove manifest partiality. In the same vein, there is also merit to petitioners' contention that they honestly believed that verbal permission of their travels was already sufficient under Section 96 of the LGC. A cursory reading of Section 96 (b) reveals that unlike paragraph (a), the wording does not explicitly state any qualification as to the form of permission for mayors of component cities and municipalities to travel outside the province. All the more, Governor Mandanas – the authorizing officer at that time – testified that he adopted a ""freedom of travel"" policy during his tenure, and as such, gave blanket authority to his mayors to travel outside their respective municipalities.[49] He also subsequently ratified the questioned travels in writing.[50] As petitioners' travels appeared authorized and valid, there was, likewise, basis for them to reimburse their incidental expenses. Thus, absent the crucial elements of evident bad faith, manifest partiality, or gross inexcusable negligence, public officers cannot be held criminally liable under Section 3 (e) of RA 3019. The Court finds that the amounts subject of the reimbursements were indeed used for official travel to and from various government offices outside Batangas. Thus, as the amounts were necessary and incidental to the exercise of public functions, it cannot be concluded that they redounded to petitioners' undue personal benefit. All told, for failure of the prosecution to prove petitioners' guilt for each of the charges under Section 3 (e) of RA 3019 beyond reasonable doubt, their conviction for the crimes charged must be set aside.","WHEREFORE, the motion for reconsideration is GRANTED. The Decision dated November 19, 2009 and the Resolution dated March 10, 2010 of the Sandiganbayan in Criminal Case Nos. 27555, 27556, 27557, and 27558 are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

"G.R. No. 236619, April 06, 2022","HEIRS OF MANUEL EÑANO, REPRESENTED BY VIRGILIO A. BOTE, PETITIONERS, VS. SAN PEDRO CINEPLEX PROPERTIES, INC., RESPONDENT.","Jennifer Eñano Bote, daughter of Manuel H. Eñano (Manuel), was the representative of the latter's legal heirs.[7] In August 2006, she authorized her husband Virgilio A. Bote (Virgilio) through a Special Power of Attorney[8] to file a Complaint for Quieting of Title with Damages[9] involving a parcel of land with an estimated area of 74,847 square meters located at Barangay Landayan, San Pedro, Laguna (subject property).[10] Petitioners contended that Manuel is the registered owner of the subject property evidenced by Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-35050[11] (TCT No. T-35050). Manuel had been in open and continuous possession of the subject property since 1966 until his demise in 1987 when his heirs had taken possession of the same. In June 2006, while Virgilio was in possession of the subject property, he received a Complaint for Forcible Entry filed by San Pedro Cineplex Properties, Inc. (respondent) claiming that it is the registered owner of the subject property by virtue of Transfer Certificate of Title Nos. T-309608,[12] T-309609,[13] and T-309610.[14] After verification with the Register of Deeds of Calamba City, petitioners discovered that TCT Nos. T-309608, T-309609 and T-309610 were fictitious, creating a cloud over Manuel's title over the subject property.[15] The survey of the properties described under petitioners' TCT No. T-35050 and respondent's TCT Nos. T-309608, T-309609 and T-309610 confirmed that said certificates of title covered one and the same lot. Petitioners contended that respondent's titles were fictitious because they originated from an unnotarized and undated Deed of Sale between respondent and La Paz Housing Development Corporation (La Paz Housing), whose antecedent titles were allegedly reconstituted in a proceeding that did not transpire. Respondent chronicled its chain of transactions leading to its acquisition of the subject property, tracing ownership from Original Certificate of Title No. 0-217 to TCT Nos. T-309608, T-309609, and T-309610 issued in 1994, and argued that Manuel's TCT No. T-35050 in fact covered a different 219-square meter property in Calamba, Laguna.","In its Decision[57] dated June 20, 2014, the RTC of San Pedro resolved that the petitioners are the exclusive owners, having a better right than respondent, over the subject property. Consequently, TCT Nos. T-309608, T-309609, and T-309610 were declared null and void.[58] The trial court ratiocinated that Manuel legally acquired the subject property through an Absolute Deed of Sale dated May 13, 1965, and he was in continuous and peaceful possession of the property from the time of said sale. Finally, between the conflicting titles of the petitioners and of the respondent, the former's Tax Declaration covering TCT No. T-35050 constituted as conclusive proof of their claim over the subject property.","In its August 15, 2017 Decision,[65] the CA reversed the trial court's findings and dismissed the complaint for lack of merit.[66] The petitioners failed to prove by preponderance of evidence that they have a legal or an equitable title over the subject property. Their unsubstantiated allegation that respondent's titles were fictitious and constituted a cloud over the title of Manuel could not prevail over the evidence presented by respondent regarding the chain of transactions, and the transfers and historical origin of the titles from the mother title until the same reached respondent.[67] Manuel's TCT No. T-35050 was already a cancelled title covering a 219-square meter property in Barrio Mayapa, Calamba, Laguna, and registered under the name of Marcelo P. Karran. Conversely, the existence of the mother title and its subsequent TCTs including respondent's titles was confirmed from the records of the Register of Deeds.","The petition is DENIED. The assailed August 15, 2017 Decision and January 4, 2018 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 107300 are hereby AFFIRMED in toto. Costs on petitioners."

During their quarrels, respondent would insult petitioner by bringing up her traumatic past. Petitioner and respondent would also argue over respondent's drinking, gambling, and womanizing. Encountering difficulties in supporting their family, the couple moved to the house of petitioner's parents. In February 2000, respondent eventually found work as an entertainer in Japan. Petitioner claimed that she was shocked to learn that respondent indicated his civil status as 'single' in his passport, and when she confronted him, respondent simply claimed that he was advised by his manager to represent himself as 'single' as it is the common practice for male entertainers in Japan. Respondent would nonetheless proceed to work in Japan and send money to petitioner, but such remittances were not enough to support their family. Sometime in June 2002, respondent failed to send money to petitioner and ultimately ceased all contact with his family. After two years of no communication with respondent, petitioner was able to talk to respondent after he called his sister to tell petitioner that he was no longer coming back to her, and that he was already living with another woman. Respondent told her, 'Wag mo na akong hintayin pa at ako'y di na uuwi pa dahil may babae na ako dito. Kung gusto mo, mag-asawa ka na rin.' Petitioner filed before the RTC a petition dated August 13, 2010, seeking the declaration of nullity of her marriage to respondent on the ground of the latter's psychological incapacity. Petitioner submitted as evidence a report on the psychological condition of petitioner and respondent conducted by clinical psychologist Dr. H. Nedy L. Tayag, who concluded that respondent suffered from antisocial personality disorder stemming from his childhood years, and 'being afflicted with said disorder, respondent lacked depth when it concerned his marital duties and obligations.'","In its December 28, 2011 Decision, the RTC granted the petition declaring the marriage of the parties null and void ab initio, relying on the findings in the report. The OSG filed a motion for reconsideration, which the RTC denied in an Order dated March 23, 2012. In its June 16, 2017 Decision, the CA reversed the December 28, 2011 Decision of the RTC, holding that the totality of the evidence presented is insufficient to establish respondent's psychological incapacity to fulfill his marital obligations. The CA found that Dr. Tayag's report failed to fully explain the symptoms and establish a link between respondent's acts to respondent's alleged psychological incapacity. Petitioner's motion for reconsideration was denied in the Resolution dated November 16, 2017.","The Supreme Court finds the petition to be bereft of merit. Applying Article 36 of the Family Code and the revised guidelines in Tan-Andal v. Andal, the Court finds that the petitioner failed to prove and substantiate by clear and convincing evidence that respondent suffers from such 'psychological incapacity' that prevents him from complying with his marital obligations. Although the respondent clearly failed to fulfill his essential obligations (abandonment, lack of support, infidelity), the totality of evidence does not show that such failure is caused by a genuinely serious and incurable psychic cause which exists prior to or at the time of celebration of the marriage. The Court noted inconsistencies in the information provided in the psychologist’s report, as the sources of information (children and respondent's younger brother) contradicted the report’s conclusion that respondent suffered from parental neglect and defective behavior. The Court emphasized that psychological incapacity must be a 'downright incapacity or inability' and not a mere 'refusal, neglect or difficulty, much less ill will.' Absent clear and convincing evidence, the petition must be denied.","WHEREFORE, the petition is hereby DENIED. The June 16, 2017 Decision and the November 16, 2017 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 100665 are AFFIRMED. Accordingly, the petition for declaration of nullity of marriage filed under Article 36 of the Family Code, as amended, is DISMISSED."
"G.R. Nos. 250366 and 250388-98, April 06, 2022","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. CARLOS RACADIO ASUNCION, MAMELFA R. AMONGOL, GENOVEVA R. RAGASA, ROSITA R. RAGUNJAN, AND VIRGINIA R. RAFANAN, ACCUSED-APPELLANTS.","Asuncion was a public officer, being the Mayor of Sta. Catalina; Ilocos Sur for three consecutive terms from 2007 until 2016. He is married to Flora R. Asuncion (Flora), who was the Federated President of the Bayanihan ng Kababaihan, an organization of women rural workers. Accused-appellants Amongol, Ragunjan, Rafanan, and Ragasa were the Presidents of their respective chapters of the Bayanihan ng Kababaihan, i.e., the Cabittaogan, Subec, Paratong, and Sinabaan chapters, respectively, from 2007 until 2016. The private complainant is Jonathan Amando R. Redoble (Redoble), a member of the opposition in the Municipality of Sta. Catalina, Ilocos Sur, who lost his bid for the Sangguniang Bayan in the May 2013 National and Local Elections. He is the son of Juan Robles, a mayoralty candidate during the 2007, 2010, and 2013 National and Local Elections, who lost three times to Asuncion. The undisputed facts, as culled by the Sandiganbayan from the parties' admissions and joint statement of facts, are as follows: On 20 September 2010, the Bayanihan ng Kababaihan was accredited by the Sangguniang Bayan of Sta. Catalina, Ilocos Sur. They were managed by the officers who were elected by the members. On 04 June 2012, accused Asuncion approved four (4) undated project proposals and entered into four (4) Memoranda of Agreement (MOA) with: (1) accused Amongol in her capacity as the Bayanihan ng Kababaihan - Cabittaogan Chapter President; (2) accused Ragunjan in her capacity as the Bayanihan ng Kababaihan — Subec Chapter President; (3) accused Rafanan in her capacity as the Bayanihan ng Kababaihan Paratong Chapter President; and (4) accused Ragasa in her capacity as the Bayanihan ng Kababaihan - Sinabaan Chapter President. Under the subject project proposals and MOA, the four (4) chapters of the Bayanihan ng Kababaihan each received the amount of Php 100,000.00 as financial assistance for livelihood projects. The recipient members of the chapters were required to pay the amount loaned to them within six (6) months plus interests. Accused Asuncion, being the approving authority and the person who had control over the disbursements of funds of the municipality, approved the release of the funds in favor of the four (4) chapters of the Bayanihan ng Kababaihan. Eventually, accused Amongol, Ragunjan, Rafanan, and Ragasa received and negotiated the checks with the following details: Accused Check Number Date Amount(in PhP) Amongol 636184 June 15, 2012 100,000.00 Ragunjan 636186 June 15, 2012 100,000.00 Ragasa 636187 June 15, 2012 100,000.00 Rafanan 636185 June 15, 2012 100,000.00 The beneficiaries were the chapters of the federation of Bayanihan ng Kababaihan, and not the federation itself. The subject funds released to the aforesaid chapters of Bayanihan ng Kababaihan were public funds, having been sourced from the share of the municipality of Sta. Catalina, Ilocos Sur in the Tobacco Excise Tax as provided in R.A. No. 7171 entitled An Act to Promote the Development of the Farmers in the Virginia Tobacco Producing Provinces. On account of the foregoing, private complainant filed both administrative and criminal complaints against herein accused, claiming that the grant of financial assistance in favor of the said Bayanihan ng Kababaihan chapters was not authorized and that the said recipients were not legitimate organizations. On 22 February 2016, the financial assistance, which was disallowed by the Commission on Audit (COA), was settled or returned (by Amongol, Ragunjan, Ragasa and Rafanan) as evidenced by a certification dated 14 April 2016. On February 8, 2013, private complainant Redoble filed a complaint-affidavit before the Office of the Ombudsman against accused-appellants Mayor Asuncion, Amongol, Ragunjan, Ragasa, Rafanan (and other John Does) for violations of Articles 217 and 220 of the Revised Penal Code and for violations of Sections 3(e), (h) and (j) of RA 3019. In a Resolution dated August 29, 2014 and approved on June 13, 2016, the Ombudsman found probable cause to indict accused-appellants for violation of Sections 3(e) and (j), and for violation of Article 217 of the Revised Penal Code. Thus, on July 3, 2017, the Special Prosecutor of the Office of the Ombudsman filed informations against the accused-appellants for violation of Sec. 3(e) of RA 3019, violation of Sec. 3(j) of RA 3019, and malversation of public funds, similarly worded as follows: SB-17-CRM-1393 to 1396 (violation of Sec. 3(e) of RA 3019) That on 15 June 2012, or sometime prior or subsequent thereto, in Sta. Catalina, Ilocos Sur, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, Carlos Racadio Asuncion, a high-ranking public official being then the Municipal Mayor of Sta. Catalina, Ilocos Sur, in such capacity, committing the crime in relation to his office, acting through evident bad faith, manifest partiality or gross inexcusable negligence, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and criminally, in conspiracy with accused xxx, caused undue injury to the Local Government of Sta. Catalina, Ilocos Sur, by granting despite the lack of authority from the Sangguniang Bayan of Sta. Catalina, lack of proper appropriation and non-compliance with Commission on Audit C,ircular No. 2007-01, financial assistance in the amount of ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PESOS (Php 100,000.00) sourced from the municipality's 2010 share of the Tobacco Excise Tax to Bayanihan ng Kababaihan - xxx Chapter, through accused xxx, an entity unqualified to receive said financial assistance in view of its lack of legal personality and the fact that it is not an association of tobacco farmers, thus giving the latter unwarranted benefit, advantage or preference. SB-17-CRM-1397 to 1400 (violation of Sec. (j) of RA 3019) That on 15 June 2012, or sometime prior or subsequent thereto, in Sta. Catalina, Ilocos Sur, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, Carlos Racadio Asuncion, a high-ranking public official being then the Municipal Mayor of Sta. Catalina, Ilocos Sur, in such capacity, committing the crime in relation to his office, in conspiracy with accused xxx, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and criminally approve or grant a benefit in the form of a financial assistance in the amount of ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PESOS (Php 100,000.00) sourced from the municipality's 2010 share of the Tobacco Excise Tax to Bayanihan ng Kababaihan - xxx Chapter, through accused xxx, knowing fully well that it is an entity not legally entitled to such benefit or advantage in view of its lack of legal personality and the fact that it is not an association of tobacco farmers. SB-17-CRM-1401 to 1404 (Malversation of Public Funds) That on 15 June 2012, or sometime prior or subsequent thereto, in Sta. Catalina, Ilocos Sur, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, Carlos Racadio Asuncion, a public official, being then the Municipal Mayor of Sta. Catalina, Ilocos Sur, and as such is accountable for public funds under his administration, in conspiracy with accused xxx, did then and there willfully and feloniously appropriate, take or misappropriate, consent or permit the taking of public funds by granting financial assistance in the amount of ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PESOS (Php 100,000.00) sourced from the municipality's 2010 share of the Tobacco Excise Tax to Bayanihan ng Kababaihan - xxx Chapter, through accused xxx, without the benefit of an appropriation ordinance, to the damage and prejudice of the Municipality of Sta. Catalina, Ilocos Sur in the said amount. The accused-appellants separately posted their bail bonds, which the Sandiganbayan subsequently approved. Upon arraignment on August 14, 2017 and September 14, 2017, the five accused-appellants pleaded ""Not Guilty"" to the three charges against them. During pre-trial, the parties agreed to submit a Joint Stipulation and Narration of Facts and Issues, in lieu of the presentation of witnesses. After pre-trial, the Sandiganbayan ordered the parties to submit their respective formal offers of evidence and memoranda. Evidence for the Prosecution The prosecution endeavored to show that the Cabittaogan, Subec, Paratong and Sinabaan chapters of the Bayanihan ng Kababaihan, respectively headed by the accussed-appellants Amongol, Ragunjan, Rafanan and Ragasa, neither had the legal personality nor the qualifications to receive financial assistance sourced from the municipality's 2010 share of Tobacco Excise Taxes because: (1) they did not submit the documents required by COA Circular No. 2007-001; (2) they have no legal personality, as they were not registered with either the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), nor were they accredited by the Bids and Awards Committee; (3) they were not an association of tobacco farmers who are authorized to receive a portion of the municipality's share of the Tobacco Excise Taxes pursuant to RA 7171; (4) accused-appellant Asuncion was not authorized by the Sangguniang Bayan through an appropriation ordinance to enter into a Memorandum of Agreement with the subject chapters of the Bayanihan ng Kababaihan and to grant them financial assistance; and (5) there was a conspiracy between the accused-appellants. To prove the foregoing, the prosecution submitted a Certification dated November 26, 2012 from the SEC, to the effect that the Bayanihan ng Kababaihan is not registered as a juridical person; a Certification dated January 2, 2013 from the Cooperative Development Authority, to the effect that the Bayanihan ng Kababaihan is not registered as a cooperative; and a letter dated January 15, 2013 to private complainant Jonathan Redoble from Region I DOLE, to the effect that the Bayanihan ng Kababaihan is not registered as labor organization. Next, the prosecution tried to show that accused-appellant Mayor Asuncion acted with partiality toward the Bayanihan ng Kababaihan because his wife was the Federated President of the organization, as shown by their Marriage Contract and by the Certification signed by Mrs. Flora Asuncion attesting to the fact that she was the Federated President of Bayanihan ng Kababaihan. The disbursements were proved by the appurtenant Project Proposals, Memoranda of Agreement, Obligation Request Forms, Disbursement Vouchers, Checks and Journal Entry Vouchers pertaining to a loan of P100,000.00 each given by the Municipality of Sta. Catalina, Ilocos Sur to the Cabittaogan, Subec, Paratong and Sinabaan chapters of the Bayanihan ng Kababaihan. Evidence for the Defense In his defense, accused-appellant Mayor Asuncion countered that (1) the Bayanihan ng Kababaihan and its Cabittaogan, Subec, Paratong and Sinabaan chapters possessed the necessary juridical personality at the time when they entered into their respective Memorandum of Agreement in 2012, as shown by various resolutions of the Sangguniang Bayan accrediting the Bayanihan ng Kababaihan as a community-based non-governmental organization and civil society organization since 2007; (2) as the Mayor of Sta. Catalina, he possessed the proper authorization from the Sangguniang Bayan to enter into the MOA with the other accused, as shown by Resolution No. 39, s. 2010, dated July 5, 2010, authorizing him to represent the Municipality of Sta. Catalina in all of its official transactions, and to sign on its behalf all bonds, contracts and obligations and such other documents made pursuant to law or ordinance; (3) he acted in good faith upon his honest belief that the four chapters of the Bayanihan ng Kababaihan (who were rural workers or farmers, as certified by the DOLE in September 2013) were qualified to avail of financial assistance under RA 7171 because said law speaks of giving special support to tobacco-producing provinces for the benefit of its farmers, without stating that non-tobacco farmers were specifically disallowed or excluded from also benefitting therefrom; (4) the loans given to the accused-appellants were authorized by Appropriation Ordinance No. 01 series of 2010, which was re-enacted in 2011 and 2012, pursuant to Section 323 of the Local Government Code; and (5) there was no undue injury to the Municipality and/or the government because – as admitted by private complainant and the prosecution in the Joint Stipulation and Narration of Facts and Issues – the four beneficiary chapters of the Bayanihan ng Kababaihan paid the loans on February 22, 2016, upon being informed of the COA disallowance and prior to the filing of the subject criminal cases. For their part, accused-appellants Amongol, Ragunjan, Rafanan and Ragasa argued that they had the requisite legal personality to enter into a MOA and obtain loans from the Municipality of Sta. Catalina because they had been accredited as NGO (non-governmental organization) and CSO (civil society organization) by the Municipality itself since 2007. Further, they contended that they can also be considered as an association of tobacco farmers because tobacco farmers reside within their respective chapters or barangays. Rafanan also maintained that albeit eventually and belatedly, the DOLE approved their application as an association of rural workers on September 30, 2013. Thus, they believed in good faith that they were qualified to avail of the loans from the Municipality. Rafanan emphasized that the amounts they obtained from the Municipality are loans, not financial assistance or dole-outs. They were not recipients of a livelihood program and there was no conspiracy to commit any illegality because they simply became debtors of the Municipality. Finally, they denied the existence of a conspiracy between them.","After due proceedings; the Sandiganbayan rendered a Decision dated May 17, 2019 finding accused-appellants Mayor Asuncion, Amongol, Ragunjan, Rafanan and Ragasa, in conspiracy with one another, guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violations of Sections 3(e) and (j) of RA 3019 and Malversation of Public Funds. The dispositive portion of the Sandiganbayan decision reads, as follows: WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered as follows: 1. In Criminal Case Nos. SB-17-CRM-1393-1396, accused CARLOS RACADIO ASUNCION, MAMELFA AMONGOL y RABAGO, ROSITA R. RAGUNJAN, VIRGINIA RAFANAN y RABINO, and GENOVEVA RAGASA y REQUEZO are each found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019, and are hereby imposed the indeterminate penalty of imprisonment of SIX (6) YEARS and ONE (1) MONTH as minimum to TEN (10) YEARS as maximum for each count. Additionally, said accused are sentenced to suffer perpetual disqualification to hold public office. 2. In Criminal Case Nos. SB-17-CRM-1397-1400, accused CARLOS RACADIO ASUNCION, MAMELFA AMONGOL y RABAGO, ROSITA R. RAGUNJAN, VIRGINIA RAFANAN y RABINO, and GENOVEVA RAGASA y REQUEZO are each found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 3(j) of R.A. No. 3019, and are hereby imposed the indeterminate penalty of imprisonment of SIX YEARS and ONE (1) MONTH as minimum to TEN (10) YEARS as maximum for each count, and perpetual disqualification to hold public office. 3. In Criminal Case Nos. SB-17-CRM-1401-1404, accused CARLOS RACADIO ASUNCION, MAMELFA AMONGOL y RABAGO, ROSITA R. RAGUNJAN, VIRGINIA RAFANAN y RABINO, and GENOVEVA RAGASA y REQUEZO are each found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of malversation of public funds under Article 217 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. No. 10951, and are hereby imposed the indeterminate penalty of imprisonment of TWO (2) YEARS, FOUR (4) MONTHS and ONE (1) DAY of prision correccional as minimum to SIX (6) YEARS of prision correccional as maximum for each count, appreciating the total restitution of public funds as a mitigating circumstance. The penalty of perpetual disqualification to hold public office is likewise imposed upon said accused. Further, the following accused are ordered to pay a fine equivalent to the amount malversed in each case: (1) accused CARLOS RACADIO ASUNCION and MAMELFA AMONGOL y RABAGO, the amount of Php 100,000.00 in SB-17-CRM-1401; (2) accused CARLOS RACADIO ASUNCION and ROSITA R. RAGUNJAN, Php 100,000.00 in SB-17-CRM-1402; (3) accused CARLOS RACADIO ASUNCION and VIRGINIA RAFANAN y RABINO, Php 100,000.00 in SB-17-CRM-1403, and (4) accused CARLOS RACADIO ASUNCION and GENOVEVA RAGASA y REQUEZO, Php 100,000.00 in SB-17-CRM-1404. No civil liability is adjudged, in view of the full restitution of the amounts involved. SO ORDERED.","We find merit in the appeal of the accused. After a judicious examination of the records and submissions of the parties in this case, the Court finds that the facts and evidence presented by the prosecution failed to prove the guilt of accused-appellants beyond reasonable doubt. Accused-appellant Mayor Asuncion did not violate Sec. 3(e) of RA 3019 when he entered into the MOA with the other accused-appellants and granted them a loan of P100,000.00 per chapter. However, the third element of committing the violation in one of three ways: manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence is absent in the case. All told, accused-appellant Mayor Asuncion acted in good faith when he authorized the disbursement of a loan of P100,000.00 for each of the subject chapters of the Bayanihan, anchored as it was on the honest belief that they were not excluded from the benefits granted by RA 7171. In fine, accused-appellant Mayor Asuncion is acquitted for the following reasons: (1) absence of the third element on the modes of committing the offense under Sec. 3(e) of RA 3019, and (2) the exculpatory proof of good faith. Accused-appellant Mayor Asuncion did not violate Sec. 3(j) of RA 3019 when he entered into the MOA with the other accused-appellants and granted them a loan of P100,000.00 per chapter. In this case, the first element of knowledge was not proved by the prosecution. Without evidence of such knowledge, accused-appellant Mayor Asuncion should be acquitted of the charge of violation of Sec. 3(j) of RA 3019. Violations of RA 3019 must be grounded on graft and corruption. In the instant case, the grant of the loans to the subject Bayanihan chapters was based on accused-appellant Mayor Asuncion's mistaken belief in good faith that accused-appellant chapter presidents were qualified to obtain livelihood loans from the Municipality's share of tobacco excise taxes under RA 7171. What is more, the prosecution failed to establish that accused-appellants had taken and given a bribe in return for the loans granted. The charge of malversation likewise fails. Since the disbursements were supported by the proper Appropriation Ordinances, there was no reason for accused-appellant Mayor not to enter into the loan agreements with his co-accused chapter presidents, and the charge of malversation must fail. The prosecution failed to prove the existence of a conspiracy between the accused-appellants. We are not persuaded by the theory of the prosecution that because accused-appellant Mayor Asuncion is married to the Federated President of the Bayanihan ng Kababaihan, he and the other accused-appellants, who are the presidents of their respective chapters, must have conspired in bad faith to obtain the loans. There being no conspiracy between the accused-appellants, the acquittal of accused-appellant Mayor Asuncion carries with it the acquittal of his co-accused Amongol, Ragunjan, Ragasa and Rafanan in the absence of any other evidence proving their guilt of the offenses charged.","the appeal is GRANTED and the Decision dated May 17, 2019 of the Sandiganbayan (Fourth Division) in the following 12 consolidated cases: Case Nos. SB-17-CRM-1393, -94, -95 and -96, for Violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019; Case Nos.

Asuncion, Mamelfa R. Amongol, Genoveva R. Ragasa, Rosita Ragunjan and Virginia R. Rafanan are ACQUITTED for failure of the prosecution to prove their guilt of the offenses charged beyond reasonable doubt."
"A.C. No. 11520 (Formerly CBD Case No. 17-5472), April 05, 2022","TITA MANGAYAN, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. CIPRIANO G. ROBIELOS III, RESPONDENT.","Loan with complainant Sometime in 1995, respondent contracted a loan from the complainant in the amount of P594,185.00. As payment for the obligation, respondent issued four postdated checks (the first set of checks), all drawn against Philam Savings Bank-United Nations Branch. The details of the checks are as follows: Drawee Bank Check No. Date Amount Philam Savings Bank 0002655 October 17, 1995 P24,560.00 Philam Savings Bank 0002661 October 22, 1995 P281,750.00 Philam Savings Bank 0002654 October 13, 1995 P37,975.00 Philam Savings Bank 0002653 October 1, 1995 P249,900.00 Total P594,185.00 When the obligation fell due, complainant presented the checks for payment but were all subsequently dishonored. Immediately, complainant informed respondent of the bounced checks and the latter committed to replacing the dishonored checks. However, for six years no replacement was ever given by respondent. As such, complainant initiated a criminal complaint for a violation of Batas Pambansa Blg. 22 (BP 22) which eventually reached the Metropolitan Trial Court of Quezon City. The case was, however, archived due to respondent's failure to attend the scheduled arraignment. Respondent remained at large for several years until his successful arrest sometime in 2016. It was only at this point that he had resumed communications with complainant regarding his obligations. Desirous for an expeditious settlement of her claims against respondent, complainant entered into a Compromise Agreement dated May 2, 2016 with respondent. In pursuit of the Compromise Agreement, respondent committed to replace the first set of checks issued. Accordingly, respondent issued four postdated Bank of Commerce checks (the replacement checks) with an aggregate value of P500,000.00, to wit: Drawee Bank Check No. Date Amount Bank of Commerce 0000053 August 2, 2016 P217,516.00 Bank of Commerce 0000056 August 2, 2016 P100,000.00 Bank of Commerce 0000055 August 2, 2016 P74,384.00 Bank of Commerce 0000054 August 2, 2016 P108,100.00 Total P500,000.00 At the time the replacement checks were agreed to be deposited for payment, respondent requested for at least eight extensions of time. In all these instances, complainant acceded to the request of respondent and refrained from depositing the replacement checks. However, on September 16, 2016—more than a month after the due date for the payment of his obligation under the Compromise Agreement—respondent stopped communicating with complainant. Complainant was thus constrained to present the replacement checks for payment. But, much to her chagrin, the replacement checks were likewise dishonored. Loan with Elizabeth Macapia Respondent was not only indebted to complainant in 1995. In same year, he incurred a loan from one Elizabeth Macapia (Macapia), a cousin of complainant, totaling P441,000.00. Similar to his obligation to complainant, he issued two postdated checks drawn against Philam Savings Bank (the second set of checks) as payment: Drawee Bank Check No. Date Amount Philam Savings Bank 0002662 October 13, 1995 P26,950.00 Philam Savings Bank 0002663 October 22, 1995 P414,050.00 Total P441,000.00 Complainant claims that she served as an accommodation co-maker of the obligation of respondent to her cousin. Unfortunately, much like the previous checks that respondent had issued, the second set of checks were likewise dishonored. In view of the respondent's failure to timely fund these checks, complainant, as a co-maker, settled respondent's obligation with Macapia, and resolved to pursue the amount she advanced from respondent. Respondent's failure to settle his obligation to Macapia effected another criminal case against him, which is currently pending before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Quezon City, Branch 217. Proceedings before this Court and the Integrated Bar of the Philippines In total, respondent had owed complainant a total of P1,035,185.00, which remained uncollected to this day. Accordingly, complainant initiated the instant administrative proceedings. On May 4, 2017, after requesting for an extension of the period of time to file a comment, respondent filed his Answer dated May 2, 2017. In his Answer, respondent essentially admits to being indebted to complainant but qualifies that he merely acted as an accommodation party for one Danilo Valenzona (Valenzona). According to respondent, he merely acceded to the request of Valenzona to “borrow” his personal checks in order to help conclude a business transaction between Valenzona and complainant. Oddly, in the same breath that he asserts that he is 'not personally indebted to the complainant[,]' he likewise states that he 'is willing to pay the obligation which he assumed[,]' and that 'complainant should be considerate enough especially that she knows that the respondent is merely an accommodation party.' Respondent makes no asseveration with respect to his debts to Macapia in his Answer. Less than a week after, or on May 11, 2017, complainant filed a Reply dated May 9, 2017, where she denied having dealt with Valenzona, and highlighted the fact that respondent presented no evidence to prove his claims in his Answer. In a Resolution dated July 5, 2017, this Court referred the case to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines Commission on Bar Discipline (IBP-CBD) for investigation, report, and recommendation. Before the IBP-CBD, respondent neither appeared before the Investigating Commissioner (IC) for the mandatory conferences, nor complied with the IC's Orders to file a Verified Comment, Mandatory Conference Brief, or Position Paper. As such, the case was eventually submitted for resolution where the IC, in his Report and Recommendation dated June 14, 2019, recommended that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for two years:","This Court finds the Report and Recommendation of the IC and the Resolution of the IBP Board of Governors impressed with merit and resolves to adopt the same with modification. The order of society rests upon the effective administration of justice for which members of the Bar play a crucial and indispensable role. In the fulfillment of this role, 'lawyers must not only in fact be of good moral character but must also be seen to be of good moral character and leading lives in accordance with the highest moral standards of the community.' ... The present controversy presents a familiar question before this Court: may a lawyer be administratively sanctioned by this Court for having failed to pay debts as they fall due, and for having issued worthless checks as payment for such debts? In the absence of circumstances that would evince good faith, the answer is an unequivocal yes. In Lim v. Rivera, this Court held: '""[the] deliberate failure to pay just debts and the issuance of worthless checks constitute gross misconduct, for which a lawyer may be sanctioned with suspension from the practice of law. Lawyers are instruments for the administration of justice and vanguards of our legal system. They are expected to maintain not only legal proficiency but also a high standard of morality, honesty, integrity and fair dealing so that the peoples' faith and confidence in the judicial system is ensured. They must at all times faithfully perform their duties to society, to the bar, the courts and to their clients, which include prompt payment of financial obligations. They must conduct themselves in a manner that reflects the values and norms of the legal profession as embodied in the Code of Professional Responsibility.""' Thus, the IBP IC correctly ruled that respondent's act of issuing a worthless check was a violation of Rule 1.01, Canon 1 of the CPR, which explicitly states: CANON 1 — A lawyer shall uphold the constitution, obey the laws of the land and promote respect for law and legal processes. Rule 1.01 — A lawyer shall not engage in unlawful, dishonest, immoral or deceitful conduct. ... In the present case, respondent does not dispute that he had been indebted to complainant since 1995. Respondent merely proffers the excuse that he had 'acted as accommodation party to Valenzona, [respondent's] friend who purchased construction materials from the complainant.' However, such an excuse is untenable. Not only is the assertion bereft of evidentiary support, but more importantly, as a lawyer, respondent should have known that being an accommodation party does not absolve him from responsibility for the loan incurred. Indeed, as an accommodation party he is directly and primarily liable to complainant. ... In fine, the period of time that has lapsed combined with the actions taken by respondent inexorably lead to the conclusion that he had no true intention of settling his obligation to complainant. Accordingly, it is beyond cavil that respondent had failed to observe the exacting standards of morality demanded by Canon 1 and Rule 1.01 of the Code of Professional Responsibility. The requirement of possessing a good moral character is not only a condition precedent to the admission to the Bar, but also a continuing requirement for the practice of law. Undoubtedly, therefore, administrative sanction is warranted by respondent's misconduct. This Court, however, disagrees with the recommended sanction of one (1) year suspension by the IBP Board of Governors insofar as it is not commensurate to the gravity of the wrong committed by respondent. Respondent is not deserving of such largesse considering the attendant circumstances. ... In view of the foregoing, this Court finds that the appropriate penalty to be imposed to respondent is suspension from the practice of law for a period of five (5) years with a stern warning that a repetition of the same or similar offense will warrant a more severe penalty. This Court finds the penalty proper in view of the following circumstances: (1) the amount involved in the instant case; (2) the fact that respondent had issued two sets of a number of worthless checks; (3) the more than two decades that the obligation has remained outstanding; (4) the failure of respondent to participate in the cases filed against him, including the instant administrative proceedings; and (5) the fact that respondent had not yet been convicted of the accusations against him in separate, but related, criminal proceedings before the RTCs. In addition to the foregoing sanction, this Court cannot overlook the fact that respondent, in more than one instance, displayed abject failure to obey the lawful orders of this Court and the IBP-CBD. ... In view of the foregoing, this Court finds it proper to likewise sanction respondent with a fine amounting to P10,000.00 for his unjustified refusal to obey the lawful orders of this Court and the IBP-CBD.","WHEREFORE, respondent Atty. Cipriano G. Robielos III is found GUILTY of violating Rule 1.01 and Canon 1 of the Code of Professional Responsibility and is hereby SUSPENDED from the practice of law for five (5) years to commence immediately from the receipt of this Decision.

"G.R. No. 252940, April 05, 2022","CENTRAL BAY RECLAMATION AND DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON AUDIT AND THE PHILIPPINE RECLAMATION AUTHORITY, RESPONDENTS.","On March 30, 1999, respondent Philippine Reclamation Authority (PRA), formerly Public Estates Authority (PEA), entered into an Amended Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) with petitioner Central Bay Reclamation and Development Corporation (Central Bay), formerly known as the Amari Coastal Bay and Development Corporation (AMARI), to develop three (3) reclaimed islands and reclaim about 592.15 hectares of foreshore and submerged areas of the Manila Bay. In a Decision dated July 9, 2002, this Court nullified the Amended JVA for violating Sections 2 and 3, Article XII of the 1987 Constitution which respectively prohibit the alienation of natural resources other than agricultural lands of the public domain, and the acquisition of private corporations of any kind of alienable land of the public domain. However, the Court held that Central Bay is not precluded to recover from PEA the costs incurred in implementing the agreement prior to its declaration of nullity on a quantum meruit basis. Accordingly, Central Bay filed a petition for money claim against PRA before the COA in COA CP Case No. 2010-350, seeking P11,527,573,684.12. Later, the parties submitted a joint motion for judgment based on a Compromise Agreement where PRA offered to pay the incurred costs of P1,027,031,483.79 by transferring 102,703.15 square meters of reclaimed land to Central Bay's qualified assignee. In a Decision dated May 23, 2019, the COA disapproved the Compromise Agreement, ruling that the stipulation to transfer the reclaimed land was a circumvention of the Court's previous Decision. The COA partially granted Central Bay's money claim in the amount of P714,937,790.29 representing advance payment for the reclamation and project development, while denying other claims for lack of supporting documents or legal basis. Central Bay filed this petition for certiorari against the COA's disapproval of the Compromise Agreement and the disallowance of the other money claims.","In this case, there is no grave abuse of discretion when the COA disapproved the Compromise Agreement. x x x In sum, the COA did not commit grave abuse of discretion when it disapproved the Compromise Agreement and disallowed the money claims, except the amount of P714,937,790.29 that was properly established with documentary evidence.","The proscription against corporate ownership of alienable lands is absolute and clear. The Compromise Agreement obliged PRA to transfer the reclaimed land to Central Bay's qualified assignee. Yet, this scheme grants Central Bay beneficial ownership or equitable title, circumventing the prohibition against private corporations from acquiring any kind of alienable land of the public domain except through a lease. Applying the maxim 'nemo dat quod non habet,' the qualified assignee can acquire ownership of the land only if Central Bay owns the land. Moreover, the COA correctly rejected the Compromise Agreement absent congressional approval. Section 20 (1), Chapter IV, Subtitle B, Title I, Book V of Executive Order No. 292, or the Administrative Code of 1987, is explicit that the Congress has the exclusive authority to compromise a settled claim or liability that exceeded P100,000.00 involving a government agency. Additionally, applying Section 29 (1), Article VI of the 1987 Constitution, as implanted in Sections 84 and 85 of the Government Auditing Code, a law must first be enacted by Congress appropriating P1,027,031,483.79 as compromise money before payment to Central Bay can be made. Lastly, the COA correctly disallowed Central Bay's money claims except the amount of P714,937,790.29 representing advance payment for the reclamation and project development which were properly established with documentary evidence, as claims against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation.","The petition is DISMISSED. The Decision of the Commission on Audit dated May 23, 2019 COA Decision No. 2019-157 and Resolution dated January 21, 2020 in COA CP Case No. 2010-350 is AFFIRMED. The Compromise Agreement between respondent Philippine Reclamation Authority and petitioner Central Bay Reclamation and Development Corporation is declared VOID AB INITIO for being contrary to Section 3, Article XII of the 1987 Constitution; Section 20 (1), Chapter IV, Subtitle B, Title I, Book V of Executive Order No. 292, or the Administrative Code of 1987; and Section 87, Chapter 4, Title II of Presidential Decree No. 1445, otherwise known as the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines."
"A.C. No. 9457 (Formerly CBD Case No. 13-3883), April 05, 2022","ABNER R. MANGUBAT, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. REYNALDO L. HERRERA, RESPONDENT.","The complainant, Abner Mangubat ( Abner ), is one of the heirs of Aurelia Rellora Mangubat ( Aurelia ), who in turn, predeceased her husband, Gaudencio Mangubat ( Gaudencio ). It was alleged in the complaint of Abner that in May 1998, Gaudencio engaged the services of Atty. Herrera to institute a complaint for revival of judgment involving a parcel of land covered by TCT No. 6337 against Orlando Seva ( Orlando ) and Belen Morga-Seva ( Belen ) and the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) docketed as Civil Case No. P-2145. In the complaint, Gaudencio was identified as the complainant together with the ""Heirs of Aurelia represented by Raquel Azada ( Raquel )."" Atty. Herrera enumerated the heirs of Aurelia and stated that Raquel joined the Complaint ""for herself and as attorney-in-fact of her co-plaintiffs."" Atty. Herrera admitted that the engagement was only at the instance of Gaudencio, in the form of a verbal agreement, and that the latter undertook to secure the special power of attorney ( SPA ) from his children. However, no SPA was presented to the trial court. On February 22, 2001, a Compromise Agreement was executed between Gaudencio, represented by Atty. Herrera, Belen, and the counsel for the DBP. After the compromise agreement was approved by the court, Atty. Herrera filed a motion for execution. Incidentally, on January 31, 2002, Gaudencio died. Abner subsequently hired Atty. Haide Gumba ( Atty. Gumba ) to represent him. Atty. Gumba filed a motion to substitute Gaudencio with Abner. Subsequently, Atty. Herrera filed an "" Ex-Parte Manifestation with Motion to Hold in Custody of the Court the Award in this Case Pending the Settlement of Estate of the Late Gaudencio Mangubat ."" Abner claimed that Atty. Herrera did not secure any authority from the heirs when he filed the motion and manifestation and even omitted Job in the enumeration of heirs. On December 18, 2003, two years and two months after the writ of execution was issued, Atty. Herrera filed a Compliance stating that he received P91,280.00 from Helen's son. On even date, a deed of conditional sale Atty. Herrera drafted was executed between one Silvestre Seva, Jr. ( Silvestre ), who claimed to be the attorney-in-fact of Belen, and the Spouses Ricardo and Rosemarie Biag ( Spouses Biag ) involving 600 square meters of the 16,320 square meters covered by TCT No. 6337. Atty. Herrera notarized the deed of conditional sale. However, it was only on April 7, 2005, or one year and four months after Atty. Herrera received the money that he deposited it with the clerk of court. On December 17, 2004, Atty. Herrera filed an "" Ex-Parte Motion to Designate the Clerk of Court to Draft and Execute the Deed of Sale or Conveyance in Favor of the Defendants .""","After a judicious review of the records of the case, We resolve to modify the penalty recommended by the IBP Board of Governors and impose the more serious penalty of disbarment from the practice of law. We find that the repeated and brazen acts committed by Atty. Herrera violates the CPR, Canons of Professional Ethics ( CPE ), and the Rules of Court. His acts reveal his proclivity to commit unethical and dishonest practices to the detriment of the legal profession. In view of the foregoing, We modify Resolution No. XXII-2015-68 of the IBP Board of Governors by imposing the more serious penalty of disbarment from the practice of law on Atty. Herrera for violating the following: Canons 1, 5, 10, 15, 16 and 19 of the CPR; Canon 11 of the CPE; and Section 16, Rule 3, and Section 27, Rule 138 of the Rules of Court.","In sum, Atty.

"A.C. No. 9594, April 05, 2022","THE HEIRS OF THE LATE SPOUSES JUSTICE AND MRS. SAMUEL F. REYES, HEREIN REPRESENTED BY JUDGE ANTONIO C. REYES, COMPLAINANTS, VS. ATTY. RONALD L. BRILLANTES, RESPONDENT","On February 17, 2005, the Estate of the late Justice Samuel F. Reyes and Mrs. Antonia C. Reyes (the Estate) filed a Complaint for quieting of title against the Spouses Florencio and Felicitas Divina. The RTC ruled in favor of the Estate on November 21, 2007, which the CA affirmed on January 20, 2010, making the decision final and executory on February 16, 2010. On August 9, 2011, Spouses Divina engaged the services of Atty. Brillantes. On September 29, 2011, Spouses Divina, through Atty. Brillantes, filed a Petition for Annulment of Judgment (Annulment Petition) with the CA, arguing that his clients' belated receipt of the RTC Decision on August 19, 2011 prevented them from filing a timely appeal thereof with the CA. The CA denied due course to the Annulment Petition and dismissed the case. In the disbarment complaint, Judge Reyes alleged that Atty. Brillantes had grossly and deliberately violated the Lawyer's Oath, the CPR for committing a falsehood and for abusing procedural rules, and the rule on forum shopping, as the RTC Decision had already been received by Spouses Divina in 2007. Atty. Brillantes countered that Spouses Divina never disclosed the previous appeal and he relied only on their interview and submitted documents, insisting he acted in good faith. The IBP found Atty. Brillantes guilty of violating the rule on forum shopping, the Lawyer's Oath, and the CPR, and recommended suspension.","After a careful review of the case, the Court concurs with the findings and recommendation of the IBP that Atty. Brillantes be suspended from the practice of law for a period of six (6) months.","Atty. Brillantes failed to competently handle the case of his clients by preparing and filing the Annulment Petition with the CA on the sole basis of his clients' misrepresentations, showing a lack of due diligence (Rules 18.02 and 18.03, Canon 18). By fully relying on inaccurate information, he inadvertently committed a falsehood before the CA (Rule 10.01, Canon 10). Furthermore, he violated the rule on forum shopping (Rules 12.02 and 12.04, Canon 12) by filing the Annulment Petition despite the finality of the previous CA Decision, causing undue delay in the settlement of the Estate. However, considering his admission of shortcomings, sincere apology, that this is his first infraction, and the negative economic impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic, the Court deemed the penalty of suspension for six (6) months commensurate.","the Court finds respondent Atty. Ronald L. Brillantes GUILTY of violating the rule on forum shopping, the Lawyer's Oath, and Rule 10.01, Canon 10, Rules 12.02 and 12.04, Canon 12, and Rules 18.02 and 18.03, Canon 18 of the Code of Professional Responsibility. Accordingly, the Court hereby SUSPENDS him from the practice of law for a period of six (6) months, with a STERN WARNING that a repetition of the same or similar acts shall be dealt with more severely. The suspension in the practice of law shall take effect immediately upon receipt of this Decision by respondent Atty. Ronald L. Brillantes. He is DIRECTED to immediately file a Manifestation to the Court that his suspension has started, copy furnished all courts and quasi-judicial bodies where he has entered his appearance as counsel.

"G.R. No. 198629, April 05, 2022","REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, PETITIONER, VS. EFREN S. BUENAVENTURA, RESPONDENT.","On January 11, 2008, Buenaventura filed a Petition[4] before the RTC of San Mateo, Rizal, applying for the original registration of title of Lot No. 1788, Cad. 674 (the subject property). In his petition, Buenaventura alleged that: He purchased the subject property from Lorenzo Habagat as evinced by a Deed of Absolute Sale dated August 4, 1993 (Deed of Sale); The subject property is situated on P. Sandoval St., Burgos, Rodriguez, Rizal; The subject property has a market value of P229,900.00 per the Declaration of Real Property under Property Index No. 021-08-002; The subject property is declared for assessment under his name; To his knowledge, the subject property is not mortgaged nor encumbered; The subject property is exclusively occupied by him; The subject property is alienable and disposable; and He has been religiously paying the real property taxes thereon.[5] On June 16, 2008, the Republic, through the OSG, filed an Opposition,[6] praying for the denial of Buenaventura's application for original registration of title. During trial, Buenaventura presented himself and the following witnesses: (1) Ferdinand Encarnacion (Encarnacion) from the Docket Section of the Land Registration Authority (LRA); (2) Loriza Aldeano (Aldeano), an employee of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR)-Region IV-A City Environment and Natural Resources Office (CENRO); and (3) Engr. Marilou Daga (Engr. Daga) from the Projection Section of the LRA.[7] Buenaventura testified that he is the owner of the subject property which he bought from Lorenzo Habagat in 1993 by virtue of the Deed of Absolute Sale.[8] He also stated that the subject property consists of 209 square meters, and is surveyed and classified as a residential lot. Buenaventura explained that previously, the subject property measured 220 square meters, but the same was reduced because of a road widening project. Further, Buenaventura testified that he constructed a house thereon and lived there, but the house is now being rented out. Finally, Buenaventura averred that as early as 1949, or even before the execution of the Deed of Absolute Sale, he has been paying real property taxes on the subject property.[9] Encarnacion testified that as an employee of the Docket Section of the LRA, he is in charge of safekeeping of records in their office. He then verified that a survey plan of the subject property has been submitted to their office, and that the same is not covered by any cadastral record or title.[10] Meanwhile, Aldeano stated that she is the Records Officer of the CENRO of the DENR-Region IV-A, and as part of her duties, she is responsible to keep on file the records of their office. She likewise identified a Certification dated January 18, 2008 signed by Flordelino M. Rey, Officer-In-Charge-CENRO, which states that the subject property is within the alienable and disposable zone and is not covered by any other application for registration of title.[11] Lastly, Engr. Daga testified that she is the Chief of the Projection Section of the DENR, and that as part of her duties, she is tasked to supervise the ocular inspection of lands, and verify surveys and certifications. She further testified that upon review of the original plan of the subject property, there were no overlapping of lots nor double issuance of title involving the subject property[12]","On September 13, 2011, the CA promulgated its Decision,[18] dismissing the Republic's appeal, thus: WHEREFORE, premises considered, the assailed decision dated June 29, 2009 of the RTC, Branch 77, San Mateo, Rizal in L.R.C. Case No. N-326 is hereby AFFIRMED. SO ORDERED.[19] In affirming the RTC's Decision,[20] the CA ruled that the certification issued by the CENRO is sufficient to establish that the subject property is considered alienable and disposable.[21] The CA likewise held that Buenaventura was able to establish his right to have the subject property registered since: (1) he purchased the subject property from its previous owner; (2) he has occupied it openly, continuously, notoriously, and exclusively in the concept of an owner; (3) he has declared the subject property for taxation purposes under his name; and (4) he built a house thereon, lived there for a while, and later rented it out to someone else.[22]","The Court noted that although the prevailing doctrine required both a CENRO certification and a copy of the original classification approved by the DENR Secretary to prove alienability, Republic Act (R.A.) No. 11573, which took effect on September 1, 2021, retroactively superseded these requirements due to its curative nature. Under R.A. No. 11573 (specifically Section 7), a duly signed certification by a designated DENR geodetic engineer is now sufficient proof that the land is alienable and disposable, provided the certification contains specific references (like LC Map number, Project Number) and the engineer is presented as a witness for proper authentication. Since the CA and RTC findings regarding Buenaventura's possession were binding, the only remaining issue was land classification, which must now be re-evaluated based on the new, more relaxed standards set by R.A. No. 11573.","WHEREFORE, the Petition for Review on Certiorari dated October 24, 2011 is DENIED in part. The case is REMANDED to the Court of Appeals for reception of evidence on the subject property's land classification status based on the parameters set forth in Section 7 of Republic Act No. 11573. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 249344, April 05, 2022","WESTMINSTER SEAFARER MANAGEMENT PHILIPPINES, INC., PETITIONER, VS. ARNULFO C. RAZ, RESPONDENT.","Respondent entered into a Contract of Employment[5] on November 10, 2014[6] to work as a Fitter for the vessel NOCC Kattegat for a period of nine months. In the contract, Wallem Shipmanagement Limited was represented by petitioner as its agent.[7] As a Fitter, respondent's duties included repairing and maintaining the vessel engine, assisting in its overhauling, welding, cleaning, carrying and lifting, and pulling heavy equipment and engine parts.[8] On May 15, 2015, while lifting a heavy cylinder head, respondent suffered pain in his right shoulder. As time passed, the pain had worsened so that he could no longer raise his arm without feeling pain that radiated to his back. He reported the matter to his superiors and the latter referred him to a physician in Southampton, London for examination. They repatriated him on May 31, 2015 after he was declared to be unfit to work.[9] Upon his arrival in the Philippines, petitioner referred respondent to the NGC Clinic for further tests where his shoulder was subjected to X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination.[10] His MRI result revealed that he was suffering from ""superior labral tear, anterior or posterior (SLAP), effusion in the biceps tendon sheath and superior subscapular recess; supraspinatus tendinosis and acromioclavicular joint hypertrophy.""[11] Respondent underwent surgery on his right shoulder on July 8, 2015. The hospital discharged him after two months and continued with his physical therapy sessions on an outpatient basis.[12] On November 11, 2015, Dr. Nicomedes G. Cruz (Dr. Cruz), the company-designated physician, assessed respondent with the final disability of Grade 9— ankylosis of one shoulder, the shoulder blade remaining mobile.[13] Pursuant to the Collective Bargaining Agreement[14] (CBA) between petitioner and respondent's union, the Associated Marine Officers' and Seamen's Union of the Philippines, respondent was entitled to disability benefits amounting to US$25,313.00.[15] Dr. Cruz likewise declared respondent as not permanently unfit to work as a seafarer.[16] Because he was still experiencing pain in his right shoulder and could not fully lift his arm, respondent consulted another physician, Dr. Manuel Fidel M. Magtira (Dr. Magtira), for a second opinion in December 2015. After another MRI examination, Dr. Magtira declared that respondent was permanently unfit in any capacity for further sea duties.[17] Respondent informed petitioner of the medical findings of Dr. Magtira through a letter dated January 19, 2015. He informed petitioner that he was willing to undergo a third medical examination to confirm his disability. However, despite receipt of the letter, petitioner did not refer the matter to a third doctor.[18] The foregoing antecedents prompted respondent to file a complaint against petitioner before the National Conciliation and Mediation Board (NCMB) of the Department of Labor and Employment for payment of total permanent disability benefits, medical reimbursement, damages, and attorney's fees.[19] In the Decision[20] dated June 20, 2017 in AC-944-RCMB-NCR-MVA-095-01-05-2016 (RCMB-NCR-MAK-NTA-01-0011-2016), the NCMB ordered petitioner to pay respondent total and permanent disability benefits in the amount of US$129,212.00, moral damages amounting to US$10,000.00, and 10% of the total monetary award as attorney's fees.[21] Petitioner sought reconsideration,[24] but the NCMB denied it in a Resolution dated July 20, 2017.[25]","In the herein assailed Decision dated May 6, 2019, the CA set aside the Decision dated June 20, 2017 of the NCMB and lowered the award of disability benefit in favor of respondent to US$25,313.00. The fallo of the assailed Decision reads: WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Petition for Certiorari is GRANTED. The Decision dated 20 June 2017 and Resolution dated 10 August 2017 of the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) National Conciliation and Mediation Board-Office of the Voluntary Arbitrator (NCMB) in AC-944-RCMB-NCR-MVA-095-01-05-2016 (RCMB-NCR-MAK-NTA-01-0011-2016[)] are hereby SET ASIDE. Petitioner Westminster Seafarer Management Phil., Inc. is hereby ORDERED to pay to Private Respondent Arnulfo C. Raz the amount of Twenty-Five Thousand Three Hundred and Thirteen US Dollars (USD25,313.00) as Grade 9 Disability benefit, plus Attorney's Fees equivalent to ten percent (10%) of his monetary award. Legal interest shall be computed at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum of the total award from date of finality of judgment until full satisfaction. SO ORDERED.","The Court denies the petition. At the outset, the Court notes that there is no longer an issue as to the amount of the award to respondent. In the assailed Decision dated May 6, 2019, the CA set aside the NCMB Decision dated June 20, 2017 and lowered the award of disability benefit of respondent to US$25,313.00. . . Because no party further questioned the award of disability benefit to respondent in the sum of US$25,313.00, the amount is already deemed binding upon the parties. It then leaves the Court to decide only the issues raised in the petition—the award of attorney's fees in favor of respondent and the imposition of 6% legal interest on the total monetary award.[45] In Nacar v. Gallery Frames,[46] the Court laid down the rule that when the judgment of the court awarding a sum of money becomes final and executory, the rate of legal interest shall be 6% per annum from such finality until its satisfaction, this interim period being deemed equivalent to a forbearance of credit.[47] In the case, petitioner alleges that the NCMB Decision dated June 20, 2017 was already executed; that pursuant thereto, petitioner paid respondent the amount of P7,548,241.70[48] on December 6, 2017;[49] and, that consequently, it should no longer be liable for the 6% legal interest. However, apart from its bare allegations, petitioner did not adduce any proof nor attach in the petition relevant documents in support thereof.[50] . . . Thus, for lack of basis, the Court sees no reason to modify the ruling of the CA insofar as the imposition of 6% legal interest is concerned. Anent the award of attorney's fees, considering that respondent was forced to litigate to protect his rights and interests, he is entitled to a reasonable amount pursuant to Article 2208(8)[52] of the Civil Code of the Philippines. The Court agrees with the NCMB and the CA that payment of attorney's fees is warranted in an amount equivalent to 10% of the total amount awarded to respondent.","WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED. The Decision dated May 6, 2019 and the Resolution dated September 12, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 152165 are AFFIRMED. SO ORDERED."

Several officials were identified as liable for the transaction, namely: 1. Libertad O. Alameda (Municipal Mayor), 2. Maria Lourdes A. Navaja (Municipal Accountant), 3. Julia R. Orcullo (Municipal Treasurer), 4. Rosenda D. Lamela (Municipal Budget Officer), 5. Edmund L. Lamela (Municipal Health Officer), 6. Abundia P. Salinas (Administrative Officer IV/HRMO Designate). Taking umbrage at the foregoing findings, petitioners Dr. Lamela, Navaja, and Municipal Budget Officer Rosenda Lamela (MBO Lamela) (collectively, petitioners) lodged an Appeal Memorandum, together with Abundia Salinas (Salinas) and Julia Orcullo (Orcullo) before the Regional Office No. XIII of the COA in Butuan City, Agusan del Norte. Au fond, they sought to set aside the ND, positing that Dr. Lamela's performance of duties and functions as MHO from September 2013 to December 2014, coupled with his numerous accomplishments, redounded to the benefit of the Municipality of San Agustin. Thence, he took on the duty of the MHO in a de facto capacity, and as such, he was legally entitled to the emoluments of the office. Ploughing through the respective postures of the parties, the COA Regional Office No. XIII rendered a Decision dated 14 December 2015, affirming the ND but ruling that Dr. Lamela was entitled to compensation based upon the equitable principle of quantum meruit, but finding Mayor Alameda, Municipal Accountant Navaja, Municipal Budget Officer Lamela and HRMO Designate Salinas liable because of their lack of due care and/or their negligence in ascertaining the validity of the appointment of Dr. Lamela. On automatic review, the COA rendered the challenged Decision, affirming the disallowance albeit modifying the disposition of the COA Regional Office in that Dr. Lamela and Orcullo were absolved from any liability. Petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration having been denied in the assailed Resolution, they now come to this Court via the present petition.","At the maelstrom of the instant Petition for Certiorari with Prayer for the Issuance of a Writ of Preliminary Injunction and/or Temporary Restraining Order under Rule 64, in relation to Rule 65, of the Rules of Court is the Decision No. 2018-350 dated 3 October 2018 of the Commission on Audit (COA), the fallo of which ordains: WHEREFORE, premises considered, Commission on Audit Regional Office No. XIII Decision No. 2015-020 dated December 14, 2015 is hereby APPROVED. Accordingly, Notice of Disallowance No. 15-001-101-(13&14) dated January 26, 2015 in the total amount of P1,248,085.69 is MODIFIED, exempting Dr. Edmund L. Lamela and Ms. Julia R. Orcullo from liability under the disallowance.","The lis mota of this instant petition boils down to the determination of whether Dr. Lamela was a de facto officer from the time his temporary appointment expired on 11 September 2013. . . Indubitably, the COA failed to quote in its entirety the second requisite laid down in Tuanda v. Sandiganbayan, i.e., there must be a color of right or general acquiescence by the public. Thus, there is nary a doubt that mere general acquiescence suffices. . . Having established that Dr. Lamela was a de facto MHO who performed the functions of the office in good faith, and actually rendered services for the benefit of the public, any payments he received in consideration therefor were valid. Whence, the government incurred no loss in making the payment, which in turn, warranted the issuance of the disallowance. . . We hew to this Court's pronouncement in Lumayna v. Commission on Audit, as reverberated in Madera v. Commission on Audit: Furthermore, granting arguendo that the municipality's budget adopted the incorrect salary rates, this error or mistake was not in any way indicative of bad faith. Under prevailing jurisprudence, mistakes committed by a public officer are not actionable, absent a clear showing that he was motivated by malice or gross negligence amounting to bad faith.","WHEREFORE, the Petition for Certiorari is hereby GRANTED. Perforce, the Decision No. 2018-350 dated 3 October 2018 and the Resolution No. 2020-291 dated 31 January 2020 of the Commission on Audit are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Notice of Disallowance No. 15-001-101-(13&14) is hereby LIFTED. Accordingly, the prayer for the injunctive relief becomes non momentum est. SO ORDERED."
"A.M. No. P-21-030 (Formerly OCA IPI No. 17-4762-P), April 05, 2022","ROWELL E. ABELLA AND RUBEN DE OCAMPO, COMPLAINANTS, VS. TEODORA P. PARFAN, COURT STENOGRAPHER III, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, BRANCH 59, LUCENA CITY, RESPONDENT.","Abella was indicted for Frustrated Homicide in a criminal case filed before the RTC, docketed as Criminal Case No. 2005-1127. De Ocampo was the father of Renato De Ocampo (Renato), the victim in the said case. Upon the instance of Presiding Judge Dinah Evangeline Bandong (Judge Bandong) of the said RTC, the parties were advised to settle their case, to which they acquiesced. Parfan, also known as ""Tita Dory,"" discussed the terms of payment with the parties. In due course, it was agreed that Abella would pay De Ocampo the aggregate amount of P72,000.00 at the rate of P5,000.00 every two months. On 18 September 2013, Abella made an initial payment of P5,000.00 inside the court's staff room. De Ocampo recalled that on 27 November 2013, he received only P4,000.00 from Abella. On 31 March 2015, Abella and De Ocampo returned to the RTC where De Ocampo received P5,000.00 from a certain court employee named ""Ed."" Abella avouched that since 18 September 2013, he had consistently remitted his payments, then totaling P40,000.00, to Parfan, who, in turn, assured him that she would deliver the money to De Ocampo. As it happened, De Ocampo and Abella discovered Parfan's clandestine acts when the former informed the latter that he only received about P14,000.00 from Parfan. Thenceforth, Parfan appeared and talked to De Ocampo, saying ""magkwentahan na lang tayo kung magkano na ang nabigay ko sa iyo (Ruben) at magkano ang naibigay sa akin ni Rowell."" Subsequently, she made herself scarce. Parfan was ordered dropped from the rolls effective 2 February 2015 for having been absent without official leave and repeatedly failed to submit a comment on the administrative complaint.",We modify the findings of the OCA and rule that Parfan is guilty of gross misconduct.,"The Court found Parfan guilty of Gross Misconduct, noting that her act was attended by elements of corruption, clear intent to violate the law, and a flagrant indifference to an established rule, given that she unlawfully used her official position as a court personnel to obtain some benefit for herself, specifically the misappropriation of Abella's payments, which is antithetical to her official duties, the rights of the complainants, and established rules. By virtue of A.M. No. 21-08-09-SC, Rule 140 of the Rules of Court finds retroactive application to this case. Under Section 22, Rule 140, as amended by A.M. No. 18-01-05-SC, Parfan's acts constitute gross misconduct, a serious charge punishable by dismissal from the service. However, in view of her supervening separation from the service, which precludes the Court from imposing the penalties of dismissal or suspension, she should be meted a fine in the amount of P105,000.00, adjusted according to A.M. No. 21-03-17-SC, which increased the imposable fine for serious charges.","WHEREFORE, respondent Teodora P. Parfan, Court Stenographer III, Regional Trial Court, Branch 59, Lucena City, is found GUILTY of Gross Misconduct. She is hereby imposed a FINE of one hundred five thousand pesos (P105,000.00) with FORFEITURE of whatever retirement benefits may be due her, except accrued leave credits, if any, and with prejudice to reemployment in any branch or instrumentality of the government, including government-owned and controlled corporations. The fine is ORDERED deducted from any remaining accrued leave benefits. Otherwise, she will be personally liable therefor, to pay the same directly to this Court. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 245938, April 05, 2022","CATTLEYA R. CAMBIL, PETITIONER, VS. KABALIKAT PARA SA MAUNLAD NA BUHAY, INC., RESPONDENT.","On May 30, 2016, Cattleya R. Cambil (petitioner) was hired by KMBI as Program Officer for Credit Group – Upper Cavite Branch on a probationary basis (May 30, 2016 to November 26, 2016). Petitioner received her employment packets including Performance Standards, Code of Ethics, and Job Description on June 2, 2016, following a one-week training.

Petitioner claimed she was terminated on July 22, 2016, after taking three days of sick leave (July 19-21, 2016) without proper notification. KMBI maintained that petitioner was terminated on August 1, 2016, due to her failure to meet the prescribed rating and standards, having received an overall rating of 67.50% on July 25, 2016, and having failed to create new centers or disburse new loans. KMBI also issued a show cause letter (July 28, 2016) for abandonment/absence without official leave, and an interoffice memo for 'Disrespect' following her verbal altercation with Branch Manager Hembrador.

The Labor Arbiter (LA) ruled on June 20, 2017, that petitioner was illegally dismissed, finding the charge of abandonment unsubstantiated due to her illness, and ordered KMBI to pay unpaid wages and salary corresponding to the unexpired portion of her contract. The NLRC affirmed the LA Decision, noting that KMBI failed to sufficiently communicate the performance evaluation criteria.

KMBI filed a Petition for Certiorari with the CA. The CA, in its Decision dated January 31, 2019, reversed and set aside the NLRC rulings. The CA found that petitioner's absence merely triggered the evaluation, and KMBI validly terminated her contract for failing to meet performance standards (67.50% rating) and complying with due process requirements.","WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED. The Decision dated January 31, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 154165 is hereby AFFIRMED.","The Court finds that the CA correctly imputed grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC when the latter ruled that petitioner was not dismissed due to her failure to qualify as a regular employee. A probationary employee may be terminated when they fail to qualify as a regular employee in accordance with reasonable standards prescribed by the employer. The LA and NLRC erred in focusing solely on the issue of abandonment and overlooking KMBI's substantiated allegations regarding petitioner's work attitude and performance, including her 67.50% overall rating and failure to create new centers or disburse loans. The termination of petitioner's probationary contract was justified due to her poor performance and negative demeanor (disrespect towards superiors, unauthorized absences). KMBI substantially complied with Section 6(d), Rule I, Book VI of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the Labor Code by apprising petitioner of the standards for regularization during her engagement and training. KMBI’s dissatisfaction with petitioner was real and in good faith, justifying her dismissal before the end of the six-month period. Consequently, the CA correctly found that the NLRC gravely abused its discretion in sustaining the LA and ordering the payment of petitioner's salary for the unexpired portion of her probationary employment.","The petition is DENIED. The Decision dated January 31, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 154165 is hereby AFFIRMED."
"G.R. No. 221978, April 04, 2022","DMCI PROJECT DEVELOPERS, INC., PETITIONER, VS. NELIA BERNADAS, NOEL BATANES, EDUARDO NONSOL, JOSE BALDE, ELMOR MABATAN, AND LILIO M. REBUENO, RESPONDENTS.","The instant case involves a certain parcel of land ( subject lot ) with an area of 16,461 square meters located in Taguig City and covered by Transfer Certificate of Title ( TCT ) No. 25491 issued to ""Honorato Lacsina married to Milagros Lacsina, Reynaldo Bonifacio Lacsina married to Evelyn Lacsina, and Renato G. Dionisio married to Corazon Platon Dionisio."" The same lot became the subject of a labor case filed with the National Labor Relations Commission ( NLRC ) instituted by Nelia Bernadas, Noel Batanes, Eduardo Nonsol, Jose Balde, Elmor Mabatan, and Lilio Rebueno ( Bernadas et al. ), entitled "" Nelia Bernadas, et al . v. Liberty Transport Corp. and/or Mr and Mrs. Honorato Lacsina ."" Eventually, the NLRC resolved the case in Bernadas et al .'s favor, prompting a Notice of Levy to be annotated on TCT No. 25491 on March 15, 2006, stating: Entry No. 5371/25491: Affecting title, rights, interests, shares and participations of the herein registered owner in the properly described, herein in accordance with the said notice, in NLRC NCR CASE NO. 00-08-04508-96 of the Department of Labor and Employment[,] National Labor Relations Commission, Quezon City, entitled NELIA BERNADAS, ET AL. -versus- LIBERTY TRANSPORT CORP. (sic), & or MR. & MRS. HONORATO - NILA (sic) LACSINA, issued by Sheriff, Ramon Nonato R. Dayao. Date of instrument: Mar. 15, 2006 Date of inscription: Mar. 3, 11:01 a.m. On April 3, 2009, an auction sale was conducted for the subject lot where Bernadas et al . emerged as the winning bidder. To reflect the sale, the Register of Deeds caused an annotation on TCT No. 25491 on June 3, 2009, thus: Entry No. 3252: CERTIFICATE OF SALE in favor of NELIA BERNADAS, EVELYN I. REBUENO, NOEL BATANES, EDUARDO NONSOL, JOSE BALDE, ELMOR MABATAN, LILIO M. REBUENO for the sum of ONE MILLION NINE HUNDRED FIFTEEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED [PESOS] (P1,915,800) in accordance with a cert. [o]f sale issued by NLRC. The period of redemption expires under the pertinent guarantee provided by law. On June 29, 2009, Bernadas et al . executed a Deed of Sale and/or Certificate of Redemption of Real Property, ceding the ownership of the subject lot to DMCI after having received the sum of P1,915,800.00, representing Bernadas' total monetary award. On the same date, Bernadas et al . likewise executed a Release and Quitclaim, discharging Honorato and Milagros Lacsina and DMCI from all liabilities arising from their instituted labor case. Thereafter, both DMCI and Bernadas et al . filed a petition before the Register of Deeds of Taguig City seeking to cancel the Notice of Levy on Execution appearing as Entry No. 5371/25491 and the Certificate of Sale on the TCT. Subsequently, Taguig Land Development Corporation ( Taguig Land ) acquired the subject lot, securing a new TCT – TCT No. 12619. Thereafter, Taguig Land transferred the subject lot to DMCI by virtue of a merger. Contrary to their previous actions, Bernadas et al . filed a Motion to Nullify the Deed of Sale and/or Certificate of Redemption of Real Property and Release and Quitclaim before the NLRC. In the motion, Bernadas et al . asserted that the Deed of Sale and/or Certificate of Redemption of Real Property and Release and Quitclaim was spurious and had been falsified. Reflective of Bernadas et al .'s intent to own the subject lot, a Sheriffs Final Deed of Sale was already issued by NLRC Sheriff Ramon Nonato P. Dayao in order to consolidate the ownership of the subject lot in their favor. In advocating for its falsity, Bernadas et al . further argued that one of the signatories, Lidfiel Marikit, had already died on January 15, 1997, long before the execution of the said documents. Similarly, Jerson Talam, also a signatory, was no longer part of the judgment and can no longer be found. Worse, Bernadas et al . claimed to have been prejudiced for not having been paid their monetary claims amounting to P1,915,800.00. In lieu thereof, they received a mere sum of P100,000.00 from collections from a surety company. As a way to stealthily collect their signatures for the Deed of Sale and/or Certificate of Redemption of Real Property and Release and Quitclaim, Bernadas et al . were made to sign a piece of paper while making them believe that it was a document representing their receipt of the P100,000.00. DMCI opposed the motion and argued that Evelyn Insilay-Rebueno ( Evelyn ), the alleged attorney-in-fact who filed the motion on behalf of Bernadas et al ., lacked the requisite authority. Since Evelyn received the monetary claims from DMCI, Bernadas et al .’s act of agency in favor of Evelyn was deemed extinguished by virtue of Article 1919 of the New Civil Code. Simply, as Evelyn had already collected Bernadas et al .'s claims, there was no need for her to act as agent on their behalf. Connectedly, DMCI insisted that the Labor Arbiter ( LA ) should dismiss the motion by virtue of the full payment and satisfaction of the judgment award in favor of Bernadas et al. On January 4, 2011, LA Antonio R. Macam issued an Order granting Bernadas et al .’s motion, thereby nullifying the Deed of Sale and/or Certificate of Redemption of Real Property and Release and Quitclaim. Therefore: ACCORDINGLY, the Motion to Nullify the Deed and/or Certificate of Redemption and the Quitclaim and Release is granted and the said documents are hereby nullified. And as prayed for, the title issued under the name of Taguig [L]and Development Corporation under TCT [N]o. 12619, is ordered cancelled and a new Transfer Certificate of Title be issued by the Registry of Deeds in favor of complainants. SO ORDERED. The LA found that DMCI had no personality to redeem the subject lot as it was not a redemptioner as contemplated under Section 11, Rule VII of the NLRC Manual on Execution of Judgment ( NLRC Manual ), which lays down specific parties and/persons entitled to redeem, to wit: a) The losing party, or his successor in interest in the whole or any part of the property; b) A creditor having a lien by attachments, judgment or mortgage on the property sold, or on some part thereof, subsequent to the judgment under which the property was sold. Such redeeming creditor is termed a redemptioner. Here, DMCI could not be considered as a successor-in-interest of the subject lot, as the property was sold on auction, the original owners being those named in TCT No. 25491, namely: ""Honorato Lacsina married to Milagros Lacsina, Reynaldo Bonifacio Lacsina married to Evelyn Lacsina, and Renato G. Dionisio married to Corazon Platon Dionisio."" The LA also cited DMCI's thwarted attempts at being declared as owner of the subject lot. It appears from the records that DMCI had already attempted to be declared as successor-in-interest by instituting a third-party claim with the NLRC, contending that it purchased the subject lot from Taguig Land. For sheer lack of evidence, and for failing to annotate TCT No. 25491 for an inordinate period of 11 years, the case was dismissed. Upon elevating the case via a petition for certiorari to the CA, the CA likewise rejected DMCI's claim of ownership in a Decision dated July 31, 2009, which became final and executory. The LA likewise held that DMCI cannot claim that it possesses a lien, judgment, or mortgage on the property sold, having only acquired the property through a merger with Taguig Land. The LA was inclined to nullify the assailed documents, as quitclaims and releases have been jurisprudentially disfavored for being contrary to public policy, citing Veloso v. Department of Labor and Employment. Undeterred, DMCI filed a Memorandum of Appeal on February 7, 2011. Regardless if it were a valid redemptioner under the NLRC Rules, it was still the rightful owner given the Deed of Sale and/or Certificate of Redemption of Real Property and Release and Quitclaim executed by Bernadas et al. in its favor. It also reiterated its previous argument that the proceedings should have been long terminated, in view of the full payment received by Bernadas et al. For their part, Bernadas et al . filed an Answer to Appeal dated March 1, 2011, praying that the January 4, 2011 Order be affirmed. Bernadas et al . asseverated that the LA was correct in ruling that DMCI has no standing to redeem, given the prevailing NLRC Rules and in view of the pending receipt of their monetary awards. On May 27, 2011, the NLRC rendered a Resolution affirming the January 4, 2011 Order issued by the LA. While DMCI averred that Evelyn lacks the requisite authority to file the motion, it appears from the records that DMCI implicitly admitted the same by continuing to participate in the proceedings. In fact, they filed an Affidavit dated July 21, 2010, reiterating their prayer to nullify the assailed documents. The NLRC likewise concluded that the theory that the case has been terminated with the payment of the judgment award is ""more of a conclusion, facts surrounding which were not sufficiently proven."" On July 19, 2011, despite DMCI seeking reconsideration, the NLRC issued an Entry of Judgment declaring that its May 27, 2011 Resolution has become final and executory. Arguing that the Entry of Judgment was premature for failure of the NLRC to rule on their pending motion for reconsideration, DMCI filed a Manifestation and Motion to Recall Entry of Judgment dated August 25, 2011. On August 25, 2011, pursuant to the Entry of Judgment, Bernadas et al ., through their attorney-in-fact, Evelyn, filed a letter-request with the Register of Deeds of Taguig City, praying that the January 4, 2011 Order of the LA be implemented and registered pursuant to the Register of Deeds' ministerial duties. To avoid any conflict involving the title to the subject lot, the Register of Deeds elevated the matter to the LRA via consulta based on the following issues: Whether or not the NLRC has the power to issue an Order for the cancellation of a title already issued in the name of Taguig Land Development Corporation; and Whether or not the order includes the cancellation of the two-third (2/3) shares of the previous owners (Reynaldo Bonifacio D. Lacsina and Renato G. Dionisio) who are not parties to the NLRC case thereby declaring their sale null and void. In a Manifestation dated January 12, 2012, DMCI asserted that the consulta to the LRA has no leg to stand on, as the Entry of Judgment dated July 19, 2011 was deemed pre-mature and, subsequently, recalled by the NLRC. DMCI also lodged a Complaint with a prayer for the issuance of a temporary restraining order and/or preliminary injunction dated November 4, 2011 before the Regional Trial Court of Pasig City, Branch 266 ( RTC ) for quieting of title, alleging that it is the true, lawful, and absolute owner of the subject lot, having acquired the same from Taguig Land under TCT No. 12619. It repeated its previous arguments that by virtue of the Deed of Sale and/or Certificate of Redemption of Real Property and Release and Quitclaim, Bernadas et al . have no claim over the subject lot. Concomitantly, their action to nullify their previous issuances are a cloud on the title of DMCI. On March 22, 2012, the NLRC issued a Resolution recalling the Entry of Judgment dated July 19, 2011 for failure to resolve DMCI's motion for reconsideration. On April 4, 2012, the NLRC denied DMCI's motion for reconsideration for its utter failure to file the said motion within the 10-day reglementary period pursuant to Section 15, Rule VII of the 2011 NLRC Rules of Procedure. Meanwhile, on April 19, 2012, the RTC granted the application for a temporary restraining order, thus enjoining Bernadas et al . from implementing the levy on execution under Entry No. 5371/25491 and Certificate of Sale (Entry No. 3252) annotated on TCT No. 25491. Then on May 16, 2012, the NLRC issued a subsequent Entry of Judgment, declaring that the April 4, 2012 Resolution has become final and executory. In the case pending with the RTC, a preliminary injunction was subsequently issued against Bernadas et al . on October 22, 2012. In granting the injunction, the RTC was convinced that between DMCI and Bernadas et al ., DMCI had clearly shown a better right over the subject lot by virtue of the evidence it proffered. Thus, there was a clear, urgent, and paramount necessity for the injunctive writ to stop Bernadas et al . from enforcing the levy on execution On October 31, 2012, DMCI filed a Manifestation with the LRA, attaching the October 22, 2012 Order of the RTC. On April 3, 2013, the LRA issued a Resolution, in Consulta No. 5208, ruling that the January 4, 2011 NLRC Order and its July 19, 2011 Entry of Judgment are registrable. On the first issue of whether the NLRC can order the cancellation of a title, the LRA relied on this Court's ruling in Tanongon v. Samson, recognizing that the NLRC possessed sufficient authority and power to execute final judgments and awards, and that third-party claims of ownership on a levied property does not necessarily prevent execution. It further found it militating against DMCI that its third-party claim of ownership over the subject lot was denied and was declared final and executory in a CA Decision dated July 31, 2009. In support of its registrability, the LRA likewise noted that the January 4, 2011 Order has been rendered final and executory, pursuant to the Entry of Judgment issued by the NLRC. Anent the second issue of whether the January 4, 2011 Order of the LA covers the whole subject lot or only a portion thereof, the LRA cited the principle observed in Armed Forces and Police Mutual Benefit Association, Inc. v. Santiago that ""as a rule, the functions of the Register of Deeds are generally regarded as ministerial and said officer has no power to pass upon the legality of an order issued by a court of justice."" Given that the whole property was subject of the levy and was eventually sold at public auction in favor of Bernadas et al ., it cannot be denied that the January 4, 2011 Order pertains to the entire property. Aggrieved, DMCI filed a Motion for Reconsideration with the LRA on May 6, 2013, which the LRA subsequently denied in an Order dated September 26, 2013, in view of the May 16, 2012 Entry of Judgment. DMCI elevated the matter to the CA via a Petition for Review under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court, maintaining that the LRA gravely erred in ruling that the January 4, 2011 Order of the LA is registrable and emphasizing that the Entry of Judgment dated July 19, 2011 was recalled. It contended that, given such recall and the absence of a writ of execution, the basis for registration ceased to exist. Moreover, while the Entry of Judgment was later reinstated on May 16, 2012, there was nothing in the ruling that would suggest that such entry had been reinstated. In a Decision dated June 5, 2015, the CA denied the petition, disposing in this wise: WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the Petition for Review is DENIED. The Resolution dated April 3, 2013 and Order dated September 26, 2013, rendered by the Land Registration Authority (LRA) in Consulta No. 5208, are AFFIRMED. SO ORDERED. In denying the petition, the CA reasoned that the NLRC's second Entry of Judgment issued on May 16, 2012 was a supervening event that rendered the issue before it moot and academic. It explained that while the LRA did not mention the reinstatement of the July 19, 2011 Entry of Judgment, the fact that the same was subsequently issued by the NLRC leaves nothing more for the appellate court to resolve. In the first place, the instant petition should already be struck down in light of the doctrine of immutability of judgments, under which decisions that have already acquired finality cannot be modified or altered in any respect. Lastly, assuming arguendo that the LRA erred in its consulta, it was afforded the opportunity to correct its mistake when it denied DMCI's motion for reconsideration on the basis of the May 16, 2012 Entry of Judgment. DMCI moved for reconsideration, which the CA denied in a Resolution dated December 15, 2015. Hence, this present petition.","assailing the June 5, 2015 Decision and the December 15, 2015 Resolution of the Court of Appeals ( CA ) in CA-G.R. SP No. 132268. The assailed Decision affirmed the April 3, 2013 Resolution and the September 26, 2013 Order of the Land Registration Authority ( LRA ) in Consulta No. 5208.","This Court is not persuaded. In determining the significance of a writ of execution in enforcing orders of the NLRC, the NLRC Manual shall govern any question regarding the execution of a judgment of that body. It is well settled that regular courts have no jurisdiction to hear and decide questions arising from and are incidental to the enforcement of decisions, orders, or awards rendered in labor cases by officers and tribunals of the Department of Labor and Employment. The Rules of Court shall then only apply by analogy or in a suppletory character. ... The LRA, in Consulta No. 5208, did not mention dispensing with the requirement of the writ. In other words, the consulta was not positioned to do away with the writ of execution. To be precise, it merely declared that the January 4, 2011 Order, together with the July 19, 2011 Entry of Judgment, was registrable. Stated differently, the consulta merely pronounced the state of the property as registrable; it by no means actually enabled the Order, or more appropriately, the subject lot, to be registered in favor of the respondents. Such distinction was well-identified by the CA in its Resolution dated December 15, 2015, thus: In this regard, petitioner needs to be reminded that ""registrability"" and actual registration of real estate are very distinct concepts. A declaration that a property is registrable refers to the fact that a party may register the same in his or her name while registration refers to the act itself. In the instant case, the LRA merely declared the property to be registrable and did not refer to the actual cancellation of petitioner's title thereto, as directed in the Labor Arbiter's order affirmed by the NLRC. Thus, this Court cannot give merit to petitioner's contention that a writ of execution is required before the property can be declared registrable as the directive which requires such writ is one of cancellation of petitioner's title and not the mere declaration of registrability. ... Upon scouring the records, it appears that the petitioner committed a procedural infraction in belatedly filing an appeal via a petition with the CA. Petitioner manifestly admits that upon receipt of the consulta, it filed a motion for reconsideration with the LRA on May 6, 2013 and a supplement to the same on August 18, 2013. Thereafter, petitioner received a copy of the Resolution of the LRA denying its motion on October 4, 2013. Thus, petitioner had 15 days from October 4, 2013, or until October 19, 2013, to seek further recourse. However, it was only on October 31, 2013, or 11 days past the prescribed reglementary period, that its petition was filed. In petitioner's case, no explanation was advanced; neither did it even provide the slightest justification for its procedural missteps. Given the transgressions of petitioner, the Register of Deeds, pursuant to its ministerial duty, was bound by the ruling in Consulta No. 5208 of the LRA to register the January 4, 2011 Order and the Entry of Judgment dated July 19, 2011. While the previous Entry of Judgment was recalled and a second Entry was subsequently issued on May 16, 2012, the LRA rectified such error that may be attributed to it by recognizing the second Entry of Judgment in its Order dated September 26, 2013, which also denied petitioner's motion for reconsideration. After all, a scrutiny of the records will prove that no such significant difference exists between the July 19, 2011 Entry of Judgment vis-à-vis the May 16, 2012 Entry of Judgment, considering that no other inequitable or otherwise improvident event or condition arose that would warrant a reversal of the NLRC Decision. ... Apart from the non-perfection of petitioner's appeal, this Court cannot close its eyes to the Entry of Judgment dated May 16, 2012, which renders the January 4, 2011 Order final and executory, thus, immutable and unalterable. Thus, this Court shall not belabor the point of discussing the implications of the LA's Order dated June 19, 2015, emanating from the proceedings in the original case entitled ' Nelia Bernadas et al. v. Liberty Transport Corp. and/or Mr. and Mrs. Honorato Lacsina .' Foremost is the principle that 'a decision that has attained finality becomes the law of the case regardless of any claim that it is erroneous. Any amendment or alteration which substantially affects a final and executory judgment is null and void for lack of jurisdiction, including the entire proceedings held for that purpose.' ... Nevertheless, even if this Court were to indulge petitioner, its arguments deserve scant consideration given the July 31, 2009 Decision of the CA, dismissing its claim of ownership over the subject lot, which it insists was acquired from Taguig Land. This Court notes that such Decision lapsed into finality pursuant to an Entry of Judgment dated September 3, 2009. It also goes without saying that the finality of the July 31, 2009 Decision would belie yet another claim of ownership by petitioner in its pending action for quieting of title before the RTC.","WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the instant petition is DENIED. The Decision dated June 5, 2015 and the Resolution dated December 15, 2015 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 132268, affirming the April 3, 2013 Resolution and the September 26, 2013 Order of the Land Registration Authority in Consulta No. 5208, are AFFIRMED.

"G.R. No. 230735, April 04, 2022","EDGARDO M. PAGLINAWAN, PETITIONER, VS. DOHLE PHILMAN AGENCY, INC., AND/OR DOHLE-IOM (LIMITED) AND/OR MANOLO T. GACUTAN, RESPONDENTS.","This case arose from a complaint[7] for the recovery of permanent and total disability benefits, sickness allowance, and attorney's fees, filed by petitioner against respondents. Petitioner averred that Dohle employed him as engine and deck fitter for and in behalf of foreign principal Dohle-IOM (Limited) on board the vessel MN Tamina.[8] He signed the contract of employment on March 19, 2013, which was approved by the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) on the same day.[9] In the course of his employment, he was constantly exposed to dust and chemicals.[10] He performed strenuous tasks from time to time.[11] His daily work hours extended up to the late hours of the night, causing tremendous strain and fatigue.[12] Extreme varying temperature (as he moved from the hot engine room to the cold engine control room and vice versa), harsh sea weather conditions, frequent adjustment to different time zones, and homesickness, likewise contributed to his stressful life on board the vessel.[13] Sometime in July 2013, petitioner suffered loose bowel movement and bloody stool.[14] On August 11, 2013, he was brought and admitted to Hospital Velmar in Mexico City.[15] He underwent laboratory examinations and CT scan. There was a note of mass from the rectal margin, which, after biopsy, showed diffuse lymphoid hyperplasia.[16] He was discharged on August 18, 2013 and was subsequently medically repatriated.[17] Upon repatriation, petitioner was referred to [Marine Medical Services] Metropolitan Medical Center for treatment under the care of the company-designated physician.[18] He underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and was diagnosed with lower gastro intestinal bleeding secondary to ulcerative colitis; iron deficiency anemia; cholelithiasis; s/p laparoscopic cholecystectomy.[19] Despite the treatment, petitioner maintained that he was not restored to his prior health status.[20] Thus, he sought the opinion of Dr. Bonifacio Q. Flores and of Dr. Rommel F. Galvez (Dr. Galvez), an Internist-Cadiologist; Dr. Galvez opined that petitioner was unfit in any capacity to work as a seafarer.[21] Petitioner thus sought payment of disability benefits from Dohle, but to no avail,[22] resulting to the filing of the instant complaint. Respondents had the same narration of events up to the point of petitioner's medical repatriation.[23] Respondents aver that after arrival, petitioner was referred to the company-designated physicians at Marine Medical Services Metropolitan Medical Center under the medical coordination of Dr. Robert D. Lim (Dr. Lim).[24] Petitioner was initially examined and was subsequently referred to a gastroenterologist and surgeon.[25] The specialists recommended that petitioner be admitted for closer monitoring and further tests; petitioner then underwent laboratory examinations, CT scan, and rectal biopsy.[26] On September 16, 2013, petitioner was diagnosed with lower gastro intestinal bleeding secondary to ulcerative colitis; iron deficiency anemia; cholelithiasis; s/p laparoscopic cholecystectomy.[27] The company-designated physician also opined that petitioner's diagnosed illnesses are not work-related.[28] Subsequently, petitioner was again admitted at the hospital for laparoscopic cholecystectomy.[29] He was declared unfit for sea duties for a period of approximately three months.[30] The medical certificate dated September 27, 2013 issued by the company-designated physician states that petitioner's ulcerative colitis and the secondary illnesses are not work-related.[31] Due to the absence of work-relation, respondents terminated petitioner's further medical treatment, and paid him sickness allowance.[32]","This petition for review on certiorari[1] assails the December 14, 2016 Decision[2] and March 21, 2017 Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 141363, which affirmed the March 3, 2015 Decision[4] and May 25, 2015 Resolution[5] of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC). The NLRC reversed and set aside the December 29, 2014 Decision[6] of the Labor Arbiter (LA) that ordered respondents Dohle Philman Agency, Inc. (Dohle), Dohle-IOM (Limited), and Manolo T. Gacutan to pay petitioner Edgardo M. Paglinawan permanent total disability compensation and attorney's fees.","The petition lacks merit. The Court affirms the ruling of the CA. Petitioner is not entitled to permanent disability benefits. Pursuant to its mandate of securing the ""best terms and conditions of employment of Filipino contract workers,"" as well as promoting and protecting ""the well-being of Filipino workers overseas,"" the POEA formulated the standard employment contract for seafarers.[69] The POEA-SEC is deemed incorporated to petitioner's employment contract, and it governs his claim for permanent disability benefits.[70]... In the instant case, it is undisputed that petitioner's illness, ulcerative colitis, is not listed as an occupational disease in the 2010 POEA-SEC. Thus, there is a disputable presumption that it is work-related. Petitioner, however, still bears the burden and must still prove by substantial evidence the reasonable causal connection between his ulcerative colitis and the nature of his work as engine and deck fitter. In this regard, he failed. The Court agrees with the CA that petitioner failed to prove by substantial evidence the work-relatedness of his illness. Records do not show how his work in the vessel caused the development of his illness. There is no evidence of the link or relatedness between the illness and his work. Petitioner merely relied on bare allegations that the work conditions and diet onboard made him sick. It is settled that awards of disability compensation cannot be based on mere general averments or speculations.[78] The same analysis applies to the allegation that his illness was work-aggravated.[79]... On the other hand, the company-designated physician issued a medical report dated September 27, 2013, which clearly stated that petitioner's illness is not work-related.[80] The report of a company-designated physician is binding when not refuted by the seafarer's physician of own choice and a third doctor.[81] Petitioner failed to present a contrary medical opinion. The CA found that his availment of a second physician was belated — he consulted a second physician only after he filed the complaint for disability benefits. Further, the NLRC and appellate court found that petitioner's appointed physician, in rendering his certification, did not personally examine or diagnose petitioner; thus, his certification is not reflective of petitioner's actual condition.[82] Hence, it is proper to rely on the company-designated physician's report that petitioner's illness is not work-related. Considering the lack of substantial evidence from petitioner's side and the great weight accorded to the company-designated physician's medical report, denial of disability benefits is only proper. In this connection, the Court likewise agrees that petitioner's claim is premature. ... Relevant to the instant case is item (f), which provides that the cause of action accrues when the company-designated physician issues a finding that the seafarer's illness is not work-related, but the physician of choice and a third doctor found otherwise that the seafarer is unfit to work. As stated, the company-designated physician in this case has issued a medical certification that petitioner's illness is not work-related. However, petitioner did not have the required contrary opinion as he only availed of a second opinion after he filed the complaint. ... The Court likewise notes that the 120-day rule is immaterial to this case. The company-designated physician rendered a final assessment on September 27, 2013, which is well within 120 days from petitioner's medical repatriation on August 20, 2013.[93] In sum, the Court finds that petitioner is not entitled to disability benefits for his failure to timely procure a second physician's opinion, and for failing to show that his illness is work-related or work-aggravated.","WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED. The December 14, 2016 Decision and March 21, 2017 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 141363 are AFFIRMED. SO ORDERED."

Later that day, she angrily returned, attempted to strike Pedroche with a stapler, and cursed him, wishing death upon him and his family. Respondent also refused to hand over her stenographic notes to Pedroche. Respondent had previously received six (6) Memoranda from Judge Gandia-Asuncion between 2014 and 2017 for various infractions, including refusal to follow orders, arrogant and offensive words, and disrespectful behavior. Respondent consistently refused to receive these memoranda, in one instance crumpling and tearing apart the Memorandum dated April 28, 2016.

"A.C. No. 11304, June 28, 2022","LEONARDO L. SARMIENTO AND RICHARD G. HALILI, COMPLAINANTS, VS. ATTY. GREGORIO C. FERNANDO, JR., A.K.A. JERRY FERNANDO, RESPONDENT.","Complainants are business associates engaged in buying, developing and selling real estate. In 2013, they came to know of respondent during a meet-up set up by one of their broker friends.[2] During the meet-up, respondent proposed the sale to the complainants of a 374-square meter parcel of land (subject land), located in Parañaque City and covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 68952.[3] In order to entice the complainants to push through with such sale, respondent made the following representations: He is the absolute owner of the subject land. This is true even though TCT No. 68952 was still in the name of his parents—i.e., the spouses Gregorio and Natividad Fernando. His parents already conveyed the subject land to him by virtue of a Special Power of Attorney (SPA)[4] dated 14 April 2012. Only an SPA was executed to effect the conveyance in order to avoid payment of taxes for the transfer from his parents to him, and another payment of taxes from him to his buyer.[5] Both his parents are still alive, and their signatures in the SPA are genuine.[6] He is the sole heir of his parents. Hence, no other person will make a claim of ownership over the subject land that is contrary to his.[7] Persuaded by the foregoing representations, the complainants agreed to purchase the subject land for P3,740,000.00. To evidence the agreement, a Deed of Absolute Sale[8] (deed of sale) was executed between the respondent, as the supposed attorney-in-fact of his parents Gregorio and Natividad Fernando, on one hand, and Sylvia Sarmiento (Sylvia), the wife of complainant Leonardo Sarmiento, on the other. Subsequently, TCT No. 68952 in the name of the spouses Gregorio and Natividad Fernando was cancelled and replaced by TCT No. 010-2013000507[9] in the name of Sylvia. Not long after, however, a complaint seeking the nullification of the SPA, Deed of Sale and TCT No. 010-2013000507 was brought before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Parañaque City against Sylvia, complainant Leonardo Sarmiento and the respondent. The complaint, which was docketed as Civil Case No. 14-040, was filed by no other than respondent's mother Natividad Fernando and the heirs of respondent's father Gregorio Fernando. In Civil Case No. 14-040, the complainants learned of the falsity of respondent's representations, to wit: Respondent is not the absolute owner of the subject land, and the same was never conveyed to him. The SPA dated 14 April 2012, upon which respondent bases his claim of ownership, is falsified. Gregorio Fernando could not have signed the SPA since the latter already died as of April 4, 1997, as evidenced by a Certificate of Death[10] issued by the County of Contra Costa in California. On the other hand, the forgery of Natividad Fernando's signature in the SPA is made apparent from a comparison between such signature and the latter's legitimate signature as appearing in her Office of the Senior Citizen Affair (OSCA) card.[11] Respondent is not the only heir of his parents. He has no less than four (4) living siblings, namely Samuel, Clifford, Mildred and Rene Fernando. Samuel, Clifford and Mildred, along with Natividad Fernando, even designated Rene as their attorney-in-fact in prosecuting Civil Case No. 14-040.[12] Hence, to preserve TCT No. 010-2013000507 and to put an end to Civil Case No. 14-040, Sylvia and complainant Leonardo Sarmiento were constrained to enter into a settlement with Natividad Fernando and the heirs of Gregorio Fernando for P2,992,000.00. The complainants equally shared the burden of paying the settlement amount. The settlement was eventually approved by the RTC in an Order[13] dated 4 November 2014. The complainants demanded reimbursement of the P2,992,000.00 settlement amount from the respondent, but the latter ignored the same. Prejudiced by the turn of events, the complainants filed two (2) cases against the respondent: an estafa complaint,[14] docketed as NPS Docket No. XV-08-INV-15A00026, before the Office of the City Prosecutor (OCP) of Muntinlupa City, and the instant disbarment petition, docketed as CBD Case No. 15-4471, before the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP).[15] . . . In a Report and Recommendation[33] dated 2 June 2015, the IBP-CBD recommended the disbarment of the respondent based on the following findings and ratiocinations: The evidence submitted by the complainants sufficiently established that[:] a) the Special Power of Attorney allegedly executed by respondent's parents in April 2012 at Mayantoc, Tarlac, was a forgery. Respondent's father died already in 1997, and respondent's mother's signature thereon was not hers; b) the Deed of Sale in question was executed by the respondent purportedly in his capacity as attorney-in-fact of his parents, who were the registered co-owners of the subject parcel of land in San Dionisio, Parañaque City, Metro Manila; as indicated earlier, respondent was not an attorney-in-fact of his parents; c) respondent received and pocketed the [P]3,740,000.00 paid by the buyers of the subject parcel of land; d) the buyers of the subject parcel of land, when sued by respondent's mother and siblings for the recovery of the subject parcel of land, paid an extra [P]2,992,000.00 to respondent's mother and siblings so that the earlier sale of the subject parcel of land to them (buyers) will be honored and respected by the true owners thereof; respondent refused to return to the buyers of the subject parcel of land this [P]2,992,000.00 in spite of proper demands therefor.",The Court adopts the recommendation of the IBP-CBD and IBP-BOG.,"The evidence on record is damning against the respondent. Taken together, the complainants' evidence engendered reasonable conclusions that the SPA dated 14 April 2012 was falsified, and that respondent used such falsified SPA, along with other deceitful representations, in order to sell and profit from a property that he knew was not his or his to sell. Worse, as the established facts disclose that he was the only one who benefited from his use of the falsified SPA, respondent may also be presumed to have been the material author of the falsification himself.[36] Respondent, on the other hand, was unable to repudiate the evidence against him. We fail to see how the existence of an SPA dated 22 December 2002, or of any other prior SPA for that matter, can prove that the SPA dated 14 April 2012—the very deed he used to convince the complainants to push through with the purchase of the subject land—was genuine. Even assuming the existence of previous SPAs in respondent's favor, the fact remains that the SPA dated 14 April 2012 was still executed after the death of Gregorio Fernando in 1997 and, just the same, bears the forged signature of Natividad Fernando. Neither could respondent's attack against the personality of the complainants to file the present administrative case be given serious consideration. Contrary to respondent's assertion, the complainants did not perjure when they stated in their petition's verification/certification that they did not commence any other action or proceeding involving the same issues in any other form. The reason is obvious. Though they may be based on the same facts, the preliminary investigation for estafa initiated by the complainants is distinct from and does not involve the same issues as the present administrative case. The purpose of the preliminary investigation proceedings is the determination of whether there is probable cause to file a criminal indictment against the respondent for estafa, while the issue underlying this administrative case is whether the respondent may be administratively sanctioned as a lawyer. Hence, the complainants' mere filing of an estafa complaint against the respondent cannot, as it did not, preclude them from instituting disciplinary proceedings against the respondent.[37] It is indubitable that respondent's actions constitute gross violations of Rules 1.01 and 7.03 of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR), viz: RULE 1.01 A lawyer shall not engage in unlawful, dishonest, immoral or deceitful conduct. x x x x RULE 7.03 A lawyer shall not engage in conduct that adversely reflects on his fitness to practice law, nor shall he, whether in public or private life, behave in a scandalous manner to the discredit of the legal profession. . . . With the foregoing disquisitions, the Court thus finds the penalty of disbarment proper in this case, as recommended by Commissioner De Mesa and the IBP Board of Governors. x x x The respondent deserves the same fate. As said, respondent's employment of deceit and use of a forged SPA to gain personal wealth at the expense of the complainants was well substantiated by the evidence. The evidence on record too left no doubt that respondent's dishonest actions inflicted, not only grave inconvenience to his own mother and siblings who were forced to file a suit just to undo what he had done, but also tremendous prejudice to the complainants who practically had to pay for the subject land twice over. Yet, despite all these, respondent made no attempt to right his wrongs, and showed absolutely no remorse. Indeed, he even failed to appear at the hearing set for the present administrative case in clear disobedience to the IBP-CBD's order. Like the lawyer in Brennisen, respondent exhibited his unfitness to remain a member of the legal profession. Respondent showed himself unworthy of the privilege to practice law.","WHEREFORE, the Court finds respondent Atty. Gregorio C. Fernando, Jr. a.k.a. Jerry C. Fernando GUILTY of gross violations of Canon 1, Rule 1.01 and Canon 7 of Rule 7.03 of the Code of Professional Responsibility.

Respondent Atty. Fabian A. Gappi was their counsel but failed to attend a single scheduled hearing. Respondent did not submit any position paper on 11 March 2014, the deadline for submission. When complainants asked respondent to withdraw as counsel, he prepared a document that they discovered spoke not of his withdrawal as counsel but rather the withdrawal by complainants of their illegal dismissal complaint, which complainants did not sign. Because of respondent's failure to file a position paper, the illegal dismissal complaint was dismissed by the LA in a Decision dated 7 April 2014. Furthermore, respondent failed to file an answer to the administrative complaint as required by the IBP-CBD, failed to appear during the mandatory conferences (except for the complainants in one instance), and failed to file his verified position paper.","The Court adopts the findings and recommendation of the IBP-CBD, as modified by the IBP-BOG, finding respondent guilty of violations of Rule 1.01 of Canon 1, Canon 11, and Rule 18.03 of Canon 18 of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR). The IBP-BOG's modifications included increasing the period of suspension from the practice of law to three (3) years, and adding a fine in the amount of P15,000.00 against the respondent for his failure to attend the mandatory conference and to file the required pleadings before the IBP-CBD.","The established facts show that respondent, as counsel, failed to appear in any scheduled hearing and failed to file a position paper, leading to the dismissal of the illegal dismissal complaint—actions that speak of respondent's gross negligence and gross inefficiency in the performance of his duty as counsel (Rule 18.03 of Canon 18). Respondent also tried to deceive complainants when he presented for their signature a document that stipulated their withdrawal of their illegal dismissal complaint instead of merely formalizing his withdrawal as counsel, testifying to his dishonesty (Rule 1.01 of Canon 1). His willful disregard for Court orders and failure to attend hearings reflects disrespect (Canon 11). Furthermore, his failure to comply with the IBP-CBD directives constitutes clear infractions of Canons 11 and 12 of the CPR. Applying the precedent of Olvida vs. Gonzales, the combination of gross negligence and dishonesty warrants the three-year suspension.","WHEREFORE, the Court finds respondent Atty. Fabian A. Gappi GUILTY of violations of Rule 1.01 of Canon 1, Canon 11, and Rule 18.03 of Canon 18 of the Code of Professional Responsibility.

"G.R. No. 211299, June 28, 2022","LIGHT RAIL TRANSIT AUTHORITY, PETITIONER, VS. CITY OF PASAY, REPRESENTED BY THE CITY TREASURER AND THE CITY ASSESSOR, RESPONDENT.","From 1985 to 2001, the City of Pasay (City) assessed the Light Rail Transit Authority (LRTA) of real estate taxes on its properties consisting of lands, buildings, machineries, carriageways, and passenger terminal stations. LRTA admitted its tax liabilities and proposed to pay them on installment basis. It even requested for condonation of penalties on its arrears. [4] However, LRTA failed to settle its outstanding obligations despite repeated demands from the City, which later issued a notice of delinquency with warrants of levy. Aggrieved, LRTA filed a Petition for Certiorari, Prohibition and Mandamus [5] against the City, questioning its assessments before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Pasay, docketed as R-PSY-12-09347-CV. [6] Citing the 2006 case of Manila International Airport Authority v. Court of Appeals [7] ( 2006 MIAA Case ), LRTA claimed that it is a government instrumentality exempt from local taxation. It is operating the light rail transit system for the Republic of the Philippines, which is the true owner of the subject real properties. It also invoked the ruling in Ty v. Trampe [8] ( Ty ), which permitted immediate resort to judicial action without exhaustion of administrative remedies. [9]","On October 8, 2013, the CA denied [16] the appeal of LRTA and affirmed the RTC ruling in toto, finding that LRTA has not exhausted all administrative remedies, and that it should not be extended a similar tax exemption accorded to the Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA) in the 2006 MIAA Case. The CA held that LRTA was already found to be a taxable entity pursuant to the case of LRTA v. Central Board of Assessment Appeals ( 2000 LRTA Case ). [17] The fallo of the CA Decision reads: FOR THESE REASONS, the appeal is DENIED. SO ORDERED. [18]","To summarize, under Section 2(10) and (13) of the Introductory Provisions of the Administrative Code, which governs the legal relation and status of government units, agencies and offices within the entire government machinery, LRTA is a government instrumentality, and not a GOCC. Under Section 133(o) of the LGC, LRTA as a government instrumentality is not a taxable person because it is not subject to ""[t]axes, fees or charges of any kind"" by local governments. The only exception is when LRTA grants the beneficial use of its real property to a ""taxable person"" as provided in Section 234(a) of the LGC, in which case, the specific real property leased becomes subject to real property tax, which must be paid by the ""taxable person"" as stressed by J. Caguioa. Thus, only portions of the LRT leased to taxable persons like private parties are subject to real property tax by the City. Under Article 420 of the Civil Code, the rail roads and terminals of the LRT, being devoted to public use, are properties of public dominion and thus owned by the State or the Republic of the Philippines. Article 420, while not specifically mentioning ""rail roads"" or ""rail road tracks,"" allow for the inclusion of properties of a similar character. LRT rail roads, which necessarily include its terminals, are of a similar character to public roads, as both are devoted for public use and both facilitate transportation through certain vehicles. In any event, the LRT is owned by the State through the LRTA, as its agent, and is definitely intended for some public service, which is to provide mass transportation to the people to alleviate the traffic and transportation situation in Metro Manila. Therefore, being properties of public dominion owned by the Republic, there is no doubt that the LRT rail roads and terminals are expressly exempt from real estate tax under Section 234(a) of the LGC, subject to the rule discussed above, and are not subject to execution or foreclosure sale.","WHEREFORE, the Petition is GRANTED. The October 8, 2013 Decision and the January 29, 2014 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 129922, are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Accordingly, We DECLARE: 1. Petitioner Light Rail Transit Authority properties that are actually, solely and exclusively devoted for public use, consisting of the LRT rail roads and terminals, and the lots on which they are situated, EXEMPT from real property tax imposed by the City of Pasay. Consequentially, the City of Pasay is PROHIBITED from imposing any further similar tax. 2. VOID all the real property tax assessments, as well as the warrants of levy, issued by the City of Pasay, on petitioner's properties, except the assessment covering the portions that petitioner has leased to private parties, who are liable to pay the corresponding real property tax. 3. VOID the subsequent public auction over any of petitioner's exempt properties, and any act of disposition made by the City of Pasay of such exempt properties. We likewise declare VOID the corresponding Certificates of Sale or Conveyance issued by the City of Pasay. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 258435, June 28, 2022","NORMAN CORDERO MARQUEZ, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, RESPONDENT.","On October 1, 2021, Marquez filed a Certificate of Candidacy[3] for Senator in the 2022 National and Local Elections. Acting thereon, the COMELEC Law Department motu proprio filed a petition[4] to declare Marquez as a nuisance candidate, thus: 15. In the present Petition, [Marquez] filed the COC to put the election process in mockery or disrepute, and as gleaned from the said circumstance or act, [Marquez] has no bona fide intention to run for the office for which the COC was filed and thus prevent a faithful determination of the true will of the electorate. 16. A candidate of a national position should be publicly known by numerous voters. It bears stressing, however, that [Marquez] is not virtually known to the entire country except possibly in the locality where he resides. 17. Also, in entry No. 3 of the COC, [Marquez] stated that he was running for Senator without being officially nominated by any political party. Although a political party nomination is not a guarantee of a candidate's capability to launch a nationwide campaign, running as an independent candidate or without the support of a political party further decreases a candidate's chances for such a rigorous campaign, as there will be no political party to support him. [5] [Marquez] does not appear to have a genuine intention to run for public office. He does not have a nationwide network or organization of supporters to assist him during the campaign so that he may be known nationally within the short campaign period. Neither does he appear to be personally capable of persuading a substantial number of voters from different parts of the country. x x x In his Answer,[6] Marquez asserted he was not a nuisance candidate. He denied filing his COC as Senator supposedly without any bona fide intention to run for office. He claimed he had been actively campaigning all over the Philippines for about five (5) years already as an advocate of animal welfare and co-founder of Baguio Animal Welfare, Cordillera to the Rest of the Philippines, and had extended free legal assistance nationwide.[8] By Resolution[13] dated December 13, 2021, the COMELEC First Division declared Marquez a nuisance candidate and subsequently canceled his COC.[14] The COMELEC En Banc denied reconsideration under Resolution[19] dated January 3, 2022. Marquez filed a Petition for Certiorari challenging these dispositions. In the interim, Marquez sought the issuance of a Writ of Injunction and/or Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) to enjoin the COMELEC from implementing its Resolutions dated December 13, 2021 and January 3, 2022.[26] By Resolution[29] dated January 19, 2022, the Court issued a TRO, effective immediately. Thereafter, Marquez filed subsequent letters and motions asserting that the COMELEC proceeded with the printing of the ballots, without including his name.","First off, the petition has become moot with the conclusion of the 2022 National and Local Elections and the proclamation as senators-elect of the top 12 senatorial candidates receiving the highest number of votes. But despite the mootness of a case, the Court may still render a decision if it finds that: (a) there is a grave violation of the Constitution; (2) the case involves a situation of exceptional character and is of paramount public interest; (3) the issues raised require the formulation of controlling principles to guide the Bench, the Bar and the public; and (4) the case is capable of repetition yet evading review.[51] Just like in the first foray of Marquez against the COMELEC in Marquez v. COMELEC,[52] we find his situation here to be one capable of repetition, yet, evading review. x x x We disagree [with the COMELEC]. While the COMELEC, in this instance, has cited an apparently different ground to declare Marquez a nuisance candidate, that is, he is ""virtually not known to the entire country""[57] and has no political party to help him become known, these circumstances are closely intertwined to the ground previously used against him in Marquez v. COMELEC, i.e., that he had no financial capacity to wage a nationwide campaign. The COMELEC is merely referring to it by another name. x x x [T]he attempt of the COMELEC to pass off the inability of Marquez to wage an election campaign as an indication of lack of bona fide intent to run for office is unconstitutional and will not be allowed by the Court. For what cannot be done directly, cannot be done indirectly. Another. The COMELEC unfairly shifted to Marquez the burden of proving his genuine intention to run for office. x x x In fine, the so-called nuisance status of Marquez, although apparently grounded on his supposed absence of bona fide intent to run for public office, actually hinged on his perceived lack of capacity to wage a successful election campaign. . . . Finally. The COMELEC insists that Marquez is not virtually known to the entire country except possibly in the locality where he resides. Assuming this to be true, it does not, standing alone, suffice to declare one a nuisance candidate. In fact, it is not among the grounds for declaration of a nuisance candidate enumerated in Section 69 of the Omnibus Election Code. We now tackle the prayer of Marquez ""to make the COMELEC suffer the pain of contempt of Court""[83] because it ""brazenly and contumaciously exhibited contempt""[84] and ""[was] bold enough to defy the Court""[85] in proceeding with its election preparations despite the Court's issuance of a TRO. Here, the COMELEC has sufficiently demonstrated that it was not impelled by a desire to disrespect the authority of the Court when it proceeded with election preparations despite our issuance of a TRO. Rather, it only sought to ensure that the 2022 National and Local Elections would take place on the second Monday of May—the time appointed by the 1987 Constitution.","ACCORDINGLY, the petition is PARTLY GRANTED. The Resolution dated December 13, 2021 of the COMELEC First Division in SPA Case No. 21-056(DC)(MP) and the Resolution dated January 3, 2022 of the COMELEC En Banc are NULLIFIED. The prayer of Marquez for the inclusion of his name in all the official ballots as a candidate for Senator for the May 2022 National and Local Elections is DECLARED MOOT. The prayer ""to make the COMELEC suffer the pain of contempt of Court"" because it ""brazenly and contumaciously exhibited contempt"" and ""[was] bold enough to defy the Court"" in proceeding with its election preparations despite the Court's issuance of a TRO is DENIED. To avoid a recurrence of similar incidents in the future, the COMELEC is strongly urged to adopt a practicable plan or timeline to ensure that all cases which may result in the exclusion of a candidate from the ballot are resolved at the earliest possible time.

Christian B. Buenafe, Fides M. Lim, Ma. Edeliza P. Hernandez, Celia Lagman Sevilla, Roland C. Vibal, and Josephine Lascano filed before the COMELEC a Petition to Deny Due Course to or Cancel the COC of respondent Marcos, Jr. under Section 78, in relation to Section 74, Article IX of Batas Pambansa Blg. (BP) 881, or the Omnibus Election Code (OEC). Subsequently, on 20 November 2021, petitioners Bonifacio Parabuac Ilagan, et al. filed before the COMELEC a Petition for Disqualification of respondent Marcos, Jr. under Section 12, Article I of the OEC. Both petitions referred to the same set of criminal cases for the violation of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1977, as amended (1977 NIRC), involving respondent Marcos, Jr. for failure to file his income tax returns for the years 1982, 1983, 1984, and 1985. The Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 105 (RTC) initially found Marcos, Jr. guilty, imposing imprisonment and fines. The Court of Appeals (CA) Decision dated 31 October 1997 modified this, acquitting him of non-payment but finding him guilty of failure to file ITRs, imposing only fines and payment of deficiency income taxes. The dispositive portion did not include imprisonment or perpetual disqualification. This decision became final upon Entry of Judgment on 31 August 2001. The COMELEC Second Division (SPA No. 21-156) denied the cancellation petition, finding no false material representation or intent to deceive, and that perpetual disqualification did not apply. The COMELEC Former First Division (SPA No. 21-212) dismissed the disqualification petition, finding no moral turpitude, no sentence over 18 months, and no perpetual disqualification imposed. These resolutions were affirmed by the COMELEC En Banc. The National Elections proceeded on 09 May 2022, as scheduled. Respondent Marcos, Jr. garnered 31,629,783 votes, or 58.77% of the votes cast and was proclaimed as the winning presidential candidate on 25 May 2022. Petitioners subsequently filed the consolidated petitions before the Supreme Court seeking to annul the COMELEC resolutions.","The consolidated petitions are DISMISSED.

Respondent Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. possesses all the qualifications and none of the disqualifications to run for president. Furthermore, his Certificate of Candidacy (COC) contains no false material representation and is, therefore, valid. x x x respondent Marcos, Jr.'s failure to file income tax returns does not involve moral turpitude. x x x The CA's Decision imposing only the penalty of a fine is valid: Consequently, respondent Marcos, Jr. cannot be disqualified on the ground that he was sentenced by final judgment to a penalty of more than eighteen months under Section 12 of the OEC. x x x This Court thus holds that, unless explicitly provided for in the fallo, the penalty of disqualification from public office under Section 286(c) is not deemed automatically imposed on a public officer or employee found to have violated the provisions of the 1977 NIRC.","WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the Petitions in G.R.

"G.R. No. 205275, June 28, 2022","MAMERTO AUSTRIA, PETITIONER, VS. AAA AND BBB, RESPONDENTS.","In 2006, the Regional Trial Court (RTC) convicted Mamerto Austria (Mamerto), a school teacher, of five counts of acts of lasciviousness committed against private complainants, both 11-year-old female students. Mamerto moved for reconsideration. Meantime, the trial judge handling the criminal cases was promoted. On August 15, 2008, the new presiding judge resolved the motion and rendered Joint Orders acquitting Mamerto. Unsuccessful at a reconsideration, private complainants filed a special civil action for certiorari to the Court of Appeals (CA) docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 114771. They alleged that the new presiding judge committed grave abuse of discretion in rendering the Joint Orders of acquittal which merely recited the contents of the accused's motion for reconsideration without stating any factual and legal basis. Mamerto opposed the petition arguing that a review of his acquittal will place him in double jeopardy. On July 31, 2012, the CA ruled that the RTC is guilty of grave abuse of discretion when it disregarded the constitutional requirement that a decision must express clearly and distinctly the facts and the law on which it is based. As such, the Joint Orders acquitting Mamerto are void and double jeopardy will not attach. The CA annulled and set aside the Joint Orders and reinstated the Joint Decisions convicting Mamerto. Mamerto sought for a reconsideration but was denied. Hence this Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. Mamerto invokes his right against double jeopardy and reiterates that the Joint Orders of acquittal are already final and not subject to review. The OSG later gave its conformity to the petition for certiorari that private complainants filed before the CA.","The Court denied Mamerto Austria's Petition for Review on Certiorari, affirmed the Court of Appeals' finding that the RTC committed grave abuse of discretion in issuing the Joint Orders of acquittal, and ruled that the void judgment did not trigger double jeopardy.","The RTC committed grave abuse of discretion when it rendered the Joint Orders acquitting Mamerto in violation of Section 14, Article VIII of the Constitution, which requires that a decision must express clearly and distinctly the facts and the law on which it is based. The Joint Orders are void for merely copying the allegations of Mamerto in his motions for reconsideration and memoranda followed by a conclusion that the prosecution miserably failed to overcome the legal presumption of innocence. A void judgment of acquittal has no legal effect and does not terminate the case. Thus, Mamerto's right against double jeopardy is not violated. The Court also clarified that while the private complainant's interest is generally limited only to the civil aspect of the case, and only the OSG may question the criminal aspect, the existing jurisprudence allowing private complainants to question void judgments (due to grave abuse of discretion or denial of due process) based on their interest in the civil aspect, justifies not dismissing their remedy here, especially since the OSG eventually joined their cause. The Court took the opportunity to harmonize the case law and formulate new prospective guidelines on the private complainant's legal standing to question judgments or orders in criminal proceedings.","FOR THESE REASONS, the petition is DENIED. The Court of Appeals' Decision dated July 31, 2012 in CA G.R. SP No. 114771 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION in that the criminal cases are REMANDED to the Regional Trial Court for resolution of Mamerto Austria's motion for reconsideration in accordance with Section 14, Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution."
"G.R. No. 254830, June 27, 2022","ENGR. JOSE S. DELA CRUZ, PETITIONER, VS. FIRST BUKIDNON ELECTRIC COOPERATIVE, INC. (FIBECO), RESPONDENT.","Dela Cruz was first hired as line personnel, and was eventually promoted as respondent FIBECO's general manager in 2001.[4] On March 26, 2007, however, concerned employees of FIBECO initiated an administrative complaint against him for grave offenses, including nepotism, insubordination, misuse of FIBECO properties/funds, and gross incompetence. After investigation, Dela Cruz was found guilty of the charges. Consequently, FIBECO's Board of Directors passed Resolution No. 42, Series of 2007, dismissing Dela Cruz from service effective May 1, 2007.[5] In its Resolution No. 79 dated October 18, 2007, the NEA Board of Administrators approved and confirmed the finding of guilt against Dela Cruz and his dismissal from service.[6] Illegal dismissal cases were filed before the labor tribunal, but eventually, in a Resolution[7] dated March 15, 2017 in G.R. No. 229485 entitled (Engr. Jose S. dela Cruz v. First Bukidnon Electric Cooperative, Inc. [FIBECO] and/or Fibeco Board of Directors, namely, Raul L. Alkuino, et al.) the Court upheld NEA's jurisdiction over the termination dispute and the finality of NEA's Resolution No. 79. The Court's Resolution[8] became final and executory on May 3, 2017.[9] Meanwhile, the present controversy spawned when Dela Cruz reached the compulsory retirement age on August 28, 2013 pending finality of the termination dispute. Believing that he is entitled to the retirement package pursuant to FIBECO Board Resolution No. 05-2014, in relation to NEA Memorandum No. 2005-015[10] or the Revised Retirement Plan for Electric Cooperative General Managers, Dela Cruz filed an application for retirement benefits with FIBECO, but to no avail. Thus, he pursued his claim before the Labor Arbiter (LA), insisting that he is eligible to receive retirement benefits as he had been employed by FIBECO since 1979; and that from 2001, he served as general manager until the date of his retirement.[11] FIBECO countered that Dela Cruz is not entitled to retirement benefits since he was found guilty of the administrative charges against him and validly dismissed therefor. Besides, it is the NEA, not the LA, which has jurisdiction over Dela Cruz's retirement benefits claim.[12] The LA sustained FIBECO' s jurisdictional argument, and consequently, dismissed Dela Cruz's claim for lack of jurisdiction.[13] However, on appeal, the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) ruled that the LA has original and exclusive jurisdiction over claims for retirement benefits. Thus, in a Resolution dated April 29, 2016, the NLRC remanded the case to the LA for proper disposition.[14] Notably, this NLRC Resolution was not questioned by any party. Nevertheless, in a Decision[15] dated September 14, 2016, the LA stood by its previous ruling that it is the NEA that has exclusive jurisdiction over Dela Cruz's retirement benefits claim since Presidential Decree (PD) No. 269,[16] as amended by PD No. 1645[17] and Republic Act (RA) No. 10531,[18] conferred the NEA with the power of supervision and control over all electric cooperatives, and such power includes the adjudication of any and all complaints or actions affecting the electric cooperatives, thus: [T]he instant complaint for retirement benefits pursuant to the NEA's Retirement Plan for General Managers of Electric Cooperatives (Either NEA Memorandum No. 2015-024 or NEA Memorandum No. 2005-015) is DISMISSED. Let a copy of this Decision be furnished the [NEA] for information and appropriate action as may be warranted under the circumstances. SO ORDERED.[19] Unrelenting, Dela Cruz sought remedy from the NLRC again. The NLRC rebuked the LA for reversing its earlier resolution on the jurisdictional issue, and reiterated that the labor tribunal has exclusive jurisdiction over the retirement benefits claim. On that premise, the NLRC granted Dela Cruz's claim for retirement benefits, viz.: [T]he appealed decision is SET ASIDE. Accordingly, [w]e declare again that the original and exclusive jurisdiction over complainant's monetary claim on his retirement benefits is properly lodged with the [LA] or the [NLRC] for that matter as this issue has been finally resolved through [o]ur earlier Resolution promulgated on April 29, 2016 with corresponding Entry of Judgment that the same has become final and executory on May 23, 20[1]6. Further, respondent [FIBECO], through its authorized officers or representatives is ORDERED to PAY complainant ENGR. JOSE S. DELA CRUZ the amount of SIX MILLION FORTY[-]EIGHT THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED PESOS ([P]6,048,600.00) representing the latter's retirement benefits as ratiocinated above. SO ORDERED.[20] FIBECO filed an Omnibus Motion for Reconsideration with Motion to Inhibit (Omnibus Motion), which remained unresolved. This prompted FIBECO to file a petition for certiorari before the CA, ascribing grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC for ignoring its Omnibus Motion; and for awarding retirement benefits to Dela Cruz.[21] In its assailed Decision[22] dated July 29, 2019, the CA upheld the jurisdiction of the labor tribunal over the retirement benefits claim solely on the ground that the NLRC ruling thereon already became final and executory for failure of any party to question it. The CA ruled that the only issue left for the LA to resolve was whether Dela Cruz was entitled to receive retirement benefits. For that matter, the CA disagreed with the NLRC and ruled that Dela Cruz was ineligible for the claimed benefits in view of his dismissal from the service before he reached the retirement age. The CA noted that such dismissal was affirmed valid in G.R. No. 229485, thus: FOR THESE REASONS, the assailed Resolution dated June 7, 2017 is AFFIRMED WITH MODIFICATION that the award of retirement benefits in favor of [Dela Cruz] is DELETED. SO ORDERED.[23] Dela Cruz's Motion for Reconsideration was denied in the assailed CA Resolution[24] dated September 14, 2020. Hence, this petition, which focuses only on Dela Cruz's entitlement to retirement benefits without delving into the jurisdictional issue. Dela Cruz faults the CA for relying upon the Court's ruling in G.R. No. 229485 in upholding the validity of his dismissal, and consequently, denying his claim for retirement benefits. He argues that G.R. No. 229485 merely resolved the issue on which between the LA and the NEA had jurisdiction over the termination dispute, and as such, did not resolve the merits of the validity of his dismissal. He also claims that he remained under FIBECO's employ until his retirement on August 28, 2013.[25] In its Comment,[26] FIBECO maintains that the primary and exclusive jurisdiction over retirement benefits claims of electric cooperative general managers is with the NEA, not with the labor tribunal. Nonetheless, it agrees with the CA in deleting the award of retirement benefits since Dela Cruz was validly dismissed from service.[27]","The Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED. The Decision dated July 29, 2019 and the Resolution dated September 14, 2020 of the Court of Appeals-Cagayan de Oro City in CA-G.R. SP No. 08417-MIN are AFFIRMED as to the deletion of the award of retirement benefits.","The CA upheld the labor tribunal's jurisdiction over Dela Cruz's retirement benefits claim solely on the ground that the NLRC's ruling on that matter had already attained finality since it was not questioned by any party in any forum. This, however, is a palpable error that must be rectified. Nothing is more settled than that jurisdiction over the subject matter of a case is conferred by law. It cannot be acquired by waiver or acquiescence of any or all of the parties, by estoppel, or by the erroneous belief of the court or any adjudicative body that it exists.[28] Thus, the failure of the parties to question the NLRC 's ruling on the jurisdictional issue in its Resolution[29] dated April 29, 2016, did not vest the labor tribunal with jurisdiction to take cognizance of the claim. On the contrary, PD No. 269, as amended, clearly provides that the NEA has the authority to supervise the management and operations of all electric cooperatives.[30] As the law vested the NEA with jurisdiction over all administrative matters involving officers of electric cooperatives, FIBECO's denial of, or inaction on Dela Cruz's claim should have been brought to the NEA's disposal in accordance with the retirement policy as correctly held by the LA.[34] In other words, the CA patently erred when it sustained the labor tribunal's jurisdiction to rule upon Dela Cruz's retirement benefits claim. Moreover, Dela Cruz is not entitled to his claimed retirement benefits. The validity of Dela Cruz's dismissal had long been settled, and consequently, is beyond scrutiny. The Court's disposition in G.R. No. 229485 dated March 15, 2017,[35] upholding NEA's jurisdiction over Dela Cruz's termination dispute and the finality of NEA Resolution No. 79, which dismissed Dela Cruz from the service, became final and executory on May 3, 2017.[36] Thus, contrary to Dela Cruz's proposition, the CA did not err in recognizing that he was validly dismissed from the service. Dela Cruz's removal from his position as general manager through NEA Resolution No. 79, entails the forfeiture of his retirement benefits. Section 3(a), Rule VII of the Rules of Procedure of the [NEA] on all administrative cases of Electric Cooperatives' Board of Directors, officers and employees[37] explicitly provides for the forfeiture of retirement benefits in case an officer is found guilty of grave offenses and penalized with removal from service: SEC. 3. ADMINISTRATIVE DISABILITIES INHERENT IN CERTAIN PENALTIES. (a) The penalty of dismissal shall carry with it that of cancellation of eligibility to run for the position of [Electric Cooperative] director, forfeiture of retirement benefits, and the perpetual disqualification for reemployment in any Electric Cooperative unless otherwise provided in the decision[.] (Emphases supplied) Since NEA Resolution No. 79, which dismissed Dela Cruz from the service, did not provide for his entitlement to retirement benefits despite a finding of guilt, the CA committed no reversible error in deleting the NLRC's award of retirement benefits.",Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED.

(Coca-Cola) and respondent Pacific Sugar Holdings Corporation (Pacific Sugar) entered into a Supply and Purchase Agreement (first supply agreement) dated December 13, 2007, and a second Supply and Purchase Agreement dated September 15, 2008, for the purchase of refined sugar. Due to alleged ""extremely low productivity of sugar cane,"" Pacific Sugar unilaterally terminated the agreements. Coca-Cola demanded payment of P347,410,104.66 representing the additional expenses it incurred after it was constrained to purchase the undelivered sugar products from other sellers. After Pacific Sugar refused, Coca-Cola filed a Complaint with the Regional Trial Court (RTC) praying for the nullification of the termination and issuance of a writ of preliminary attachment. The RTC granted the writ of preliminary attachment on February 8, 2011. Thereafter, Pacific Sugar filed a Motion to Dissolve Writ of Preliminary Attachment, praying that the writ be quashed, dissolved or discharged upon the former's filing of a standby letter of credit. The RTC issued an Order granting Pacific Sugar's motion, holding that a standby letter of credit may substitute the counter-bond required under Rule 57, Section 17, as both instruments secure the payment of an obligation. Aggrieved, Coca-Cola filed a Petition for Certiorari before the Court of Appeals (CA). While the certiorari petition was pending, the RTC issued an Order discharging the attachment. The CA dismissed Coca-Cola's petition for certiorari, affirming the RTC's ruling that a standby letter of credit serves the same purpose as a counter-bond.","The February 13, 2018 Decision and August 8, 2018 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 143593 affirmed the Regional Trial Court's dissolution of a writ of preliminary attachment on Pacific Sugar Holding's properties upon the latter's filing of a standby letter of credit, ruling that the standby letter of credit serves the same purpose as a counter-bond.","The Supreme Court ruled that the Court of Appeals seriously erred when it did not issue the writ of certiorari prayed for by petitioner. First, the RTC committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to excess of jurisdiction when it continued to exercise jurisdiction over the dissolution of the writ of preliminary attachment despite the pendency of the same issue before the CA, violating the principle of judicial courtesy, as its actions would render the CA’s review moot. Second, a standby letter of credit cannot be considered a substitute for a cash deposit or counter-bond under Rule 57, Sections 12 and 13 of the Rules of Court. The law limits the modes upon which an attachment may be discharged, and allowing substitution by a standby letter of credit is a blatant disregard of the rules, tantamount to judicial legislation. Furthermore, the standby letter of credit filed was more onerous than a counter-bond because it required petitioner to first prove that respondent was given 15 days to satisfy the judgment and failed to comply, thus transforming the instrument from a direct surety (like a counter-bond) into a mere guarantee.","The Petition is GRANTED. The February 13, 2018 Decision and August 8, 2018 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 143593 are REVERSED AND SET ASIDE. The writ of preliminary attachment subject of this case is ordered restored for the satisfaction of judgment."

Banner moved for reconsideration of the award resolution on April 10, 2017. On May 26, 2017, ATM, represented by Leon E. Peralta, filed a Petition for Prohibition against the LTO to enjoin it from proceeding with the contract, arguing LTO gravely abused its discretion by awarding the contract without resolving Banner's pending protest (Request for Reconsideration) and by failing to act on ATM's Observer's Report, asserting that the contract was grossly disadvantageous to the government due to the P79,668,053.55 difference between Banner's and Dermalog's bids.",The Petition must fail.,"The Court ruled that while petitioner Anti-Trapo Movement of the Philippines has legal capacity to sue (having submitted its Certificate of Incorporation and Secretary's Certification), it lacks legal standing to file the action. ATM failed to meet the criteria for transcendental importance, as it did not sufficiently show a blatant disregard of constitutional or statutory prohibition by the LTO, and there were other parties (like the Commission on Audit or qualified bidders) with a more direct interest. Furthermore, the writ of prohibition does not lie because the act sought to be enjoined is already fait accompli, as the Notice to Proceed had already been issued and the contract awarded. Even addressing the merits, the Court found that the LTO did not commit grave abuse of discretion. Banner's Request for Reconsideration of the March 31, 2017 Resolution, filed on April 10, 2017 (after the Notice of Award on April 3, 2017), could not be considered the 'protest' contemplated under Section 55 and 57 of Republic Act No. 9184 because it was not verified, nor was the non-refundable protest fee shown to have been paid. Thus, the LTO was not required to resolve it before making the award. Finally, the LTO did not gravely abuse its discretion by not acting upon the Observer's Report of ATM before issuing the Notice to Proceed, as neither RA 9184 nor its Implementing Rules prohibits the Procuring Entity from granting the award without acting on the report; in fact, non-submission of such a report within seven days creates a presumption that the bidding activity followed the correct procedure.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DISMISSED. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 253327, June 27, 2022","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. DANILO REYES CRISOLOGO AND ROBERTO LOLENG MANLAVI, ACCUSED-APPELLANTS.","Accused-appellants Danilo R. Crisologo (Crisologo), President of the Philippine Aerospace Development Corporation (PADC), and Roberto Loleng Manlavi (Manlavi), Senior Vice President of PADC, were charged with violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019 (RA 3019) for allegedly giving unwarranted benefit, advantage, or preference to Wingtips Parts Corp. (Wingtips) in 2007 and 2008 by selling PADC aircraft spare parts, accessories and equipment at a loss through negotiation. This action was allegedly done with manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence, violating COA rules and PADC's Revised Pricing Policy requiring a 30% mark-up added to the acquisition cost, causing undue injury or pecuniary loss to PADC amounting to at least PhP6,246,635.00.
Crisologo appointed Manlavi as temporary Senior Vice-President. Manlavi then issued a Memorandum regarding the pricing of PADC spare parts proposing guidelines that significantly reduced the valuation of parts (2.5% or 5% of acquisition cost, depending on the status), which Crisologo signed, signaling his approval. From February to July 2008, PADC and Wingtips entered into seven (7) sales transactions using these new guidelines, completely disregarding the established PADC pricing policy of 30% mark-up. A COA Fraud Audit Report found that the items sold were not scrap, obsolete, or of no value, as they remained in inventory (indicating they were still new), and the prices were unilaterally set by Manlavi without approval from the Board of Directors or expert appraisal.","The Decision dated November 29, 2019 of the Sandiganbayan in Criminal Case No. SB-17-CRM-0168 found appellants Danilo R. Crisologo and Roberto Loleng Manlavi guilty of violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 and sentenced them to suffer the indeterminate penalty of six (6) years and one (1) month, as minimum, to ten (10) years, as maximum, and to suffer the penalty of perpetual disqualification from holding public office.","The Supreme Court affirmed the Sandiganbayan’s conviction. The Court clarified that while the Sandiganbayan erred in requiring public bidding for the sale (as the spare parts fell under the exemption for 'merchandise or inventory held for sale in the regular course of business' under COA Circular No. 89-296), this did not exonerate the appellants.

Regarding the second element (manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence): Crisologo peremptorily approved Manlavi's unilaterally fixed pricing guidelines without consulting the PADC pricing committee or the PADC Board of Directors, completely disregarding the existing 30% mark-up policy. They failed to substantiate the claim that the parts were obsolete. Furthermore, Crisologo failed to justify hiring consultants instead of bonded personnel for the stockroom and ordering the use of unofficial computer-printed receipts. Their collective acts, including negotiating solely with Wingtips, revealed a 'clear, notorious, or plain inclination or predilection to favor Wingtips' and demonstrated evident bad faith and gross negligence.

Regarding the third element (undue injury or unwarranted benefits): Wingtips unduly benefited by procuring the spare parts at extremely low prices ('for a song'). This caused undue injury to the government amounting to a loss of P6,640,358.28, representing the difference between the potential earnings (P7,489,868.50) and the actual sale proceeds (P849,510.22).","ACCORDINGLY, the appeal is DISMISSED. The Decision dated November 29, 2019 of the Sandiganbayan in Criminal Case No. SB-17-CRM-0168 is AFFIRMED. Accordingly, appellants Danilo Reyes Crisologo and Roberto Loleng Manlavi are sentenced to the indeterminate penalty of six (6) years and one (1) month, as minimum, to ten (10) years, as maximum, with perpetual disqualification from holding public office."

DIMAGIBA, AND ELVIRA M. BURAYAG; AND HENIE N. PUNONGBAYAN, PETITIONERS, VS. ST. PETER'S COLLEGE, INC., RESPONDENT.","The present case is an offshoot from the orders issued by the Regional Trial Court in Special Proceeding No. 1053 entitled ""In the Matter of the Intestate Estate of the Deceased Escolastica Punongbayan Paguio."" Sotero Punongbayan (Sotero), the co-administrator of the Estate, filed a Manifestation/Motion praying that the amount of P40,000,000.00 deposited in Security Bank and Trust Company, Iligan Branch (Security Bank) under the name of St. Peter's College, Inc. (St. Peter's College), be levied and attached, alleging it represented St. Peter's College's rental payment for the use of a property belonging to the Estate, and that St. Peter's College was a mere trustee. The Regional Trial Court, in its May 23, 2001 Order, froze the account, finding prima facie evidence that the funds belonged to the Estate. The RTC later denied St. Peter's College's Complaint in Intervention on September 27, 2001. Subsequently, the RTC issued an Order dated February 4, 2004, directing the funds (then P68,000,000.00) to be transferred and deposited, in equal amounts, with the Bank of the Philippine Islands and Land Bank of the Philippines under the joint account of the Estate and St. Peter's College, prohibiting withdrawal until the proper court decided its ownership through appropriate proceedings. St. Peter's College filed a Motion on May 30, 2013, for the Lifting and Discharge of the Attachment Order and the return of the P66,000,000.00, arguing lack of service and due process. In its July 3, 2013, Omnibus Order, the RTC ruled that St. Peter's College had no personality to seek redress and conclusively held that ""The money deposited with [Land Bank] and BPI belongs to the Estate of Escolastica Punongbayan."" Aggrieved, St. Peter's College filed a Petition for Certiorari before the Court of Appeals, arguing the RTC gravely abused its discretion by ruling on ownership despite its limited jurisdiction and lack of jurisdiction over St. Peter's College.","In its August 31, 2017 Decision, the Court of Appeal granted St. Peter's College's petition and nullified the Orders of the Regional Trial Court:
FOR THESE REASONS, this court GRANTS the petition for a writ of certiorari and NULLIFIES the Orders of the Regional Trial Court dated May 23, 2001, February 4, 2004, and July 3, 2013 in Spec. Proc. No. 1053 for having been rendered in excess of jurisdiction. The Bank of the Philippine Islands Cagayan de Oro and Land Bank of the Philippines Cagayan de Oro are ORDERED to restore and deliver the 66 Million pesos together with its interests to St. Peter's College, Inc., or its authorized representative, without prejudice to whatever appropriate action the incumbent Administrator of the Estate of Escolastico Punongbayan may bring to enforce and protect the estates alleged interest in those monies.","The petition is unmeritorious. This Court agreed with the Court of Appeals that St. Peter's College had the legal personality to file the Petition for Certiorari because it had a material, direct interest in challenging the lower court’s decision regarding the disputed funds. The Supreme Court affirmed that a Regional Trial Court acting as an intestate court has special and limited jurisdiction and cannot pass upon questions of ownership arising from a title adverse to that of the deceased. The RTC exceeded its jurisdiction when it made a conclusive determination on the fund's ownership in its July 3, 2013 Omnibus Order. Furthermore, the RTC acted on the Manifestation/Motion without serving a copy or giving St. Peter's College an opportunity to be heard, amounting to a deprivation of property without due process of law. Recovery of alleged rentals due to the Estate cannot be made by the administrator through a mere motion during the intestate proceedings but must be by the institution of a separate action against the third person. Finally, the Court ruled that St. Peter's College was not guilty of estoppel by laches because the initial orders were interlocutory, and the college had incessantly filed motions to protect its rights.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DENIED. The August 31, 2017 Decision and April 2, 2018 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 05678-MIN are AFFIRMED.

"G.R. No. 221664, June 27, 2022","RUBEN M. BUENAFLOR PETITIONER , VS. STOLT-NIELSEN PHILIPPINES, INC., AND STOLT-NIELSEN ITS GMBH RESPONDENTS.","The antecedents of this case go back to July 8, 2010, when petitioner was hired by the respondents as Second Officer of the vessel Stolt Shearwater. He signed on the vessel to begin his employment on July 25, 2010. Two (2) days after signing on or on July 27, 2010, Marine Pollution (MARPOL) inspectors boarded the Stolt Shearwater for routine inspection to check the vessel's compliance with MARPOL Rules at the Port of Rotterdam in Netherlands. Subsequent thereto, according to petitioner, he was questioned by the Russian captain or master of the vessel, A. Kuzins (Captain Kuzins), as to the remarks and observations made by the MARPOL inspectors. Petitioner averred that, at that time, Captain Kuzins shouted at him in front of the chief officer and did not allow him to explain what had happened. Less than a month after the foregoing incident, or on August 22, 2010, petitioner claimed he was verbally informed by Captain Kuzins that he will be sent home — without any written notice given or formal investigation conducted — because he was supposedly incapable of doing his job. Thus, petitioner was repatriated on August 26, 2010. Upon his arrival, petitioner contended that he immediately asked Stolt Nielsen's Agent in the Philippines, SNP, to review his case; and it was decided that he would be reinstated and transferred to another vessel. Stolt-Nielsen, however, reversed SNP's decision and upheld his dismissal by Captain Kuzins. Aggrieved, petitioner filed a complaint for illegal dismissal, alleging that his employment was terminated without just, valid, or authorized cause and in violation of Section 17 of the Standard Terms and Conditions Governing the Overseas Employment of Filipino Seafarers On-Board Ocean-Going Ships (Standard Employment Contract), which provides the required procedure for disciplinary proceedings against seafarers. He prayed for the payment of his salaries for the unexpired portion of his contract, moral and exemplary damages, as well as attorney's fees. For their part, the respondents maintained that petitioner's employment was validly terminated. Respondents explained that petitioner was reprimanded by Captain Kuzins after the MARPOL inspection conducted on July 27, 2010 because he was unable to answer the inspectors' inquiries and did not inform the senior management of such incident, which supposedly led to incorrect observations and derogatory remarks against the vessel. The incident was recorded on July 29, 2010 on page 41 of the vessel's logbook as follows: 2off. R. Buenaflor has been given Formal Verbal Warning in witness of Ch. Off. D. Filipovs by Capt. A. Kuzins. Reasons: - unauthori[z]ed overriding of his authority/duties in respect of dealing with MARPOL inspectors of Port of Rotterdam - non calling/non reporting to Capt or Ch. Off. in due time as required, above failures had leaded [ sic ] to incorrect observation done by inspector which was not clarified at a [ sic ] time of inspection. Master (sgd.) In addition to this incident, the respondents claimed that two (2) other instances as documented in the Near Miss Incident Reports (NIRs) — one wherein petitioner did not properly conduct the discharge operations of a highly inflammable cargo on August 11, 2010, and the other wherein petitioner failed to take action to prevent the extreme build-up of pressure in the cargo tank on August 14, 2010 — led to petitioner's eventual dismissal due to his carelessness, lack of safety awareness, ignorance of operational safety procedures, inefficiency, and incompetence. The respondents further contended that petitioner was notified of the charges against him and was given a chance to explain, but he failed to provide a satisfactory explanation. Moreover, petitioner was served a written notice of dismissal on August 22, 2010 but he refused to receive the same.","The Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 129462 dated October 28, 2015 is REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The Resolutions of the National Labor Relations Commission in NLRC LAC No. 07-000589-11-OFW dated August 30, 2012 and January 17, 2013, which affirmed the Decision of the Labor Arbiter dated May 10, 2011, are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION.","The Court thus views the CA decision in the same context that the earlier petition for certiorari was presented to the CA, i.e. , whether the latter correctly determined the presence or absence of grave abuse of discretion in the findings of the NLRC... With the foregoing in mind, the Court holds that the NLRC, in affirming the LA, did not gravely abuse its discretion. Its findings are supported by substantial evidence and are consistent with prevailing law and jurisprudence as to the issues raised. Consequently, the CA erred in ascribing grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC when the latter ruled that petitioner was illegally dismissed. Thus, the Decision of the CA must be reversed and set aside, and the NLRC's Resolutions affirming the Decision of the LA must be reinstated. The respondents failed to prove that petitioner was incompetent and inefficient. ... There is no substantial evidence to support the claim that petitioner was indeed incompetent or inefficient so as to justify his dismissal. While the Court agrees with the respondents and the CA that the photocopy of the vessel's logbook is prima facie evidence of the facts contained therein and is therefore admissible in evidence, the Court finds that the same does not provide sufficient proof of the supposed incompetence or inefficiency of petitioner. That singular incident as reported, without nothing more, does not warrant a finding that there was just cause for the termination of petitioner's employment on the ground of incompetence or inefficiency. ... The printouts of these NIRs, however, were rejected by the CA and both labor tribunals a quo. According to the LA, as affirmed by the NLRC, the NIRs were not signed by either the author thereof or petitioner, and therefore could have easily been prepared by anyone. The CA, on the other hand, found that '[t]he NIRs are not considered official records, hence require authentication to be admissible in evidence.' The Court agrees. ... The petitioner was not accorded due process in his illegal dismissal. The CA and the labor tribunals a quo are all in agreement that petitioner was not accorded due process. The CA found that the respondents failed to show that they furnished petitioner with a written notice, and that they had conducted a formal investigation of the charges where they gave him the opportunity to defend himself. ... The propriety of monetary awards granted by the LA Decision is proper. Since petitioner was illegally dismissed, he is therefore entitled to be paid his salaries for the unexpired portion of his employment contract. This also includes the monthly vacation leave pay and other bonuses, which are expressly provided and guaranteed in his employment contract as part of his monthly salary and benefit package. The Court also finds that the LA correctly granted moral and exemplary damages as affirmed by the NLRC. ... As for the attorney's fees, the same was likewise proper because petitioner was forced to litigate and incur expenses to protect his rights and interests. Thus, petitioner is therefore entitled to attorney's fees equivalent to ten percent (10%) of the total award, to be computed on the basis of the exchange rate prevailing at the time the actual payment is made. Finally, legal interest on all the foregoing monetary awards is hereby imposed, at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from finality of this ruling until full payment.","Accordingly, petitioner is hereby declared to have been illegally dismissed from employment by the respondents Stolt-Nielsen Philippines, Inc. and Stolt-Nielsen ITS GMBH (respondents). As such, the respondents are hereby ORDERED to PAY, jointly and severally, petitioner the following: ( a ) USD20,149.33 , representing the sum of his salaries for the unexpired portion of his employment contract, vacation leave pay, and bonus; ( b ) PHP100,000.00 in moral damages; ( c ) PHP100,000.00 in exemplary damages; and ( d ) attorney's fees equivalent to ten percent (10%) of the total monetary awards. The amount denominated in US Dollars shall be paid in its equivalent in Philippine currency at the exchange rate prevailing at the time of payment. The monetary awards granted shall further earn legal interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum reckoned from the date of the finality of this Decision until its full payment."

""KABAYO,"" ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","Under Information dated February 15, 2013, appellant Pedro Rama, Jr. y Ybañez a.k.a. ""Kabayo"" was charged with the special complex crime of rape with homicide of 11-year old AAA253467, allegedly committed on February 12, 2013, by having carnal knowledge of the victim and then strangling and mauling her, resulting in her death. Around 6 o'clock in the morning of February 12, 2013, AAA253467 went to a nearby sugarcane field to defecate. When she did not return, her mother (BBB253467) and brother (CCC253467) searched for her. CCC253467 encountered the long-haired appellant hastily walking away from the field, shirtless, with his body full of mud, scratches, and blood on his right abdomen. On the way to the hospital, AAA253467 momentarily regained consciousness and described her aggressor to her mother as a neighbor, with long hair, wearing a red and blue shirt, and that she was able to scratch the right portion of the aggressor's body. AAA253467 died shortly thereafter. Neighbor Jimenez testified he saw appellant heading towards the sugarcane field around 5:00 AM wearing a red and blue shirt and returning around 6:30 AM shirtless, soiled, and scratched. PO3 Lopez recovered a red and blue shirt at the crime scene and noticed scratches on appellant's abdomen upon arrest. Dr. Tan's post-mortem examination showed fresh hymenal laceration and that the cause of death was ""asphyxia – cardiac arrest secondary to intrathoracic injuries secondary to rape,"" consistent with strangulation. Dr. Tan also examined appellant and found linear abrasions on his abdomen, rib, and fingers, appearing to be fingernail scratches caused by a defensive move or action. Appellant claimed he never left his house from 5 o'clock until 9 o'clock in the morning of February 12, 2013, as he was repairing the post of their house. He denied owning the shirt recovered from the crime scene and belied having any scratches on his body.","The Regional Trial Court (RTC) – Branch 58 found appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the special complex crime of rape with homicide and sentenced him to suffer the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA, without the possibility of parole, based on circumstantial evidence forming an unbroken chain. The Court of Appeals, in its Decision dated December 12, 2019, affirmed the verdict of conviction.","The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, finding that the circumstantial evidence presented by the prosecution constituted an unbroken chain leading to the conclusion that appellant was the rapist-killer. These circumstances included: 1) The victim's dying declaration describing her long-haired attacker wearing a red and blue shirt and stating she scratched his body; 2) The testimony of CCC253467 who saw the long-haired, shirtless appellant exiting the crime scene with mud and scratches/blood on his abdomen; 3) Jimenez’s testimony confirming appellant’s presence near the scene and his subsequent soiled and scratched condition; 4) The recovery of the red and blue shirt at the crime scene; and 5) Dr. Tan’s findings confirming rape and strangulation of the victim, and the presence of linear abrasions (fingernail scratches) on appellant’s body. The Court noted that appellant’s defense of denial and alibi failed because he did not prove the physical impossibility of him being at the situs criminis, which was only 150 to 160 meters away from his house. The courts below aptly ruled that appellant's denial cannot prevail over the categorical testimonies of the prosecution witnesses.","ACCORDINGLY, the Appeal is DENIED.

"G.R. No. 256177, June 27, 2022","PIONEER INSURANCE & SURETY CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. THE INSURANCE COMPANY, SUCCESSOR BY MERGER TO CLEARWATER INSURANCE COMPANY, RESPONDENT.","Pioneer is a domestic corporation engaged in the business of selling non-life insurance. Meanwhile, Clearwater Insurance Company (Clearwater), previously known as Odyssey Reinsurance Corporation and Skandia America Reinsurance Corporation, is a foreign company organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, United States of America (USA). On September 30, 2016, Clearwater merged with TIG Insurance Company (TIG Insurance), a foreign company organized under the laws of the State of California, USA. On April 21, 2016, Clearwater filed a verified Petition for confirmation, recognition, and enforcement of the arbitral award before the RTC. Clearwater alleged in its Petition that on July 1, 1973, it entered into First Surplus Share Capacity — SK 100 Retrocession Agreement No. 9166 (SK 100 agreement) with insurance and reinsurance companies (referred to the agreement as retrocessionaires), one of which was Pioneer. On January 21, 1974, Pioneer agreed to assume Clearwater's 1% share of the interests and liabilities in the SK 100 agreement. Pioneer failed to pay Clearwater the outstanding balance amounting to $138,093 plus $101,115 interest. Consequently, Clearwater initiated the arbitration proceedings in New York. The panel of arbitrators allowed the parties to present their positions, but Pioneer did not participate in the scheduled hearing on April 24, 2013. On April 25, 2013, the panel issued the Final Award, ordering Pioneer to pay Clearwater a total amount of $344,991.68. Pioneer failed to pay Clearwater having received a copy of the final award. In opposing Clearwater's Petition, Pioneer invoked Rule 13.4 of the Special Rules of Court on Alternative Dispute Resolution, A.M. No. 07-11-08-SC dated September 1, 2009 (Special ADR Rules), and Article V of the 1958 New York Convention, and argued that the arbitral award is contrary to public policy or the Philippine Constitution because Clearwater's claim was not supported by sufficient evidence. Pioneer further alleged that Clearwater's cause of action had prescribed because it was filed beyond the 6-year prescription period provided under the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules. Pioneer also invoked the lack of jurisdiction of the Philippine courts to confirm the award since the SK 100 agreement required Clearwater to go to the US District Court. Lastly, Pioneer claimed that the Petition was not sufficient in form for Clearwater's failure to attach a Secretary's Certificate or Board Resolution proving the authority of its legal counsel to sign the verification and certification of non-forum shopping. On September 21, 2016, the RTC dismissed the procedural issues raised by Pioneer and granted Clearwater's Petition, confirming, recognizing, and enforcing the FINAL AWARD dated April 25, 2013. Pioneer filed a Petition for Review under Rule 19.12 of the Special ADR Rules before the CA, raising the issues of whether Clearwater's Petition with the RTC complied with the verification and certification against forum shopping requirements, and whether the RTC was correct in confirming, recognizing, and enforcing the arbitral award. The CA affirmed the RTC Decision, finding substantial compliance and ruling that Pioneer failed to establish public policy violation. Undeterred, Pioneer filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which the CA denied, leading to this recourse where Pioneer insists the RTC and CA should have dismissed Clearwater's Petition for failure to attach a secretary’s certificate or board resolution and maintains that public policy against non-assertion of stale claims was violated due to prescription under the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules.","The Petition is DENIED. The Court of Appeals' Decision dated June 19, 2020 and Resolution dated February 24, 2021 in CA­-G.R. SP No. 149206 upholding the Decision dated September 21, 2016 and the Order dated December 16, 2016 of Branch 141, Regional Trial Court of Makati City are AFFIRMED.","The Petition is unmeritorious. The Court’s review of the CA decision under the Special ADR Rules is discretionary and will be granted only when there are special and important reasons, none of which were specifically raised or explained by Pioneer. Clearwater's verification and certification against forum shopping comply with the Special ADR Rules because Rules 1.4 and 1.5 do not require the attachment of a secretary's certificate or special power of attorney, unlike the Rules of Civil Procedure, and failure to attach these is not fatal to cases covered by the Special ADR Rules. The Court adopted the narrow approach in determining whether enforcement of an arbitral award is contrary to public policy. Mere errors in the interpretation of the law or factual findings would not suffice. Pioneer failed to prove the illegality or immorality of the award or show that enforcement would blatantly be injurious to the public or the interests of the society. Pioneer failed to establish that Clearwater's claims have already prescribed, as Pioneer did not reject Clearwater's demand for payment in 1995 but instead requested a breakdown and supporting documents; thus, the running of the prescriptive period is undeterminable.","The United States Board of Arbitrator's Final Award dated April 25, 2013 is CONFIRMED, RECOGNIZED , and ENFORCED , without pronouncement as to attorney's fees and costs of suit."

Disc Contractors started as Dasmariñas Industrial and Steelworks Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Philippine National Construction Corporation[6] that was established in 1973 under the Systems Construction Group. Its main line of business was the manufacture of prefabricated steel structures for the various projects of Philippine National Construction Corporation, in 1979, to further promote and enhance its steel products which helped Philippine National Construction Corporation reduce construction costs, accelerate completion date, and improve overall product quality, the Philippine National Construction Corporation Management decided to separate Systems Construction Group from the mother company and named it Dasmariñas Steelworks Corporation. In the same year, Philippine National Construction Corporation established another subsidiary, the Dasmariñas Industrial Corporation, which handled the manufacturing, assembly, and repowering of heavy construction equipment. In 1981, to support the country's efforts to upgrade the local steel fabrication industry, Dasmariñas Steelworks Corporation and Dasmariñas Industrial Corporation merged and became Dasmariñas Industrial and Steelworks Corporation. In 2006, following the approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission of the quasi-reorganization of Dasmariñas Industrial and Steelworks Corporation, its name was changed to Disc Contractors.

On May 28, 1999, the Board of Directors of Disc Contractors passed Resolution No. BD-007-1999 approving the grant of midyear bonus for calendar year 1999 to all its entitled employees, officers, Board of Directors, and the secretariat. [20] This bonus was patterned after the Philippine National Construction Corporation's midyear bonus and given every 15th day of May until 2012. [21] Starting 2013, however, Disc Contractors discontinued the grant of this bonus. The company also did not give midyear bonuses in 2014 and 2015. [22] In a letter dated April 7, 2015 addressed to Atty. Luis F. Sison (Atty. Sison), President of Disc Contractors, Villafuerte et al. requested for the release of their 2013 midyear bonus. In a hand-written notation inscribed on the lower right-hand corner of the said letter, Atty. Sison denied the request stating that:
In consultation w/ Legal, I am sorry that I am unable to provide a favorable response to your request. I believe there are certain procedural requirements necessary and until so fulfilled I must deny the request.
[23]
Aggrieved with the denial of their request, which did not disclose the procedural requirements that must be complied with for said benefit's grant and the person charged to comply with the said requirements, Villafuerte et al. filed a Complaint on September 29, 2015, which was later amended, for underpayment of separation pay, non-payment of midyear bonus, vacation leave, sick leave, anniversary bonus, birthday leave, rice subsidy, uniform allowance, and health maintenance organizations benefits, with prayer for damages and attorney's fees. [24] Villafuerte et al. asserted in their Position Paper that they are entitled to all the employee benefits that they are claiming as a matter of right since the grant of such benefits has ripened into a company practice which could not be unilaterally withdrawn without transgressing Article 100[25] of the Labor Code on nondiminution of benefits given that Disc Contractors has granted these benefits voluntarily, with no conditions attached, and regularly for 14 continuous years. By reason of the company's unilateral discontinuance of the said benefits, it must also be made liable for moral and exemplary damages, as well as attorney's fees. [26] In its Position Paper, Disc Contractors admitted that it granted its employees annual midyear bonus starting 1999 until 2012. However, it was constrained to discontinue giving the said benefit beginning 2013 upon the advice of the Governance Commission for Government-Owned and Controlled Corporations. The Governance Commission for Government-Owned and Controlled Corporations supposedly informed Disc Contractors that since it was a government-owned and controlled corporation, then the grant of the said benefit was bereft of legal basis without the President's prior approval, as mandated by Presidential Decree No. 1597[27] and Republic Act No. 10149. [28] Disc Contractors contended further that there could be no diminution of benefits by the withholding of this benefit since its earlier grants were contrary to law, and therefore, it could not develop into a vested right. [29] Regarding the other benefits being claimed by Villafuerte et al., Disc Contractors insisted that they were not entitled to their money claims prior to May 21, 2015 because they executed waivers and quitclaims releasing and discharging the company from any and all claims that may be due them by reason of their employment. [30] Even assuming that the waivers and quitclaims were not validly executed, they could no longer claim additional separation pay for services rendered prior to May 21, 2013 when they were still project employees because they were already paid their project completion bonus equivalent to 50% of their salaries for every year of their service. [31] They were also not entitled to vacation leave pay and sick leave pay because they were already paid said benefits as evidenced by the computation of their final pay. No anniversary bonus, birthday leave, rice subsidy, uniform allowance, and health maintenance organizations benefits can also be given to Villafuerte et al. before May 21, 2013 since these benefits were given only to regular employees, which they are not. Moreover, anniversary bonus was given only for the years 2008 and 2009. [32] In a Decision, [33] the labor arbiter held that Philippine National Construction Corporation is not a government-owned and controlled corporation but a private enterprise pursuant to Philippine National Construction Corporation v. Pabion. [34] Being a wholly-owned subsidiary of Philippine National Construction Corporation, Disc Contractors necessarily follows the status of Philippine National Construction Corporation as a private corporation. Thus, it is covered by the Labor Code, and not Presidential Decree No. 1597 and Republic Act No. 10149. Article 100 of the Labor Code precludes Disc Contractors from withdrawing the grant of the annual midyear bonus to Villafuerte et al. as it has ripened into a company policy given the considerable length of time the company had been giving the same to its employees and officers unilaterally and voluntarily. [35] Furthermore, the labor arbiter declared that Villafuerte et al. are regular employees of Disc Contractors from the date of their initial hiring as project or contractual employees until their separation therefrom on September 30, 2015. It did not escape the labor arbiter's notice that Villafuerte et al. had been working for Disc Contractors from project to project or contract to contract and rehired without any gap of any day to perform services that are necessary and indispensable to the business or trade of the company. As such, they are removed from the scope of project or contractual employees and must be regarded as regular employees of Disc Contractors. [36] The labor arbiter also held that as regular employees, they must be paid their separation pay, vacation leave, sick leave, anniversary bonus, birthday leave, rice subsidy, uniform allowance, and health maintenance organizations benefits in the amounts equivalent to those received by the regular employees of Disc Contractors. As for the separation pay, it must be computed from the time of their initial hiring until their separation from the company on September 30, 2015 and not only from the time they were hired as probationary employees on May 21, 2013. The waivers and quitclaims executed by Villafuerte et al. will not relieve the company from its obligation of paying their monetary claims as these waivers and quitclaims are looked upon with disfavor. The act of the company of flatly denying their request for the release of their midyear bonus without performing anything to comply with the requirements for the release of said benefit amounted to malice and gross negligence for which it must be held liable for moral damages. Disc Contractors must also be made to pay exemplary damages and attorney's fees. [37] The dispostive portion of the labor artbiter's Decision reads: WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered as follows: a) Finding respondent company DISC Contractors, Builders & General Services, Inc. to have violated the non-diminution clause under Article 100 of the Labor Code of the Philippines and hereby ordering respondent company to pay complainants their annual Mid-Year Bonus from the year 2013 and every year thereafter until their separation from employment on September 30, 2015 in the amount equivalent to one month of their respective basic salary as of May 31 of every year; b) Ordering respondent company to pay complainants the amounts representing their underpaid separation pay computed from their initial hiring as project and/or contractual employees up to their separation from employment on September 30, 2015, less separation pay already paid previously; c) Ordering respondent company to pay complaints the amounts representing their unpaid vacation leave, sick leave, anniversary bonus, birthday leave, rice subsidy, uniform allowance and [health maintenance organizations], subject to the 3-year prescriptive period provided under Article 291 of the Labor Cod[e]; d) Ordering respondent company to pay the amount of Fifty Thousand Pesos (Php 50,000.00) to each complainant as and by way of moral damages; e) Ordering respondent company to pay complainants the amount of One Hundred Thousand Pesos (Php 100,000.00) as and by way of exemplary damages; and f) Ordering respondent company to pay complainants the amount equivalent to ten percent (10%) of the total judgment award as and by way of attorney's fees. Attached and made an integral part of the Decision is the computation of the respective monetary awards of complainants. SO ORDERED. [38] Aggrieved, Disc Contractors appealed before the National Labor Relations Commission. In a Decision, [39] the National Labor Relations Commission affirmed the findings of the labor arbiter that Villafuerte et. al were entitled to midyear bonus under the Labor Code inasmuch as Disc Contractors is a private corporation and, therefore, not covered by Republic Act No. 10149. [40] While the National Labor Relations Commission agreed with the labor arbiter that Villafuerte et al. were entitled to rice subsidy and health maintenance organizations benefits as reflected in the Certification/Computation of Separation/Retrenchment/Terminal Benefits (Certification of Benefits) issued by Disc Contractors showing said employees' entitlement thereto, it ordered the recomputation of the awards for failure of the labor arbiter to indicate how the amounts for the same were computed. It also found the recomputation of the separation pay awarded to them necessary given that the labor arbiter computed their separation pay at one-month pay for every year of service, instead of one-half month pay for every year of service. The National Labor Relations Commission, however, deleted the anniversary bonus, birthday leave, uniform allowance, moral damages, and exemplary damages awarded for failure of Villafuerte et al. to prove their entitlement thereto. It also found unnecessary to grant vacation leave and sick leave benefits to them since their Certification of Benefits shows they were already paid the same and Villafuerte et al. did not deny having received the said benefits. [41] The dispositive portion of the said Decision states: WHEREFORE, the decision dated 27 January 2016 is hereby MODIFIED. Respondent Disc Contractors, Builders & General Services is ordered to pay complainants the following: Mid-Year Bonus Separation Pay 1. Susan B. Villafuerte 61,122.00 - 2. Jocelyn D. Lino 36,483.00 - 3. Arthur O. Pendilla 55,722.00 - 4. George B. Purugganan 34,722.00 - 5. Aida S. Santos 48,846.00 9,442.00 6. Reggie Ley F. dela Cruz 37,722.00 588.50 7. Cristian I. Perua 33,336.00 7,898.00 8. Antonio M. Cabrera 52,320.00 2,415.00 9. Dionisio C. Quino 50,841.00 5,620.00 10. Elenita P. Eroy 60,000.00 69,593.00 11. Larraine L. Abellar 61,122.00 193,664.00 The claims for rice subsidy and HMO are granted subject to re-computation. For this purpose, let the case records be remanded [f]or appropriate proceedings before the Arbitration Branch of origin. Vacation leave pay and sick leave pay, anniversary bonus, birthday leave, uniform allowance and moral and exemplary damages awarded are hereby DELETED. The other findings are AFFIRMED. SO ORDERED. [42] Not satisfied with how the National Labor Relations Commission ruled on the case, Disc Contractors filed a Motion for Reconsideration, while Villafuerte et al. filed a Motion for Partial Reconsideration. In a Resolution, [43] the National Labor Relations Commission rejected the contention of Disc Contractors that it is a government-owned and controlled corporation. It reiterated its earlier ruling that the status of Philippine National Construction Corporation as a private corporation has already been settled by this Court. As a wholly owned subsidiary of Philippine National Construction Corporation, Disc Contractors follows the status of its parent company. It also affirmed its grant of health maintenance organizations benefits and rice subsidy to the subject employees for failure of Disc Contractors to prove that they were not entitled thereto. The National Labor Relations Commission likewise refused to delete the award for attorney's fees and stood pat that Villafuerte et al. are entitled to the same because they were forced to litigate to protect their rights and interests. However, it partially reconsidered its decision and ordered the separation pay differential awarded to Eroy and Abellar deleted. After a reassessment of the evidence presented, the National Labor Relations Commission found that Eroy and Abellar admitted receiving their separation pay for the entire duration of their employment with Disc Contractors. [44] As for Villafuerte et al.'s Motion for Partial Reconsideration, the National Labor Relations Commission held that nothing prevented it from reducing the award of separation pay at the rate of 50% of the employees' base pay for every year of their service. The amount given by Disc Contractors, which was equivalent to 100% of their salary, was merely an act of benevolence and under the mistaken belief that it was liable for separation pay only for the period covering May 21, 2013 to September 30, 2015. [45] The dispositive portion of the National Labor Relations Commission Resolution reads: WHEREFORE, the motion for partial reconsideration filed by complainants is hereby DENIED for lack of merit. The motion for reconsideration filed by respondents is PARTLY GRANTED. The separation pay awarded to complainants Elenita P. Eroy and Larraine L. Abellar are deleted. The other findings are affirmed. SO ORDERED. [46] Not accepting defeat, both parties filed their respective Petitions for Certiorari before the Court of Appeals. In a Decision [47] dated December 28, 2017, the Court of Appeals found that no grave abuse of discretion can be attributed to the National Labor Relations Commission when it handed down its questioned Decision and Resolution. Thus, it dismissed the Petitions for Certiorari separately filed by Disc Contractors and Villafuerte et al. It disposed of the said case in this wise: WHEREFORE, premises considered, the petitions in CA-G.R. SP No. 148641 and in CA-G.R. SP No. 148711 are hereby DISMISSED. The assailed June 30, 2016 Decision and the September 30, 2016 Resolution of the National Labor Relations Commission are hereby AFFIRMED. No costs. SO ORDERED. [48] Both parties moved for partial reconsideration, but the Court of Appeals denied the same in a Resolution. [49] Its dispositive portion reads: WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant Motion for Reconsideration is hereby DENIED for lack of merit. Accordingly, Our Decision dated December 28, 2017 sought to be reconsidered is hereby SUSTAINED in toto. SO ORDERED. [50] Undaunted, both parties are now before this Court via their respective Petitions for Review on Certiorari. G.R. Nos. 240202-03 Villafuerte et al. contend that the Court of Appeals was correct when it affirmed the National Labor Relations Commission's ruling entitling them to separation pay, not only for the period covering May 21, 2013 until September 30, 2015, but from the time they started working for the company. However, according to them, the Court of Appeals erred when it affirmed the National Labor Relations Commission's ruling reducing the award of separation pay to just 50% of their basic salary for every year of service instead of the rate of 100%. Considering that Disc Contractors voluntarily paid them their respective separation pay in an amount equivalent to 100% of their basic salary for the period covering May 21, 2013 to September 30, 2015, their separation pay covering the period that they were initially hired until May 20, 2013 must also be computed at 100%. The National Labor Relations Commission and the Court of Appeals cannot prohibit Disc Contractors from granting its employees benefits that are more favorable to them. [51] Villafuerte et al. also claim that the Court of Appeals erred when it affirmed the National Labor Relations Commission's ruling entitling them to midyear bonus only from May 21, 2013 until their separation from the company. They argue that because they are entitled to separation pay for the entire period of their employment, they must also be entitled to the grant of midyear bonus from their initial hiring until their separation therefrom. [52] They likewise assert that it was grave error for the Court of Appeals to affirm the ruling of the National Labor Relations Commission not entitling them to vacation leave, sick leave, anniversary bonus, birthday leave, uniform allowance, moral damages, and exemplary damages for the following reasons: (a) They were only paid their vacation leave and sick leave benefits for the period of their employment from May 21, 2013 until September 30, 2015, when they should be accorded the said benefits from the date of their initial hiring until their separation therefrom since they were adjudged to be regular employees of Disc Contractors; [53] and (b) No evidence is necessary to prove their entitlement to anniversary bonus, birthday leave and uniform allowance because the company itself claimed that these benefits are reserved for regular employees. Since they are regular employees of Disc Corporation, they should automatically be granted these benefits from the date of their initial hiring until their separation therefrom. In any event, their entitlement thereto is put to rest by the Memorandum [54] issued by PNCC which granted the said benefits to all the employees of its subsidiaries; [55] and (c) The company's total indifference, complete inaction and deliberate refusal to pay their just and valid monetary claims; malicious use of deceptive and fraudulent schemes of employment agreements to prevent them from attaining regular status of employment; and deliberate and malicious concealment of material and relevant documents showing their entitlement to their monetary claims justify the award to them of moral and exemplary damages. [56] For its part, Disc Contractors claims that the Court of Appeals did not commit any error when it upheld the decision of the National Labor Relations Commission reducing the award of separation pay to 50% of their monthly salary; and denying the claim for midyear bonus for every year of service prior to 2013, vacation and sick leave pay, anniversary bonus, birthday leave pay, uniform allowance, moral damages and exemplary damages. It maintains that: (1) the National Labor Relations Commission correctly computed the separation pay at the rate of 50% and deducted the amount of separation pay already received by Villafuerte et al. While nothing prohibits employers from acting with benevolence and granting monetary benefits over and above the statutory requirements, nothing can also compel them to be benevolent absent any contractual agreement between the parties; (2) Villafuerte et al. never claimed before the labor tribunals midyear bonus prior to 2013. In fact, a reading of their Position Paper shows that the reason they filed their labor complaint was the discontinuance of the grant of midyear bonus starting 2013. In any event, their claim for midyear bonus for the period prior to 2013 has already prescribed; (3) Villafuerte et al. never denied receiving their vacation and sick leave pay; (4) Villafuerte et al. failed to show any contractual agreement between them and the company that would bind the latter to give them anniversary bonus, birthday leave pay, and uniform allowance; and (5) no bad faith or malice on the part of Disc Contractors was established as would make it liable for moral and exemplary damages. [57] G.R. Nos. 240462-63 Disc Contractors contends that the Court of Appeals gravely erred when it dismissed its Petition notwithstanding the lack of basis in the National Labor Relations Commission's grant of midyear bonus, rice subsidy, health maintenance organizations benefits, and attorney's fees to Villafuerte et al. It insists the Court of Appeals could not just conclude that the National Labor Relations Commission's ruling was supported by substantial evidence, without stating the substantial evidence it was referring to or by using pieces of evidence which are not in any way connected to the claim. [58] Disc Contractors explains that the National Labor Relations Commission misappreciated the Pabion case when it summarily concluded that Philippine National Construction Corporation is a private corporation. The said case shows that the characterization of Philippine National Construction Corporation as non-government-owned and controlled corporation was for the limited purpose of deciding the applicability of Section 16 of Administrative Order 59, [59] that is, whether the Securities and Exchange Commission has jurisdiction over Philippine National Construction Corporation and may order it to hold a shareholders' meeting for the purpose of electing its board of directors. It insists that by virtue of Letter of Instruction No. 1295, [60] the government effectively owned majority of Philippine National Construction Corporation's shares through a debt-to-equity conversion. Pursuant to the provisions of Republic Act No. 10149, Philippine National Construction Corporation, being owned by the government, and Disc Corporation, a subsidiary fully owned by Philippine National Construction Corporation, are both considered as government-owned and controlled corporations within the powers of Governance Commission for Government-Owned and Controlled Corporations. As such, Disc Contractors is bound by the issuance of Governance Commission for Government-Owned and Controlled Corporations, which did not recommend the disbursement of midyear bonus absent the prior approval of the President of the Philippines. [61] Clearly, the National Labor Relations Commission went beyond its jurisdiction when it awarded the midyear bonus; and the Court of Appeals was in grave error when it found that substantial evidence supported its ruling. Disc Contractors further insists that no substantial evidence supports the findings that Villafuerte et al. are entitled to rice subsidy and health maintenance organizations benefits. It points out that the Certification it issued cannot be used as basis for the grant of the said benefits prior to May 21, 2013 because the amounts paid, as reflected in the said Certification, pertain to the rice subsidy and health maintenance organizations benefits for the period covering May 21, 2013 until September 30, 2015 only. Absent any document or any agreement for the grant of these nonstatutory benefits prior to May 21, 2013, the same cannot be granted to them. [62] The grant of attorney's fees likewise lacks factual and legal basis given no finding that it unlawfully withheld the wages of Villafuerte et al. or that it acted with malice in not paying their monetary claims. [63] Villafuerte et al. counters that the Court of Appeals correctly ruled that Philippine National Construction Corporation, the parent company of Disc Corporation, is not a government-owned and controlled corporation, citing Pasion, Cuenca v. Hon. Atas, [64] and PNCC v. Erece, Jr. Being a wholly owned subsidiary of Philippine National Construction Corporation, Disc Corporation is also a private corporation like its parent company. As such, it could not invoke Republic Act No. 10149 to support its position that it is not obliged to give them their midyear bonus without the prior approval of the President since the said law applies only to government-owned and controlled corporation, which it is not. Having deliberately, continuously, and voluntarily granted and paid the annual midyear bonus to its employees for 14 years by virtue of board resolutions and memoranda duly passed by its Board of Directors, the same cannot be peremptorily withdrawn without violating Article 100 of the Labor Code. As Disc Contractors' regular employees, they insist that they are entitled to be paid this bonus from the time of their initial hiring until their separation in 2015. [65] The grant to them of rice subsidy, health maintenance organizations benefits, and attorney's fees are also legally justified. [66]","Guided by these considerations, this Court finds that the Court of Appeals erred in not ascribing grave abuse of discretion on the part of the National Labor Relations Commission when it ruled that Villafuerte et al. are: (a) entitled to: (1) midyear bonus and (2) separation pay equivalent to one-half month pay for every year of their service reckoned from the date of their initial hiring until September 30, 2015; and (b) not entitled to (1) vacation leave; (2) sick leave; (3) anniversary bonus; (4) birthday leave pay; and (5) uniform allowance. The National Labor Relations Commission ruling; is not supported by the evidence proffered, the applicable laws and jurisprudence.","Disc Contractors is a government- owned and controlled corporation and is governed by the provisions of Presidential Decree No. 1597 and Republic Act No. 10149... Since Philippine National Construction Corporation is a government-owned and controlled corporation, it naturally follows that Disc Corporation, its wholly-owned subsidiary, is likewise a government-owned and controlled corporation. As a government-owned and controlled corporation incorporated under the Corporation Code, there is no question that Disc Contractors is covered by the Labor Code. [73] However, PNCC v. NLRC cautions that although a nonchartered government-owned and controlled corporation is governed by the Labor Code, it is not exempt from the coverage of the National Position Classification and Compensation Plan approved by the President as well as the Compensation and Position Classification System pursuant to Republic Act No. 10149. In other words, its employees are without any right to negotiate the economic terms of their employment particularly their salaries, emoluments, incentives, allowances, and other benefits since these must conform to compensation and classification standards laid down by applicable laws. [74] Disc Contractors is not liable to pay Villafuerte et al mid-year bonus from the date of their initial hiring until their separation from the company... Similarly, this Court must necessarily rule that Disc Contractors did not violate Article 100 of the Labor Code when it did not. grant Villafuerte et al.'s midyear bonus for the years 2013 to 2015 as the same did not bear the approval of the President, a requisite imposed by Section 5 [76] of Presidential Decree No. 1597 as well as Section 10 [77] of Republic Act No. 10149. It must be emphasized that as a government-owned and controlled corporation, Disc Contractors funds are considered public funds; [78] hence it is not at liberty to disburse such as it saw fit especially so when there are laws imposing specific requirements for its lawful spending. In any event, it is clear from Villafuerte et al.'s own allegations as set forth in the Position Paper they filed before the labor arbiter that their Complaint for midyear bonus arose from the failure of the company to release the same starting 2013... The separation pay covering the period Villafuerte et al. were initially hired until May 20, 2013 must be computed at the rate of one-half month pay for every year of their service... However, the same cannot be said of the separation pay these employees must be paid from the start of their employment until May 20, 2013. It must be taken into account that the grant of separation pay for this period was brought about by the decision of the labor arbiter—which was never questioned by Disc Contractors—that Villafuerte et al. must be regarded as Disc Contractors' regular employees due to the length of time they had been working for the company as well as the nature of work they do for it. As such, the Court of Appeals correctly affirmed the ruling of the National Labor Relations Commission which limited the computation of the separation pay for this period to 50% of their monthly salary as this is the rate imposed by Article 298. Disc Contractors is in no way bound, and it cannot be ordered, to give the same at the rate of 100% of their monthly salary inasmuch as generosity cannot be compelled. Since Villafuerte et al. recognize that the contractual completion bonus they already received to be the equivalent of separation pay, such amounts plus the separation pay they received for the period covering May 21, 2013 to September 30, 2015 must be deducted from the separation pay, if any, that they will still receive following the pronouncement in its recomputation as set forth above. Villafuerte et al. are entitled to vacation and sick leave benefits from the time of their initial, hiring until May 20, 2013... Since subject employees are deemed regular employees of Disc Contractors, the latter is liable to pay their unpaid 15 days vacation leave and 15 days sick leave computed from the day they were first hired until May 20, 2013, the company having paid only such benefits from May 21, 2013 until its closure on September 30, 2015. Any amount received by them covering the period of their initial hiring until May 20, 2013 by way of service incentive leave must be deducted from their respective vacation leave and sick leave pay differentials. Villafuerte et al. are entitled to anniversary bonus, birthday leave, uniform allowance, rice subsidy and health maintenance organizations benefits... Having made such statement in its Supplemental Position Paper, Disc Contractors cannot be allowed to take a stand contrary to what it had pleaded for the same are considered judicial admissions, not needing any proof, and are conclusive against the pleader. As such, it was grave error for the Court of Appeals and the National Labor Relations Commission to still require Villafuerte et al. to present evidence to prove their entitlement to anniversary bonus, birthday leave pay, and uniform allowance as these benefits automatically vested upon them when they were pronounced as regular employees of Disc Contractors without the need of any proof by virtue of statement made by the company. Corollarily, the Court of Appeals ruled correctly when it found the ruling of the National Labor Relations Commission to grant health maintenance organizations benefits and rice subsidy to Villafuerte et al. supported by substantial evidence. To repeat, Disc Contractors' own declaration that regular employees are entitled to health maintenance organizations benefits and rice subsidy provides sufficient basis for the grant. Villafuerte et al. are entitled to attorney's fees but not to moral damages and exemplary damages... The Court of Appeals acted correctly when it affirmed the National Labor Relations Commission ruling, which deleted the awards for moral and exemplary damages as the same lacked basis. Be that as it may, the withholding of Villafuerte et al.'s monetary claims entitles them to an award of attorney's fees. The general rule that attorney's fees may only be awarded upon proof of bad faith takes a different turn when it comes to labor cases. The settled rule in labor law is that the withholding of wages need not be coupled with malice or bad faith to justify the grant of attorney's fees under Article 111 of the Labor Code. All that is required is that the lawful wages were not paid without justification thereby compelling the employee to litigate. [116] Villafuerte et al.'s monetary claims are subject to the prescriptive periods provided in Article 306 of the Labor Code and Article 1146 of the Civil Code... Since Villafuerte et al. filed their claim for these benefits only on October 27, 2015, they are only entitled to such benefits for the years 2013 to 2015, as the benefits for the years prior to 2013 are already barred by the three-year prescriptive period.","ACCORDINGLY, this Court resolves to PARTIALLY GRANT the Petitions in G.R.

"G.R. No. 242928, June 27, 2022","LOUE B. MUTIA, PETITIONER, VS. C.F. SHARP CREW MGT., INC., NORWEGIAN CRUISE LINES, M/V NORWEGIAN JADE AND JUAN JOSE P. ROCHA, RESPONDENTS.","In September 2013, petitioner Loue Mutia (Mutia) was hired as an assistant cook by respondent C.F. Sharp Crew Management, Inc. (C.F. Sharp) on behalf of its foreign principal, respondent Norwegian Cruise Lines (NCL).[5] Mutia's duties include preparing meals for passengers and crew of the M/V Norwegian Jade.[6] The employment contract is covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), which grants employees a maximum benefit of US$100,000.00 in case of disability resulting in loss of profession.[7] Before boarding the vessel, Mutia underwent a pre-employment medical examination (PEME). When asked whether he had a previous medical condition, including ear trouble and deafness, Mutia ticked the box ""No.""[8] However, his audiometry results showed that Mutia has ""mild hearing loss, bilateral,""[9] as reflected in the PEME. Even so, he was found fit to work. The attestation in his PEME states: The seafarer concerned is not suffering from any medical condition likely to be aggravated by sea service or to render the seafarer unfit for such service or to endanger the health of other persons on board.[10] On October 13, 2013, Mutia was transferring a box containing 50 kilograms of chicken meat onto a trolley when the trolley suddenly moved, forcing him to carry the full weight of the box.[11] As a result, he felt a snap on his back, suddenly felt weak, and fell to the floor.[12] After the incident, he started to feel lower back pain and requested an examination.[13] The request was denied, and Mutia was directed to continue his chores.[14] On another occasion, and without his back pain resolved, Mutia accidentally dropped one kilo of chicken seasoning into a pot of boiling corn soup while cooking, and the hot liquid splashed towards his face and eyes.[15] He went off-balance and fell face down on the floor.[16] He was brought to a Slovenian Clinic on the following day because he could no longer stand due to severe lower back pain.[17] He was administered an intramuscular analgesic and went back on board.[18] However, Mutia's condition did not improve, and he was subsequently brought to a Croatian hospital, where he underwent medical examinations.[19] The computerized tomography (CT) scan of the brain and eye fundus examination yielded normal results, but the doctors suspected a ""clear vision disorder.""[20] On November 4, 2013, Mutia was repatriated to the Philippines and was referred to Shiphealth, Inc. for initial evaluation.[21] His lumbar spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed that he has ""L5-S1 desiccation with annular tear.""[22] He was referred to an orthopedic surgeon and was advised to undergo physical therapy and further evaluation.[23] On November 14, 2013, Mutia was admitted to the hospital to examine his eye problem. He was later discharged after the MRI showed ""normal orbits with no intraorbital mass lesion and optic nerve thickening or abnormal enhancements.""[24] Later, Mutia was readmitted to the hospital for additional examinations. He was then diagnosed with ""Multiple Sclerosis"" and ""Blurring of Vision.""[25] He underwent a series of check-ups, examinations, and therapies from December 18, 2013 to March 14, 2014.[26] Despite the therapies, Mutia still complained of lower back pains. This continuing complaint prompted the attending physician to request Shiphealth, Inc. for a ""Thoracic MRI with Contrast.""[27] Mutia underwent an MRI, but the results were not released.[28] Then, respondents C.F. Sharp and NCL stopped paying for Mutia's treatment.[29] On April 2, 2014, the attending physician issued a medical certificate to enable Mutia to claim disability benefits with the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA). The certificate stated that Mutia has the following medical conditions: ""a) Disc degeneration, L5-S1; b) Neuromyelitis optica; c) To consider Behçet's disease; and d) s/b Lumbar tap.""[30] On April 8, 2014, the OWWA's government physician confirmed that Mutia has ""Neuromyelitis optica"" and certified his claim for permanent total disability benefits for loss of function of both eyes.[31] On April 24, 2014, Mutia sought the medical opinion of another physician who found that he was unfit for duty as a seafarer in whatever capacity due to herniated disc at L5-S1.[32] On July 9, 2014, Mutia filed a complaint for permanent total disability benefits, moral and exemplary damages, and attorney's fees. He claimed that he was incapacitated to perform his duties for more than 120 days, and the company-designated physician failed to make a definitive assessment of his medical condition within the allowed period. The incomplete medical attention justifies his claim for damages.[33] Respondents countered that Mutia is disqualified from claiming permanent total disability benefits because he materially concealed a pre-existing medical condition in his PEME.[34] They claimed that Mutia was earlier diagnosed with ""[a]cute otitis media with perforated tympanic membrane"" (acute otitis media) and had instituted a claim for disability benefits with his former employee.[35] They point to Mutia's affidavit of quitclaim in favor of his previous employer.[36] Thus, they assert that Section 20(E) of the 2010 POEA-SEC, which disqualifies seafarers from claiming disability benefits if they conceal their previous medical condition, is applicable.[37]","In its Decision dated January 10, 2018, the CA rejected Mutia's arguments. Relying on the legal maxim of ""Ubi lex non distinguit, nec nos distinguire debemos,""[45] it opined that Section 20(E) of the 2010 POEA-SEC did not distinguish the type of pre-existing medical condition required to be disclosed. Thus, the provision should not be limited to medical conditions having a direct causal connection to the concealed illness.[46] Therefore, Mutia's claim for disability benefits is barred. To support the application of Section 20(E), the CA relied on Vetyard Terminals & Shipping Terminals v. Perez that ""willful concealment of a vital information in his PEME disqualified him from claiming disability benefits pursuant to Section 20(E) of the POEA-SEC x x x.""[47]","Mutia's acute otitis media does not fall under any of the conditions mentioned constituting a pre-existing illness. Item 11 (a) of the 2010 POEA-SEC definition of terms is not applicable because it presupposes that the seafarer is advised to undergo treatment for a continuing illness or condition. The respondents merely point out a statement in Mutia's affidavit that he executed a quitclaim in favor of his previous employer. The specific details on Mutia's ear illness, whether it was already healed or needed further treatment, are unclear. Due to insufficient evidence, it is doubtful whether Mutia still had ""[a]cute otitis media with perforated tympanic membrane"" when he underwent the PEME and boarded M/V Norwegian Jade. It is worth emphasizing that the employer bears the burden to prove the concealment of a pre-existing illness or injury.[64] The respondents did not even examine Mutia's ear condition and solely relied on his affidavit of quitclaim. The audiometry results indicating ""mild hearing loss, bilateral"" could not be automatically attributed to Mutia's prior ear illness, absent any evaluation or expert opinion. The Court cannot simply presume the connection between the acute otitis media and the ""mild hearing loss, bilateral"" because the affidavit mentioned ""recovery."" Assuming that the ""mild hearing loss, bilateral"" should be attributed to Mutia's acute otitis media, Item 11 (b) of the 2010 POEA-SEC is also not applicable. The phrase ""and such cannot be diagnosed during the PEME"" excluded Mutia's acute otitis media as a pre-existing illness. It is undisputed that the audiometry result of Mutia's hearing capacity is not within the normal range. The PEME showed that Mutia has ""mild hearing loss, bilateral."" Further, Section 20(E) of the 2010 POEA-SEC will still be inapplicable because Mutia's prior ear illness is unrelated to his present medical conditions. There is no proof that the ear condition (acute otitis media) caused or aggravated Mutia's ""L5-S1 desiccation with annular tear,"" ""Multiple Sclerosis,"" ""Blurring of Vision,"" and ""Neuromyelitis optica"" because the respondents did not issue a final medical assessment and did not even examine Mutia's ear. Although Section 20(E) of the 2010 POEA-SEC did not specifically mention that the concealed illness or injury must be related to the seafarer's present illness or injury. However, the concealment must be fraudulent.[71] A finding of fraudulent concealment means that a person failed to disclose the truth and that the non-disclosure is deliberate and for a malicious purpose.[72] The fraudulent concealment must be coupled with an intent to deceive and profit from that deception.[73] Here, the unrelatedness of Mutia's prior ear illness and his present medical conditions negates an intent to profit from the concealment. The reasonable interpretation of Section 20(E) is that the employer should not be held liable for disability arising from the concealed illness or injury. This interpretation is consistent with the constitutional policy guaranteeing the full protection of labor[76] and that the POEA-SEC is imbued with public interest.[77] In sum, Section 20(E) of the 2010 POEA-SEC is applicable if the following conditions are met: (1) the seafarer is suffering from a pre-existing illness or injury as defined under Item 11 (b) of the 2010 POEA-SEC, (2) the seafarer intentionally concealed the illness or injury, (3) the concealed pre-existing illness or injury has a causal or reasonable connection with the illness or injury suffered during the seafarer's contract.[79] Under the last condition, it is enough that the concealed illness or injury contributed to the seafarer's disability.[80].","ACCORDINGLY, the petition is GRANTED. The Court of Appeals Decision dated January 10, 2018 and Resolution dated October 26, 2018, in CA-G.R. SP No. 146859 are REVERSED.

"G.R. No. 254251, June 22, 2022","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. DANILO CONDE Y MINA, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","The case stemmed from an Information charging accused-appellant with Murder under Article 248 of the RPC for killing Reynaldo Adlawan y Antonio (Reynaldo). The accusatory portion reads: That on or about the 24th day of February 2013, in the Municipality of San Mateo, Province of Rizal, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with the use of a kitchen knife, with intent to kill did then and there willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously attack, assault and stab one Reynaldo Adlawan y Antonio, hitting on [ sic ] the chest, thereby inflicting upon the latter [ sic ] stab wound which directly caused his death, the offense having been attended by qualifying circumstances of treachery and evident premeditation, which qualify such killing to murder, aggravated by the circumstance of nighttime. x x x. Version of the Prosecution: On February 24, 2013, at around 11:50 in the evening, Jeffrey Atibagos (Jeffrey) was at the house of his sister, Mary Jane (Jingjing) in Patiis, San Mateo, Rizal drinking with Danilo Conde, Reynaldo Adlawan (the deceased), and Rogelio Cabangisan (Roel). While they were drinking and having a casual conversation, Jeffrey saw the accused-appellant, Danilo Conde, who was seated beside him, suddenly and without provocation, stabbed [ sic ] the deceased who was seated beside the accused-appellant. Roel, who was in front of the accused-appellant also saw the latter leaning on his chair with his hands crossed while they were casually conversing, when suddenly the accused-appellant stabbed the deceased on [ sic ] the chest with a knife which the accused-appellant had been secretly holding. Roel heard the deceased say, 'Pareng Danny, bakit mo ako sinaksak.' When Roel asked the accused-appellant why he stabbed the deceased, he also stabbed Roel but he was able to parry the attack. Roel and Jeffrey brought the deceased to the St. Matthews Hospital but the latter already expired. Version of the Defense: Accused DANILO CONDE vehemently denied the charge against him and maintained that on 24 February 2013, around 11 to 12 o'clock in the evening, [Jeffrey] told him to buy 'pulutan' as they will have a drinking spree at the house of Rogelio together with Reynaldo. The accused was able to buy said pulutan at a nearby ihawan but was unable to return as the lady to [sic] whom he bought the pulutan invited him to have a drinking spree at the said ihawan. After consuming four (4) bottles of Red Horse and feeling drunk, the accused fell asleep at the waiting shed. Thereafter, he was awakened by [Jeffrey] and Rogelio and told him that he stabbed Reynaldo.","The RTC found Danilo Conde y Mina (accused-appellant) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC). In its Decision dated July 4, 2017, the RTC found accused appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder, qualified by treachery and evident premeditation, and sentenced him to suffer the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua. The CA Decision dated August 16, 2019, affirmed the RTC Decision but ruled that the prosecution was only able to prove the qualifying circumstance of treachery.","The appeal is unmeritorious. It is settled that the factual findings of the trial court are entitled to great weight and respect, especially when they are affirmed by the appellate court. x x x After a judicious perusal of the records of the case, the Court finds no compelling reason to depart from the uniform factual findings of the RTC and the CA. Thus the Court affirms accused-appellant's conviction for the crime of Murder. x x x Three prosecution eyewitnesses: Jeffrey, Rogelio, and Mary Jane, positively identified accused-appellant as the person who suddenly stabbed Reynaldo on his chest. x x x Against the factual backdrop of the instant case, all that accused-appellant offered was the weak defense of denial and alibi. x x x Furthermore, the prosecution proved the qualifying circumstance of treachery. x x x The unexpectedness of the attack deprived Reynaldo of any chance to defend himself, thereby ensuring the consummation of the offense without risk to accused-appellant arising from the defense that Reynaldo might have made. x x x the Court upholds the CA's findings that the qualifying circumstance of evident premeditation was not present in the commission of the crime. x x x As for the penalty, the RTC and the CA correctly imposed the sentence of reclusion perpetua in accordance with Article 248 of the RPC. However, the Court modifies the awards imposed by the CA. The award of P100,000.00 as civil indemnity, P100,000.00 as moral damages, and P100,000.00 as exemplary damages should be reduced to P75,000.00 each to conform with the ruling in People v. Jugueta (Jugueta). In addition, the CA correctly awarded actual damages for funeral expenses in the amount of P30,225.00 as this was adequately supported by evidence. The imposition of a legal interest rate of six percent (6%) interest per annum on all monetary awards from the finality of the decision until full payment is likewise proper.","WHEREFORE, the appeal is DISMISSED. The Decision dated August 16, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 10475 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. Accused-appellant Danilo Conde y Mina is hereby sentenced to a penalty of reclusion perpetua, and is likewise ordered to pay the heirs of Reynaldo Adlawan y Antonio the award of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages, P75,000.00 as exemplary damages, and P30,225.00 as actual damages.

"G.R. No. 242831, June 22, 2022","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. VICTOR ALCIRA Y MADRIAGA ALSO KNOWN AS [A.K.A.] BUDDHA, ACCUSED-APPELLANT,MERLEN CABEROS Y GERONIMO AND VICTOR ALCIRA Y MADRIAGA, ALSO KNOWN AS [A.K.A.] BUDDHA, ACCUSED.","On June 17, 2015, a buy-bust operation was conducted against Alcira. The operation was triggered by an information received by Senior Police Officer 1 Emil Norella Janairo (SPO1 Janairo) from a civilian informant that Alcira and his cohorts were allegedly engaged in using and selling illegal drugs, and that they possessed unlicensed firearm.[3] Thereafter, PSI Calonge formed a team for the conduct of a buy-bust operation. During the briefing, it was agreed that SPO1 Janairo would act as the poseur-buyer while PSI Calonge, Police Officer 2 (PO2) Renato Cuevas, Police Officer 1 (PO1) Alfredo Requinto, and PO2 Ronald Suelto would act as back-up officers. Before leaving the police station, the team prepared the Pre-Operation Report and Coordination Report with the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA). The serial numbers of the three pieces of P100.00 bill that would be used in the buy-bust operation were likewise recorded in the blotter book. Thereafter, the confidential informant accompanied the team in going to the house of Alcira located in Purok 4, Barangay Turbina, Calamba City, Laguna.[4] When the buy-bust team reached the target area, SPO1 Janairo and the confidential informant saw Alcira about to enter the house of a certain Merlen Caberos (Caberos), which was just a few meters away from Alcira's house. The informant then called Alcira and introduced him to SPO1 Janairo. The informant told Alcira, ""Huwag kang magalala dito[,]"" to which SPO1 Janairo added that he was interested in purchasing P300.00 worth of shabu. Alcira handed to SPO1 Janairo a plastic sachet with white crystalline substance in exchange for the money he received from the latter. Immediately thereafter, SPO1 Janairo introduced himself as a police officer and ordered Alcira to lie face down on the ground. While lying face down, SPO1 Janairo noticed a gun protruding at the back of Alcira. He then handcuffed Alcira before retrieving the gun tucked at the back of his waist. The other police officers who were positioned nearby approached them for assistance. This allowed SPO1 Janairo to search Alcira for other contraband items, which led to the recovery of two plastic sachets that also contained white crystalline substance.[5] In the midst of the commotion, SPO1 Janairo noticed Caberos standing nearby holding a small plastic sachet with white crystalline substance. This prompted him to confiscate the same and search her for other contraband items. SPO1 Janairo was then able to recover two plastic sachets with white crystalline substance from her pocket.[6] While they were still in the place of arrest, SPO1 Janairo marked all the items that he seized from Alcira and Caberos as follows: SEIZED ITEM - Caliber .38 revolver, without serial number, and the five (5) pieces of live ammunition that he recovered from Alcira; MARKING - ""VA-3""; SEIZED ITEM - One plastic sachet that he purchased from Alcira; MARKING - ""PNP-BB""; SEIZED ITEM - Two plastic sachets that he found in Alcira's pocket; MARKING - ""VA-1"" and ""VA-2""; SEIZED ITEM - Three plastic sachets that were found in Merlen Caberos' possession; MARKING - ""MC-1"", ""MC-2"" and ""MC-3"".[7] SPO1 Janairo also conducted an inventory of the seized items at the place of arrest.[8] The arrest, marking, and inventory were all witnessed by Alcira, Ronald de Leon, a member of the Calamba City Press Corps, and Danilo Gelacio, a barangay official. It was also SPO1 Janairo who prepared the requests for drug test and the laboratory examination to the crime laboratory, and entered the same in the police blotter. During his testimony, SPO1 Janairo claimed that he likewise took photographs of the seized items. Thereafter, he personally delivered the request and the seized items to the crime laboratory for examination. At the crime laboratory forensic chemist Police Chief Inspector Donna Villa P. Huelgas (PCI Huelgas) personally received the request and the six heat-sealed transparent plastic sachets, each containing white crystalline substance marked as: ""PNP-BB, MC-1, MC-2, MC-3, VA-1, and VA-2."" After conducting a qualitative examination, PCI Huelgas made the following findings in her Chemistry Report No. D-1543-15,[9] to wit: SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: A (PNP-BB) 0.03 gram, B (MC-1) 0.14 gram, C (MC-2) 0.04 gram, D (MC-3) 0.05 gram, E (VA-1) 0.04 gram, F (VA-2) 0.06 gram. FINDINGS: Qualitative examination conducted on specimens A to F gave POSITIVE result to the tests for the presence of Methamphetamine Hydrochloride (Shabu), a dangerous drug. CONCLUSION: Specimens A to F contain Methamphetamine Hydrochloride (Shabu), a dangerous drug.[10] Accordingly, Alcira was charged with violation of Sections 5 and 11, of Article II of R.A. No. 9165 and Section 28(a) in relation to paragraph (e) of R.A. No. 10591, under Criminal Case Nos. 24915-15-C, 24916-15-C, and 24917-15-C. Caberos was charged with violation of Section 11 Article II of R.A. No. 9165 (Criminal Case No. 24914-15-C). In his defense, Alcira testified that he was inside his house putting cement on the floor in the morning of June 17, 2015. Police officers, including Amador, whom he knew, entered his house, found his wallet, and brought him outside where he was arrested near Caberos’ house, claiming he saw SPO1 Janairo for the first time then and denied all charges.[15] On February 16, 2017, the RTC rendered a Judgment[16] finding Alcira guilty of illegal sale and possession of dangerous drugs, and illegal possession of firearms. The RTC acquitted Caberos for failure of the prosecution to prove her guilt beyond reasonable doubt, finding she was merely a bystander.[17] The RTC held that the prosecution proved all elements against Alcira despite partial compliance with chain of custody, as the integrity of seized items was preserved. Alcira appealed to the CA, which affirmed the Judgment rendered by the RTC in its Decision[19] dated May 23, 2018. The CA concurred that the prosecution proved all elements against Alcira and that there was substantial compliance with the chain of custody rule. The CA ruled that the buy-bust operation was regularly performed and purported irregularities were trivial and immaterial.[20]","ACCORDINGLY, the appeal is PARTIALLY GRANTED. The Decision dated May 23, 2018 rendered by the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 09161 is hereby MODIFIED. Accused-appellant Victor Alcira y Madriaga is hereby ACQUITTED of the charge of illegal sale and possession of dangerous drugs, as defined and penalized under Sections 5 and 11, respectively, of Article II of R.A. No. 9165, as amended by R.A. No. 10640. The Regional Trial Court is directed to turn over the seized sachets of shabu to the Dangerous Drugs Board for destruction in accordance with law. For violation of Section 28(a) in relation to par. (e) of R.A. No. 10591, accused-appellant Victor Alcira y Madriaga is hereby found GUILTY and is sentenced to suffer the penalty of imprisonment of eight (8) years, eight (8) months, and one (1) day, as minimum, to ten (10) years, eight (8) months, and one (1) day, as maximum. SO ORDERED.","Upon a careful review of the records of this case, this Court finds the appeal to be meritorious insofar as accused-appellant's conviction of Sections 5 and 11 of Article II of R.A. No. 9165, as amended, is concerned. His conviction for illegal possession of firearms under R.A. No. 10591, nonetheless, stands. For the drug charges, the prosecution failed to account for the links in the chain of custody. Specifically, the police officers failed to take photographs of the seized items, and no justifiable explanation was provided for this deviation. Second, there was no showing of a proper turnover from the apprehending officer (SPO1 Janairo) to the investigating officer (P/Supt. Ortega), creating a break in the second link of custody. Third, it was unclear what happened to the seized drugs after the laboratory examination, as the stipulation concerning the forensic chemist's testimony did not clarify the custody during that period. Strict adherence to the chain of custody rule is required, especially since the seized amount (0.13 gram) is minuscule and highly susceptible to tampering. The failure to preserve the integrity of the corpus delicti mandates Alcira's acquittal for drug charges. With respect to accused-appellant's violation of R.A. No. 10591 (illegal possession of firearms), this crime is separate and distinct. The Court upheld the uniform findings of the RTC and the CA that there was no irregularity in the conduct of the buy-bust operation which led to the seizure of the dangerous drugs and the unlicensed firearm. Therefore, the items seized were not the result of an unreasonable search. The crime of illegal possession of firearms can proceed independently. The corpus delicti for illegal possession of firearms is the lack of license, which was proven by the Certification issued by the Firearms and Explosives Office of the Philippine National Police. Since Alcira was found in possession of a .38 revolver loaded with five ammunitions without authority, the elements of the crime were established beyond reasonable doubt. Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law and considering the firearm was loaded (a condition raising the penalty one degree higher under R.A. No. 10591), the penalty must be modified.","PARTIALLY GRANTED. Accused-appellant Victor Alcira y Madriaga is ACQUITTED of illegal sale and possession of dangerous drugs (Sections 5 and 11, Article II of R.A. No. 9165, as amended by R.A. No. 10640). Accused-appellant Victor Alcira y Madriaga is found GUILTY of violation of Section 28(a) in relation to par. (e) of R.A. No. 10591 (Illegal Possession of Firearms) and sentenced to eight (8) years, eight (8) months, and one (1) day, as minimum, to ten (10) years, eight (8) months, and one (1) day, as maximum."

Lopez, Officer-­in-Charge, Employees' Leave Division, Office of Administrative Services, Office of the Court Administrator (OCA), showed that Christopher E. Salao (respondent), Clerk III of Branch 32, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Iloilo City, was tardy 10 times in January 2019 and 11 times in March 2019. In its 1st Indorsement[2] dated September 12, 2019, the OCA required respondent to comment on the above report. Despite receipt on September 15, 2019, as shown by the registry receipt card,[3] respondent failed to file his comment. Thus, the OCA sent a tracer[4] dated February 4, 2020 reiterating its directive in its 1st Indorsement; however, the OCA did not receive any response.[5]","The Court agrees with the JIB's findings as to respondent's culpability but modifies its findings as regards the administrative offense violated and the corresponding penalty in accordance with Rule 140 of the Rules of Court, as amended by A.M. No. 21-08-09-SC[17] (Revised Rule 140). . . . From the foregoing, the Revised Rule 140 should be applicable in respondent's case. Here, it was established that respondent is guilty of Habitual Tardiness. . . . The Court agrees with the JIB that respondent should be held administratively liable for disregarding the OCA's directives which showed his disrespect for the Court; however, the less grave offense of Insubordination under Section 50(D)(5) of the 2017 RACCS was not carried over in the Revised Rule 140. Nonetheless, he is liable for Violation of Supreme Court Directives under Section 15(e)[26] of the Revised Rule 140.","WHEREFORE, the Court resolves to RE-DOCKET this case as a regular administrative matter. Further, the Court finds respondent Christopher E. Salao, Clerk III of Branch 32, Regional Trial Court, Iloilo City, Iloilo, GUILTY of the less serious charges of Habitual Tardiness and Violation of Supreme Court Directives under Section 15(c) and (e), respectively, of Rule 140 of the Rules of Court, as amended by A.M.

FENIS, AND CONSOLIDATED BUILDING MAINTENANCE, INC., RESPONDENTS.","Petitioner Philippine Pizza, Inc. (PPI) is the franchisee and operator of Pizza Hut. CBMI is a corporation providing maintenance and allied services. On January 10, 2014, respondents Tumpang, Ramo, and Fenis filed a complaint for regularization with the Labor Arbiter (LA), alleging that PPI hired them as delivery riders (2003, 2004, and 2008) and that CBMI was a labor-only contractor, as PPI exercised control and owned the tools they used. The LA dismissed the complaint for lack of merit, finding that CBMI was the legitimate job contractor and the employer, as respondents failed to prove PPI exercised control or owned the motorcycles. The NLRC affirmed the LA's ruling. Respondents then filed a Petition for Certiorari before the CA, which subsequently reversed the NLRC/LA rulings. The CA held that CBMI was a labor-only contractor because the duties of delivery riders were necessary and desirable to PPI's business, thus making PPI the employer. Aggrieved, PPI filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari before the Supreme Court.","The Court ruled that the CA erred in finding grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC. The status of CBMI as a legitimate job contractor is supported by substantial evidence and settled by case laws, specifically CBMI v. Asprec and PPI v. Cayetano, which involved similar facts and issues. Adhering to the doctrine of stare decisis, the Court noted that CBMI has substantial capital (total assets exceeding P76 million, paid-up capital of P3,500,000.00), is duly licensed by the DOLE, and operates a business independent from PPI. Crucially, CBMI maintained the 'right of control' over the respondents, wielding powers regarding 'selection and engagement, payment of wages, dismissal, and control over the employees' conduct.'","The Court adheres to the principle of stare decisis and stands by the decision in Asprec and Cayetano. The findings of the labor tribunals—that respondents failed to establish that petitioner exercised control and supervision over their work or owned the motorcycles, and that CBMI exercised all aspects of being an employer over respondents—were consistent with case laws and supported by substantial evidence. Thus, CBMI was a legitimate job contractor, and consequently, the employer of respondents.","WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated September 30, 2016 and the Resolution dated March 3, 2017 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 142490 are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Accordingly, the Resolutions dated June 25, 2015 and July 28, 2015 of the National Labor Relations Commission in NLRC LAC No. 04-001027-15 are REINSTATED. SO ORDERED."

ASUSANO, RESPONDENT.","In 2015, Jocelyn, through her attorney-in-fact, Edwin Asusano (Edwin), filed before the trial court a Petition[5] for judicial recognition of foreign divorce.[6] She alleged that she was married to Fumio in 1993, and in 2007, they jointly filed for divorce before the City Hall of Sakado City, Saitama Prefecture.[7] As the divorce was accepted, Jocelyn sought the recognition thereof here in the Philippines.[8] Finding Jocelyn's petition to be sufficient in form and substance, the RTC set the case for hearing.[9] The Republic, through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), entered its appearance and authorized the Office of the City Prosecutor (OCP) of San Pedro City, Laguna, to appear on its behalf.[10] During the presentation of evidence, the following documents, among others, were presented: (1) the Acceptance Certificate[13] issued by the Mayor of Sakado City, Saitama Prefecture, Japan; (2) an Authentication[14] from the Vice Consul of Philippine Embassy in Tokyo, Japan; and (3) a photocopy[15] of the Civil Code of Japan in English text.[16] The Republic, through the OCP, did not object to the presentation and offer of such evidence and manifested that it will not be adducing controverting evidence.[17] Thereafter, the Commissioner rendered a Report[18] recommending that the petition be granted considering that Jocelyn was able to successfully establish the fact of divorce and the law of Japan.[19] Adopting the Commissioner's recommendation, the trial court granted the petition... The appellate court denied the appeal, viz.: WHEREFORE, the appeal is DENIED. The Order dated June 17, 2016 of the RTC, Branch 93, San Pedro, Laguna, in Sp. Proc. Case No. SPL-0990-15, is hereby AFFIRMED. SO ORDERED.[25] The CA held that Jocelyn was able to present documents proving the fact of divorce and the law of Japan.[26] It also noted that the Republic did not deny the existence of the divorce decree nor challenged the jurisdiction of the divorce court.[27] Undeterred, the Republic, still through the OSG, filed the instant Petition, arguing that Jocelyn failed to comply with the requirements of authentication and proof of documents concerning the Acceptance Certificate, and the Authentication by the Philippine Embassy in Tokyo, Japan; that Edwin's testimony as to the fact of divorce should have been excluded for being hearsay; and that the foreign law had not been proven.[29]","The Petition is meritorious. . . WHEREFORE, the Petition is GRANTED. The November 15, 2018 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 110750 is REVERSED and SET ASIDE.","For a petition for judicial recognition of foreign divorce to prosper, the party pleading it must prove the fact of divorce and the national law of the foreign spouse... Jocelyn was able to establish the fact of divorce... Similarly here, the divorce was coursed not through Japanese courts but through the Mayor of Sakado City, Saitama Prefecture. The Acceptance Certificate was what was issued to Jocelyn and Fumio when they filed their divorce before the mayor. Hence, it already suffices as proof of the fact of divorce... As in Racho, We rule that the Authentication submitted by Jocelyn is also sufficient... Nevertheless, Jocelyn was unable to establish the law of Japan on divorce. To prove that the divorce was valid under Japanese laws, Jocelyn submitted a photocopy of the English translation of the Civil Code of Japan, published by Eibun-Horei-Sha, Inc. and stamped with ""LIBRARY, Japan Information and Culture Center, Embassy of Japan, 2627 Roxas Boulevard, Pasay City.""[48] The Republic assails the document for being insufficient to prove the law of Japan on divorce.[49] We agree with the Republic. Following jurisprudence, the document is devoid of any probative value.[50] ... Not being an official translation, the document submitted by Jocelyn does not prove the existing law on divorce in Japan. Unfortunately, without such evidence, there is nothing on record to establish that the divorce between Jocelyn and Fumio was validly obtained and is consistent with the Japanese law on divorce. Given that Jocelyn was able to prove the fact of divorce but not the Japanese law on divorce, a remand of the case rather than its outright dismissal is proper. This is consistent with the policy of liberality that the Court has adopted in cases involving the recognition of foreign decrees to Filipinos in mixed marriages.","WHEREFORE, the Petition is GRANTED. The November 15, 2018 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 110750 is REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The case is REMANDED to the court of origin for further proceedings and reception of evidence on the Japanese law on divorce. SO ORDERED."

VIADO, HR HEAD, RESPONDENTS.","On June 11, 2004, One Network Bank, Inc. hired Catherine as an Accounting Specialist. On May 1, 2006, it implemented what it called an ""Exogamy Policy,"" which stated: 'Effective May 1, 2006, when two employees working for One Network Bank are subsequently married through Church or Civil Court rites, one must terminate employment immediately after marriage.' On October 31, 2009, Catherine married her co-worker, Audie Angelo A. Cagampan. On November 4, 2009, the couple requested for permission from One Network Bank President Alex V. Buenaventura to continue working for the bank. On November 10, 2009, the Head of Human Resources, Myrna S. Viado, denied the request and terminated Catherine's employment. She filed a Complaint for illegal dismissal. The Labor Arbiter rendered its October 29, 2010 Decision, ruling that Catherine was illegally dismissed and ordered her reinstatement. The National Labor Relations Commission affirmed the Labor Arbiter's ruling. One Network Bank filed a Petition for Certiorari before the Court of Appeals, which granted the petition, reversed the NLRC, and found that One Network Bank's policy was a valid exercise of management prerogative (bona fide occupational qualification exception). The Court of Appeals directed One Network Bank to pay Catherine separation pay and nominal damages.",This Court grants the Petition and reverses the assailed Court of Appeals judgment. Petitioner Catherine Dela Cruz-Cagampan was illegally dismissed and must be reinstated.,"An employer's blanket policy of no-spouse employment is discriminatory. To justify its enforcement, the employer must clearly establish a reasonable business necessity. Article 134 [136] of the Labor Code prohibits employers from dismissing, discharging, discriminating or otherwise prejudicing a woman employee merely by reason of her marriage. The respondent bank failed to demonstrate the reasonable business necessity for its no-spouse employment policy. The mere fear that spouses may divulge confidential information is ""speculative, unfounded and imaginary."" The no-spouse employment policy cannot justify petitioner's dismissal because it failed to meet the requirements of a bona fide occupational qualification.","The Petition for Review on Certiorari is GRANTED. The Court of Appeals' July 31, 2014 Decision and February 10, 2015 Resolution in CA-G.R. SP No. 04589-MIN are REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, RESPONDENT.","On April 29, 2013, Delos Santos became a resident of Makati City where he lived at his father's condominium unit in Unit 12H, Classica Tower 2. He pays condominium association dues to Classica Tower Condominium Association, Inc. (Classica). On October 31, 2012, Commissioner of Internal Revenue Kim S. Jacinto-Henares of the Bureau of Internal Revenue issued Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 65-2012 (the Circular) imposing Value-Added Tax on condominium owners' association dues, stating that association dues, membership fees, and other assessments/charges collected by a condominium corporation are subject to VAT and Income Tax because they constitute income payment or compensation for beneficial services. On November 26, 2015, Classica informed its unit owners and tenants that its Board of Trustees had decided that it will no longer shoulder the Value-Added Tax on association dues starting on January 3, 2016. On January 4, 2016, Classica sent Delos Santos a billing statement for his association dues that included the additional Value-Added Tax imposed by the Circular. He then paid his association dues on January 21, 2016. Subsequently, he filed a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 before this Court assailing the validity of the Circular, arguing that association dues are contributions to defray maintenance costs and not taxable revenue, thus rendering the Circular an invalid subordinate legislation for modifying Sections 105 and 108 of the National Internal Revenue Code.","This Court does not need to resolve the instant Petition for being moot and academic. On January 15, 2020, this Court's First Division, through the ponencia of Associate Justice Amy Lazaro-Javier, promulgated G.R. Nos. 215801 and 218924 where this Court held that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue gravely abused its authority in issuing Revised Memorandum Circular No. 65, and that in doing so, '[the Circular] did not merely interpret or clarify[,] but changed altogether the long standing rules of the Bureau of Internal [R]evenue.' Here, this Court likewise declared that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue gravely abused its discretion in issuing the same Circular and for declaring that association dues, membership fees, and other assessments or charges are subject to income tax, Value-Added Tax, and withholding tax. Thus, the promulgation of G.R. Nos. 215801 and 218924 declaring the Circular invalid has mooted the Petition.","This Court reiterated the pronouncement in Yamane v. BA Lepanto Condominium Corporation, that a condominium corporation is not engaged in trade or business. Association dues are not intended for profit, but for the maintenance of the condominium project. The collection of association dues, membership fees, and other charges is purely for the benefit of the condominium owners: For when a condominium corporation manages, maintains, and preserves the common areas in the building, it does so only for the benefit of the condominium owners. It cannot be said to be engaged in trade or business, thus, the collection of association dues, membership fees, and other assessments/charges is not a result of the regular conduct or pursuit of a commercial or an economic activity, or any transactions incidental thereto. Neither can it be said that a condominium corporation is rendering services to the unit owners for a fee, remuneration or consideration. Association dues, membership fees, and other assessments/charges form part of a pool from which a condominium corporation must draw funds in order to bear the costs for maintenance, repair, improvement, reconstruction expenses and other administrative expenses. Indisputably, the nature and purpose of a condominium corporation negates the carte blanche application of our value-added tax provisions on its transactions and activities.",The Petition is DISMISSED for being MOOT and ACADEMIC.

AUTICIO, RESPONDENT.","In her Petition to Consolidate Ownership under Article 1607 of the Civil Code dated February 21, 2002, respondent Editha A. Auticio sought to consolidate in her name, the ownership of a 1,378 square meter parcel of land covered by Tax Declaration No. 99-04019-00903 situated at Barangay Cabong, Borongan, Eastern Samar. Respondent alleged that on June 4, 2001, she bought the land from petitioner for P32,000.00, and executed the Deed of Sale Under Pacto de Retro. Respondent claimed that the six (6)-month redemption period from June 4, 2001 had expired without petitioner buying back the land; Thus, she filed the Petition to consolidate her ownership of the land. In his Answer, petitioner countered that the Deed did not express the true agreement between him and respondent. He claimed that their true agreement was a loan. He borrowed P20,000.00 from respondent at ten percent (10%) interest per month for six (6) months and put up the land as a security. Petitioner continued to possess the land. He paid the realty taxes. He offered to pay the loan plus interest at P32,000.00. Respondent, however, refused his offer. Petitioner prayed that the contract be declared as an equitable mortgage.","By Decision dated July 21, 2008, the trial court ruled in respondent's favor declaring the subject contract to be a true sale with right to repurchase or a Deed of Sale with Pacto de Retro. However, the vendor a retro, Froilan Dala is hereby allowed to repurchase the property sold within 30 days in accordance with the stated Par. 3, Article 1606 of the Civil Code of the Philippines, in the [a]mount of P32,000.00 plus the sum of P182,000.00 as interest, or a total amount of Two Hundred Fourteen Thousand (P214,000.00) Pesos. The Court of Appeals, in its assailed Decision dated August 29, 2012, AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION the RTC Decision, deleting and setting aside the dispositive portion allowing the vendor a retro the opportunity to repurchase and ordering payment of interest, and declared petitioner-appellee Editha Auticio the absolute owner of the real property.","We reverse. The Court finds and so rules that the purported contract of sale with pacto de retro executed by the parties is, in reality, an equitable mortgage. This conclusion aligns with the rule in Article 1603 of the Civil Code, that in case of doubt, the law favors the least transmission of rights and interest over a property subject of the parties' conflicting claims. The conclusive earmarks of an equitable mortgage present are: One. Petitioner and respondent evidently intended to use the land merely as security for his loan of P32,000.00; Two. Petitioner remained in possession of the land even after the execution of the contract and continued to pay realty taxes thereon; and Three. The contract contained a pactum commissorium provision.

Around noon of December 8, 2010, a certain James Aquino, claiming to be a Purchasing Manager at Aboitiz, Inc., called Lacap (TRM encoder) and later sent a faxed Purchase Order No. 010-1742 (P483,095.00). On December 9, 2010, petitioner arrived at the warehouse to pick up the items covered by the first purchase order. He gave Warehouse Supervisor Sarmiento a sealed envelope containing an Authorization Note dated December 8, 2010, and handed him PBCom Check No. 2000024652 in the amount of P483,095.00. Petitioner signed Sales Invoice Nos. 101550 and 101591. On December 10, 2010, another transaction occurred (second purchase order, P657,294.00) involving a different driver who presented PBCom Check No. 2000024651. Both PBCom checks were later dishonored for the reason 'Account Closed' and were found to be spurious. Aboitiz denied employing Aquino or Flores or making the purchases. Petitioner testified that he was a jeepney driver hired by a woman named Elsa Hernandez (who wore an Aboitiz ID) for P1,000.00 to pick up the goods. He insisted he did not know the contents of the sealed envelope or that the transaction was illegal, maintaining he was merely following Hernandez's instructions to deliver the goods to Paco Market.","By Decision dated October 6, 2016, the trial court found petitioner guilty of 2 counts of estafa under Art. 315, par 2(a) of the Revised Penal Code and sentenced him to a prison term of 6 years of prision correccional as minimum to 8 years and 1 day of prision mayor as maximum for each count, ordering him to pay TRM Sales Marketing Inc.

The acts of petitioner—handing over the sealed envelope, allowing the goods to be loaded, signing his name in the sales invoices, handing over the check payment, and delivering the goods for a fee of P2,000.00—do not establish conspiracy, as it was not shown that petitioner was actuated by any unlawful purpose through deceptive tactics or misrepresentation. Sarmiento, the warehouse supervisor, could not cite any single deceitful utterance of petitioner which supposedly caused him to part with the goods. It was Sarmiento's gross negligence, specifically processing the transaction despite the Authorization Letter not bearing petitioner's name, which directly caused the company to lose the goods to the impostor or impostors.","ACCORDINGLY, the petition is GRANTED.

LAROCO AND REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENTS.","On February 20, 2014, petitioner filed a petition for declaration of nullity of his marriage with respondent based on Article 36 of the Family Code. Petitioner alleged that he first met respondent in 1970, courted her, but later broke up with her after learning she was still entertaining other suitors and because his parents disapproved of her reputation as a promiscuous, dishonest, and flirtatious woman. When he returned to Baguio, respondent informed him that she was pregnant, and her parents forced him to marry her on September 6, 1971. They begot three children. While married, respondent allegedly continued to go on dates with other men, borrowed money without paying, deceived him, and was arrested for estafa (jewelry incident). Petitioner found love letters from other men. After he raised money for her bail, respondent never returned to their home; she took their children and lived with her paramour. Their children later decided to live with him because the paramour maltreated them, and he remained in custody of the children since 1983. Petitioner consulted a physician-psychiatrist, Dr. Clarette Rosario Dy, who interviewed petitioner and several witnesses. Dr. Dy diagnosed petitioner with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder and respondent with Histrionic Personality Disorder, concluding that both spouses were psychologically incapacitated, with the disorders being serious, grave, incurable, and having juridical antecedence. Respondent neither filed an Answer nor participated in the proceedings.","The Regional Trial Court (RTC) – Branch 9, La Trinidad, Benguet, by Decision dated May 22, 2017, denied the petition, holding that the totality of evidence failed to establish either or both spouses' respective psychological incapacities that antedated the marriage and that are grave and incurable. On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA), in its Decision dated November 6, 2019, affirmed the RTC decision, ruling that the totality of evidence was insufficient, lacked specific explanation regarding the gravity, juridical antecedence, and incurability of the alleged disorders, and that the psychiatric report lacked credibility as respondent was not personally examined.","The Supreme Court granted the petition, applying the reconceptualized framework of psychological incapacity set forth in Tan-Andal v. Andal, which moved away from a strict focus on clinical personality disorders and expert opinion towards establishing mutual incompatibility and antagonism between the spouses arising from their personality structures. The Court found that the totality of evidence met the standard of clear and convincing evidence. The mutual incompatibility and antagonism were proven by the clear, persistent, and chronic dysfunctionalities, including long physical separation (since 1983), undying charges and suspicions of respondent's adultery, and the severe disruption of family life. The incompatibility was grave, incurable (time did not heal the rift), and had juridical antecedence, starting with the circumstances surrounding the forced marriage and petitioner's prenuptial observation of respondent's alleged flirtatious disposition. The Court held that the lower courts erred because they relied on the strictures of the now-abandoned doctrines on psychological incapacity, and thus reversed their decisions.","The petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated November 6, 2019 and Resolution dated June 15, 2020 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

The RTC issued an Order dated October 16, 2013, directing Banco De Oro to render an accounting and hold in trust the deposits. BDO informed the trial court that the amount deposited in Account No. 302703452706 was entirely applied to Ailene's outstanding obligation under her Back-to-Back Loan on October 17, 2011, and Account No. 302703078315 was applied in full to the Superlite Loan on January 30, 2012, claiming both accounts were closed. In an Omnibus Order dated January 10, 2017, the RTC denied BDO's motion for exclusion and thereupon nullified the questioned application of payment: ""The afore-cited Motion to Exclude the Dollar Time Deposit Accounts of Petitioner Aileen Chua Co is DENIED and the afore-cited Motion to Nullify BDO's Payment and/or Transfer of Assets is GRANTED. Accordingly, the BDO's application of the petitioner Ailene Chua Co's Dollar Time Deposit Accounts with her alleged back-to-back loan with the BDO is nullified and the said dollar time deposits are included in the petitioners' assets for the eventual distribution to the creditors in accordance with the rules."" BDO filed a Motion to Admit (October 10, 2017) documents including a Promissory Note with Assignment, insisting the set-off was valid as it exercised its right as a secured creditor. The RTC issued an Order dated February 5, 2018, admitting the Promissory Note but again directed BDO to submit the complete ledgers for both dollar deposit accounts. This order was reiterated on August 23, 2018. BDO's Motion for Reconsideration was denied on February 28, 2019. BDO questioned the RTC's Orders dated August 23, 2018 and February 28, 2019 via certiorari before the CA. On January 16, 2020, the CA issued the assailed Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 160580, which found no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the RTC in issuing the assailed Orders. Hence, BDO filed this Petition for Review on Certiorari.","On January 16, 2020, the CA issued the assailed Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 160580, which found no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the RTC in issuing the assailed Orders, thus: WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant petition is DISMISSED. The Orders of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 90 dated 23 August 2018 and 28 February 2019, in Spec. Proc. No. Q-11-70234 are AFFIRMED.","The Petition is devoid of merit. The RTC Orders being assailed by petitioner are interlocutory orders. The writ of certiorari will not issue because the RTC did not act without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion in issuing the interlocutory orders. The RTC was simply discharging its mandate as a special commercial court in facilitating a speedy and orderly liquidation of respondents' assets and the settlement of obligations with their creditors under the FRIA, taking steps to ensure transparency and efficiency by requiring the production of ledgers. Allowing one year and nine months to lapse before seeking the reversal of the Omnibus Order dated January 10, 2017 (which nullified the application of payment) is unreasonable and constitutes laches. At any rate, the resolution of the issues concerning the validity of the application of payment; petitioner's alleged status as a secured creditor; and whether its interests as such should be considered in the insolvency proceedings, are all questions of fact requiring an examination of the financial documents which BDO refused to produce. The RTC's Omnibus Order explicitly declared that the deposits in the subject bank accounts are to be included in the respondents' assets ""for the eventual distribution to the creditors in accordance with the rules,"" assuring that petitioner's supposed right as a secured creditor will be recognized should its status as such be proven later.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DENIED. The January 16, 2020 Decision and September 2, 2020 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 160580 are AFFIRMED. The Regional Trial Court, Branch 90 of Quezon City is ordered to proceed and resolve the Petition for Voluntary Insolvency, SP. PROC. No. Q-11-70234, with dispatch."

Tepace October 23, 2012 May 31, 2013 The CGS CD consolidated and decided the appeals in COA CGS-­Cluster 2 Decision No. 2015-013,[17] denying them and affirming the NDs. ... Aggrieved by the NDs, the above-named liable persons appealed before the Director, CGS-Cluster 2 of the COA, raising the following issues: 1) Letter of Implementation (LOI) No. 97[25] dated August 31, 1979 authorized the adoption of additional incentives for government-owned or controlled corporations (GOCCs) performing critical functions; thus, the approving NHA officers were merely performing important functions; 2) Section 10[26] of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 757[27] authorizes the General Manager, subject to the approval by the BOD, to determine the rates of allowances, honoraria, and such other additional compensation which the NHA is authorized to grant to its officers, technical staff and consultants, including the necessary detailed personnel; 3) The grant of CIB or SONA Incentive Award is in accordance with Section 35,[28] Chapter 5, Subtitle A, Title I of Book V of Executive Order (EO) No. 292[29] and its Implementing Rules in recognition of the NHA's valuable contributions in the implementation of the national government flagship housing program and in the overall economic program of the national leadership; 4) The economic subsidy was given to help the employees cope with the financial difficulties on the unabated increase in the price of basic commodities and mitigating inflation; 5) The Christmas Bonus is the NHA's way of expressing recognition of the employees' selfless devotion of duty and dedication to public service and is in keeping with the spirit of gift-giving; 6) The Citation Bonus is anchored on pertinent provisions of EO No. 292 as implemented through the Civil Service Commission (CSC) Memorandum Circular No. 1[30] (s. 2001); 7) The payment of MYFA to the employees is an annual tradition and a recognized corporate practice since 1988 or prior to the approval of R.A. No. 6758 that have already ripened into benefits. Thus, the principle of non-diminution of benefits and salaries applies. On December 18, 1995, the President approved the granting of the MYFA; 8) The grant of meal subsidy and Christmas Bonus were anchored on LOI No. 97, while the rice subsidy was granted pursuant to Board Resolution No. 1725[31] dated June 6, 1989. The subsequent increases in the rates of meal and rice subsidy were pursuant to the approval of the Office of the President communicated through letters dated October 2, 1991 and April 5, 1993; 9) The grant of RATA to select employees who were occupying positions outside those authorized to receive the same pursuant to the General Appropriations Act (GAA) was discontinued as early as July 1, 2011; 10) The approving NBA officers cannot be held liable since the approval of these benefits and their subsequent release and receipt were all in accordance with duly concluded Collective Negotiation Agreement (CNA) which, like any other contracts, has the force and effect of law between the parties; 11) The grant of benefits should be deemed to have been made with constructive notice and tacit approval of the Office of the President because the NHA's Corporate Operating Budget (COB) is approved by the BOD, where the President's alter egos, namely the Secretaries of Public Works and Highways, Transportation and Communication, Finance, Labor and Employment, Trade and Industry, Director General of the National Economic Development Authority, and the Executive Secretary sit; and 12) Appellants cannot be made to refund what they have received because they acted in good faith. They received the allowances and bonuses in the honest belief that they were deserving and that the grant thereof had legal basis. The CGS CD denied the appeals and affirmed the NDs in COA-CGS Cluster 2 Decision No. 2015-013[37] because the clear policy of R.A. No. 6758 is to standardize rates among government personnel, negating the legality of the disallowed allowances and benefits.","We rule in the negative and, consequently, dismiss the consolidated petitions for lack of merit. At the outset, We clarify that the NDs being challenged in the original Petition for Certiorari filed by the petitioners on June 28, 2018, namely ND Nos. 2014-001, 2014-002, 2014-003 (2013) and 2014-005 (2014) were not the NDs affirmed in COA Decision No. 2018-124, but those pertaining to the grant of the Program Administration Fees (PAF) to NHA officers and employees for CYs 2013 and 2014 in the total amount of P58,612,450.00, which were subject of Cluster CGS-Cluster 2 Decision No. 2015-009 dated June 2, 2015. The NDs pertaining to the PAF are subject of a petition for review, docketed as COA CP Case No. 2015-380, which remains pending resolution by the COA Commission Proper. [48] In its Motion with Leave of Court to Amend Petition and Admit Attached Amended Petition, [49] the NHA admitted that due to sheer human frailty, the NDs that were assailed in the Petition for Certiorari and attached to the same were incorrect. The NHA prayed that We set aside technicalities and resolve the Petition based on the merits thereof. In a Resolution dated July 2, 2019, [50] the Supreme Court En Banc granted the petitioners' motion for leave of court to amend the Petition. Thus, on May 7, 2019, the petitioners submitted their Amended Petition for Certiorari, [51] containing the arguments discussed above. The COA did not commit grave abuse of discretion in affirming the disallowances subject of the NDs. We find that in affirming the disallowance under the subject NDs, the respondent COA did not act without or in excess of its jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.","In denying the petition, the COA correctly ruled that the power of the NHA BOD under Sections 8[54] and 9[55] of PD No. 757 to fix and grant additional compensation to the officials and employees of the NHA had already been repealed by Section 16 of R.A. No. 6758, which provides that: SEC. 16. Repeal of Special Salary Laws and Regulations. — All laws, decrees, executive orders, corporate charters, and other issuances or parts thereof, that exempt agencies from the coverage of the System, or that authorize and fix position classification, salaries, pay rates or allowances of specified positions, or groups of officials and employees or of agencies, which are inconsistent with the System, including the proviso under Section 2, and Section 16 of Presidential Decree No. 985 are hereby repealed. (Emphasis supplied) ... The benefits and allowances subject of the assailed NDs, with the exception of the RATA, were not excluded from the integration into the standardized salary rates under R.A. No. 6758. Meanwhile, as to the continued grant of meal and rice subsidy and children's allowances under CCC No. 10-99, the same requires that the recipient employee must be an incumbent as of June 30, 1989 and was actually receiving said allowances on or prior to the said date... Thus, the RATA granted to NHA employees whose positions are not within the purview of Section 45 is disallowable. As regards the argument that the payment of the benefits was in accordance with the CNA, the NHA cannot argue that the grant of the aforesaid benefits and allowances were in accordance with the CNA... Furthermore, Section 10, Resolution No. 02, s. 2003, provides that the following are not negotiable: a. Increase in salary emoluments and other allowances not presently provided for by law; x x x x f. Rice/sugar/other subsidies. ... With respect to the petitioners' invocation of the doctrine of qualified political agency, We agree with the respondent COA that the same does not apply in this case. ... the principle cannot be extended to acts of the appointees of the President in the Cabinet sitting as members of the NHA BOD. ... There was no good faith in the release and receipt of the disallowed amounts. ... It cannot be said that the members of the NHA BOD acted in the honest belief that the benefits and allowances given were due to the recipients. R.A. No. 6758 and PD No. 1597 (Further Rationalizing the System of Compensation and Position Classification in the National Government) are explicit that the NHA BOD is bereft of power to grant and increase the amount of the allowances. ... Similarly, the recipient-employees, by virtue of the notarized Deeds of Undertaking, [66] are likewise liable to refund the benefits and allowances they actually received when they authorized the NHA, through the Treasury Department, to deduct from their salaries or benefits due them the equivalent amount received, payable in equal monthly installments, should refund be necessary and required. No evidence on record shows that the employees were forced, intimidated, and threatened to execute the said undertakings, which are considered valid contracts. ... The present case, however, takes exception from the application of the 3-year prescriptive period considering the significant and peculiar fact in this case wherein the subject NHA employees knowingly and willingly executed notarized Deeds of Undertaking, implying that they were aware of the irregularity and illegality of the allowances and benefits they received.","WHEREFORE, premises considered, the consolidated petitions are hereby DISMISSED for lack of merit. The decision dated January 26, 2018 of the Commission on Audit is AFFIRMED in toto. The approving and certifying officers are solidarily liable for the return of the disallowed amounts in accordance with the notices of disallowance, while the payee-recipients are individually liable for the return of the amounts they respectively received."

LIM IN HIS CAPACITY AS CPA, FROILAN G. AMPIL, ALLAN M. BASARTE, VIRGILIO F. AGUNOD, AND JONAS P. MASCARIÑAS, RESPONDENTS.","The case stems from a Petition for Declaratory Relief with Prayer for Preliminary Injunction and Temporary Restraining Order filed by 1Accountants Party List, Inc. (respondent), represented by its President, Christian Jay D. Lim, who also filed the said petition in his personal capacity as a Certified Public Accountant (CPA), as well as fellow CPAs Froilan G. Ampil, Allan M. Basarte, Virgilio F. Agunod, and Jonas P. Mascariñas against the SEC before the RTC. Respondent's petition for declaratory relief assailed petitioner's regulations, particularly Rule 68, paragraph 3 of the Amended Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of the Securities Regulation Code (SRC) and SEC Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 13-2009, and all other similar memorandum circulars which, since 2002, have required the accreditation of CPAs acting as external auditors of corporations issuing registered securities and possessing secondary licenses (assailed issuances). The grounds for challenge were that the issuances: (1) are issued without authority (ultra vires); (2) contravene Republic Act No. 9298 (R.A. 9298) or the Philippine Accountancy Act of 2004; and (3) restrict the right of CPAs to practice accountancy. The SEC defended its authority based on the SRC and the Corporation Code. In a Decision dated March 20, 2018, the RTC declared Paragraph 3, Rule 68 of the IRR of the SRC and SEC MC No. 13-2009 null and void for being contrary to R.A. 9298, unconstitutional, and issued ultra vires. Petitioner moved for reconsideration but was likewise denied, leading to this Rule 45 petition.","Although both parties argue their stance on several points, We find that this case presents only one principal issue: did the RTC correctly declare Paragraph 3, Rule 68 of the IRR of the SRC and SEC MC No. 13-2009 null and void? We rule in the affirmative.","Petitioner bases its authority to issue the assailed regulations on several provisions of the SRC and the Corporation Code. However, these all pertain to juridical entities such as corporations. x x x Thus, all other powers granted by the SRC provisions relied upon by petitioner flow from the SEC's jurisdiction over corporations, and cannot be made to apply to individual CPAs. While petitioner may regulate corporations as well as the securities market, such regulation does not extend to an authority to restrict, even in the slightest degree, the practice of accountancy. Moreover, the accreditation requirement imposed by the assailed issuances amounts to a licensing requirement which curtails the right of CPAs to practice their profession. x x x It appears from the foregoing that the power to supervise the accounting profession and to impose regulations on CPAs is exclusively delegated to the Professional Regulatory Board of Accountancy. Yet, this exclusive delegation is contravened by the provisions in MC No. 13-2009... Petitioner further argues that it executed a MOA with the Board which allows for such accreditation with the SEC. However, We remind petitioner of another legal maxim, 'delegata potestas non potest delegari' or what has been delegated by Congress can no longer be further delegated or redelegated by the original delegate to another... Moreover, a private agreement such as the MOA cannot operate to validate a transgression of a provision of law. Thus, the MOA is void and cannot serve as authorization for the petitioner to make the assailed issuances.","WHEREFORE, the present petition for review on certiorari is DENIED. The Decision dated March 20, 2018 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Davao City, Branch 15, in Civil Case No. R-DVO-15-02294-SC is AFFIRMED. Paragraph 3, Rule 68 of the IRR of the SRC and SEC MC No. 13-2009 are declared null and void."

LEPANTO CONSOLIDATED MINING COMPANY AND FAR SOUTHEAST GOLD RESOURCES, INC., RESPONDENTS.","In Mineral Production Sharing Agreement (MPSA) No. 001-90[6] dated March 3, 1990, the Republic, through the DENR, authorized respondents to conduct mining operations on a vast tract of land located in the Municipality of Mankayan, Province of Benguet.[7] Notably, the land area subject of the MPSA covers part of the ancestral domains of the Mankayan Indigenous Cultural Communities/Indigenous Peoples (ICCs/IPs).[8] Section 3.1 of MPSA No. 001-90 provides for an initial 25-year term, renewable for another period of 25 years ""upon such terms and conditions as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties or as may be provided for by law.""[9] The present controversy relates to the sought renewal of MPSA No. 001-90, as affected by laws enacted subsequent to its execution on March 3, 1990, specifically RA 7942 (Philippine Mining Act of 1995) and RA 8371 (IPRA), which requires the ""Free and Prior Informed and Written Consent"" (FPIC) of the affected ICCs/IPs as a condition for the issuance of the NCIP certification precondition for renewals. As MPSA No. 001-90 was about to expire on March 18, 2015, respondents wrote the MGB-Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR) a Letter[13] dated May 22, 2014, expressing their intention to renew the agreement. Controversy arose when the MGB-CAR, while informing Lepanto that it had substantially complied with the requirements for the renewal of MPSA No. 001-90, advised respondents that their joint application for renewal would be endorsed to the NCIP for appropriate action, supposedly for the required FPIC and NCIP Certification Precondition.[14] Respondents questioned the endorsement, arguing that the imposition of the certification as a pre-condition would impair their vested rights to renew MPSA No. 001-90. Thereafter, arbitration ensued in an Arbitral Tribunal. On November 27, 2015, the Arbitral Tribunal issued a Final Award[21] (Arbitral Award) holding that the issue arising from the FPIC and NCIP certification requirement for the renewal of MPSA 001-90 is arbitrable, and ruled that the FPIC and NCIP Certification Precondition may not be validly imposed as a requirement for the renewal of MPSA 001-90, and the latter should be renewed under the same terms and conditions, without prejudice to changes mutually agreed upon by the parties. Disagreeing, the Republic filed a Petition to Vacate Arbitral Award[28] with the RTC Branch 141.","In the assailed Decision[41] dated April 30, 2018, the CA set aside the Resolution dated May 6, 2016 and Order dated July 5, 2016 of the RTC Branch 141, and denied the Motion for Leave to Intervene of the District of Benguet. Thus, the CA affirmed the Arbitral Award in favor of respondents: WHEREFORE, the instant petition is hereby GRANTED. The Resolution dated May 6, 2016 and Order dated July 5, 2016 in SP. Proc. Case No. M-7932 rendered by Branch 141, Regional Trial Court of Makati City are SET ASIDE. Accordingly, the Award dated November 27, 2015 of the Arbitral Tribunal is hereby AFFIRMED. SO ORDERED.","G.R. No. 244216: The Arbitral award in favor of respondent mining companies must be vacated. The Republic's invocation of violation of public policy is impressed with merit. Contrary to the proposition of respondents, the Arbitral Tribunal's determination—that respondents be excused from the IPRA requirement on the FPIC and NCIP Certification Precondition—does not relate to a mere interpretation of law, or its application to the established facts, within the context of arbitration. The non-application of the requirement contravenes a strong and compelling public policy on the protection of the rights of the Mankayan ICCs/IPs to their ancestral domains. Rooted in no less than the Constitution, as well as being clearly, categorically and positively reflected in the IPRA, the existence and mandate of the invoked public policy ensuring the protection of the rights of the ICCs/IPs to their ancestral domains cannot be undermined, worse disregarded. The Arbitral Tribunal, in apparently seeking to strike a balance between the contending interests of respondent mining companies and that of the Mankayan ICCs/IPs, simply had no factual and legal bases to arbitrate favorably to the former dispensing with the FPIC requirement under the IPRA. As the Court emphasizes, the consent requirement proceeds from public policy and social justice finding support in no less than the Constitution.","WHEREFORE, the petition in G.R. No. 244216 is GRANTED. The Decision dated April 30, 2018 and the Resolution dated January 14, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

"G.R. No. 242781, June 21, 2022","SUPERIORA LOCALE DELL' ISTITUTO DELLE SUORE DI SAN GIUSEPPE DEL CABURLOTTO, INC., PETITIONER, VS. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","On March 22, 2013, Superiora Locale filed an Application for Registration[5] praying for the issuance of a Decree and Original Certificate of Title over Lots No. 1341-A and No. 1341-B, Cad-482, Amadeo Cadastre, in its name. In its Application, Superiora Locale claimed that it is the absolute owner of Lot No. 1341-A with an area of 2,876 square meters and Lot No. 1341-B with an area of 136 square meters.[6] Lots No. 1341-A and No. 1341-B are declared in its name and are covered by Tax Declaration Nos. 02-0015-0068 and 02-0015-00070, respectively.[7] At the last assessment for taxation, Lot No. 1341-A was assessed at P299,100.00, and Lot No. 1341-B at P14,140.00.[8] Superiora Locale further averred that it acquired both lots by purchase from Servando M. Baurile, Sr., Antonio M. Baurile, Yuvilla Baurile-Legaspi, Norberta Baurile-Legaspi, and Benigno M. Baurile, as evidenced by a Deed of Extrajudicial Settlement with Absolute Sale.[9] It likewise claimed that by itself or through its predecessors-in-interest, it has been in open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession and occupation of both lots under a bona fide claim of ownership since June 12, 1945 or earlier, and that the lots are within alienable and disposable lots of the public domain.[10] The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) filed its Opposition[11] on Superiora Locale's Application, contending that, as to Lot No. 1341-A, the application is barred by res judicata. The issue on Superiora Locale's registrable title over the said lot has already been decided by the CA in a Decision[12] dated March 28, 2012 in CA-G.R. CV No. 92767 (first CA decision). [13] This CA decision reversed the Municipal Circuit Trial Court's (MCTC) Decision[14] dated January 18, 2008 in LRC No. 2006-327, thereby resulting in the dismissal of Superiora Locale's first application for registration due to its failure to prove possession of the lots from June 12, 1945 or earlier and to prove that the property is part of the alienable and disposable lands of the public domain.[15] As for Lot No. 1431-B, the OSG opposed the application arguing that the RTC of Cavite had no jurisdiction over the case since Lot No. 1341-B was assessed for taxation at P14,140.00 only or below the jurisdictional amount required before a RTC may take cognizance of a cadastral or land registration case.[16] In its Reply,[17] Superiora Locale contended that the principle of res judicata is not applicable. On April 11, 2016, the RTC issued an Order[18] dismissing the application filed by Superiora Locale over Lot No. 1341-A on the ground of res judicata and over Lot No. 1341-B on the ground of lack of jurisdiction... In a Decision[22] dated April 6, 2018, the CA denied Superiora Locale's appeal and affirmed the RTC's Order. Superiora Locale filed a motion for a reconsideration,[25] which was denied by the CA in a Resolution[26] dated October 23, 2018. Hence, this petition for review on certiorari.",This Court grants the petition.,"The core issue to be resolved is whether the CA was correct in affirming the RTC's dismissal of petitioner's application for registration over Lot No. 1341-A on the ground of res judicata and over Lot No. 1341-B on the ground of lack of jurisdiction. This Court grants the petition. Res judicata does not apply to registration proceedings because there is no conclusive adjudication of rights between adversarial parties. This occurs where the previous application for registration was not opposed, had been dismissed without a hearing or for insufficiency of evidence, or like circumstances. Defects in the original application may be remedied by the discovery of new evidence or the effluxion of time – the eventual compliance with the requirements of a present statute or the curative effect of a new statute. With respect to Lot No. 1341-A, the petition is granted in view of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 11573. R.A. No. 11573, being a curative statute, can be retroactively applied, shortening the required length of possession from 'since June 12, 1945 or earlier' to twenty (20) years immediately preceding the filing of the application for confirmation of title. Section 7 of R.A. No. 11573 simplifies the proof required for establishing the alienable and disposable character of the land. R.A. No. 11573 shall apply retroactively to all applications for judicial confirmation of title which remain pending as of September 1, 2021. Concerning Lot No. 1341-B, although the RTC does not have original jurisdiction due to the low assessed value (P14,140.00), this Court will allow a joinder of causes of action considering Sections 18 and 34 of P.D. No. 1529 and Section 5, Rule 2 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure. The joinder is allowed because one of the causes of action (Lot No. 1341-A) falls within the RTC's jurisdiction.","WHEREFORE, premises considered, the petition for review on certiorari is GRANTED.

NOLASCO, MARIE A. BALANGUE, NONNETTE C. BENNETT, DR. TERESITA F. DE VENECIA, ANTONIO J. SUPREMIDO, JR., AND PASTOR GENER TANDOC, RESPONDENTS.","On 8 July 1940, President Manuel L. Quezon issued Proclamation No. 581[4] creating the Santo Tomas Forest Reserve[5] in Tuba, Benguet. The reserve, which was constituted for purposes of forest protection, timber production and aesthetic preservation, consists of around 3,114 hectares[6] of mountains and forest lands striding five different barangays.[7] Nestled within the reserve are two of Benguet's highest peaks—Mount Santo Tomas and Mount Cabuyao. The Santo Tomas Forest Reserve hosts several natural springs that are critical sources of water, not only of the residents of Tuba and of the nearby Baguio City, but also of the inhabitants of the distant province of Pangasinan. To start, the natural springs of the Santo Tomas Forest Reserve sustain three reservoir dams of the Baguio Water District (BWD). These dams—named the Amliang Dam 1, Amliang Dam 2A/2B[8] and Amliang Dam 3—hold the supply of potable water for some 4,176 households[9] in Tuba and Baguio City.[10] Apart from sustaining the dams of the BWD, however, the springs of the Santo Tomas Forest Reserve also comprise the headwaters of the Bued River.[11] These springs connect to the streams that cascade along the reserve's steep slopes and their confluence at the feet of Mount Santo Tomas thereby gave birth to the Bued River.[12] From the base of Mount Santo Tomas, the Bued River runs for about 31 kilometers downstream, traversing the municipalities of Sison and San Fabian in Pangasinan, and emptying into the Lingayen Gulf.[13] The Bued River is the principal source of water of the San Fabian River Irrigation System (San Fabian RIS) which, in turn, supports around 1,144 hectares of farmlands in Pangasinan.[14] On 15 April 2014, mountain trekkers Francis S. Likigan, Jr., Eric S. Tanglib and Christian T. Labascan wrote a letter to then Benguet Governor Nestor B. Fongwan (Gov. Fongwan) informing the latter of tree-cutting and excavation activities at Mount Santo Tomas.[15] Gov. Fongwan forwarded this information to the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) - Cordillera Administrative Region which, in turn, relayed the same to the Community Environment and Natural Resources Office (CENRO) of La Trinidad.[16] Acting on the information, the CENRO organized a team to investigate and conduct an ocular inspection of Mount Santo Tomas.[17] That team conducted an ocular inspection of the mountain on 25 April 2014, and made follow-up investigations thereon on 23 and 27 of May 2014.[18] In sum, the inspection and investigation yielded the following findings:[19] There had been tree-cutting and earth moving activities within Mount Santo Tomas. Such tree-cutting and earth moving activities were made pursuant to the construction of two new roads in Barangay Poblacion, Tuba. One road spans 1.5 kilometers from Sitio Amliang to Sitio Pongayan, while another covers 1.14 kilometers from Sitio Pongayan to Sitio Bekel. Per plotting of the CENRO, the area covered by the roads falls within the Santo Tomas Forest Reserve. Per the records of the Environment Management Bureau (EMB) and the CENRO, the construction of the new roads is not supported by any Environmental Compliance Certificate (ECC), Tree Cutting Permit/Special Land Use Permit, or Road Right of Way/Excavation Permit. An estimated 306 trees (293 Benguet pine trees and 13 Alnus trees) and 455 saplings (415 Benguet pine saplings and 40 Alnus saplings) were cut in connection with the construction of the new roads.[20] This translates to a total damage in the amount of P10,314,531.40. The earth moving activities associated with the construction of the new roads also led to heavy soil erosion that, in turn, silted tributaries that supply water to Amliang Dam 3. It was observed that one of the roads ends only 50 meters away from Amliang Creek—a water source of Amliang Dam 3. Present along the road constructions were three backhoes that were respectively marked as ""Goldrich Construction,"" ""RUA Construction,"" and ""BLC Construction & Aggregates."" Significantly, the CENRO investigation tagged petitioner Nicasio M. Aliping, Jr. (petitioner)—then a member of the House of Representatives for the lone legislative district of Baguio City—as the person responsible for the earth moving activities within the Santo Tomas Forest Reserve.[21] Later, it was discovered that the offending roads actually originate from a piece of land within the reserve that is being claimed by petitioner. In view of the foregoing findings, the Provincial Environment and Natural Resources Office (PENRO) of Benguet filed before the provincial prosecutor a criminal complaint against petitioner, Goldrich Construction, RUA Construction, and BLC Construction & Aggregates for violations of Section 77 and 78 of Presidential Decree No. 705 or the Revised Forestry Code, as amended.[22] On the other hand, on 2 June 2014, the EMB issued a Notice of Violation cum Cease and Desist Order against petitioner, Goldrich Construction, RUA Construction, and BLC Construction & Aggregates for their failure to secure an ECC in relation to the earth moving activities within the reserve.[23] The EMB thus conducted a technical conference on 14 July 2014 that was participated in by petitioner and the representatives of the construction companies.[24] During such conference, petitioner admitted responsibility for an excavation project within his claim and for undertaking the same without the necessary environmental permit.[25] In view of such admission, the EMB imposed a penalty of P50,000.00 against petitioner for violation of Section 4 of PD No. 1586.[26] Meanwhile, on 28 April 2014, the BWD conducted its own inspection of the Amliang Dam 3 and its surroundings amid observing turbidity in the dam's water supply. In essence, the BWD attributed the turbid waters of the Amliang Dam 3 to two principal reasons,[27] viz: The road construction within and around the property claimed by petitioner which caused massive volumes of excavated earth and other debris which were dumped along the creeks and tributaries leading to the dam, and The presence of small-scale mining activities above the Amliang Dam 3 which led to massive soil erosions. The BWD submitted its findings to then Tuba Mayor Florencio V. Bentrez (Mayor Bentrez)[28] who then relayed the same to petitioner.[29] In a letter[30] dated 21 May 2014 to Mayor Bentrez, petitioner stated that he would be "" undertaking and instituting measures to avoid further damage to plants, trees and the [ Amliang Dam 5 ] of the [ BWD ]"" and assured that any "" damage will be minimized if not avoided. "" On 26 June 2014, the BWD filed before the Pollution Adjudication Board (PAB) a Complaint[31] for violation of Republic Act (RA) No. 9275 or the Clean Water Act of 2004 against petitioner, Goldrich Construction, RUA Construction, and BLC Construction & Aggregates. The PAB instructed the EMB to investigate the complaint. On 18 July 2014, the EMB conducted yet another inspection of the reserve. After such inspection, the EMB arrived at the conclusion that the pollution of the Amliang Creek was contributed by different sources and that it would be difficult to determine the exact percentage by which each source contributed to the creek's pollution.[32] Moved by the foregoing events and findings, herein respondents Bishop Carlito J. Cenzon, Archbishop Socrates B. Villegas, Sheree M. Nolasco, Marie A. Balangue, Nonnette C. Bennett, Dr. Teresita F. De Venecia, Antonio J. Supremido, Jr. and Pastor Gener Tandoc (Bishop Cenzon et al.)[33] filed before the Court a Petition for the Issuance of a Writ of Kalikasan and a Writ of Continuing Mandamus ( Kalikasan petition).[34] They brought the said petition against herein petitioner, as well as several key officials of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR),[35] the Tuba municipal government[36] and the Tuba police station.[37] In the Kalikasan petition, Bishop Cenzon et al. complained of four ongoing anthropogenic activities that had allegedly degraded the sustainability of the natural springs indigenous to the Santo Tomas Forest Reserve. These activities[38] are: First. Illegal tree-cutting and massive earth moving in Mount Santo Tomas caused by a road construction project of petitioner. Second. Illegal small-scale mining activities. Third. Expansion of vegetable gardens and residential areas due to the unwarranted issuance of tax declarations over lands within the Santo Tomas Forest Reserve. Fourth. Use of Mount Santo Tomas and of the nearby Mount Cabuyao as sites of relay towers and radars by different television and communication companies. Bishop Cenzon et al. claimed that the foregoing activities caused soil erosions and generated pollutants which, in turn, significantly reduced the volume and quality of water flowing into the Amliang Dam 3 and the Bued River. Hence, it was argued that such activities had violated and, unless abated, will continue to violate the constitutional right to a balanced and healthful ecology of the people who rely on water from such river and dam—namely, the inhabitants of Tuba in Benguet, of Baguio City and of San Fabian in Pangasinan. Accordingly, Bishop Cenzon et al. prayed for the immediate issuance of an ex parte Temporary Environmental Protection Order (TEPO) and for the rendition of judgment granting the privilege of the Writs of Kalikasan and Continuing Mandamus with the following directives: [Compelling the] x x x DENR, [DENR – Cordillera Administrative Region], and [Environmental Management Bureau – Cordillera Administrative Region] through their respective heads, to perform [their] mandate under the laws, and to take SHORT TERM and LONG TERM measures to conserve whatever remains of the [Santo Tomas Forest Reserve], including but not limited to the following: A. By deploying personnel to guard against further cutting of trees, illegal excavation and other forms of earth-moving activities, illegal mining, construction of houses and other buildings, and expansion of vegetable gardens; B. To come up with a comprehensive plan to mitigate the pollution/contamination of the springs and the river system resulting from the erosion caused by earthmoving activities, illegal logging, agricultural and human settlement activities; and C. To initiate the necessary actions to nullify tax declarations covering portions of the [Santo Tomas Forest Reserve] which have been issued in violation of the laws. [Compelling the] x x x Municipality of Tuba through [Mayor Bentrez], to comply with its duty to protect the environment within its jurisdiction and protect the interests of its constituents under the general welfare clause, and in particular: A. To come up with the necessary ordinance outlawing the issuance of tax declarations over portions of the [Santo Tomas Forest Reserve], and prohibiting the alienation of portions of the same; B. To coordinate with the [DENR – Cordillera Administrative Region], PENRO, CENRO and other government agencies in guarding the [Santo Tomas Forest Reserve] against further cutting of trees, illegal excavation and other forms of earth-moving activities, illegal mining, construction of houses and other buildings, and expansion of vegetable gardens; and C. To incorporate the conservation of the [Santo Tomas Forest Reserve] in its Environmental Code, or if there be none, for said [municipality] to immediately take steps to pass such a code. [Compelling the petitioner]: A. To rehabilitate the portions of the [Santo Tomas Forest Reserve] which have been destroyed by the road-opening activity, more particularly – that 2-kilometer stretch which starts from [petitioner's] claimed property down to the river at the bottom of the mountain – by conducting massive planting of trees. B. To undertake – at his own expense – measures to minimize, and if possible, prevent the further siltation and contamination of the Amliang Dams 1, [2A/2B] and 3 utilized by the BWD. [39] In a Resolution dated 30 September 2014, the Court ordered the issuance of a Writ of Kalikasan along with the referral of the Kalikasan petition to the CA for the acceptance of the return of the writ, conduct of hearing, reception of evidence and rendition of judgment.[40] The Court, in the same resolution, also handed down a TEPO[41] which enjoined: (a) [Petitioner], and those acting for and in his behalf, to CEASE and DESIST from performing acts to develop or enhance the property located at [the Santo Tomas Forest Reserve] which [petitioner] claims to be his and/or his brother's, which acts include improving the old building standing on the land, building any structure thereon, continuing with the road opening activities, concreting any part of the road, and for said [petitioner] to immediately take steps to MITIGATE the contamination of the Amliang dams due to the erosion emanating from his road opening project; (b) x x x Municipality of Tuba through [Mayor Bentrez] to CEASE and DESIST from accepting applications for issuance of tax declarations over lands within the [Santo Tomas Forest Reserve], from processing applications which have already been filed, and from issuing tax declarations which have already been processed and approved; and (c) x x x [Philippine National Police] Tuba through Chief of Police PCI William B. Willie, to enforce environmental laws which includes apprehension of violators of forest laws, mining laws and other environmental laws.[42] The Kalikasan petition was docketed in the CA as CA-G.R. No. 00029 W/K.[43] Petitioner filed with the CA his return[44] to the writ on 13 October 2014. In his return, petitioner admitted responsibility for the excavation activities within his claim—a 2.6885-hectare estate consisting of a vegetable land and a rootcrop-camotal land[45] located at Mami Cave in Barangay Poblacion—but denied any involvement in the construction of roads and the cutting of trees outside of the said claim. He alleged that he only engaged in excavation activities to improve an existing access road to his claim, whose terrain is semi-rolling with a cliff. Petitioner also averred that the roads found to be emanating from his claim are not actually newly constructed but are rather old logging roads already established. The impleaded officials of the DENR, the Tuba municipal government and the Tuba police station, on the other hand, filed a joint return. In their return, the officials acknowledge the threats to the sustainability of the natural springs of the Santo Tomas Forest Reserve but posit that they have not been remiss in their duties of protecting the reserve pursuant to environmental laws, rules and regulations. They also cite the prompt response taken by the DENR and the CENRO on reports of tree-cutting and earth moving activities within the Santo Tomas Forest Reserve, and the measures taken by the said agencies to hold the persons responsible for such activities accountable. On 6 May 2015, after due proceedings, the CA issued its Decision[46] granting the Kalikasan petition and rendering permanent the TEPO it earlier issued.","On 6 May 2015, after due proceedings, the CA issued its Decision[46] granting the Kalikasan petition and rendering permanent the TEPO it earlier issued.

Willie of the mandate under paragraph 6 of this fallo . SO ORDERED. [47]","We deny the petition. Item 4(a) of the Dispositive Portion of the Assailed Decision Does Not Violate Petitioner's Right to the Equal Protection of the Laws Petitioner's invocation of his rights to the equal protection of the laws is misplaced. Concededly, item 4(a) of the dispositive portion of the assailed decision is directed exclusively at petitioner. It permanently enjoins petitioner—and only petitioner—from performing acts "" to develop or to enhance "" his claim located within the Santo Tomas Forest Reserve. Indeed, the assailed decision itself does not impose any similar restriction on other residents and owners of vegetable gardens within the Santo Tomas Forest Reserve, even though the proliferation of residential areas and vegetable gardens have been recognized as a potential contributor to the degradation of the water sources of the reserve.[52] Be that as it may, We find that item 4(a) of the dispositive portion of the assailed decision cannot be considered as discriminatory against petitioner. It should be emphasized that, unlike the other residents and owners of vegetable gardens within the Santo Tomas Forest Reserve, petitioner was impleaded as one of the respondents of the Kalikasan petition . In fact, petitioner is the only resident and vegetable garden owner within the Santo Tomas Forest Reserve that had been so impleaded. The reason behind the disparity is obvious. The Kalikasan petition lists, as one of its causes of action, an anthropogenic activity specific only to petitioner— i.e. , the illegal tree-cutting and earth moving within the Santo Tomas Forest Reserve resulting from a road construction project. No similar activity was imputed against the other residents and owners of vegetable gardens within reserve. Item 4(a) of the dispositive portion of the assailed decision was crafted in that context. The directive is nothing more than a specific remedial response to the earth moving activities committed by petitioner within his claim that had been confirmed, during the proceedings a quo , to be a major contributor to the siltation of the streams and tributaries leading to the Amliang Dam 3 and the Bued River. A similar directive could not have been made against the other residents and owners of vegetable gardens within the Santo Tomas Forest Reserve because they were never specifically impleaded in the Kalikasan petition, nor have they been accused of, much less proven to have engaged in earth moving activities comparable to that committed by petitioner. Thus, the reason why item 4(a) was exclusively directed against petitioner. In the analogous case of People v. Dela Piedra ,[53] We held that the act of a prosecutor in filing a criminal charge against only one of two suspects does not, by itself, constitute a violation of the right to the equal protection of the laws of the person against whom a charge was filed. We ruled that to consider such act to be violative of the said right, the element of "" intentional or purposeful discrimination "" must be clearly shown, thus: At the outset, it may be stressed that courts are not confined to the language of the statute under challenge in determining whether that statute has any discriminatory effect. A statute nondiscriminatory on its face may be grossly discriminatory in its operation. Though the law itself be fair on its face and impartial in appearance, yet, if it is applied and administered by public authority with an evil eye and unequal hand, so as practically to make unjust and illegal discriminations between persons in similar circumstances, material to their rights, the denial of equal justice is still within the prohibition of the Constitution. The prosecution of one guilty person while others equally guilty are not prosecuted, however, is not, by itself, a denial of the equal protection of the laws. Where the official action purports to be in conformity to the statutory classification, an erroneous or mistaken performance of the statutory duty, although a violation of the statute, is not without more a denial of the equal protection of the laws. The unlawful administration by officers of a statute fair on its face, resulting in its unequal application to those who are entitled to be treated alike, is not a denial of equal protection unless there is shown to be present in it an element of intentional or purposeful discrimination. This may appear on the face of the action taken with respect to a particular class or person, or it may only be shown by extrinsic evidence showing a discriminatory design over another not to be inferred from the action itself. But a discriminatory purpose is not presumed, there must be a showing of ""clear and intentional discrimination."" Appellant has failed to show that, in charging appellant in court, that there was a ""clear and intentional discrimination"" on the part of the prosecuting officials.[54] (Citations omitted, emphasis supplied, italics in the original). Such element is certainly lacking in item 4(a) of the dispositive portion of the assailed decision. There is simply no evidence that the CA, in formulating the said directive, had been guilty of intentional discrimination against him. On the other hand, the established circumstances clearly reveal that the directive was conceived, not to purposely single out petitioner, but merely to provide a specific relief to an anthropogenic activity unique only to petitioner. Too, the directive cannot be made to embrace other residents and owners of vegetable gardens within the Santo Tomas Forest Reserve because their situation, as far as the present case goes, is different from that of the petitioner. In view of these considerations, therefore, We find that item 4(a) of the dispositive portion of the assailed decision did not violate petitioner's right to the equal protection of the laws. Item 4(a) of the Dispositive Portion of the Assailed Decision Does Not Violate Petitioner's Right to Due Process Petitioner's invocation of his rights to due process is likewise misguided. While item 4(a) of the dispositive portion of the assailed decision prohibited petitioner from exercising certain acts within his claim, it cannot be said that the same violated the latter's right to due process. The voluminous records of this case attest that the assailed decision—including the subject directive—had been the product of bona fide proceedings in which petitioner actively participated.[55] Verily, petitioner had been given ample opportunity to be heard before the verdict against him was handed down. Moreover, We find that item 4(a) of the dispositive portion of the assailed decision cannot be considered as arbitrary or oppressive. The directive only permanently enjoins petitioner from performing acts to develop or enhance his claim—such as bulldozing, levelling or any earth-moving activity, and continuing with the road construction project—which are the same acts identified in the assailed decision to have contributed to the siltation, and continuing degradation, of the streams and tributaries leading to the Amliang Dam 3 and the Bued River. The directive, in other words, is a necessary restriction to prevent further damage to the waterways indigenous to the Santo Tomas Forest Reserve. Items 4(b) and (c) of the Dispositive Portion of the Assailed Decision Have Factual Basis Petitioner's challenge against the factual basis of items 4(b) and (c) of the dispositive portion of the assailed decision also lacks merit. Contrary to petitioner's assertion, there is ample evidence presented during the proceedings a quo linking him to the tree-cutting and earth moving activities in the Santo Tomas Forest Reserve—whether within or without his claim. In the assailed decision, the CA aptly observed: It is a conceded fact that [petitioner] caused earth-moving activities in his claim without any environmental compliance certificate, tree-cutting permit, special land use permit, road right of way or excavation permit. In his letter dated May 21, 2014, he undertook to institute measures to avoid further damage to the plants, trees and dam of the BWD, in effect an admission that there was indeed damage to the plants, trees[,] and dam of the BWD caused by his earth-moving activities. He acknowledged that by reason of the ongoing excavation being situated at a higher elevation, there is a tendency of the soil to go down.[56] (Citations omitted) There are several documents and pieces of evidence submitted during the proceedings a quo which reveal the circumstances surrounding the illegal tree-cutting and earth moving activities within the reserve. These evidence are: The Memorandum dated 30 May 2014[57] of CENRO Officer Julio Lopez. In this document, CENRO Officer Julio Lopez reported illegally felled trees and saplings along two roads in Barangay Poblacion— i.e. , one road from Sitio Amliang to Sitio Pongayan, while another from Sitio Pongayan to Sitio Bekel. He observed that both roads are new or recently constructed. Moreover, based on the location of the felled trees and saplings, he determined that the tree-cutting were made pursuant to the construction of such roads. The judicial affidavit of one Felix Siplat, a resident of Santo Tomas. In such affidavit, Felix Siplat supported the observation of the CENRO Officer Julio Lopez regarding the construction of two new roads within the reserve.[58] The return of petitioner.[59] In his return, petitioner made two critical admissions: That he instituted earth-moving and soil excavation activities within his claim. Petitioner further professed that he undertook such earth-moving and soil excavation to improve an existing access road to his claim. That the road from Sitio Amliang to Sitio Pongayan, and the one from Sitio Pongayan to Sitio Bekel are connected to or originate from his claim.[60] Petitioner, however, avers that such roads were not new but rather are already logging roads. Taken together, the above evidence reveals that the tree-cutting and earth moving activities within the reserve were made pursuant to the construction of two roads in Barangay Poblacion. Such roads were new i.e. , they were only recently constructed, and they emanate from petitioner's claim within the Santo Tomas Forest Reserve. Moreover, coinciding with the construction of these roads were the earth-moving activities conducted by petitioner within his claim. Petitioner undertook such activities, precisely , to improve access between his claim and such roads. The confluence of the foregoing circumstances, to Our mind, clearly indicates that the construction of the two offending roads was made at the behest of petitioner—and no other. The roads originate from his claim and are structurally designed to connect his claim to different sitios within Barangay Poblacion. Hence, the roads were evidently constructed for the benefit of the petitioner and, as shown by the records of the case, only for his benefit. Petitioner's attempt to disassociate himself from the construction of the roads—by insisting that they were old logging roads—cannot be given credence. The recent construction of the two roads have been attested, not only by the CENRO, but also by Felix Siplat, a resident of Santo Tomas. In contrast, the allegation that the two roads were existing logging roads were not supported by any evidence—save for petitioner's bare insistence. Having been established as the person responsible for the construction of the two new roads, petitioner is likewise accountable for the illegal tree-cutting and earth-moving activities—whether within or without his claim—that resulted from the said construction. Hence, We sustain items 4(b) and (c) of the dispositive portion of the assailed decision.","WHEREFORE , premises considered, the instant petition is DENIED.

[2] The next day, it was discovered that the subject radio was missing. During the investigation, Cruz claimed that Ponce returned to the security office and retrieved the subject radio. On the other hand, Ponce denied Cruz's claim, asserting that he already entrusted the subject radio to Cruz for the proper turnover procedure to the shift-in-charge, Elberto Bautista (Bautista). The investigation further revealed that there was no actual surrender of the subject radio to an accountable officer, considering that the proper procedure therefor was not followed, i.e., that the security guard having possession of the assigned radio shall, after their shift, turn over the same to the security guard assigned to the same post in the next shift. [3] In light of the foregoing, the Investigation Report concluded that respondents were the security personnel responsible for the loss of the subject radio as they were the last persons in possession of the same. [4] The Investigation Report was then forwarded to Sandiganbayan Associate Justice Oscar C. Herrera, Jr. (Justice Herrera) for a formal investigation. After due proceedings, Justice Herrera issued a Resolution [5] dated June 15, 2015 recommending that respondents be found guilty of simple neglect of duty, and accordingly, be meted the penalty of suspension from the service for a period ranging from one (1) month and one (1) day to two (2) months, with a warning that a repetition of the same or a similar offense shall warrant a more severe penalty. [6] During the investigation, Justice Herrera found that Ponce committed the aforementioned administrative offense when he failed to observe the proper turnover procedure of the subject radio to Bautista. According to Justice Herrera, the fact that Ponce recorded the turnover in his own record book does not exculpate him from liability because it is highly probable that he did so only as an afterthought when the subject radio had already been reported as missing. Furthermore, the fact that Ponce offered to replace the subject radio cannot likewise absolve him from any administrative liability, as such offer may be reasonably construed as an admission of fault for its loss. [7] On the other hand, Justice Herrera found that Cruz's assertion that there was no proper turnover of the subject radio to him does not absolve him of administrative liability. As such, considering that his acceptance of the subject radio from Ponce shows that Cruz assented to its custody and safekeeping, he should be held equally liable for its loss. [8] Given the foregoing facts, Justice Herrera concluded that respondents' failure to: ( a ) secure a government-issued property, i.e ., the subject radio; ( b ) observe existing procedures on the turnover of such radio which resulted in its loss; and ( c ) exercise due diligence and care required of them as security personnel to ensure the security and safety of the same, constitutes neglect of duty. Relatedly, Justice Herrera further concluded that the loss was not intentional but was rather due to carelessness and respondents' failure to observe vigilance. Hence, respondents should be held administratively liable for simple neglect of duty since their acts cannot be attributed to a flagrant and palpable breach of duty. However, Justice Herrera recommended that the minimum penalty be imposed on respondents due to the presence of the mitigating circumstance of first offense. [9] Thereafter, the Sandiganbayan forwarded its records relative to the instant administrative matter to the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) for proper action. Meanwhile, during the pendency of this administrative matter, the Court promulgated a Decision in Security and Sheriff Division, Sandiganbayan v. Cruz ( A.M. No. SB-17-24-P ), [10] finding Cruz guilty of improper solicitation. Accordingly, Cruz was meted the penalty of dismissal from service with forfeiture of all retirement benefits except accrued leave credits and perpetual disqualification from employment in any branch of the government or any of its agencies or instrumentalities, including government-owned and -controlled corporations. [11] The OCA Report and Recommendation In a Memorandum [12] dated November 29, 2019, the OCA recommended that respondents be found administratively liable for simple neglect of duty, and accordingly, be penalized as follows: ( a ) for Ponce, that he be meted the penalty of suspension for one (1) month and one (1) day without pay, with a stern warning that a repetition of the same act shall merit a more severe penalty; and ( b ) for Cruz, that he be meted instead the penalty of a fine in the amount of P5,000.00 payable within 30 days from notice, in lieu of suspension, considering that he could no longer be suspended on account of his supervening dismissal from the service. [13] Mainly upholding the findings of the Investigation Report, as well as the Resolution of Justice Herrera, the OCA held that respondents committed the administrative offense of simple neglect of duty when they failed to secure the subject radio, a government-issued property, by disregarding the existing procedure for the proper turnover thereof to Bautista, thus resulting in its unwarranted loss. Moreover, the OCA opined that since this is respondents' first offense, the same shall be appreciated as a mitigating circumstance in their favor. [14]","Given the foregoing jurisprudential guidance, the Court agrees with the findings of Justice Herrera, which is affirmed by the OCA, that respondents' acts which resulted in the loss of the subject radio should result in a finding of administrative liability against them. As succinctly found, respondents' failure to: ( a ) secure a government-issued property, i.e ., the subject radio; ( b ) observe existing procedures on the turnover of such radio which resulted in its loss; ( c ) exercise due diligence and care required of them as security personnel to ensure the security and safety of the same, constitutes neglect of duty. Furthermore, since the circumstances surrounding the loss of the subject radio show that such loss may be reasonably attributed to respondents' mere carelessness and their failure to observe vigilance, and hence, cannot be attributed to a flagrant and palpable breach of duty, they should be held administratively liable for simple neglect of duty only.","Under Rule 140, simple neglect of duty – now denominated as ""simple neglect of duty in the performance or non-performance of official functions"" – is a less serious charge [19] which is punishable by any of the following penalties: ( a ) suspension from office without salary and other benefits for not less than one (1) month nor more than six (6) months; or ( b ) a fine of more than P35,000.00 but not exceeding P100,000.00. [20] ... In this case, the Court agrees with both Justice Herrera and the OCA in appreciating the mitigating circumstance of first offense insofar as Ponce is concerned, as records are bereft of any showing that he incurred any other administrative offense prior to the one subject of the instant administrative matter. As such, and further noting that the Court, in several cases, has imposed the penalty of fine in lieu of suspension to prevent any undue adverse effect on public service, [22] the Court imposes on Ponce the penalty of a fine in the amount of P18,000.00. On the other hand, the Court could not appreciate the same mitigating circumstance in favor of Cruz, considering that he was previously found administratively liable and consequently penalized in A.M. No. SB-17-24-P . In this light, and further considering his supervening separation from the service, the Court imposes on him the penalty of a fine in the amount of P40,000.00.","ACCORDINGLY , the Court rules as follows: (1) Respondent Ferdinand Ponce, Security Guard II of Sheriff and Security Services Division, Sandiganbayan, is hereby found GUILTY of simple neglect of duty. He is ordered to pay a FINE in the amount of P18,000.00; and (2) Respondent Ronald Allan Gole Cruz, formerly a Security Guard I of the Sheriff and Security Services Division, Sandiganbayan, is hereby found GUILTY of simple neglect of duty. He is ordered to pay a FINE in the amount of P40,000.00. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 231238, June 20, 2022","LIGHT RAIL TRANSIT AUTHORITY, PETITIONER, VS. BUREAU OF INTERNAL REVENUE, REPRESENTED BY THE COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, RESPONDENTS.","Based on the submissions to this Court, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (the Commissioner), through the Regional Director of Revenue Region No. 8 (Regional Director), issued a Preliminary Assessment Notice[5] to the Light Rail Transit dated December 8, 2008, for deficiency income tax, value-added tax, withholding tax on compensation, expanded withholding tax, and withholding of value-added tax for the year 2003, the total amount being P3,521,915.61. Light Rail Transit filed a protest[6] to the Preliminary Assessment Notice. On December 24, 2008, the Regional Director issued the Formal Assessment Notice,[7] and the alleged deficiency taxes, inclusive of interests, amounted to P3,555,982.19. The Light Rail Transit likewise protested the Formal Assessment Notice on January 7, 2009.[8] On April 1, 2011, the Regional Director issued the Final Decision on Disputed Assessment,[9] denying the Light Rail Transit's protest to the Formal Assessment Notice. The Light Rail Transit received a copy of the Final Decision on Disputed Assessment on April 26, 2011.[10] On May 6, 2011, the Light Rail Transit appealed[11] the Commissioner's Final Decision on Disputed Assessment. Pending resolution of the Light Rail Transit's appeal to the Commissioner, the Officer-in-Charge Revenue District Officer... issued a Preliminary Collection Letter[12] on September 20, 2011... Still, on November 23, 2011, the Revenue District Officer issued a Final Notice Before Seizure,[15] giving the Light Rail Transit 10 days from receipt within which to settle its tax liabilities. On March 5, 2012, the Revenue District Officer issued a Warrant of Distraint and/or Levy,[18] which the Light Rail Transit received on May 17, 2012. Through an April 4, 2013 Letter,[20] the Revenue District Officer forwarded the docket of the case to a Revenue Officer with the instruction to pursue the reinvestigation... However, in a June 9, 2014 Letter,[21] the Revenue District Officer dropped the reinvestigation of Light Rail Transit's case for failure to submit required documents. Then, in a June 30, 2014 Letter,[23] the Regional Director, acting on the May 6, 2011 appeal of the Light Rail Transit to the Office of the Commissioner, again declared the case final, executory, and demandable for Light Rail Transit's failure to submit the required documents. The Light Rail Transit received a copy of the June 30, 2014 Letter on August 12, 2014.[24] On September 11, 2014, the Light Rail Transit filed a Petition for Review before the Court of Tax Appeals.[25] The Court of Tax Appeals Third Division granted the Motion to Dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, finding that the assessment had become final and unappealable. The Court of Tax Appeals En Banc denied the Light Rail Transit's Petition for Review[43] for lack of merit, reckoning the 30-day appeal period from April 26, 2011 (receipt of FDDA), and concluding the assessment attained finality.",The Petition for Review on Certiorari is granted.,"In cases of inaction by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue on appeals of denials of protest, the taxpayer has the option to await the Commissioner's decision on appeal before filing a petition for review before the Court of Tax Appeals. The petition for review can be filed notwithstanding the expiration of the 180-day period for the Commissioner to resolve protests of assessments. . . The June 30, 2014 Letter denying petitioner's appeal was the final decision on the protest that is appealable to the Court of Tax Appeals. With petitioner having filed its Petition for Review within 30 days from receipt of the June 30, 2014 Letter, the Court of Tax Appeals had jurisdiction over the petitioner's Petition for Review. . .

"G.R. No. 254800, June 20, 2022","BRYAN TA-ALA Y CONSTANTINO, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","On August 6, 2016, SPO4 Liberato S. Yorpo ( SPO4 YORPO ) and SPO1 Jerome G. Jambaro ( SPO1 JAMBARO ) of the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group ( CIDG ), Negros Occidental effected the warrantless arrest of petitioner Bryan Ta-ala y Constantino and one Wilford Palma y Zarceno ( Palma ). Police claimed they received an intelligence report about a package containing contraband firearms and accessories shipped via ATLAS Shippers International Incorporated to Bacolod City. SPO4 Yorpo and SPO1 Jambaro posed as errand boys. When Palma (claiming as Michael Diamante) picked up the package, and petitioner (the driver) stepped out, the officers claimed they saw a Glock 26 9mm pistol tucked in petitioner’s waist, and saw the contents of the opened box (firearm accessories). They effected a warrantless arrest. The Affidavit of Arrest, however, stated that the same Glock 26 9mm pistol (SN: ELR043) was both found tucked in petitioner’s waist and also listed among the contents seized inside the package. The inquest proceedings conducted by ASP Vito Cruz resulted in multiple criminal charges filed against petitioner. The first two Informations were filed one month later for two counts of violation of Section 28 of RA 10591 (illegal possession of firearm and illegal possession of firearm accessories), docketed as Criminal Case Nos. 16-43163 and 16-43164 (the latter was later withdrawn). Despite posting bail in both cases, petitioner was not released because ASP Vito Cruz converted the inquest into a preliminary investigation for illegal importation charges (non-bailable). The last two Informations were filed two months after the arrest: violation of Section 33, RA 10591 (illegal importation of firearm accessories, Criminal Case No. 16-43487), and violation of the Tariff and Customs Code (Criminal Case No. 16-43488, later withdrawn). In Criminal Case No. 16-43163 (illegal possession of firearm), petitioner filed a Motion to Quash and to Suppress Evidence which was denied by RTC-Branch 46. In Criminal Case No. 16-43487 (illegal importation), petitioner filed an Omnibus Motion (challenging the arrest, probable cause, and seeking bail) which was denied by RTC-Branch 54, which also denied bail. Petitioner initiated two Petitions for Certiorari before the Court of Appeals (CA-G.R. SP No. 10697 and CA-G.R. SP No. 10873). The CA consolidated and dismissed both petitions in a Decision dated May 9, 2019, affirming the denial of petitioner's motions and holding that the warrantless arrest was valid. Petitioner filed the present Petition for Review on Certiorari.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated May 9, 2019 and Resolution dated January 30, 2020 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 10697 and CA-G.R. SP No. 10873 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The Resolution dated August 22, 2016 and Resolution dated September 13, 2016 of the Department of Justice through Assistant State Prosecutor Michael A. Vito Cruz in NPS Docket No. XVI-INQ-16H-00110 are likewise REVERSED and SET ASIDE.","The petition is NOT academic. Petitioner timely filed the relevant motions questioning his arrest, that is, before his arraignment where he refused to enter a plea. The arrest was illegal. The Affidavit of Arrest reveals that the Glock 26 9mm cal. pistol with Serial No. ELR043 was seen tucked in the waist of petitioner and consequently seized from his possession and control. But the same one unit Glock 26 9mm pistol with Serial No. SN. ELR043 was also listed in the inventory of contrabands supposedly found in the box which Palma had claimed from Atlas Shipping International. The Court cannot ignore these apparently irreconcilable and conflicting facts on record emanating no less than from the arresting officers themselves. This discrepancy cannot simply be brushed aside. Petitioner's warrantless arrest is clearly and convincingly a case of frame up and planting of evidence. For without seeing petitioner in actual possession of the pistol, and thereafter, inside the box of alleged contrabands, the police officers had no reason to effect his warrantless arrest in flagrante delicto, let alone, seize the same and the other supposed illegal items in his possession. They had no probable cause to arrest petitioner without a warrant and to search and seize the box as an incident of the arrest. The alleged firearm and its ammunitions, i.e., Glock 26 9mm cal. pistol with Serial No. ELR043, and the boxful of alleged firearm accessories or paraphernalia, are fruits of the poisonous tree, which are inadmissible in any proceeding for any purpose whatsoever. The inquest and later the preliminary investigation conducted by ASP Vito Cruz were illegal. ASP Vito Cruz had 36 hours to complete the inquest, resolve the complaint, and file the Informations, if any. Had he needed more time to resolve, he should have converted the inquest to a regular preliminary investigation, but petitioner should have been released in the meantime. By making petitioner suffer incarceration as ASP Vito Cruz bade his time to complete the inquest, ASP Vito Cruz and the DOJ violated petitioner's right not to be deprived of his liberty without due process of law.","The following criminal cases filed against petitioner BRYAN TA-ALA y CONSTANTINO are DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE: a) People of the Philippines v. Bryan Ta-Ala y Constantino before the Regional Trial Court for Negros Occidental, Bacolod City, Branch 46, Criminal Case No. 16-43163 for violation of Section 28, Republic Act No. 10591 for illegal possession of firearm and ammunitions; and b) People of the Philippines v. Bryan Ta-Ala y Constantino before the Regional Trial Court for Negros Occidental, Bacolod City, Branch 54, Criminal Case No. 16-43487 for violation of Section 33, Republic Act No. 10591 for illegal importation of firearm accessories.

"G.R. No. 217866, June 20, 2022","SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM, PETITIONER, VS. VIOLETA A. SIMACAS, RESPONDENT.","Irnido L. Simacas worked as a Fabrication Helper at Fieldstar Manufacturing Corporation from April 1995 until February 2010 where he assisted the welder and machinist in cutting steel materials. Two years before retiring, Irnido complained of back pains and incessant coughing. He was retired from work by Fieldstar in February 2010. On February 20, 2010, Irnido was hospitalized due to back pains, cough, dysuria or painful urination, night sweating, and fever. He was diagnosed ""with Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy (BHP) T/C (to consider) Prostatic Cancer and Pneumonia vs. Pulmonary Tuberculosis[.]"" On July 13, 2010, Irnido died at the Philippine Orthopedic Center. His death certificate stated that the immediate cause of his death was Cardiopulmonary Arrest probably secondary to Metastatic Prostatic Adenocarcinoma. Violeta, Irnido's surviving spouse, filed a claim for employees' compensation benefits which was denied by the Social Security System Sta. Maria Branch on the ground that the cause of Irnido's death was a non-occupational disease. The Employees Compensation Commission affirmed the denial of Violeta's claim, ruling that Violeta was required to prove that Irnido's work increased the risk of him contracting prostate cancer, and that no evidence was presented by Violeta to establish a causal relation between Irnido's work and the illness which caused his death. Violeta appealed before the Court of Appeals, which reversed the Commission's decision and ordered the Social Security System to pay Violeta's claim for death benefits. The CA stressed that Presidential Decree No. 626 is a social legislation and held that it was impossible for Violeta to present evidence of causal relation since the specific cause for prostate cancer is medically unknown. Social Security System moved for reconsideration but it was denied. Dissatisfied, Social Security System filed a Petition for Review before this Court.","The Petition is DENIED. The Court of Appeals' August 29, 2014 Decision and April 8, 2015 Resolution in CA-G.R. SP No. 126890 are hereby affirmed.","The Labor Code defines sickness as ""any illness definitely accepted as an occupational disease listed by the Commission, or any illness caused by employment subject to proof that the risk of contracting the same is increased by working conditions."" Since the sickness which caused Irnido's death (prostate cancer) is not a listed occupational disease, it was incumbent upon respondent to demonstrate that the risk of contracting prostate cancer was increased by Irnido's working conditions. The claimant need only present substantial proof establishing a reasonable work-connection, not a direct causal relation. A review of the records reveals that respondent proved that Irnido's working conditions increased the risk of him contracting prostate cancer. Irnido's work included assisting the welder and machinist in cutting steel materials. Workers engaged in the manufacturing or handling stainless steel are exposed to chromium in varying degrees, and several studies have suggested that work-related exposures to certain substances, such as chromium, have the potential of affecting the risk of getting prostate cancer. This probability suffices to warrant the grant of the claimed benefits. Presidential Decree No. 626 is a social legislation which should be liberally construed in favor of labor.",The Court of Appeals' Decision ordering the Social Security System to pay Violeta Simacas' claim for death benefits is affirmed.

The P510,000,000.00 loan was specifically for acquiring 50,000,000 Philex Mining Corporation (Philex) shares from DBP at P12.75 per share, registered in the name of Goldenmedia Corporation (also owned by Ongpin). DBP officers were involved in the quick approval despite Deltaventure's questionable financial standing. A day after acquisition, Goldenmedia sold these 50,000,000 Philex shares, along with others, to Two Rivers Pacific Holdings Corporation for a negotiated price of P21.00 per share. DBP executives filed a complaint before the Ombudsman, alleging violation of banking laws and RA 3019, claiming the transaction caused DBP P415,000,000.00 in opportunity trading gains/losses. The Anti-Money Laundering Council (AMLC) found probable cause that the transactions related to an unlawful activity, noting the DBP officers' bank transactions were grossly disproportionate to their legitimate income.

"G.R. No. 239995, June 15, 2022","ROSA C. GONZALBO-MACATANGAY, PETITIONER, VS. HONORABLE CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION, RESPONDENT.","Petitioner held the position of Secretary in the Passport Division of the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA).[7] On September 5, 2002, Marites L. Calivara (Marites) filed a complaint­-affidavit before the CSC alleging that during the existence of Marites' marriage with Modesto Macatangay, Jr. (Modesto), Modesto contracted a second marriage with petitioner on February 3, 1997.[8] This prompted Marites to file a criminal case for Bigamy before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Lucena City.[9] Upon arraignment, petitioner and Modesto pleaded guilty, resulting to their conviction for the crime of Bigamy.[10] The RTC Decision became final and executory on October 8, 2002.[11] In her counter-affidavit, petitioner alleged that: (a) Modesto introduced the idea of marriage when she became pregnant with his child; (b) she has no knowledge of Modesto's previous existing marriage when she agreed to marry him; (c) she eventually learned about Modesto's previous existing marriage with Marites sometime in April 1996; (d) she became uncertain about her child, which drove her to marry Modesto on February 3, 1997—her lawyer friend, however, advised her that her marriage to Modesto is illegal; (e) on September 27, 1999, the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Makati City rendered a decision in a civil case declaring petitioner and Modesto's marriage void; and, (f) on August 16, 1999, Modesto filed before the RTC, Labo, Camarines Norte a petition for declaration of nullity of his marriage with Marites.[12] The CSC-NCR, through a Formal Charge,[13] indicted petitioner for the administrative offense of Conviction of a Crime Involving Moral Turpitude. Petitioner added that in July 29, 2004, the RTC, Labo, Camarines Norte rendered a decision declaring Marites and Modesto's marriage null and void.[14] Subsequently, on September 4, 2004, petitioner and Modesto contracted marriage in Tokyo, Japan.[15] Petitioner also claimed that the complaint violates the prohibition against multiplicity of suits and the doctrine of res judicata.[16]","This Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] assails the August 10, 2017 Decision[2] and the May 9, 2018 Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R.

Gonzalbo-Macatangay from service for being found guilty of the administrative offense of Conviction of a Crime Involving Moral Turpitude.","The Petition is not meritorious. The Court affirms the CA ruling; the imposition of the penalty of dismissal from service is proper. . . . The Court notes that petitioner does not contest that: she is guilty of the administrative offense of Conviction of a Crime Involving Moral Turpitude; and that the crime of Bigamy, which she was convicted of in a criminal case before the trial court, is a crime involving moral turpitude. What she assails is the CSC's imposition of the penalty of dismissal from service upon the finding of her administrative guilt. . . . The Court rules in the negative. The CA is correct in not appreciating the mitigating circumstances petitioner invokes. The facts of the instant case do not justify the mitigation of the prescribed penalty. . . . The administrative offense of Conviction of a Crime Involving Moral Turpitude is a grave offense, punishable by dismissal from service. . . . Petitioner's invocation of first offense and outstanding performance in service fails to convince. First, the URACCS clearly state that the offense of Conviction of a Crime Involving Moral Turpitude is punishable with dismissal from service upon first commission. . . . Second, first offense and outstanding performance are not provided in Section 53 of the URACCS as circumstances that may be appreciated. Her invocation of these has no basis under the Rules. . . . Finally, on petitioner's allegation that her right to speedy disposition of cases is violated, the Court finds that the requisites for its proper invocation as provided in Cagang v. Sandiganbayan[64] were not complied with. . . . Considering the foregoing, the imposition of the penalty of dismissal from service upon petitioner is proper.","WHEREFORE, the Petition is DENIED. The August 10, 2017 Decision and the May 9, 2018 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 142681 are AFFIRMED."
"G.R. No. 214960, June 15, 2022","TONY N. CHUA, JIMMY N. CHUA, AND ERNEST T. JENG, PETITIONERS , VS. SECRETARY OF JUSTICE AND BDO UNIBANK, INC., RESPONDENTS.","This case arose from a Complaint-Affidavit filed with the Office of the City Prosecutor, Makati City, by private respondent BDO Unibank, Inc. (BDO) against petitioners for four counts of violation of the Trust Receipts Law. Petitioners are the responsible officers of NF Agri-Business Corporation (NF ABC). In 1999, EBC (predecessor of BDO) issued commercial letters of credit and imported merchandise (peruvian fish meal and various kinds of soybean meals) for the account of NF ABC. Consequently, petitioners executed trust receipts totaling P20,409,638.23, payable within 90 days from their dates of execution. NF ABC failed to pay its obligation under the trust receipts when it became due. On December 16, 2008, BDO demanded payment of the outstanding obligation in the amount of P17,430,882.88; despite demand, NF ABC failed to turn-over the proceeds of the sale of the goods, or return the goods if not sold. In their defense, petitioners alleged that NF ABC was severely affected by the Asian Financial Crisis and successive typhoons, compelling them to sell the goods at a non-profitable price or some goods perished. They argued that they entered into negotiations with BDO and reached an agreement on a revised repayment schedule, issuing postdated checks until March 2004, claiming that this resulted in a novation converting the trust receipt transaction into a simple loan.","The City Prosecutor of Makati City dismissed the Complaint-Affidavit, holding that there was a novation. This dismissal was initially affirmed by the Department of Justice, through the Chief State Prosecutor (June 1, 2010 Resolution). However, in a March 30, 2011 Resolution, the SOJ reversed the dismissal, finding that there was no novation but merely modifications of the terms regarding the schedule of payments, and directed the filing of four counts of Estafa under Article 315, par. 1(b) of the Revised Penal Code in relation to P.D. No. 115. The SOJ denied reconsideration in a Resolution dated February 20, 2012. The Court of Appeals, in its May 29, 2014 Decision, dismissed the Petition for Certiorari, affirming the SOJ's finding of probable cause, holding that the obligations under the trust receipts were not novated; the schedule of payments merely modified the terms of payment of the old obligation.","The Petition has no merit. The Court affirms the finding of the CA that the SOJ did not commit grave abuse of discretion in ordering the filing of four counts of Estafa under the RPC, in relation to the Trust Receipts Law. The Court holds that petitioners' obligation under the trust receipt agreements was not novated. Novation requires that it be declared in unequivocal terms or that the old and new obligations be on every point incompatible, neither of which occurred here. The new schedule of payments merely modified the terms of payment of the old obligation; it was merely modificatory and supplementary to the original obligation. The offense of violation of the Trust Receipts Law is malum prohibitum: mere failure to turn over the proceeds of the sale, or to return the goods themselves if not sold, amounts to the violation. By this mere failure, criminal liability attaches under the law.","WHEREFORE, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED. The May 29, 2014 Decision and October 15, 2014 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 124558, are AFFIRMED. The City Prosecutor of Makati City is DIRECTED to file four counts of Estafa under Article 315, paragraph 1(b) of the Revised Penal Code in relation to Presidential Decree No. 115, or the Trust Receipts Law, against petitioners Tony N. Chua, Jimmy N. Chua, and Ernest T. Jeng. In the event that an Information has already been filed, the branch of the Regional Trial Court, Makati City where the criminal case is raffled, is DIRECTED to commence or continue with the proceedings with DISPATCH. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 206847, June 15, 2022","THE HEIRS OF ZENAIDA B. GONZALES, REPRESENTED BY ARNEL B. GONZALES, PETITIONERS , VS. SPOUSES DOMINADOR AND ESTEFANIA BASAS AND ROMEO MUNDA, RESPONDENTS .","The late Zenaida B. Gonzales (Zenaida) purchased from respondents spouses Dominador and Estefania Basas (collectively, spouses Basas), a parcel of land covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. (TCT) 187898 (subject property), which had an annotation requiring the consent of the National Housing Authority (NHA) for disposal. Zenaida and the spouses Basas executed three documents: I. Contract to Sell dated May 10, 1996 (total price P800,000.00); II. Deed of Absolute Sale (DOAS) dated May 13, 1996 (consideration P300,000.00); and III. Agreement to Purchase and to Sell allegedly dated August 14, 1996 (total price P1,050,000.00). Zenaida paid over P800,000.00 but withheld the balance because the spouses Basas failed to obtain the NHA’s written consent. Zenaida sent a demand letter dated January 4, 1997, asking the spouses Basas to vacate the property, provide the title, and get the NHA consent. Zenaida subsequently discovered that the spouses Basas sold the subject property again to respondent Romeo Munda (Munda). Zenaida caused the annotation of her affidavit of adverse claim on the title on October 29, 1997. Zenaida filed a complaint on May 25, 1998 for nullity of sale, specific performance, and damages against respondents. Spouses Basas claimed that the August 14, 1996 Agreement superseded the prior documents and that ownership was retained by them until Zenaida fully paid the purchase price. Munda argued he purchased the property in good faith for value via a Deed of Absolute Sale dated August 25, 1997, at which time the title was clean, as Zenaida's adverse claim was annotated later (October 29, 1997). The subject property was eventually registered under Munda’s name on March 2, 1998 under TCT 237326.","Aggrieved with the RTC's ruling, respondents filed an appeal with the CA. However, in its November 5, 2012 Decision, the CA reversed the findings of the RTC and found Munda as a buyer in good faith and for value. The fallo of CA Decision reads: x x x x Accordingly, the Deed of Sale dated August 25, 1997 between Dominador Basa (sic.), married to Estefania Basa (sic.), and Romeo Munda, and the Transfer Certificate of Title No. 237326 in the name of Romeo Munda, are declared VALID. SO ORDERED.","We grant the petition. Petitioners sufficiently proved that the spouses Basas sold the subject property to their predecessor-in-interest, Zenaida, and that ownership of the same was constructively delivered to the latter pursuant to said sale upon execution of the May 13, 1996 DOAS, and later reinforced by the August 14, 1996 Agreement, subject to the resolutory conditions stated in the latter. Consequently, the spouses Basas had no right over the subject property which they could transfer to Munda on August 25, 1997. It was of no moment that Munda was able to register the land under his name in the Register of Deeds because registration is not a mode of acquiring ownership and moreover, he was a buyer and registrant in bad faith. ... The RTC aptly found Munda as a buyer in bad faith, and the CA also correctly held that at the time of execution of Munda's deed of sale with the spouses Basas on August 25, 1997, he may have had no knowledge yet of the defect in the Basas' title as sellers, since Zenaida's adverse claim was annotated only on October 29, 1997. However, there are other circumstances that established Munda's bad faith. Records show that Munda already had knowledge of the defect in the sellers' title: (a) when he procured the NHA's approval dated December 1, 1997; (b) when he paid the transfer fee on January 30, 1998, and (c) subsequently upon submission of the foregoing documents to the Register of Deeds. ... Since Munda proceeded to register his title despite knowledge of Zenaida's adverse claim, he is deemed a buyer and registrant in bad faith.","WHEREFORE, the instant petition is hereby GRANTED. The November 5, 2012 Decision and the April 18, 2013 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 93712 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The October 6, 2008 Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Manila City, Branch 32 in Civil Case No. 98-88713 is REINSTATED with MODIFICATION in that the award of exemplary damages shall earn interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from date of finality of this Decision until full payment.

"G.R. Nos. 251587-88, June 15, 2022","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. ROGELIO M. PIMENTEL AND HERMINIGILDO Q. REYES, ACCUSED-APPELLANTS.","Pimentel, Municipal Mayor, and Reyes, Barangay Captain of Unaban, Tago, Surigao del Sur, were charged with violating Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 and Article 217 of the RPC for allegedly conspiring to misappropriate public property. The properties consisted of 286 sacks of cement and 280 ten-millimeter steel bars (worth P121,366.80), which were government properties intended for the construction of a Multi-Purpose Drying Pavement (MPDP) for the Unaban Farmers Association. Reyes received the materials on December 17, 2013. Former Barangay Captain Salamo filed a complaint alleging that in January 2014, the materials were borrowed by Pimentel and transported to his private resort in Socorro, Surigao del Norte, for personal use, with Reyes' approval. During the preliminary investigation, Pimentel and Reyes filed counter-affidavits wherein they admitted the first ten paragraphs of Salamo's complaint (which alleged the transport and use in Pimentel's private resort) but vehemently denied the imputation of criminal acts. In court, Pimentel and Reyes testified that they merely transferred the materials to nearby Barangay Gamut due to severe flooding caused by Typhoon Agaton and that Pimentel replaced all the materials, whether damaged or not, to protect his good name, insisting they were never used for personal consumption in Socorro.","On October 4, 2019, the Sandiganbayan rendered its Decision finding both Reyes and Pimentel guilty beyond reasonable doubt for violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 and Article 217 of the RPC. In Criminal Case No. SB-16-CRM-0479 (R.A. 3019), they were sentenced to suffer an indeterminate penalty of imprisonment of six (6) years and one (1) day, as minimum, to eight (8) years as maximum, with perpetual disqualification from holding public office. In Criminal Case No. SB-16-CRM-0480 (Malversation), they were sentenced to suffer an indeterminate penalty of imprisonment of Two (2) years, Four (4) months, and One (1) day of prision correccional, as minimum, to Six (6) years and One (1) day of prision mayor, as maximum, with perpetual special disqualification from holding public office, and to each pay a fine of One Hundred Twenty-One Thousand Three Hundred Sixty-Six Pesos and Eighty Centavos (Php121,366.80).","The Supreme Court found the appeal meritorious. The Sandiganbayan erred in relying heavily on former Barangay Captain Salamo's affidavit-complaint, which was hearsay evidence as she was not presented as a witness to be subjected to cross-examination, and the allegations were not based on her personal knowledge. While the accused's counter-affidavits admitted the transportation of the materials to Socorro, they also contained specific and vehement denials of the commission of the crimes charged. The Court ruled that the mere suspicion raised by the inconsistency in the accused's statements, or the unqualified admission of transporting the materials, was insufficient to establish, beyond reasonable doubt, that Pimentel and Reyes acted with manifest partiality or evident bad faith, or that the materials were actually converted for Pimentel's personal use, which are essential elements of the crimes charged.","The appeal is GRANTED. The Decision dated October 4, 2019, and the Resolution dated January 24, 2020, issued by the Sandiganbayan in SB-16-CRM-0479 and SB-16-CRM-0480, are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Accordingly, accused-appellants Rogelio Maquinano Pimentel and Herminigildo Quico Reyes are ACQUITTED for failure of the prosecution to prove their guilt beyond reasonable doubt."

VILLAFUERTE, MA. LUISA I. PARAS, RUEL S. VILLACORTA, TERESITA C. FERNANDO, LC LOPEZ RESOURCES, INC., AND CONQUEROR INTERNATIONAL, INC., RESPONDENTS.","Insofar as they are relevant to the resolution of the instant petition, the facts are as follows: PROCEEDINGS IN THE QUEZON CITY REGIONAL TRIAL COURT On 1 March 2019, Lily C. Lopez (petitioner), along with Ma.[3] Christina Patricia C. Lopez (Christina), filed before the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City (RTC-QC) a case[4] for election contest against Lolito S. Lopez (respondent Lolito), Ma. Rachel Nicolette Lopez, Barbara Villas, Benedicto Villafuerte, Ma. Luisa Paras, Ruel Villacorta, Teresita C. Fernando, and iSpecialist Development Corporation (respondents, collectively). Docketed as Commercial Case No. R-QZN-19-03290-CV, the case was assigned to Branch 93 of RTC-QC,[5] which was designated as a special commercial court.[6] iSpecialist Development Corporation (respondent iSpecialist) is engaged in the management and operation of a public market. It leases out market stalls in New Nova Plaza Market.[7] Since its incorporation in 2011, it was being run by petitioner and her husband, respondent Lolito, who is also the president of said corporation.[8] Petitioner and respondent Lolito own the majority shares of iSpecialist.[9] On 14 February 2019, respondent Lolito, in his capacity as president of iSpecialist, called a special stockholders' meeting of said corporation, to be held at Anabel's Restaurant in Quezon City.[10] During said meeting, new members of the Board of Directors were elected: namely, respondent Lolito, Ma. Rachel Nicolette Lopez, Teresita Fernando, Barbara Villas and Benedicto Villafuerte.[11] Petitioner filed the Complaint a quo seeking to declare the nullity of the special stockholders' meeting and consequent election on the ground that they were conducted in violation of the By-Laws and Articles of Incorporation of iSpecialist. According to petitioner, the meeting was null and void as it was not held in the principal office of iSpecialist, as required by its by-laws. Furthermore, it was held on a date different from that explicitly mandated by the same by-laws.[12] Petitioner likewise argued that the conduct of the meeting was also void on the additional ground that Christina, who claimed to be a stockholder of iSpecialist, was prevented from attending it.[13] Petitioner further asserted that the elections should be nullified, as 33,495 unissued shares were allowed to vote and were actually used to elect the new Board of Directors. Petitioner also claimed that said shares could not be utilized without violating her right to pre-emptive right.[14] Finally, petitioner contended that respondent Lolito had no right at all to vote any or all of his shares of stock as said shares were conjugal in nature, having been acquired during the existence of their marriage.[15] Responding to the complaint, respondent Lolito and his co-defendants insisted on the validity of the meeting and the subsequent elections. They countered that under Section 2, Article II of the corporation's By-Laws, special meetings of stockholders may at any time be called by the president of the corporation.[16] The venue was also valid as under Section 51 of the Corporation Code, regular or special meetings may be held in the city or municipality where the principal office is located—in this case, Quezon City.[17] On 29 July 2019, the court a quo rendered its Decision[18] finding for petitioner and Christina and declaring the 14 February 2019 elections null and void. The dispositive portion of said decision reads: WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiffs, and against the defendants, as follows: a. Declaring as null and void ab initio the Special Stockholders Meeting/Elections held on February 14, 2019, as well as any and all proceedings held therein, and b. Enjoining all of the herein defendants from representing themselves as the newly-elected Directors and/or officers of the defendant corporation on the basis of the Special Stockholders Meeting/Elections held on February 14, 2019. SO ORDERED.[19] The trial court found that in iSpecialist's 2013 General Information Sheet (GIS), the total number of common shares was only 12,500, with respondent Lolito and petitioner holding 44.75% each of the total shareholdings, or 5,592 common shares for each of them. Respondent Lolito allegedly infused his personal money into the corporation as additional capital by purchasing 33,495 unissued shares.[20] However, the trial court held that the unissued shares in excess of the 12,500 shares originally issued by the corporation may only be issued by authority of the Board of Directors. Prior authorization of the Board was necessary to validate the sale of the unissued shares.[21] When he was cross-examined during trial a quo, respondent Lolito admitted that there was no such board resolution authorizing the sale and that, despite the absence of prior authorization by said Board, he proceeded to make the purchase and eventually voted such shares in the questioned elections of the Board.[22] Citing Section 23 of the Corporation Code, in relation to Section 25 of the same code, the court a quo held that all corporate business of iSpecialist should be conducted by the Board of Directors and that no individual corporate officer could solely exercise any corporate power without authority from said Board.[23] It ruled that since the sale was invalid, the erstwhile unissued shares could not be voted upon. And because the number of shares illegally issued were substantial enough to affect the elections, the latter should likewise be voided, as the court did so.[24] PROCEEDINGS IN THE MARIKINA CITY REGIONAL TRIAL COURT Petitioner, together with Christina and John Rusty Lito C. Lopez (John Rusty) as plaintiffs, also filed an election contest[25] docketed as SEC Case Nos. 2019-29 to 31 before Branch 273 of the Regional Trial Court of Marikina City (RTC-Marikina). Alleging that they were stockholders and directors of LC Lopez Resources, Inc. (LC Lopez), Conqueror International, Inc. (Conqueror) and Russ Marketing, Inc. (Russ Marketing), they questioned the validity of a stockholders' meeting held on 11 February 2019.[26] According to petitioner and her co-plaintiffs, who are her children with respondent Lolito, on 29 January 2019, they individually received notice for the said meeting, signed by respondent Lolito in his capacity as chairman of the board of directors and president of said corporations.[27] Both Christina and John Rusty sent proxies to the said meeting, but they were turned away because allegedly, their principals (Christina and John Rusty) were not stockholders of the corporations.[28] Petitioner, meanwhile, walked out of the venue after she was not allowed to have her lawyer around for the said meeting. However, the meeting went ahead and resulted in the election of a new set of board of directors for the aforesaid corporations.[29] According to petitioner, on 26 November 2018, or some two months prior to the meeting, respondent Lolito acquired 252,125 unissued shares of stock in LC Lopez, and 97,050 unissued shares of stock in Conqueror.[30] He used said shares, which were purchased without any board resolution of the two aforesaid corporations, to ostensibly elect, or cause to be elected, his co­defendants as directors for the two aforesaid corporations, in the process ousting petitioner, Christina, and John Rusty as directors and officers thereof.[31] Petitioner and her co-plaintiffs thereafter filed the complaint a quo, assailing the alleged invalidity of the meeting and the eventual election of a new board of directors.[32] Respondent Lolito and his co-defendants in the complaint a quo insisted on the validity of the meeting even as they sought the dismissal of the complaint insofar as Christina and John Rusty were concerned, claiming that they were not parties-in-interest as they were not stockholders of the subject corporations.[33] They likewise sought to have the complaint dismissed in the case of Russ Marketing, saying that the scheduled election for its board of directors actually did not push through during the said meeting. In its Decision[34] dated 13 September 2019, RTC-Marikina rendered judgment in favor of petitioner and her co-plaintiffs and declared the special stockholders' meeting held on 11 February 2019 and all activities made in its course, including the election of a new set of board of directors, to be null, void, and of no force and effect. The court a quo found that both Christina and John Rusty were indeed stockholders of the subject corporations despite the fact that their names were not listed in the subject corporation's Stock and Transfer Book (STB), although they did appear as stockholders in the General Information Sheet (GIS) submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission.[37] However, the trial court ruled that the cited cases could not be applied squarely to the case at bar because of differing factual milieus,[39] foremost of which was that unlike in the Velasco and Lao cases, in the instant case, petitioner and her co-plaintiffs relied not only on the GIS but also on other circumstances to support their claim: first, respondent Lolito himself, as well as his other co-defendants, Benedicto L. Villafuerte and Teresita Fernando, confirmed that the two were indeed stockholders of the subject corporations; second, the three corporations were not in the habit of religiously complying with legal corporate requisites as according to Mario Lopez (Mario), the supposed corporate secretary, even the stock certificates of respondent Lolito and those of his five co-defendants were signed only a few days before the 11 February 2019 special stockholders' meeting; and, third, the subject corporations could be strictly considered family corporations, and that at least before conflicts started to appear among family members, petitioner and respondent Lolito really intended their two children to be stockholders thereof, which would explain the inclusion of their names in the GIS.[40] The court a quo also ruled that the issuance of the stock certificates to respondent Lolito and his co-defendants was a clear afterthought and was obviously rigged, apparently in preparation to ousting the original members of the board. It even held the certificates to be void, as it was not executed by Mario, but by a certain Edna Victoria (Edna), the accounting head of LC Lopez, who did not have the legal mandate to do so.[41] On this matter, the trial court cited part of the testimony of Mario, thus: Atty. Nazareno: In relation to that mister witness, I refer you to A20 of your judicial affidavit where you testified ""nilagyan ni Edna ng entrada iyong Libro ng LC Lopez at Conqueror x x x x"" Witness: Yes, sir. Atty. Nazareno: And by Edna, you mean Edna Victoria? Witness: Yes, sir. x x x x Witness: Yes, sir. Atty. Nazareno: And again in A20, you said that nilagyan ni Edna ng entrada iyong libro ng LC Lopez,"" when did she put the entries? Witness: I cannot recall, sir. Atty. Nazareno: But this was after you sought the lawyer's advice who said that you should fix the entries of the stock and transfer book, correct? Witness: Yes, sir. x x x x Atty. Nazareno: And in fact, all of the entries in the stock and transfer book were made by Edna, correct? Witness: Yes, sir. Court: Okay. Were you present when Ms. Edna entered and wrote those entries in the stock and transfer book? Witness: Yes, your Honor. x x x x Court: So, tell the court what documents were relied as basis by Edna in making those entries in the stock and transfer book? x x x x Witness: I don't know the documents. Atty. Nazareno: And mister witness, you just testified that you were there when the entries were being made. And after which you signed, correct? Witness: Yes, sir. x x x x Atty. Nazareno: And this was sometime in January 2019? Witness: I cannot recall the exact date, sir. Atty. Nazareno: But it was this year? Witness: Yes, sir. Atty. Nazareno: I am showing you this Exhibit ""6"", which is the stock and transfer book of Conqueror. Similarly, all the entries here were prepared by Edna, correct? Witness: Yes, sir. x x x x Atty. Nazareno: And similarly, you are not familiar with the documents that was the basis of Edna in making those entries, correct? Witness: Yes, sir. Atty. Nazareno: Again, you signed it in 2019, correct? Witness: Yes, sir. [42] According to the trial court, the act of Edna in filling out the entries in the STB was in violation of Article IV, Section 5 of the by-laws of both LC Lopez and Conqueror, as it was required therein it should be the corporate secretary, in this case Mario, who should do all the recording in the STB.[43] Even the stock certificates themselves did not escape the trial court's scrutiny, noting that it did not comply with the jurisprudential requisites for their validity. Citing the case of Bitong vs. Court of Appeals,[44] the court held that for the stock certificates to be valid, the par value, as to par value shares, or the full subscription as to no par value shares, must have been fully paid first.[45] It found that respondent Lolito, as reflected in the corporations' Articles of Incorporation, had only paid 25% of his subscribed shares, and was not able to present any proof of fully paying for his entire subscription.[46] Finally, the court ruled that respondent Lolito was estopped from questioning the shareholder status of his two children after he testified in open court that he recognized them both as members of the Board of Directors, but only for the purpose of transacting with banks. According to the trial court, respondent Lolito should not be allowed to confirm or deny the two as stockholders and directors depending on the circumstances and whenever it fitted him.[47] Concluding that the two children were stockholders and directors of the subject corporations, the trial court held that they had every right to be present during the special stockholders' meeting. It ruled that the refusal of respondent Lolito to allow the two children and petitioner from attending the special stockholders' meeting greatly affected the validity of its conduct, as no quorum could have been acquired.[48] The trial court ruled that to validate the conduct of the 11 February 2019 meeting, a quorum representing 81,251 shares and 22,501 shares for LC Lopez and Conqueror, respectively, should have been attained. However, with the absence of the other members of the Board of Directors, only the 61,750 shares and 17,100 shares of respondent Lolito in each of the corporations were represented, way below the shares needed to form a quorum.[51] In arriving at its conclusion, the trial court nullified respondent Lolito's purchase of the 56,250 and 252,125 shares of LC Lopez and 97,050 shares of Conqueror, all erstwhile unissued, on the ground that it was made without the appropriate board resolution and without offering them first to petitioner in recognition of her right of pre-emption under Article 39 of the Corporation Code.[52] Respondents filed Petitions for Review[53] before the CA to question the decisions of the courts a quo. Thereat, the Quezon City case was docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 162134 while the Marikina City case was docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 162787. In their petition, respondents insisted on the validity of the two special stockholders' meeting, maintaining that in both instances, a quorum had been attained. They likewise asserted that respondent Lolito's purchase of the unissued shares of stock were not in fact void, but was merely voidable, as it should be deemed an ultra vires act. They claimed that the purchase was justified as there was, at the time, an extreme need to infuse capital into the subject corporations, adding that their assets were misused by petitioner.[54] Respondents also challenged the two decisions for declaring Christina to be a non-stockholder considering that her name was not reflected in the STB. [55] In their Comment on the petitions in the court below, petitioner and Christina defended the judiciousness of the decisions while raising a procedural question insofar as CA-G.R. SP No. 162134 was concerned. Clamoring for the outright dismissal of this particular petition, they contended that it was filed beyond the 15-day period allowed under A.M. 04-9-07-SC.[56] The petitions were eventually consolidated,[59] and on 26 February 2020, the court below rendered its Decision[60] thereon, the dispositive portion of which reads as follows: WHEREFORE, premises considered, both Petitions for Review are hereby GRANTED. The Decisions dated July 29, 2019 and September 13, 2019, rendered by the Regional Trial Court, Branch 93 Quezon City, in Commercial Case No. R-QZN-19-03290-CV and by the Regional Trial Court Branch, Branch (sic) 273, Marikina City in SEC Case Nos. 2019-29 to 31, respectively, are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The Special Stockholders' Meeting of iSpecialist on February 14, 2019, of LC Lopez Resources, Inc. and Conqueror International, Inc. held on February 11, 2019 are hereby declared VALID.[61] In ruling for respondents, the CA found their ratiocinations anent the procedural and substantive issues to be meritorious. It held the petition in CA-G.R. SP No. 162134 to have been filed on time, belittling the significance of the certification issued by the court a quo because petitioner and Christina supposedly failed to prove that Richard Belasco was indeed connected and authorized to receive an original duplicate of the decision.[62] On the substantive aspect, the court below gave full credence to respondents' arguments. First, it declared Christina to be a non-stockholder considering that her name was not reflected in the STB. Second, respondent Lolito's purchase of the unissued shares was justified by the immediate need of infusing much-needed capital to the concerned corporations, and that furthermore, it was merely an ultra vires act that could have been ratified by the positive action of the Board.[64] Eventually, petitioner filed the petition at bar assailing the ruling of the court below.","The Court of Appeals (CA) Decision dated 26 February 2020 in the consolidated cases of CA-G.R. SP No. 162134 and CA-G.R. SP No. 162787, which granted the Petitions for Review, reversed and set aside the decisions of the Regional Trial Courts (RTCs), and declared the Special Stockholders' Meeting of iSpecialist on February 14, 2019, and the meetings of LC Lopez Resources, Inc. and Conqueror International, Inc. held on February 11, 2019, as VALID.","The Court finds for petitioner. Regarding CA-G.R. SP No 162134, the petition was dismissed because it was filed beyond the 15-day period allowed under A.M. 04-9-07-SC, as the presumption of regularity of the court officer's certification of receipt (August 6, 2019) was not overcome. Thus, the RTC-QC decision in Commercial Case No. R-QZN-19-03290-CV became final and executory. Regarding CA-G.R. SP No. 162787, the RTC-Marikina ruling was more in accord with law. Christina Lopez is a stockholder (based on evidence other than the STB and estoppel on the part of Lolito Lopez). Respondent Lolito Lopez's purchase and voting of unissued shares were void because they were made without a prior board resolution (violating Section 23 of the Corporation Code) and violated petitioner's right of pre-emption (Section 39). The special stockholders' meeting for LC Lopez and Conqueror was void for lack of quorum, as respondent Lolito's shares alone were insufficient, and the stockholdings should be based on the latest General Information Sheet (GIS) due to the doubtful veracity of the Stock and Transfer Book (STB) entries. It is beyond doubt that the special stockholders' meeting, and the sale and voting of the unissued shares of stock, were both void and thus could not have produced any legal effect.","WHEREFORE, premises considered, the petition at bar is hereby GRANTED. The Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP Nos. 162134 and 162787 is hereby SET ASIDE.

Turbina, Calamba City, Laguna[,] and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, without authority of law, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously possess quantities of methamphetamine hydrochloride, a dangerous drug, approximately weighing 11.69 [grams], in violation of the aforementioned law.
CONTRARY TO LAW.
[6]
Donato pleaded not guilty to the charges on arraignment.
[7]
Version of the Prosecution
The prosecution presented Police Officer 1 Jhon Kevin P. Villarino (PO1 Villarino) of the Philippine National Police (PNP), then assigned at the Calamba City Police Station, Calamba City, Laguna, as its lone witness.
PO1 Villarino testified that on September 15, 2017, Senior Police Officer 2 Lorenzo D. Colinares, Jr. (SPO2 Colinares), of the Calamba City Police Station received a phone call from a confidential informant (CI) that Donato was engaged in selling drugs in
Barangay
Turbina, Calamba City.
[8]
SPO2 Colinares relayed the information to their Officer-in-Charge, Police Superintendent Sancho Celedio, who immediately formed a buy-bust team for the arrest of Donato. During the briefing, PO1 Villarino was designated as the poseur-buyer, while Police Officer 2 Ken Fereliz Elauria (PO2 Elauria) would serve as his back-up. PO1 Villarino then prepared a P500.00 bill to be used as buy-bust money, which he marked with his initials ""JV.""
[9]
The planned buy-bust operation was thereafter coordinated with the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency.
[10]
The buy-bust team then proceeded to the target area in the company of media representative Zen Trinidad (Trinidad).
Barangay
Chairman Rodel Manalo (Manalo) subsequently joined the team. Upon their arrival at the target area, PO1 Villarino and PO2 Elauria, together with the CI, went to Donato's house while the rest of the team remained outside. The CI then introduced the two police officers to Donato as prospective buyers of shabu. Donato asked PO1 Villarino ""Magkano kukunin niyo"" to which the latter replied ""Limang piso lang boss."" PO1 Villarino handed the marked money to Donato, who in turn, invited them inside the house.
[11]
While PO1 Villarino and PO2 Elauria were inside Donato's house, the CI, pretending to buy a cigarette, left the house to inform the back-up team to proceed to Donato's house.
[12]
Meanwhile, Donato took one heat-sealed transparent plastic sachet suspected to contain shabu from a black pouch on top of the table, and gave it to PO1 Villarino, who immediately placed it in his right pocket. Upon receipt of the merchandise, PO1 Villarino introduced themselves as police officers and arrested Donato. Thereafter, the back-up team, together with Trinidad and Manalo, arrived. Upon frisking Donato, PO1 Villarino recovered the buy-bust money. The search of the black pouch also yielded four more plastic sachets suspected to contain shabu.
[13]
After the arrest, PO1 Villarino conducted the marking and inventory of the seized items in the house of Donato, in the presence of Trinidad and Manalo. PO1 Villarino marked the plastic sachet he bought from Donato with ""JPV-BB."" The remaining four sachets were marked with ""JPV-1,"" ""JPV-2,"" ""JPV-3,"" and ""JPV-4,"" and the black pouch with ""JPV-5.""
[14]
Subsequently, Donato was brought to the
barangay
hall and eventually to the police station. At the station, Police Chief Inspector Melisa M. Malayo (PCINSP Malayo), prepared the Request for Laboratory Examination of the contents of the plastic sachets, as well as the Request for Drug Test. Thereafter, PO1 Villarino and PO2 Elauria turned over the seized items to Police Office 2 Comia
[15]
of the Regional Crime Laboratory, Camp Vicente Lim in Canlubang, Laguna.
[16]
Upon examination conducted by forensic chemist, Police Chief Inspector Donna Villa P. Huelgas (PCI Huelgas), the specimens tested positive for the presence of methamphetamine hydrochloride or shabu, as per Chemistry Report No. D-1339-17.
[17]
During trial, however, the parties agreed to dispense with the testimony of PCI Huelgas, and in lieu thereof, stipulated on the qualifications of PCI Huelgas as the forensic chemist who examined the specimens and concluded that the substance tested positive for shabu.
[18]
Version of the Defense
Donato denied the charges against him and alleged that on September 16, 2017 at 8:00 a.m., he was watching television in his house when several armed individuals barged in looking for a ""Kuya Boogie."" When Donato identified himself as ""Kuya Boogie,"" the armed individuals introduced themselves as police officers and forced Donato to surrender something. When Donato denied knowledge of their accusations, one of the police officer poked a gun at him. Thereafter, they searched Donato's bedroom. When they found nothing, a police officer pulled a black pouch containing plastic sachets from his pocket and pointed to Donato as its owner. In short, Donato claimed that the illegal drugs were planted. Donato was then brought to the
barangay
hall and afterwards to the police station.
[19]
Ruling of the Regional Trial Court
On August 7, 2018, the RTC rendered a Decision finding Donato guilty as charged. It gave credence to the positive testimony of PO1 Villarino over Donato's defense of denial. Donato's theory of frame-up cannot prevail over the police officers' performance of official duties that carries with it the presumption of regularity. The RTC likewise found that the prosecution has duly preserved the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized shabu from the moment of confiscation until its presentation in court. The decretal portion of the RTC Decision reads:
WHEREFORE, guided by the foregoing mandates of Republic Act 9165, accused Donato Hernandez y Cedron is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt in Criminal Case No. 30374-2017-C. The Court hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of LIFE IMPRISONMENT and a fine of FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PESOS (Php500,000.00).
In Criminal Case No. 30375-2017-C, this Court also found accused Hernandez GUILTYs (sic) beyond reasonable doubt for Violation of Section 11 of Republic Act 9165. The Court sentences him to suffer LIFE IMPRISONMENT and to pay a fine of FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PESOS (Php500,000.00) for possession of 11.69 grams of methamphetamine hydrochloride.
Let the confiscated methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu) subject matter of these cases be turned over to Region IV-A, Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency, Camp Vicente Lim, Canlubang, Calamba City for destruction in accordance with law.
SO ORDERED.

(Emphasis in the original)
Ruling of the Court of Appeals
In its assailed September 30, 2020 Decision,
[21]
the CA affirmed the RTC's ruling. Hence, this appeal.","WHEREFORE, the appeal is GRANTED. The September 30, 2020 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 12463 is REVERSED and SET ASIDE.","We rule in the negative. In cases involving Illegal Sale and/or Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs under RA 9165, it is essential that the identity of the dangerous drug be established with moral certainty, considering that it is the corpus delicti of the crime. Failing to prove the integrity of the corpus delicti renders the evidence for the State insufficient to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt, and hence, warrants an acquittal. While the first two links [seizure/marking and turnover to investigating officer (substantially)] had been substantially complied with, We hold that the prosecution failed to demonstrate observance of the third and fourth links in the chain of custody. Anent the third link, PO1 Villarino testified that he and PO2 Elauria personally delivered the drug specimens to the crime laboratory... While it appears that the requests were stamp received by PO2 Comia, the latter was not presented in court to shed light on the condition of the contraband when it was received, as well as the necessary precautions employed to ensure that the seized illegal drugs were not contaminated, changed, or altered while in PO2 Comia's custody. Accordingly, absent the testimony of PO2 Comia, the person who supposedly received the illegal drugs from PO1 Villarino, makes the third link in the chain of custody flawed. In the same vein, We hold that the prosecution miserably failed to comply with the fourth link in the chain of custody. ... The failure of the prosecution to place PCI Huelgas on the witness stand raised nagging questions regarding the post-examination custody that were left unanswered by the prosecution evidence, in particular, who exercised custody and possession of the specimens after the chemical examination, and how they were handled, stored, and safeguarded pending their presentation as evidence in court. Consequently, there was a missing link from the point when the drugs were in the hands of PCI Huelgas, to the point when the same were submitted to the court. Thus, it was not convincingly shown whether the specimens submitted to the court were the same plastic sachets of shabu that were actually recovered from Donato. In sum, the foregoing lapses in the chain of custody of the illegal drug purportedly seized from Donato, fatally compromised its integrity and evidentiary value. Hence, Donato's acquittal is warranted. Finally, given the obvious evidentiary gap in the chain of custody, the presumption of regularity in the performance of duties cannot be applied in this case. When challenged by the evidence of a flawed chain of custody, the presumption of regularity cannot prevail over the presumption of innocence of the accused.","Accused-appellant Donato C. Hernandez is ACQUITTED of the crimes charged against him for failure of the prosecution to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. He is ordered immediately RELEASED from detention, unless confined for any other lawful cause."
"G.R. No. 250776, June 15, 2022","NANCY CLAIRE PIT CELIS, PETITIONER, VS. BANK OF MAKATI (A SAVINGS BANK), INC., RESPONDENT.","On July 15, 2013, respondent hired petitioner as an Account Officer for its Pasay City Branch. On May 23, 2016, respondent assigned her to the Legal and External Agency Department as an Administrative Officer. Towards the end of 2017, respondent's Human Resource Department received a report that petitioner was previously employed in the Rural Bank of Placer (Bank of Placer), Surigao del Norte, and was involved in a case concerning embezzlement of funds. However, petitioner did not disclose her past employment with the Bank of Placer in her job application with respondent. Acting on the information, respondent issued a Notice of Explanation dated December 13, 2017 to petitioner and thereafter, placed her under preventive suspension for 30 days beginning December 18, 2017. On December 21, 2017, petitioner submitted a Written Explanation wherein she admitted that she indeed failed to disclose her past employment with the Bank of Placer but attributed such omission to her excitement in filling up her job application with respondent. She denied being involved in an embezzlement case and explained that the matter was mere hearsay and gossip. On January 8, 2018, respondent conducted a conference/hearing where petitioner personally explained her side. In the Notice of Decision dated January 10, 2018, respondent resolved to terminate the employment of petitioner on the following grounds: (1) violation of the Bank's Code of Conduct and Discipline (respondent's Code of Conduct) for ""[k]nowingly giving false or misleading information in applications for employment as a result of which employment is secured"" (subject infraction); and (2) Serious Misconduct, Fraud or Willful Breach of Trust and Loss of Confidence under Article 297 [282] of the Labor Code. Respondent found out that petitioner purposely concealed her past employment with the Bank of Placer to hide her implication in a certain embezzlement case. In meting out the penalty of dismissal, respondent likewise considered the infractions of petitioner in 2016 and the corresponding disciplinary actions imposed on her, viz.: (1) suspension from work for 10 days for her ""improper conduct and acts of gross discourtesy or disrespect to fellow employees;"" and (2) suspension from work for 15 days for her infraction of ""personal borrowing from the Bank's Clients."" Consequently, petitioner filed a Complaint for illegal dismissal, monetary claims, and damages against respondent. She alleged that her dismissal from employment was only precipitated by her discovery of the corrupt practices in which her division head and her department head were involved. Petitioner maintained that her failure to disclose her past employment with the Bank of Placer was done in good faith, and respondent failed to prove her involvement in the embezzlement case.","The petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated June 7, 2019 and the Resolution dated December 6, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 158988 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The Decision dated July 13, 2018 and the Resolution dated October 26, 2018 of the National Labor Relations Commission in NLRC LAC No. 06-002270-18/NLRC Case No. NCR-02-02488-18 are hereby REINSTATED with MODIFICATION in that the total monetary award in favor of petitioner Nancy Claire Pit Celis shall earn legal interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of finality of this Decision until full satisfaction. The case is hereby REMANDED to the Labor Arbiter for the proper computation of the monetary awards.","The CA erred in imputing grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC. To be liable under the subject infraction, i.e., ""knowingly giving false or misleading information in applications for employment as a result of which employment is secured,"" the employee must have performed an overt or positive act, i.e., giving false information in the application for employment. Considering that petitioner did not actually state any false information in her job application but merely omitted to reflect her past employment with the Bank of Placer, she could not have committed the alleged infraction. At any rate, it is of no moment that petitioner had omitted to reflect her past employment with the Bank of Placer or was allegedly implicated in the purported embezzlement case thereat. Significantly, the Bank of Placer neither found petitioner liable nor meted out any disciplinary action against her in the case. The labor tribunals aptly held that this is merely a case of an omission to disclose former employment in a job application, a fault which does not justify petitioner's suspension and eventual termination from employment. To dismiss petitioner on account of her omission to disclose former employment is just too harsh a penalty. The CA's reliance on the Principle of Totality of Infractions is misplaced. Previous offenses may be used to aggravate a subsequent infraction to justify an employee's dismissal only if they are related to the subsequent offense upon which termination is decreed. Petitioner's infractions not being related or similar in nature to the present charge, the CA erred in applying the Principle of Totality of Infractions against her. Indubitably, respondent failed to substantially prove that petitioner's dismissal from employment was for a just cause. All told, there is substantial evidence to support the finding of the NLRC that respondent illegally dismissed petitioner from employment. The Court deems it best to award petitioner separation pay in lieu of reinstatement due to the resultant strained relations between respondent and petitioner.",Petitioner was indeed illegally terminated from her job.
"G.R. No. 250013, June 15, 2022","ARNALDO M. ESPINAS, PETITIONER, VS. OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSMAN, RESPONDENT.","This case finds its roots in the acquisition of Express Savings Bank, Inc. (ESBI), a local thrift bank, located in Cabuyao, Laguna, by the Local Water Utilities Administration (LWUA). On September 23, 2008, the LWUA Board, which included Espinas as Corporate Legal Counsel and Board Secretary, issued Resolution No. 145 approving the establishment of a water development bank. Subsequently, despite advice from the OGCC regarding necessary approvals (DOF and OP) and BSP's recommendation to acquire an existing bank instead of creating a new one, the LWUA proceeded with the acquisition of 60% of the outstanding shares of ESBI for P80,000,000.00 (Resolution No. 129-A, May 26, 2009), even after the Audit Report by JPA revealed that ESBI was insolvent. LWUA executed the Deed of Sale on June 3, 2009, and subsequently took over management of ESBI without the required prior approval of both the DOF and the Monetary Board of the BSP. The General Information Sheet (GIS) of ESBI dated August 11, 2009 showed Espinas as Assistant Corporate Secretary. On August 4, 2009, the LWUA Board approved the designation of ESBI as a depository bank, resulting in a P300,000,000.00 deposit from LWUA (total deposits eventually reached P700,000,000.00). The DOF formally objected to the acquisition in December 2009. On April 29, 2010, the Monetary Board denied LWUA's acquisition request and issued a Cease-and-Desist Order against ESBI for accepting government deposits without authorization. On July 7, 2011, the Monetary Board placed ESBI under receivership. The Field Investigation Office (FIO) of the Ombudsman filed administrative charges (OMB-C-A-13-0211) against Espinas and others for grave misconduct and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service for disregarding R.A. Nos. 8791 and 7653 and existing banking laws in approving ESBI's acceptance of the LWUA's deposits and for serving simultaneously as an officer of the LWUA and ESBI. The Ombudsman, in its Joint Resolution dated March 16, 2015, found Espinas administratively liable for Grave Misconduct and Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service and meted upon him the penalty of DISMISSAL. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed this finding, ruling that Espinas is guilty of Section 19 of R.A. No. 8791, which prohibits any appointive or elective public official from serving as an officer of any private bank at the same time, as ESBI was still a private bank.","the Decision dated June 7, 2019 and the Resolution dated October 22, 2019 of the Court of Appeals ( CA ) in CA-G.R. SP No. 145982, which denied the petition for review filed by Arnaldo M. Espinas ( Espinas ) and affirmed the Joint Resolution dated March 16, 2015 of the Ombudsman in OMB-C-C-13-0212, finding Espinas guilty of grave misconduct and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service.","The Court agrees with the CA that CA-G.R. SP No. 120934 does not constitute res judicata and is not a bar to the present case. ... Here, the evidence on record falls short of proving petitioner's culpability for the charge of grave misconduct. Essentially, respondent would like to impress upon this Court that petitioner, through his individual actions, caused deliberate injury to the government by holding concurrent positions in the LWUA and the ESBI. While petitioner appears to hold such positions in contravention to Section 19 of R.A. No. 8791, this Court finds that such act, by itself, does not ipso facto amount to grave misconduct. Taken as a whole, there is a lack of substantial evidence to prove that the foregoing act done by petitioner was tainted with 'corruption, a clear intent to violate the law, or a flagrant disregard of an established rule.' Contrary to the CA's sweeping assertion, there is a dearth of evidence to prove that petitioner, in occupying both roles, was motivated and was actually 'benefiting from the perquisites of such position.' ... Withal, respondent failed to demonstrate that petitioner had unlawfully used his station and character while concurrently serving as the Corporate Legal Counsel of the LWUA and the Assistant Corporate Secretary of ESBI to deliberately gain or appropriate any form of benefit for himself or for any other person. ... On the same score, the pieces of evidence likewise failed to establish that petitioner wielded any influence or was in connivance or in conspiracy with others regarding the acquisition of ESBI by the LWUA. ... Verily, the mere act of holding a position in a private bank while serving in a government-owned and controlled corporation, without more, does not rise to the level of grave misconduct which requires the elements of corruption or willful disregard of rules. On another point, neither is there any persuasive basis to find petitioner guilty of conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service. ... All told, this Court cannot adopt the findings of the CA, there being absolutely no substantial evidence existing from the records to hold petitioner liable for grave misconduct and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service.","WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the instant petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated June 7, 2019 and the Resolution dated October 22, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 145982 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The complaint insofar as it found petitioner Arnaldo M. Espinas guilty of grave misconduct and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service is hereby DISMISSED. Accordingly, petitioner Arnaldo M. Espinas is ORDERED REINSTATED immediately to his former or equivalent position in the Local Water Utilities Administration without loss or diminution to his seniority rights, salaries, or benefits.

Alano (Judge Alano) and Ruel V. Delicana (Delicana) against each other. Mary Jane G. Corpuz (Corpuz) is impleaded as co-respondent in Delicana's complaint. Delicana charged Judge Alano and Corpuz with Grave Misconduct, Grave Abuse of Authority, Conduct Unbecoming of a Court Employee, and Conduct Prejudicial to the Interest of Public Service, Oppression, and Dereliction of Duty, mainly stemming from Corpuz (designated Acting Clerk of Court by Judge Alano) giving Delicana a 'satisfactory' rating, which Delicana considered unjustifiable, and Delicana further accused Judge Alano of various ethical violations including humiliating him, protecting accused in gambling cases, and uttering racist words. Judge Alano, in turn, accused Delicana of using intemperate, offensive, and abusive language in his pleadings (reproducing derogatory phrases like 'smacked with absurdity,' 'his hatred and abhorrent attitude prevailed'), committing acts of disrespect (shouting match, social media posts), and committing acts prejudicial to the interest of the service by receiving and losing official court records of a pending criminal case, which was beyond the functions of a Legal Researcher. On November 28, 2016, Judge Alano died. The cases were consolidated and referred for investigation. On January 22, 2018, Delicana was found guilty of Simple Misconduct in a related case (A.M.

"G.R. No. 251967, June 14, 2022","BERNADETTE LOURDES B. ABEJO, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE INTER-COUNTRY ADOPTION BOARD, PETITIONER , VS. THE COMMISSION ON AUDIT, REPRESENTED BY CHAIRPERSON, MICHAEL AGUINALDO, RESPONDENT .","The ICAB was created under Republic Act No. (RA) 8043, otherwise known as the ""Inter-Country Adoption Act of 1995,"" to act as the central authority in matters relating to inter-country adoption"" and ""policy-making body for purposes of carrying out the provisions of (RA 8043)."" The ICAB is composed of the Secretary of the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) as ex-officio Chairman, together with six other members to be appointed by the President. Meanwhile, under the direction of the Board is the Inter-Country Adoption Placement Committee (ICPC) that carries out an integrated system and network of selection and matching of applicants and children. According to petitioner, the ICPC is tasked to screen, review, evaluate, and eventually decide upon and approve applications of prospective adoptive parents (PAPs) or PAPs Dossiers. Petitioner also alleged that from 2008 to 2010, there had been a heavy volume of inquiries and applications from PAPs that require action from the ICPC. To address the heavy workload and to meet the monthly targets of the ICPC, the members of ICAB were asked to help with the review of the PAPs Dossiers. To compensate the work performed by the members of ICAB in reviewing the dossiers, Undersecretary Luwalhati F. Pablo, in her capacity as Alternate Chairperson of ICAB, issued an unnumbered memorandum dated 14 August 2008 granting the ICAB members additional remuneration of P250.00 for each application reviewed. Another unnumbered Memorandum dated 16 April 2009 increased this amount to P500.00 After audit, the Audit Team Leader and Supervising Auditor assigned to ICAB issued ND No. 2011-009-101-(08-10) which disallowed the additional remuneration to ICAB member amounting to P162,855.00. The disallowance was based on the following: The grant has no legal basis. Payment is contrary to Section 4 of Department of Budget and Management (DBM) Budget Circular (BC) No. 2003-5 and Section 49 of RA 9970 or the General Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2010. The Legal Service of the DSWD issued a Memorandum denying the grant of honoraria to members of ICAB. Section 5 of RA 8043 states that ICAB members are only entitled to a per diem of P1,500.00 per meeting. Petitioner, as Executive Director and approving officer, was identified in the ND as the person liable to return the entire disallowed amount. Petitioner appealed but the COA NGS — Sector 6 affirmed the disallowance. Aggrieved, petitioner filed a petition for review before the COA Proper. On 14 January 2020, the COA Proper rendered its Decision denying the petition for review filed by petitioner. The COA Proper ruled that the additional remuneration given violated Section 5 of RA 8043 that sets a limit to the amount to be received by ICAB members. It also violated DBM BC No. 2003-5, which provides that honoraria may only be received if they are neither paid salaries nor per diem. The COA Proper also found no merit in petitioner's claim that she was not guilty of negligence in approving the additional compensation.","We agree with the COA Proper that while additional work done outside of a government official's regular function may be compensated, the grant of such compensation must still be in accordance with the applicable laws and rules. ... In this case, RA 8043 and DBM BC No. 2003-5 prevents the ICAB member from receiving additional compensation for the work they have done reviewing the PAPs Dossiers. ... Apart from her bare allegations, petitioner failed to show any approved special project plan of activities or undertakings as required by DBM Circular 2007-2. In the absence of this approved plan, the Court has no basis to rule whether the ICAB member's review of the PAPs Dossiers constitute a special project. Despite the propriety of the disallowance, petitioner should not be held liable for the disallowed amount. In finding petitioner liable, the COA Proper found her negligent as the rules and regulations violated by the grant of the disallowed remuneration ought to have been within her knowledge considering the position she holds. We disagree. ... Badges of good faith could be appreciated in favor of petitioner. No prior disallowance of the same benefit has been issued against ICAB. Also, there is no precedent disallowing a similar case in jurisprudence. ... The COA Proper's exoneration of the recipients already attained finality and may no longer be disturbed.","The Court found that the additional remuneration violated Section 5 of RA 8043, which limits ICAB members to a per diem, and DBM BC No. 2003-5, which prohibits the payment of honoraria to officers already receiving per diem. The Court rejected the argument that the work constituted a ""special project"" compensable under Section 49 of RA 9970 due to the lack of an approved special project plan. Applying the Madera Rules, the Court absolved petitioner Bernadette Lourdes B. Abejo from civil liability to return the disallowed amount, recognizing her presumption of good faith since ""[n]o prior disallowance of the same benefit has been issued against ICAB"" and there was ""no precedent disallowing a similar case in jurisprudence.""","WHEREFORE , the petition is PARTIALLY GRANTED .

BBB was indicted for the crime of rape committed against AAA by virtue of two Informations, the accusatory portions of which read as follows: Criminal Case No. 18941 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx (rape committed sometime in July 2013 against 13-year-old minor); Criminal Case No. 18942 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx (rape committed on or about the 9th day of February 2014 against 14-year-old minor). AAA was not able to testify during trial. Nevertheless, the case was prosecuted on the strength of a Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) test which revealed BBB to be the biological father of AAA's child [CCC] with a probability of paternity of 99.9999%. Accused-appellant for his defense, denied the allegation of rape against him, claiming his daughter falsely accused him upon the prodding of his sister-in-law, DDD.","This is an ordinary appeal under Rule 122 of the Rules of Court, as amended, seeking to reverse and set aside the Decision dated November 11, 2019 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R.

The said issuance affirmed with modification the April 16, 2018 Decision of Branch I of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Pallocan West, Batangas City in Criminal Case Nos. 18941 and 18942 which, in turn, found accused-appellant BBB guilty beyond reasonable doubt of one (1) count of rape, imposing upon him the penalty of reclusion perpetua and other monetary awards. The CA affirmed BBB's conviction, modifying the penalty of reclusion perpetua to be imposed without the benefit of parole and increasing the amounts awarded for the civil indemnity, moral damages and exemplary damages to P100,000.00 each.","The Court finds the instant appeal bereft of merit. Circumstantial evidence alone may be relied upon by the courts to render a judgment of conviction, and is neither weaker nor inferior to direct evidence. The elements of rape under Article 266-A(1) of the RPC are obtaining: (1) carnal knowledge was established by the DNA test proving BBB fathered AAA's child; and (2) the second element, force or intimidation, is substituted by moral influence or ascendancy because BBB is AAA's biological father, especially in cases of incestuous rape of a minor. BBB's defenses of denial and frame-up are unworthy of the Court's consideration. Furthermore, it is not essential that the time of commission of the rape be determined with precision, as the date of commission is not an essential element of the crime.","The appeal is DISMISSED for lack of merit. The Decision dated November 11, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 11429 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. Accused-appellant BBB is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of Rape under Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, and is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua without eligibility for parole. Accused-appellant BBB is further ORDERED to PAY AAA the amount of P100,000.00 each as civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages.

"G.R. No. 227600, June 13, 2022","HO CHING YI, PETITIONER, VS. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","Ho filed a petition for naturalization on September 17, 2010. The Petition alleged that she is a Taiwanese citizen who arrived in the Philippines in 1994 when she was eight years old, and has continuously resided here for more than 10 years. She alleged that she has been working as a treasurer of Tungtay Trading and Manufacturing Corporation (Tungtay Trading) since 2009 and has an average annual income of P240,000.00. She attached the affidavits of her former tutors, Mary Ann R. Tamondong (Tamondong) and Maritess S. Adaon (Adaon), in her Petition and presented them as witnesses during the hearing. In a July 31, 2014 Decision, the Regional Trial Court denied her Petition, doubting the witnesses' credentials and competence to establish her character, and finding inconsistencies in her claims regarding her income. Ho filed an appeal before the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the trial court, noting that inconsistencies regarding her stated average annual income remain unexplained. Ho thus filed this Petition for Review on Certiorari arguing that the Court of Appeals erred in finding that her witnesses were not credible enough to support her petition for naturalization and explaining her declining income.",The Petition is denied.,"The burden of establishing compliance with the requirements for naturalization belongs to the applicants, and naturalization laws are strictly construed in favor of the government. The Court found that Ho failed to establish her witnesses were the 'credible persons' required by law, as she offered no clear link relating their credentials to their credibility, nor did she present evidence to prove their good standing and reputation in the community as required under the Naturalization Law (Commonwealth Act No. 473). Furthermore, the Regional Trial Court did not find the witnesses competent to testify on whether petitioner possessed the qualifications for naturalization, noting that as one-on-one tutors, they did not have substantial time to personally observe her or her interactions with other people, thus lacking the personal knowledge of specific facts and events needed to competently vouch for her morally irreproachable character (citing In re: Tse Viw). Finally, Ho failed to sufficiently address why her stated average annual income of P240,000.00 was inconsistent with records showing a lower annual income.","WHEREFORE, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED. The Court of Appeals' June 7, 2016 Decision and October 10, 2016 Resolution in CA-G.R. CV No. 104569 are AFFIRMED. Petitioner Ho Ching Yi's petition for naturalization is DENIED due to insufficiency of evidence to prove that petitioner has all the qualifications and none of the disqualifications provided by law to warrant the granting of the petition."

ALCANTARA (VICTIM), AND ALL REPRESENTED BY THEIR ATTORNEY-IN-FACT AND CO-PLAINTIFF, CHARLIE S. ALCANTARA, RESPONDENTS.","At around 6:30 p.m. on October 15, 2008, Cristina S. Alcantara (Alcantara) figured in a vehicular crash while crossing the road on 25th Street, East Bajac-Bajac, Olongapo City. She was hit by a public utility jeepney driven by Fegarido, who was making a left turn toward 25th Street. The impact threw Cristina off a few meters away before hitting the pavement. She was rushed to the hospital to be treated for physical injuries, but was declared braindead and died three days later. Fegarido was charged with reckless imprudence resulting in homicide in an amended Information filed before the Municipal Trial Court in Cities. Meanwhile, the heirs of Cristina S. Alcantara filed before the Regional Trial Court a Complaint for damages with prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction/temporary restraining order not only against Fegarido, but also Milan, the registered owner of the jeepney. In its June 19, 2012 Decision, the Municipal Trial Court in Cities acquitted Fegarido of the crime charged. It found that the evidence on record was insufficient to prove with moral certainty that Fegarido recklessly drove the jeepney. Meanwhile, the Regional Trial Court rendered a Decision in the civil action for damages on March 9, 2015, finding Fegarido and Alcantara solidarily liable to Alcantara's heirs. Fegarido and Milan appealed before the Court of Appeals.","In its October 13, 2017 Decision, the Court of Appeals affirmed the Regional Trial Court Decision finding Fegarido and Milan solidarily liable for damages. It ruled that Fegarido's acquittal in the criminal case for the prosecution's failure to prove his criminal liability with moral certainty did not preclude a finding of liability for damages based on negligence (quasi-delict). It stressed that the pieces of evidence weighted against Fegarido, when taken together, established his negligence based on quasi-delict. As to Milan's liability, the Court of Appeals similarly decreed that she failed to exercise the due diligence required by law when she entrusted her legal duties in the selection and supervision of her employee to her husband. Fegarido and Milan moved for reconsideration, but their Motion was denied in a May 4, 2018 Resolution.","The Petition is denied. The issue of whether petitioners acted negligently is a question of fact beyond the ambit of a Rule 45 petition. The Court found no cogent reason to reverse the findings of the Regional Trial Court, as affirmed by the Court of Appeals, that petitioner Fegarido's gross negligence in operating the jeepney was the proximate cause of Alcantara's death, noting that Fegarido's acquittal in the criminal case does not extinguish the civil liability based on quasi-delict, which requires only preponderance of evidence. The Court affirmed that petitioner Milan, the registered owner of the jeepney, is vicariously liable under Article 2180 of the Civil Code because she failed to exercise the required diligence in the selection and supervision of her employees, having delegated her legal duties to her husband who conducted insufficient screening. The Court affirmed the damages awarded by the Court of Appeals, including actual, moral, and exemplary damages, and attorney's fees.","WHEREFORE, the Petition is DENIED. The October 13, 2017 Decision and May 4, 2018 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in C.A.-G.R. CV No. 105000 are AFFIRMED. Petitioners Gerry S. Fegarido and Linalie A.

BENJAMIN CAMIWET [DECEASED], SUBSTITUTED BY HIS SURVIVING SPOUSE, JUANITA CAMIWET, AND CHILDREN, SHANE VICENTE, CLINT CAMIWET, AND LEDEN LICZEK, RESPONDENTS.","Julia R. Perez (Julia) was the registered owner of a 21,000-square meter property in Barrio Batal, Santiago, Isabela, covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 143861. She mortgaged the lot to Land Bank. Julia defaulted in the payment of her obligation. The property was extrajudicially foreclosed and eventually sold at a public auction on September 30, 1997, where Land Bank won as the highest bidder. Since Julia did not redeem the property within the redemption period, the lot's ownership was consolidated in Land Bank's favor. Transfer Certificate of Title No. 143861 was canceled, and Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-329010 was issued in Land Bank's name on December 4, 2002. On June 6, 2006, Land Bank filed an Ex-Parte Petition for the Issuance of a Writ of Possession over Transfer Certificate of Title No. T- 329010. On September 18, 2006, the Regional Trial Court granted the petition and later issued the writ of possession. On September 24, 2007, representing themselves as Julia's agricultural tenants, Mary, Efren Basilan, and Benjamin Camiwet (collectively, Basilan et al.) filed a Petition for the Maintenance of Peaceful Possession as Agricultural Lessee/Farmer Beneficiaries before the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board. The Municipal Agrarian Reform Office of Santiago City, Isabela issued a Certification stating that under Section 22 of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law of 1988, Mary and Efren were qualified farmer-beneficiaries of the land covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 329010. In its July 14, 2008 Resolution, the Regional Trial Court denied Land Bank's motion to cite Basilan et al. in contempt. It held that the issue of agricultural tenancy is a valid third-party claim that defers the implementation of the writ of possession. In its December 17, 2010 Decision, the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board Provincial Adjudicator affirmed the Municipal Agrarian Reform Officer's declaration that Basilan et al. are agricultural lessees and are actual occupants of the properties. On July 24, 2013, Land Bank filed a Motion for Issuance of an Alias Writ of Possession before the Regional Trial Court. In its November 7, 2013 Resolution, the Regional Trial Court denied Land Bank's motion, ruling that tenancy constitutes a third-party claim that suspends the implementation of the writ of possession. The Court of Appeals, in its July 12, 2016 Decision, denied Land Bank's Petition and affirmed the Regional Trial Court's denial of the issuance of alias writ of possession.","The Court of Appeals' July 12, 2016 Decision and January 16, 2017 Resolution in CA-G.R. SP No. 137010 are AFFIRMED.","Agricultural tenancy of a property constitutes a third-party claim that bars the ex parte issuance of a writ of possession in favor of the winning bidder in a public sale of a foreclosed property. The exception provided under Section 33, Rule 39 of the Revised Rules of Court applies when a third party is actually holding the property adversely to the judgment obligor, such as a tenant, who possesses the property in their own right. The Court finds no cogent reason to disturb the factual finding of the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board Provincial Adjudicator, as affirmed by the Regional Trial Court and the Court of Appeals, that respondents are agricultural tenants. Findings of administrative agencies are generally accorded respect and finality, and these specialized agencies are presumed to have the expertise on matters over which they have jurisdiction. Thus, agricultural tenancy is a valid third-party claim that warranted the suspension of the implementation of the writ of possession previously issued.","WHEREFORE, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED for lack of merit.

"G.R. No. 252252, June 13, 2022","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. EDUARDO M. PAGUIO, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","This case stemmed from an Information filed before the RTC charging Paguio of the crime of Rape, the accusatory portion of which reads: That on or about May 2, 1999 at xxxxxxxxxxx Bataan, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused, thru force and intimidation, and with the use of a deadly weapon, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously lie and succeed in having sexual intercourse with AAA, against the will and consent of the latter to her damage and prejudice. The prosecution alleged that at around eight (8) o'clock in the evening of May 2, 1999, AAA, then 21 years of age, was watching television at the house of her cousin, when she saw Paguio outside, looking through the window. AAA asked what Paguio was doing, to which the latter replied, ""Nothing."" Suddenly, Paguio went around the house, surreptitiously went inside, and pinned down AAA. Paguio then removed their clothing, pointed a knife on AAA's neck, and told her not to shout or else he would kill her. Thereafter, Paguio went on top of AAA and inserted his penis into her vagina. After satisfying his lustful desires, Paguio ordered AAA to put back her clothes and then he ran away. After undergoing such ordeal, AAA just cried. She also noticed that there were bloodstains on her underwear. AAA then told her mother about the incident, prompting the latter to make the former undergo a medico-legal examination, and to report the matter to the authorities. For his part, Paguio invoked the defenses of denial and alibi. He claimed that at around four (4) o'clock in the afternoon of May 2, 1999, he went to the house of a friend to celebrate the town fiesta. At around seven (7) o'clock in the evening, they went to the plaza to watch the fiesta singing contest, which lasted until 1 o'clock in the morning of the following day. According to Paguio, he and his friends were supposed to go somewhere else after the singing contest, but they were unable to do so due to lack of transportation, so he just decided to go home at three (3) o'clock in the morning and sleep. Finally, Paguio testified that he does not know of any reason why private complainant would accuse him of raping her.","In a Judgment dated July 28, 2015, the RTC found Paguio guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged, and accordingly, sentenced him to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua without eligibility for parole, and ordered him to pay AAA the amounts of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages, and P30,000.00 as exemplary damages. The RTC found that the prosecution, through AAA's straightforward, credible, and trustworthy testimony, was able to prove that Paguio indeed had carnal knowledge of her against her will and consent. In a Decision dated June 18, 2018, the CA affirmed Paguio's conviction with modification, increasing the monetary awards due to AAA to P100,000.00 as civil indemnity, P100,000.00 as moral damages, and P100,000.00 as exemplary damages, all with legal interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of finality of the ruling until full payment.","The Court affirmed Paguio's conviction, with modification as to the penalty to be imposed and his civil liability ex delicto. The courts a quo correctly ruled that through AAA's straightforward, credible, and trustworthy testimony, she clearly, categorically, and positively identified Paguio as the one who ravished her on the date of the incident. The Court found no reason to overturn the courts a quo's finding of criminal liability against Paguio. Anent the proper penalty, the Court noted that Paguio's use of a knife to consummate the crime of Rape was duly alleged in the Information and proven at the trial, resulting in the penalty of reclusion perpetua to death under Article 266-B of the RPC. However, the courts a quo erred in imposing the death penalty (which was commuted to reclusion perpetua without eligibility for parole pursuant to RA 9346). In the absence of an additional aggravating circumstance that was duly alleged and proven at the trial, Paguio should only be sentenced with reclusion perpetua. In light of the modification of Paguio's sentence, the monetary awards due to AAA should likewise be adjusted: (a) P75,000.00 as civil indemnity; (b) P75,000.00 as moral damages; and (c) P75,000.00 as exemplary damages, all with legal interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of finality of this Decision until full payment, pursuant to prevailing jurisprudence.","WHEREFORE, the appeal is DISMISSED. Accused-appellant Eduardo M. Paguio is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Rape with the Use of a Deadly Weapon, as defined and penalized under Article 266-A (1) in relation to Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code, as amended. Accordingly he is sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua, and ordered to pay AAA the amounts of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages, and P75,000.00 as exemplary damages, all with legal interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the date of finality of this Decision until full payment."

SO ORDERED. [3] Traders Royal and Security Bank appealed to the CA docketed as CA-G.R. No. CV 54656. The CA absolved Security Bank from any liability and held Traders Royal solely liable to RPN, IBC, and BBC for damages and costs of suit. [4] Aggrieved, Traders Royal elevated the case to this Court docketed as G.R. No. 138510. Meantime, Traders Royal and Bank of Commerce (BankCom) entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (PSA). The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas approved the agreement on the condition that the parties must set up a P50,000,000.00 escrow fund to be kept for fifteen (15) years. Accordingly, Traders Royal deposited the required amount with the Metropolitan Bank and Trust Co. (Metrobank). [5] On October 10, 2002, the Court in G.R. No. 138510 affirmed with modification the CA's judgment in CA-G.R. No. CV 54656. The Court deleted the award of exemplary damages but granted attorney's fees to RPN, IBC, and BBC. The parties' motions for reconsideration were denied. In April 2003, the Court's judgment in G.R. No. 138510 became final and executory. [6] Thereafter, RPN, IBC, and BBC filed their respective motions before the RTC for the issuance of a writ of execution and subpoena duces tecum requiring Metrobank to submit a detailed report of the status of the escrow fund. [7] On March 31, 2004, the RTC granted the motion for issuance of the subpoena. Thus, Metrobank submitted a report showing that the escrow fund had already been depleted. [8] The RTC then issued another subpoena directing BankCom to present the list of Traders Royal's assets and liabilities that it assumed and ordering Metrobank to submit documents of withdrawals from the escrow fund. [9] BankCom and Metrobank moved to quash the subpoena. On August 15, 2005, the RTC granted the motion for the issuance of a writ of execution on all of Traders Royal's assets, the escrow fund, and the properties included in the PSA, [10] viz: WHEREFORE, premises considered, [RPN, et al.'s] motion for execution dated 18 July 2003 and supplemental motion for execution dated 20 January 2004, are GRANTED. Accordingly, let a Writ of Execution be issued to execute the judgment, as modified, against any and all assets of TRB found anywhere in the Philippines, including those subject of the merger/consolidation in the guise of the Purchase and Sale Agreement with Bank of Commerce, and/or against the Escrow Fund established by TRB and Bank of Commerce with the Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company. SO ORDERED. (Emphases in the original) Metrobank filed a Motion for Clarification and/or Reconsideration Ad Cautelam and asserted that it is not a party in the case and that there is nothing that the RTC could execute against it. Also, Metrobank underscored the RTC's lack of jurisdiction to determine RPN IBC, and BBC's right to proceed against the escrow fund. On February 22, 2006, the RTC upheld the order of execution and clarified that the escrow account is included only as a possible source of funds to satisfy the award. The RTC pointed out its power to determine all issues of facts and law in aid of enforcing the final judgment. [11] Dissatisfied, BankCom and Metrobank filed petitions for certiorari with the CA docketed as CA-G.R. SP Nos. 91258 and 94171. BankCom and Metrobank argued that a separate proceeding against the escrow fund is necessary. On December 8, 2009, the CA dismissed the petitions and ruled that the RTC did not act with grave abuse of discretion when it directed the issuance of a writ of execution against the escrow fund. The determination of whether the escrow fund had been exhausted is a question which the RTC can properly resolve as an incident of the execution of a final judgment.","On December 8, 2009, the CA dismissed the petitions [CA-G.R.

The determination of whether the escrow fund had been exhausted is a question which the RTC can properly resolve as an incident of the execution of a final judgment.","The petition is partly meritorious. The RTC is correct in issuing a writ of execution because its judgment in Civil Case No. Q-89-3580 declaring Traders Royal liable had attained finality, but the RTC should have confined the order of execution in a manner prescribed in the rules, specifically Section 9, Rule 39 of the Revised Rules of Court. The RTC deviated from the rules when it directed the enforcement of the money judgment 'against any and all assets of TRB x x x and/or against the Escrow Fund established by TRB and Bank of Commerce with the Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company' without first requiring the sheriff to demand immediate payment from Traders Royal and without resorting to the levy of properties by way of garnishment only if payment cannot be made. The RTC cannot require Metrobank to comply with all its orders and processes absent the service of a writ of garnishment, as it is through service of this writ that the trial court acquires jurisdiction over the garnishee. The RTC prematurely inquired into the status of the escrow account via subpoena before the mandatory procedures for execution and garnishment were followed.","ACCORDINGLY, the petition is PARTLY GRANTED.

LUCIA REALTY AND DEVELOPMENT, INC., RESPONDENT.","Petitioners Marcial and Elizabeth Vargas (the Spouses) own a 10,000 square-meter parcel of land located in Barangay Batasan Hills, Quezon City (the Outside Lot). In 2000, the Spouses bought another 300-square-meter parcel of land (the VRC Lot) in a private residential subdivision known as Vista Real Classica (VRC), which is adjacent to their Outside Lot. Through a letter dated October 5, 2001, the Spouses demanded from the developer of VRC, Sta. Lucia Realty and Development, Inc. (SLR), a right of way from the Outside Lot through their VRC Lot, into VRC's streets, and into a public road (Commonwealth Avenue). SLR denied receiving the demand letter and claimed that a right of way for the Outside Lot cannot be constituted through VRC's streets, citing, among other reasons, that the Deed of Restrictions for the VRC Lot expressly prohibits the use of the lot as an access to any adjacent lot outside the subdivision. On November 19, 2001, the Spouses filed a complaint before the Quezon City RTC. The RTC rendered its decision granting the right of way as demanded by the Spouses, subject to the payment of indemnity, finding that the Outside Lot was indeed surrounded by other immovables and its only outlet to a public highway is through VRC. On appeal by SLR, the CA reversed the RTC decision and dismissed the Spouses' complaint, holding that the Spouses failed to prove the existence of the requisites for the establishment of a compulsory right of way under the Civil Code, specifically failing to substantiate their allegation that the route through VRC is the Outside Lot's only adequate outlet to a public highway, failing to prove they offered to indemnify SLR, and failing to prove that their proposed route for the claimed right of way is the least prejudicial to VRC. With their motion for reconsideration having been denied, the Spouses now raise the matter before the Supreme Court.","WHEREFORE, the Court DENIES the present petition and AFFIRMS the assailed Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

The requisites are: 1) The dominant estate is surrounded by other immovables and has no adequate outlet to a public highway; 2) The owner must pay proper indemnity; 3) The isolation is not the result of the owner's own acts; and 4) The claimed right of way must be at the point least prejudicial to the servient estate. The Spouses failed to meet the burden of proof. Although they proved the Outside Lot is surrounded by other immovables, they failed to prove it has no adequate outlet to a public highway. The sketch plans showed the Outside Lot is bounded on three sides by three other lots, denominated as Lot 10, PCS-2587, Lot 9, PCS-2587, and Lot 14, PCS-2587. The Spouses should have alleged and proved the physical and geographical circumstances of these three adjacent lots, so that the courts may determine if these lots are adequate outlets for the Outside Lot. Furthermore, the failure to submit evidence on the condition of the three other lots surrounding the Outside Lot prevented them from establishing compliance with the fourth requisite, as the determination of the point least prejudicial to the owners of servient estates requires a comparative evaluation of the physical conditions of the estates.",DENIES the present petition and AFFIRMS the assailed Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

Said complaint questioned the mortgage and transfer of title in favor of PNB.[8] PNB filed its Answer with Compulsory Counterclaim,[9] in turn respondents spouses filed a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings,[10] to which PNB failed to file any comment or opposition.[11] The complaint was deemed submitted for decision.[12] In April 2011, the RTC of Malolos City, Branch 9 adjudged that PNB's extra-judicial foreclosure proceedings as null and void, hence, it cancelled PNB's title on the subject properties.[13] It likewise denied PNB's Motion for Extension of Time to File a Motion for Reconsideration[14] because of failure to strictly adhere to the 15-day period provided under the rules.[15] In June 2011, the RTC of Malolos City, Branch 9 denied PNB's Motion to Nullify Proceedings with Opposition to Motion for Issuance of Writ of Execution,[16] because PNB's counsel failed to appear during the hearing for said motion.[17] In July 2011, the RTC of Malolos City, Branch 9 granted the Motion for Issuance of Writ of Execution.[18] On July 15, 2011, PNB filed a Petition for Relief[19] asseverating that it was deprived of due process because it failed to present its defenses due to the gross negligence of its previous counsel.[20]","The RTC of Malolos City, Branch 9 denied PNB's Petition for Relief on August 12, 2011, ruling it was filed out of time, as the 60-day period started when counsel received the decision on April 27, 2011, making the deadline June 27, 2011, but PNB filed only on July 15, 2011. PNB filed a Petition for Certiorari before the CA. The Court of Appeals (CA) in its December 21, 2012 Decision dismissed the petition, ruling that PNB failed to attach the required pleadings for certiorari, and substantively, PNB failed to strictly comply with the mandatory twin-period set forth in Rule 38. The CA likewise held that PNB was not deprived of due process and was bound by the negligence of its counsel.","The Supreme Court ruled that PNB failed to file its Petition for Relief from Judgment within the mandatory and jurisdictional twin-period prescribed by Section 3, Rule 38 of the Rules of Court, calculating the 60-day period from the date PNB's counsel received the decision (April 27, 2011) and not from when PNB learned of its counsel's negligence. The Court affirmed the long-standing principle that notice sent to a counsel of record is equivalent to notice to the client-litigant. Furthermore, the Court found that the alleged negligent acts of PNB’s counsel did not amount to gross negligence constituting clear abandonment of the client's cause, nor did it deprive PNB of due process, as PNB was able to submit its answer with compulsory counterclaim, thus having the opportunity to be heard.","the Petition is DENIED. The assailed December 21, 2012 Decision and the April 29, 2013 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 121847 are AFFIRMED."
"G.R. No. 233678, July 27, 2022","CECILIA YULO LOCSIN SUBSTITUTED BY MR. LEANDRO Y. LOCSIN, PETITIONER, VS. PUERTO GALERA RESORT HOTEL, INC. ALSO REPRESENTED BY LUISITO B. PADILLA AND LUISITO B. PADILLA, IN HIS OWN CAPACITY, RESPONDENTS.","The case stemmed from a Complaint for actual, moral, and exemplary damages with prayer for attorney's fees and cost of suit filed by Luisito B. Padilla (Padilla), in his personal capacity and in behalf of Robustiniano Quinto, Jr. (Quinto), and respondent Puerto Galera Resort Hotel, Inc. (PGRHI) against Cecilia Yulo Locsin (Cecilia), for allegedly looting and gutting the fixtures, appliances and other movables found in a hotel complex owned by Quinto. In 1993, Padilla entered into a lease contract with Quinto over the hotel complex and was authorized to introduce improvements. In 2004, Padilla and Quinto executed a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) wherein they undertook to look for prospective tenants, jointly share in the earnings, and individually or collectively defend their rights in the property. In May 2006, they agreed to lease the complex to Cecilia for 10 years. Cecilia paid a security deposit of P500,000.00 and took possession. After one year, Quinto discovered the premises was totally damaged, with estimated costs of damages and losses amounting to P12,500,000.00. Cecilia claimed the contract of lease was not yet perfected. Consequently, Padilla, using a Special Power of Attorney (SPA) executed by Quinto, instituted a complaint for damages against Cecilia. Cecilia countered that there was no perfected contract of lease. During trial, Quinto manifested that he would move for the dismissal of the case against Cecilia, executing a Revocation of the SPA, alleging that he did not fully understand the contents of the SPA. The trial court granted Quinto's Motion to Dismiss, explaining that the revocation expressly repudiated Padilla's authority, that Padilla and PGRHI were not real parties in interest, and that there was no perfected contract of lease. The trial court denied Cecilia's claim for damages but awarded her P500,000.00 in attorney's fees, P100,000.00 in litigation expenses and costs of suit. Aggrieved, Padilla and PGRHI appealed before the CA. Cecilia passed away and was substituted by Leandro Locsin.","In a Decision dated April 4, 2017, the CA granted the appeal, thereby reversing and setting aside the RTC Orders dated March 4, 2013 and April 18, 2013. The CA held that the agency between Quinto and Padilla is one coupled with interest, hence, irrevocable. Accordingly, the dismissal of the complaint was improper. In view of this, the CA ordered the remand of the case to the trial court for further reception of respondents' evidence. The CA likewise reversed and set aside the April 22, 2015 Order of the trial court awarding attorney's fees and litigation expenses in favor of Cecilia for lack of actual finding of her entitlement thereto except for the sole reason that she was compelled to litigate to protect her interest.","The Court found no merit in the petition. The Court held that the agency granted by Quinto to Padilla is coupled with interest because it is the means of fulfilling an obligation already contracted, which is the MOA between Padilla and Quinto dated October 15, 2004. Since Padilla had introduced substantial improvements, the SPA is irrevocable. The Court also held that there was a perfected contract of lease between the parties, evidenced by Cecilia's security deposit, taking possession, and payment of monthly rentals. Regarding Padilla's standing, the Court ruled that he is a real party-in-interest because he introduced substantial improvements in the property and stands to be benefited or injured by the judgment. Finally, the Court affirmed the CA's reversal of the award of attorney's fees and litigation expenses to Cecilia, finding that the suit filed by Padilla was not unfounded, as he merely exercised his right to litigate based on his material interest over the hotel complex, and there was no showing of bad faith.","WHEREFORE, the instant petition is DENIED. The April 4, 2017 Decision and the July 20, 2017 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 105148 are AFFIRMED."

PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","On August 10, 2016, two Informations were filed against Chan (the incumbent Mayor of Babatngon, Leyte) for violation of Section 3(j) of RA 3019. Criminal Case No. SB-16-CRM-0511 alleged that Chan approved and granted a Mayor's Permit for the operation of the Babatngon Gallera in favor of Nicomedes Alde, a Sangguniang Bayan member and President of the Liga ng mga Barangay, who was prohibited under Section 89(2) of RA 7160 from holding such interest. Criminal Case No. SB-16-CRM-0512 alleged that Chan approved and granted a Mayor's Permit in favor of the Liga ng mga Barangay to hold cockfights every Saturday, knowing that the holding of cockfights every Saturday is prohibited by law, particularly Section 5(d) and (e) of Presidential Decree No. 449 and Municipal Ordinance No. 281. The parties stipulated that Chan was the incumbent mayor. The prosecution presented witnesses and documentary evidence, including the Mayor's Permit (Exhibit 'H') signed by Chan. Chan opted not to present evidence, arguing that the prosecution failed to establish sufficient evidence to hold her guilty beyond reasonable doubt and that she had no criminal intent.","In a Decision dated February 20, 2018, the Sandiganbayan acquitted Chan in Criminal Case No. SB-16-CRM-0511 for insufficiency of evidence, but found her guilty beyond reasonable doubt for the crime charged in Criminal Case No. SB-16-CRM-0512.","The Supreme Court found that the prosecution proved all three elements of Section 3(j) of RA 3019 beyond reasonable doubt in Criminal Case No. SB-16-CRM-0512. First, Chan was undisputed as a public officer (Mayor). Second, she knowingly granted the permit, as evidenced by the Mayor's Permit (Exhibit 'H') signed by her, allowing the Liga ng mga Barangay to hold cockfights on Saturdays. Third, the Liga ng mga Barangay was not legally entitled to the permit because its members, being barangay officials, are prohibited from holding such interests in any cockpit operation pursuant to Section 89(a)(2) of RA 7160 (Local Government Code of 1991). The Court affirmed that criminal intent is not necessary in mala prohibita offenses such as violation of Section 3(j) of RA 3019. Thus, the finding of the Sandiganbayan that Chan is guilty beyond reasonable doubt was upheld.","The Petition is hereby DENIED. The assailed February 20, 2018 Decision of the Sandiganbayan in Criminal Case No. SB-16-CRM-0512 is hereby AFFIRMED in toto."
"G.R. No. 239827, July 27, 2022","LEONILA PAREDES MONTERO, PETITIONER, VS. THE HONORABLE OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSMAN AND AUGUSTIN M. CLORIBEL, RESPONDENTS.","This resolves a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court with prayer for the issuance of temporary restraining order and writ of preliminary injunction, assailing the Resolution and Order of the Office of the Ombudsman finding probable cause to indict Leonila Paredes Montero (Montero) for four counts of unlawful appointments under Article 244 of the Revised Penal Code and four counts of violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019. The assailed Order denied Montero's Motion for Reconsideration. On August 14, 2015, Augustin M. Cloribel (Cloribel) filed a Complaint-Affidavit against Montero, charging her with illegal use of public funds or property under Article 220 of the Revised Penal Code, unlawful appointment under Article 244 of the Revised Penal Code, and violation of Sections 3 (a) (e) and (g) of Republic Act No. 3019. Montero was likewise administratively charged with grave misconduct, gross negligence, and conduct prejudicial to the service. Cloribel alleged that Montero won the 2013 mayoral race of the Municipality of Panglao, Bohol. Upon taking her oath on July 1, 2013, she appointed four consultants, namely, Noel E. Hormachuelos, Danilo A. Reyes, Apolinar B. Fudalan, and Fernando B. Penales (Hormachuelos et al.). Cloribel claimed that Hormachuelos et al. were all candidates who lost in the May 2013 synchronized elections, making their appointment violative of the one-year prohibition on appointment of losing candidates under the Constitution and the Local Government Code. To make the appointments regular, Montero allegedly conspired with her husband and daughter, both members of the Sangguniang Bayan of Panglao, to facilitate the passage of four resolutions authorizing Montero to hire Hormachuelos et al. Cloribel asserted that the resolutions were defective, having been passed eight days after the appointments were made. In her Counter-Affidavit, Montero denied the charges against her. She cited two Opinions issued by the Department of the Interior and Local Government, which state that the prohibition does not cover the hiring of a losing candidate on a daily or casual basis, and consultancy services are not considered as government services within the prohibition's purview. In its assailed Resolution, the Office of the Ombudsman found probable cause to indict Montero for four counts of unlawful appointments and four counts of violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019. The other criminal charges filed against Montero were dismissed for lack of evidence. Montero moved for reconsideration but it was denied in an Order. Dissatisfied, Montero filed this Petition for Certiorari.",The petition is unmeritorious. This Court has adopted a policy of noninterference with the Office of the Ombudsman's exercise of its constitutional mandate. We shall not disturb its determination of probable cause unless it be proven that it committed grave abuse of discretion.,"A perusal of the records reveals that the Office of the Ombudsman committed no grave abuse of discretion in finding probable cause against petitioner for unlawful appointments and violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019. ... The Office of the Ombudsman correctly ruled that petitioner acted with partiality and evident bad faith when she appointed Hormachuelos et al. despite knowledge of the one-year prohibition. She gave Hormachuelos et al. unwarranted benefits when she hired them to fill vital positions in the local government. Undue injury was caused to the government in the amount of the salary they received. ... Finally, this Court notes that Informations were already filed against petitioner. Time and again, we have held that once the criminal action is initiated through the filing in court of an information or complaint, any proceeding questioning the finding of probable cause of the prosecutor or the Office of the Ombudsman is rendered moot and academic. ... Considering that Informations were already filed, jurisdiction over the case is now with the Sandiganbayan.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Certiorari is DISMISSED. The .November 8, 2016 Resolution and January 15, 2018 Order of the Office of the Ombudsman in OMB-V-C-15-0266 are AFFIRMED."
"G.R. No. 230968, July 27, 2022","SAMSUDIN T. HAMID, PETITIONER, VS. GERVASIO SECURITY AND INVESTIGATION AGENCY, INC./SUSAN S. GERVASIO, RESPONDENTS.","Petitioner was hired by Gervasio Security and Investigation Agency, Inc./Susan S. Gervasio, the president of the security agency (collectively, respondents) as a security guard on March 8, 2003. Sometime in October 2010, petitioner was assigned at Midas Hotel in Roxas Boulevard, Pasay City, where he was required to work seven (7) days a week from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. On May 24, 2011, after his 12-hour day shift duty, he was asked to work for the night even though it was his rest day since his co-guard assigned for night-shift duty was absent. Petitioner informed his immediate superior that he was not feeling well at that time. Notwithstanding, he was made to work and guard the Gate 2 of the hotel. On May 25, 2011, when he was about to go home after his 24-hour duty, petitioner received a Memorandum asking him to explain why no disciplinary action should be passed upon him after he was caught sleeping while on duty. On May 26, 2011, petitioner submitted his written response, wherein he admitted taking a nap during duty but insisted that he was not feeling well. He explained that he had a cough, and could not breathe properly. He likewise stated that he was taking Decolgen to alleviate his condition. Despite petitioner's explanation and supplication for understanding, he was suspended for 30 days without pay ""effective upon receipt of this memorandum after which you are directed to report to this office in complete uniform after the completion of your suspension for proper disposition."" During his suspension, petitioner received another memorandum informing him that he would be relieved from his post after his suspension by virtue of the client's request. Petitioner, thus, after his suspension, waited to be assigned for another post. Petitioner, however, waited in vain for he received no call or order from respondents. Accordingly, he filed a complaint for illegal suspension, and separation pay, among others, on January 6, 2012. Petitioner amended his complaint on March 14, 2012 to include illegal dismissal (constructive dismissal) as one of the causes of action. For their part, respondents averred that they did not dismiss petitioner on May 25, 2011, or any date thereafter. Respondents claimed that after petitioner's suspension, they sent four (4) notices on October 10, 2011, November 8, 2011, December 8, 2011 and January 9, 2012 to petitioner requiring him to report for duty for immediate posting. All these notices were sent to his last known address as per personnel files. Notwithstanding, petitioner failed to report for duty despite said notices. Instead, petitioner opted to file a complaint against them on January 6, 2012.","Labor Arbiter (LA) Jonalyn M. Gutierrez rendered the September 12, 2012 Decision dismissing petitioner's complaint for lack of merit. The LA ordered respondent security agency to pay complainant an equivalent of 20 days pay (P404 x 20 days = P8,080 pesos) or P8,080.00 to compensate for the harsh penalty he sustained despite having suffered to work on his rest day and for continuous duty. On appeal, the NLRC affirmed the dismissal of the complaint in its Decision promulgated on March 7, 2013, ruling that petitioner was not constructively dismissed. Petitioner then filed a Petition for Certiorari with the CA. In the assailed Decision promulgated on August 28, 2015, the CA dismissed the petition and deemed the same closed and terminated. The CA ruled that with the execution of a Quitclaim and Release executed by petitioner, the receipt of the amount of P9,500.00 as consideration thereof, and the dismissal of the complaint in an Order dated September 12, 2013 by the Executive LA, the petition has been rendered moot and academic.","The Court found that the CA gravely erred when it declared the case deemed closed and terminated because the approved Quitclaim and Release pertains to a different case involving the same parties, specifically a complaint for money claim (surety bond), not the instant case for constructive dismissal. The Court further ruled that petitioner was constructively dismissed. Placing security guards on floating status must not exceed six (6) months, otherwise constructive dismissal occurs. Petitioner was deemed in a floating status from June 26, 2011. Although respondents sent notices to report, these notices did not state a specific client to which he would be deployed, as required by relevant jurisprudence, making them merely general return-to-work orders which did not toll the running of petitioner's floating status. The immediate filing of the complaint for constructive dismissal also negated abandonment. Since 10 years had passed since the complaint was filed, reinstatement was no longer practicable; thus, separation pay in lieu of reinstatement was warranted.","WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing premises, the instant petition is GRANTED. The August 28, 2015 Decision and Resolution dated March 31, 2017 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 130704, are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Accordingly, respondents Gervasio Security and Investigation Agency, Inc./Susan S. Gervasio are ordered to pay petitioner Samsudin T. Hamid: 1. Full backwages and other benefits computed from the date petitioner's employment was illegally terminated until the finality of this Decision; 2. Separation pay computed from the date petitioner commenced employment until the finality of this Decision at the rate of one (1) month's salary for every year of service, with a fraction of a year of at least six (6) months being counted as one (1) whole year; and 3. Attorney's fees equivalent to ten percent (10%) of the total award. 4. Interest of six percent (6%) per annum on all the monetary awards from the finality of this Decision until full payment. The case is REMANDED to the Labor Arbiter to make a detailed computation of the amounts due to petitioner, which must be paid without delay, and for the execution of this Decision. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. Nos. 234868-69, July 27, 2022","MARIO L. RELAMPAGOS, PETITIONER, VS.

Baligod and Lourdes P. Benipayo (collectively, complainants) on October 3, 2013 and March 13, 2014 against several private individuals and public officers, including petitioner. The charges were based on the alleged participation of respondents in the criminal complaint, including petitioner, in the anomalous use or illegal diversion of the amount of P900 Million from the Malampaya Fund. Such amount allocated by the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) to the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) used as conduits 12 non-governmental organizations (NGOs) established and controlled by Janet Lim Napoles that turned out to be non-existing entities. ...

Andaya and petitioner—by respectively issuing the SARO and signing the corresponding NCA, notwithstanding their knowledge of the lack of the required supporting documents—facilitated the release of the amount of P900 Million from the Malampaya Fund with undue haste, showing their complicity in the alleged illegal diversion and misuse of public funds. ... The Joint Resolution found probable cause against several private individuals and public officers, including Mario L. Relampagos (petitioner), for two (2) counts of Plunder, ninety-seven (97) counts of Malversation of Public Funds through Falsification of Public Documents, and ninety-seven (97) counts of violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019.

"G.R. No. 249414, July 27, 2022","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. BENNY DALAGUET, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","In two separate Informations both dated March 29, 2010, Dalaguet was charged with violations of Section 5(b), of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7610, in Criminal Case No. F-10-49-MJ (sometime in December 2009) and Criminal Case No. F-10-50-MJ (on or about March 2010), both alleging that the accused willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have sexual intercourse with [AAA], a minor, fifteen (15) years old, without her consent and against her will. Upon arraignment, Dalaguet pleaded not guilty. AAA testified that in December 2009, Dalaguet carried her to a hut, undressed her, and although she struggled and shouted, he sexually molested her, inserting his penis at the outside portion of her vagina, but without penetration. She did not report it because Dalaguet told her she wouldn't be believed. On March 9, 2010, Dalaguet sexually molested her again at her house when her parents were away. AAA's grandfather, EEE, caught Dalaguet sexually molesting AAA, finding them both undressed. Dalaguet interposed denial, claiming he only went to AAA's house on March 9, 2010 to retrieve his cellphone, and denied the December 2009 incident. The RTC convicted Dalaguet of two (2) counts of rape and sentenced him to Reclusion Perpetua for each count. Dalaguet appealed to the CA. The CA affirmed with modification, finding Dalaguet GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of two (2) counts of Lascivious Conduct under Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610, holding that while sexual acts through threat were established, penetration required for rape was not proved beyond reasonable doubt. The CA imposed an indeterminate penalty of eight (8) years and one (1) day of prisión mayor as minimum, to seventeen (17) years, four (4) months and one (1) day of reclusion temporal as maximum, for each count.","The appeal is unmeritorious. After a careful review of the records, we find that the prosecution has proven beyond reasonable doubt that accused-appellant committed two (2) counts of lascivious conduct under Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610.","AAA's testimony is given due weight and credence, as the alleged inconsistencies (failure to resist/shout, delayed disclosure, medical certificate discrepancy) are trivial and insufficient to warrant acquittal. Accused-appellant cannot be convicted of two counts of rape through sexual intercourse because AAA consistently stated that Dalaguet was not able to penetrate his penis into her vagina. However, pursuant to the variance doctrine, accused-appellant is guilty of two (2) counts of lascivious conduct under Section 5 (b), Article III of R.A. No. 7610, as the acts (making her lie down, undressing her while he also undressed himself, and performing push and pull movements outside the vagina) established the elements of lascivious conduct against a child under 18 (AAA was 15) under the coercion or influence of an adult. The Court found that the retroactive application of R.A. No. 11648 (which raised the age of consent to 16) would not be favorable to the accused-appellant as it increased the minimum term of the indeterminate penalty. Thus, R.A. No. 7610, prior to its amendment, applies. Applying R.A. No. 7610 and the Indeterminate Sentence Law, without aggravating or mitigating circumstances, the maximum term shall be taken from the medium period of the imposable penalty (reclusion temporal to reclusion perpetua), and the minimum term shall be taken from within the range of the penalty next lower in degree (prision mayor in its medium period to reclusion temporal in its minimum period).","ACCORDINGLY, the appeal is DISMISSED. The Decision of the Court of Appeals dated June 25, 2019 in CA-G.R. CEB CR HC No. 02332 is AFFIRMED. Accused-appellant Benny Dalaguet is GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of two (2) counts of Lascivious Conduct under Section 5(b), Article III of the Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act (Republic Act No. 7610). He is sentenced to suffer the indeterminate penalty of eight (8) years and one (1) day of prisión mayor, in its medium period, as minimum, to twenty (20) years of reclusion temporal as maximum term of imprisonment for each count of violation. Accused-appellant is ORDERED to pay private complainant AAA the amounts of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity, P50,000.00 as moral damages, and P50,000.00 as exemplary damages, for each count of violation, with legal interest of six percent (6%) per annum from the date of finality of this Decision until full payment.

The ASB Group of Companies, including SFSRC, initiated rehabilitation proceedings before the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on May 2, 2000, and Stay Orders were subsequently issued. SFSRC filed motions with Special Hearing Panel 2 (SHP 2) to enjoin Chinabank from charging interest and penalties on its loans beginning May 4, 2000. SHP 2 granted this motion by Order dated February 28, 2013, holding that SFSRC should not be charged interest other than those indicated in Appendix J of the Rehabilitation Plan. Later, SFSRC and St. Francis Square Development Corporation (SFSDC) filed an Omnibus Motion claiming the properties were 'over-collateralized' based on appraisal reports. SHP 2 granted this motion in its Order dated March 25, 2014, directing Chinabank to release the titles and cancel mortgages on the Bel-Air and Caloocan properties for sale, and to cancel/release the mortgage on The Legaspi Place. The SEC En Banc partially reversed SHP 2, but Chinabank and respondents sought relief from the Court of Appeals (CA). The CA consolidated the cases (CA-G.R. SP Nos. 145290, 145586, 145610, 146157 & 146331).","By its consolidated Decision dated April 7, 2017, the Court of Appeals affirmed the Decision dated February 23, 2016 in SEC En Banc Case No. 03-13-286, prohibiting petitioner from charging interest and penalties on outstanding loans beginning May 4, 2000, but reversed the following SEC En Banc dispositions: (a) Decision dated April 27, 2016 in SEC En Banc Case No. 04-14-325 on the grounds that the SEC therein erroneously failed to order the cancellation of the mortgages on respondents' Bel Air and Caloocan properties prior to their auction sale, and erroneously ordered the release and transfer of the Legaspi Place property to the assets pool; and (b) Decision dated April 27, 2016 in SEC En Banc Case No. 01-15-352 which designated a special sheriff to implement its issuances, including its Decision dated April 27, 2016. The Court of Appeals resolved to DISMISS Chinabank's Petitions for Certiorari filed in CA-G.R. SP No. 145290 and CA-G.R. SP No. 146157, and Petition Ad Abudantiorem Cautelam in C.A. GR-SP No. 146331. With regard to CA-G.R. SP Nos. 145586 and 145610 filed by SFSRC and SFSDC, the Court GRANTED said petitions and REINSTATES the Orders of the SEC Special Hearing Panel 2, dated March 25, 2014, and December 22, 2014 without modification.","The Court AFFIRMED the CA's decision to relax the strict application of procedural rules and admit respondents' Rule 43 petitions, stating that the higher interest of substantial justice dictates resolution on the merits. The Court AFFIRMED the suspension or condonation of interests, penalties, and other charges on respondents' loans beginning May 4, 2000, as this was mandated by the ASB Rehabilitation Plan (Second Option), which became binding on Chinabank under the 'cram-down' principle after Chinabank refused the 'dacion en pago' option. The Court AFFIRMED the CA's directive regarding the release of the Bel-Air, Caloocan, and Legaspi properties, noting that the modification of the mortgage contracts is part and parcel of the approved Rehabilitation Plan and does not infringe on Chinabank's right to due process. Chinabank's status as a secured creditor remains only in the event of liquidation, not rehabilitation. The Court AFFIRMED that the SHP 2's Order dated March 25, 2014, is immediately executory. However, the Court MODIFIED the CA decision regarding the designation of the sheriff. Citing OCA Circular No. 161-2016, the Court held that court sheriffs cannot enforce writs of execution issued by quasi-judicial bodies (like the SEC).","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DENIED. The Decision dated April 7, 2017 and Resolution dated July 6, 2017 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP Nos. 145290, 145586, 145610, 146157, and 146331 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. The designation of Mr. Rommel M. Ignacio, Sheriff IV of the Regional Trial Court of Makati City, is REVOKED. In his stead, Special Sheriff Anthony Glenn Paggao is DIRECTED TO IMPLEMENT the Writ of Execution dated October 28, 2014 issued in relation to the Order dated March 25, 2014 in accordance with SEC Resolution No. 586 (Series of 2015). SO ORDERED."
"A.C. No. 5190, July 26, 2022","HON. MANUEL E. CONTRERAS, PRESIDING JUDGE, MUNICIPAL TRIAL COURT, OCAMPO, CAMARINES SUR, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. FREDDIE A. VENIDA, RESPONDENT.","In his letter, Judge Contreras alleged that when he became the acting Presiding Judge of MTC-Paracale, Camarines Norte on July 16, 1999, he found out that the cases wherein Atty. Venida is the accused or counsel for one of the parties had not moved since 1992, due to the latter's employment of dilatory tactics. He claimed that Atty. Venida abused the Court's processes by filing impertinent motions and manifestations which impeded and obstructed the administration of justice. Oftentimes, Atty. Venida was defiant, recalcitrant and belligerent towards the authority of the court. He was forced to suspend Atty. Venida as counsel for the cases he handled because of the numerous pro-forma motions for postponement he filed, causing delays in the resolution of the cases. Even if there were no valid grounds, Atty. Venida sought to inhibit Judge Contreras in the criminal cases against him and where he appeared as counsel. Judge Contreras also noted that Atty. Venida's language in his pleadings were offensive, disrespectful, and defiant of the authority of the court. Moreover, his personal appearance was unkempt whenever he showed up in court, which is not to be expected from an officer of the court and a member of the Bar. There were even reports that Atty. Venida was not mentally fit to practice law. Hence, Judge Contreras recommended that Atty. Venida undergo a neuro-psychiatric examination to determine if he is indeed suffering from mental illness. The IBP subsequently recommended that Atty. Venida undergo neuro-psychiatric examination and be suspended from the practice of law pending the results of the same, which the Court adopted. Atty. Venida submitted to a partial examination in 2003 and completed it in 2004. Thereafter, the Court, through the OBC, IBP, and NBI, repeatedly attempted to locate Atty. Venida for updates but were unsuccessful as he had moved from his registered addresses.","The Court found that Atty. Venida's actions, including his use of dilatory tactics, abuse of court processes, and defiant behavior, exhibited a failure to comply with the rigid standards required of the practice of law, warranting the penalty of indefinite suspension. However, the Court recognized that it could no longer impose the penalty of suspension because Atty. Venida had already been disbarred on August 23, 2016, in the case of San Juan v. Atty. Venida (793 Phil. 656, 2016), for violating Canons 16, 17, and 18, and Rules 1.01, 16.01, 18.03 and 18.04 of the Code of Professional Responsibility. As the privilege to practice law was already withdrawn, no penalty relating to that privilege could be imposed. Nevertheless, the Court ruled that the corresponding penalty (indefinite suspension) must be officially adjudged for recording purposes in the lawyer's personal file with the OBC, to be taken into consideration if he subsequently files a petition for reinstatement.","WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, Atty. Freddie A. Venida is hereby SUSPENDED INDEFINITELY from the practice of law. However, this penalty can no longer be imposed considering that he is already disbarred. Nevertheless, the penalty should be considered in the event that he should apply for reinstatement. Let a copy of this Decision be furnished the Office of the Bar Confidant to be entered into Atty. Freddie A. Venida's records. Copies shall likewise be furnished the Integrated Bar of the Philippines for their information and guidance, and the Office of the Court Administrator for circulation to all courts concerned. SO ORDERED.","Atty. Freddie A. Venida is SUSPENDED INDEFINITELY from the practice of law, but the penalty serves only for recording purposes in his personal file with the Office of the Bar Confidant, as he was previously disbarred."
"G.R. No. 258456 [Formerly UDK 17252], July 26, 2022","GIORGIDI B. AGGABAO AND AMELITA S. NAVARRO, PETITIONERS, VS. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS (COMELEC) AND LAW DEPARTMENT, RESPONDENTS.","On October 4, 2021, Navarro filed her COC for Mayor of Santiago City, Isabela for the May 9, 2022 National and Local Elections. She stated in her COC that she was officially nominated by the Partido para sa Demokratikong Reporma (Partido Reporma) for the mayoralty race. On October 8, 2021, one Christopher G. Ayson (Ayson) also filed a COC for Mayor of Santiago City, Isabela, declaring nomination by Partido Reporma, submitting a CONA. When Senator Lacson (Chairperson of Partido Reporma) learned of Ayson's declaration, he sent COMELEC a Letter dated November 6, 2021, disclaiming that Partido Reporma issued any CONA in favor of Ayson and emphasizing that Navarro was the official candidate. On November 9, 2021, Navarro withdrew her candidacy and opted to run for Vice-Mayor, declaring she would be substituted by Aggabao, also a member of Partido Reporma. Aggabao filed his COC as Mayor. By Document No. 21-3973 dated November 10, 2021, COMELEC, through its Law Department, informed Navarro that she was deemed an independent candidate pursuant to Section 15 of COMELEC Resolution No. 10717 because Partido Reporma nominated two (2) candidates for the same post. Thereafter, Senator Lacson sent another Letter dated December 2, 2021, reiterating that Ayson's CONA was disowned and Ayson was not even a party member. On December 22, 2021, the COMELEC Law Department issued Document No. 21-7467, reflecting the COMELEC En Banc's disposition maintaining Navarro as INDEPENDENT, hence, the COC of Aggabao who filed as a substitute cannot be given due course. Aggabao's motion for reconsideration was denied under Document No. 22-0176 dated January 5, 2022.","ACCORDINGLY, the petition is PARTLY GRANTED. Document No. 21-3973 dated November 10, 2021, Document No. 21-7467 dated December 22, 2021, and Document No. 22-0176 dated January 5, 2022 issued by respondent Commission on Elections are NULLIFIED.","The conclusion of the May 9, 2022 National and Local Elections and the subsequent proclamation of one Sheena Tan as the Mayor-elect of Santiago City, Isabela have undoubtedly rendered the petition moot insofar as it seeks to nullify the denial of Aggabao's COC as substitute of Navarro, the non-inclusion of Aggabao's name as a mayoralty candidate, and Navarro's declaration as an independent candidate. Despite the mootness, the Court addressed the issues to formulate controlling principles. The COMELEC acted with grave abuse of discretion by refusing to resolve the respective status of Ayson and Navarro, and later on of Aggabao. It opted to rely solely on the recommendation of its Law Department, sans the benefit of its own independent confirmation which could have been done by referring the case to the COMELEC Division for a summary hearing. Had the COMELEC performed its adjudicative duty required under the Constitution and the law, Ayson or Aggabao could have given the winning candidate a run for her money. The Court nullifies and sets aside the assailed documents for non-compliance with the due process requirements.","As for petitioners' prayer to admit the Certificate of Candidacy of Giorgidi B. Aggabao as substitute candidate for Mayor of Santiago City and to include his name in the list of candidates for the post, the same is DECLARED MOOT. The Manifestation dated June 10, 2022 of the Commission on Elections bearing its explanation why the Temporary Restraining Order under Order dated January 25, 2022 was not complied with is NOTED and ACCEPTED. To avoid a recurrence of similar incidents in the future, the Commission on Elections is strongly urged to adopt a practicable plan and timeline to ensure that all cases which involve substitution cases or similar cases which may result in the inclusion or exclusion of a candidate from the ballot are resolved at the earliest possible time."

The accusatory portion of the Information reads: That on or about March 9, 2017, in the City of Naga, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, without authority of law, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and criminally sell and handed one (1) pc.

ACTS CONTRARY TO LAW. Meanwhile, the Information filed against respondent Erick Montierro y Ventocilla (Montierro) with the RTC, charging him with violation of Section 5, Article II of RA No. 9165, docketed as Criminal Case No. 2017-0082, states: That on or about January 25, 2017, in the City of Naga, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, without authority of law, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and criminally sell, dispense and deliver three (3) pcs.

DE JESUS, which when tested were found positive for the presence of Methamphetamine Hydrochloride popularly known as ""Shabu"", a dangerous drug, in violation of the above-cited law. ACTS CONTRARY TO LAW. During arraignment, Baldadera and Montierro separately pleaded not guilty. After the termination of the pre-trial, the prosecution in each of the cases presented and formally offered its respective evidence. During the pendency of the above criminal cases, the Court En Banc, on August 15, 2017, promulgated its Decision in Estipona, Jr. v. Lobrigo (Estipona) where it declared Section 23 of RA No. 9165 as unconstitutional for being contrary to the rule-making authority of the Supreme Court under Section 5(5), Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution. This declaration meant that plea-bargaining was permitted in drugs cases. On November 21, 2017, the Department of Justice (DOJ) issued Department Circular No. 061-17 (DOJ Circular No. 61), prohibiting plea bargaining for violations of Section 5 of RA No. 9165 or in cases of illegal sale of dangerous drugs regardless of its quantity. On April 10, 2018, pursuant to its rule-making power under the 1987 Constitution, the Court promulgated A.M. No. 18-03-16-SC or the Plea Bargaining Framework in Drugs Cases. According to the Plea Bargaining Framework in Drugs Cases, an accused charged with violation of Section 5 of RA No. 9165 is allowed to plea bargain only when the quantity involved is 0.01 gram to 0.99 gram of methamphetamine hydrochloride or shabu, and for which, the acceptable plea bargain is Section 12 of RA No. 9165 or illegal possession of equipment, instrument, apparatus and other paraphernalia for dangerous drugs punishable by six (6) months and one (1) day to four (4) years and a fine ranging from P10,000.00 to P50,000.00. On June 26, 2018, the DOJ issued Department Circular No. 027-18 (DOJ Circular No. 27) amending DOJ Circular No. 61. According to DOJ Circular No. 27, for the charge under Section 5 of RA No. 9165, the acceptable plea bargain is the offense under Section 11, paragraph 3 or illegal possession of dangerous drugs with an indeterminate penalty of twelve (12) years and one (1) clay to twenty (20) years and a fine from P300.000.00 to P400,000.00. Montierro filed with the RTC a proposal for plea bargaining offering to enter a guilty plea to the lesser offense under Section 12 of RA No. 9165 (total weight 0.721 gram shabu). The prosecution objected, citing DOJ Circular No. 61. The RTC granted Montierro's plea bargaining proposal and declared DOJ Circular No. 61 and Regional Order 027-E-18 as contrary to the Rules of Court and an encroachment on the rule-making power of the Supreme Court, and subsequently convicted Montierro for the lesser offense. On certiorari before the CA, the CA dismissed the prosecution's petition. Hence, the petition docketed as G.R. No. 254564. Baldadera submitted before the RTC a plea bargaining proposal to enter a plea of guilty to the lesser offense under Section 12 Article II of RA No. 9165 (quantity 0.048 gram shabu). The prosecutor objected citing DOJ Circular No. 61. The RTC granted Baldadera's proposal. The prosecution moved for reconsideration on the ground of lack of consent. The RTC denied the motion, ruling that DOJ Circular No. 27 is in conflict with the Plea Bargaining Framework in Drugs Cases. Thereafter, the RTC convicted Baldadera for violation of Section 12. The People, through the OSG, filed a Petition for Certiorari with the CA, which granted the petition, nullifying the RTC orders and judgment, finding that the consent of the prosecutor is a condition sine qua non for the validity of plea bargaining agreement in drugs cases. Hence, the petition docketed as G.R. No. 254974. Meanwhile, in A.M. No. 21-07-16-SC, the PJA expressed concern that the Court's ruling in the cases of Reafor and Borras will render the Plea Bargaining Framework in Drugs Cases a dead-letter rule. In A.M. No. 18-03-16-SC, a memorandum from then Court Administrator Jose Midas P. Marquez seeks clarification from the Court on whether the ruling in Reafor can be basis for the judges to overturn, on motion for reconsideration, plea bargaining proposals which were approved without the consent of the prosecution. On February 15, 2022, finding the relation of issues in A.M. No. 18-03-16-SC, the Court consolidated said case to the present cases.","WHEREFORE, the Decision dated July 1, 2020 and the Resolution dated November 26, 2020 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 158032 and the Decision dated February 27, 2020 and Resolution dated October 27, 2020 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 158301 are SET ASIDE.","To summarize the foregoing discussion, the following guidelines shall be observed in plea bargaining in drugs cases: 1. Offers for plea bargaining must be initiated in writing by way of a formal written motion filed by the accused in court. 2. The lesser offense which the accused proposes to plead guilty to must necessarily be included in the offense charged. 3. Upon receipt of the proposal for plea bargaining that is compliant with the provisions of the Plea Bargaining Framework in Drugs Cases, the judge shall order that a drug dependency assessment be administered. If the accused admits drug use, or denies it but is found positive after a drug dependency test, then he/she shall undergo treatment and rehabilitation for a period of not less than six (6) months. Said period shall be credited to his/her penalty and the period of his/her after-care and follow-up program if the penalty is still unserved. If the accused is found negative for drug use/dependency, then he/she will be released on time served, otherwise, he/she will serve his/her sentence in jail minus the counselling period at rehabilitation center. 4. As a rule, plea bargaining requires the mutual agreement of the parties and remains subject to the approval of the court. Regardless of the mutual agreement of the parties, the acceptance of the offer to plead guilty to a lesser offense is not demandable by the accused as a matter of right but is a matter addressed entirely to the sound discretion of the court. 5. Though the prosecution and the defense may agree to enter into a plea bargain, it does not follow that the courts will automatically approve the proposal. Judges must still exercise sound discretion in granting or denying plea bargaining, taking into account the relevant circumstances, including the character of the accused. 6. The court shall not allow plea bargaining if the objection to the plea bargaining is valid and supported by evidence to the effect that: the offender is a recidivist, habitual offender, known in the community as a drug addict and a troublemaker, has undergone rehabilitation but had a relapse, or has been charged many times; or when the evidence of guilt is strong. 7. Plea bargaining in drugs cases shall not be allowed when the proposed plea bargain does not conform to the Court-issued Plea Bargaining Framework in Drugs Cases. 8. Judges may overrule the objection of the prosecution if it is based solely on the ground that the accused's plea bargaining proposal is inconsistent with the acceptable plea bargain under any internal rules or guidelines of the DOJ, though in accordance with the plea bargaining framework issued by the Court, if any. 9. If the prosecution objects to the accused's plea bargaining proposal due to the circumstances enumerated in item no. 5, the trial court is mandated to hear the prosecution's objection and rule on the merits thereof. If the trial court finds the objection meritorious, it shall order the continuation of the criminal proceedings. 10. If an accused applies for probation in offenses punishable under RA No. 9165, other than for illegal drug trafficking or pushing under Section 5 in relation to Section 24 thereof, then the law on probation shall apply.","The respective cases of Cypher Baldadera y Pelagio and Erick Montierro y Ventocilla are REMANDED to the court of origin to determine: (1) whether the evidence of guilt is strong; and (2) whether Baldadera and Montierro are recidivists, habitual offenders, known in the community as drug addicts and troublemakers, have undergone rehabilitation but had a relapse, or have been charged many times. Furthermore, Baldadera and Montierro are ORDERED to submit to a drug dependency test pursuant to A.M. No. 18-03-16-SC. The letter dated July 5, 2021 of the Philippine Judges Association and the memorandum dated October 8, 2021 from the Court Administrator are hereby NOTED."

COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS AND NACIONALISTA PARTY, REPRESENTED BY ITS PRESIDENT, MANUEL B. VILLAR, AND/OR ITS SECRETARY GENERAL, ALAN PETER CAYETANO, RESPONDENTS.","On March 25, 2019, the Commission on Elections issued Resolution No. 10514 titled ""Rules and Regulations Governing the Filing of Accreditation for the Purpose of Determining the Dominant Majority Party, Dominant Minority Party, Ten (10) Major National Parties and Two (2) Major Local Parties in Connection with the May 13, 2019 National and Local Elections."" On April 10, 2019, the Liberal Party filed with the Commission on Elections its Petition for Accreditation as the Dominant Minority Party. On May 8, 2019, the Commission on Elections En Banc issued Resolution No. 10538 declaring Partido Demokratiko Pilipino - Lakas ng Bayan as the Dominant Majority Party, the Nacionalista Party as the Dominant Minority Party and the Liberal Party as among the eight Major Political Parties for the 2019 national and local elections. The Commission determined that the Nacionalista Party obtained more points than the Liberal Party based on the criteria laid down in Resolution No. 10514. Commissioner Luie Tito F. Guia, concurred by Commissioner Ma. Rowena Amelia V. Guanzon, expressed serious reservation, arguing that the dominant minority party should come from the minority, ""a party that belongs to those that stand in opposite to the majority"" in accordance with Section 274 of the Omnibus Election Code. On July 1, 2019, the Liberal Party filed before this Court a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 64 in relation to Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, assailing Resolution No. 10538. Petitioner claims that respondent Commission on Elections committed grave abuse of discretion in allegedly ignoring the definition of ""dominant opposition party"" in the Omnibus Election Code when it accredited respondent Nacionalista Party, which was a member of the ruling coalition party, not an opposition party. Further, petitioner prayed for the annulment of Resolution No. 10538 and the establishment of clear guidelines for the recognition and accreditation as the dominant minority party in the conduct of the succeeding elections.",Both prayers are denied.,"The Petition for Certiorari is denied because the purpose for which the parties were accredited in Resolution No. 10538 had already been fulfilled long before the Petition for Certiorari was even filed, thus rendering the case moot, as any action this Court may take regarding Resolution No. 10538 will not produce any legal effect. A primordial requirement for courts to exercise adjudicatory functions is the existence of an actual case or controversy. Furthermore, the criteria in Resolution No. 10514 and Resolution No. 10538 are consistent with the enumerated circumstances in Republic Act No. 7166, Section 26, as amended. The respondent Commission on Elections did not exceed its rule-making powers when it used a weighted average system and assignment of points to determine the dominant majority and dominant minority parties to implement that statutory criteria. Lastly, the prayer that this Court establish guidelines on the recognition and accreditation of the dominant minority party in succeeding elections essentially amounts to a request for this Court to issue an advisory opinion, which it does not do, as this would be an interference with respondent Commission on Elections' constitutional powers over the conduct of elections.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Certiorari is DISMISSED. The May 8, 2019 Resolution No. 10538 of the Commission on Elections is AFFIRMED. SO ORDERED."

PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","This case originated from four separate Informations filed before the Sandiganbayan: Falsification of Public Document (Criminal Case No. SB-11-CRM-0016) and Violation of Section 8 of RA No. 6713 (Criminal Case Nos. SB-11-CRM-0013, SB-11-CRM-0014, and SB-11-CRM-0015). The Sandiganbayan acquitted petitioner Gil A. Valera in Criminal Case Nos. SB-11-CRM-0014 and SB-11-CRM-0016 based on reasonable doubt. However, it found him guilty in Criminal Case Nos. SB-11-CRM-0013 and SB-11-CRM-0015 for omitting his wife's stockholding in Buy Pinoy Marketing, Inc. (P12,500.00) and his minor daughter's stockholding in MJ Valera Realty (P27,000.00) in his 2001 and 2003 SALNs. The Sandiganbayan imposed a fine of P5,000.00 with disqualification to hold public office. The Sandiganbayan subsequently denied his Motion for Partial Reconsideration, declaring it a mere scrap of paper for failure to set it for hearing. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the violation of RA No. 6713 is a crime malum in se and that the disqualification penalty was too harsh.","The Court finds merit in the Petition for Review on Certiorari. The Supreme Court granted the Petition, and reversed and set aside the Decision dated 22 August 2013 and the Resolution dated 18 September 2013 of the Sandiganbayan.","The Supreme Court first decided to relax the strict application of procedural rules regarding the defective motion for partial reconsideration, prioritizing substantial justice. The Court then ruled that the review and compliance procedure provided in Section 10 of RA No. 6713 and Section 1, Rule VIII of the Implementing Rules, which affords public officers an opportunity to correct errors in their SALNs before sanctions are imposed, was not accorded to petitioner. Crucially, applying Section 11 of RA No. 6713, which mandates that a public officer shall be prosecuted under the statute bearing the heavier penalty if the violation is punishable under another law, the Court noted that petitioner was initially charged with Falsification of Public Documents (higher penalty) for the same failure to file a correct SALN. Citing People vs. Perez, the Court held that since petitioner was acquitted of the Falsification charge (Criminal Case No. SB-11-CRM-0016), his innocence is subsumed in that acquittal, rendering nugatory the subsequent Information for violation of Section 8 of RA No. 6713.","Petitioner Gil A. Valera is ACQUITTED of the charges involving violation of Section 8 of Republic Act No. 6713 otherwise known as the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees, in Criminal Case Nos.

Both agreed that petitioner would pay its real property tax liabilities amounting to P177,527,351.99 in eight annual installment payments of P22,190,918.99 beginning 2004 until 2012, excluding 2005, which was a grace interval.[15] The tax amnesty agreement provided that petitioner shall religiously comply with the payment scheme and also pay its current real estate taxes;[16] otherwise, all penalties and interests shall become immediately due and demandable.[17] Acknowledging that Global Steel had acquired the subject plant assets from petitioner and became the one obliged to pay the real property truces thereon starting October 15, 2004, respondents demanded that Global Steel pay the taxes over the plant assets.[18] However, Global Steel failed to pay the current truces on the plant assets in breach of its obligation under the asset purchase agreement.[19] Consequently, respondents went after petitioner and issued notices of tax delinquency and warrants of levy against the latter.[20] On November 22, 2006, petitioner applied for a stay order with the SEC in SEC Case No. 12-99-6496. Global Steel intervened therein.[21] On November 30, 2006, the SEC issued a Stay Order[22] enjoining respondents from enforcing the warrants of levy or conducting a public auction of the subject plant assets.[23] Nevertheless, petitioner paid respondents its second installment in 2006 in the amount of P22,190,918.99.[24] Thereafter, Philippine National Bank-Trust Banking Group, in behalf of petitioner, tendered the following: (a) Manager's Check for P133,145,514.01 as petitioner's third to eighth installment payments[25] and (b) another Manager's Check for P1,398,813.64 representing the plant assets' real property tax liability for the period of October 1 to 14, 2004.[26] Consequently, respondents issued two official receipts acknowledging petitioner's payments.[27] Respondents also issued two certifications dated December 18, 2008 and February. 23, 2009 acknowledging petitioner's full compliance with the schedule of payments.[28] All these notwithstanding, respondents did not clear petitioner of its real property tax liabilities. Thus, petitioner filed a Complaint for Specific Performance[29] with Branch 57, Regional Trial Court, Makati City (RTC of Makati), docketed as Civil Case No. 10-639, for respondents to comply with its obligations under the tax amnesty agreement.[30] On October 7, 2011, the RTC of Makati rendered its Decision[31] (RTC Makati Decision) ruling in favor of petitioner, to wit: WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of plaintiff NATIONAL STEEL CORPORATION -- a) Declaring that plaintiff has fully complied with the valid, binding and effective Tax Amnesty Agreement dated October 13, 2004; and, b) Ordering defendants to comply with the valid, binding and effective Tax Amnesty Agreement dated 13 October 2004 by clearing plaintiff of all its real property tax liabilities up to October 14, 2004 and affording them full relief from payment of interests and penalties pursuant to the amnesty. Defendants' counterclaim for the collection of real estate taxes accruing after 14 October 2004, being in the nature of a permissive counterclaim, is hereby DISMISSED, without prejudice. Defendants' counterclaim for expenses of litigation is likewise DISMISSED for lack of merit. SO ORDERED.[32] Respondents appealed the Decision of the RTC of Makati to the CA. The appeal was docketed as CA-G.R. CV No. 98607.[33] In the Decision[34] dated March 7, 2014, the CA granted the appeal of respondents and held that the RTC of Makati had no jurisdiction over Civil Case No. 10-639.[35] According to the CA, the case properly falls under the jurisdiction of the SEC as it involves the settlement of real property taxes which the City Government of Iligan claims against petitioner.[36] Aggrieved, petitioner moved for reconsideration of the CA Decision dated March 7, 2014.[37] In the Amended Decision[38] dated November 25, 2014, the CA granted petitioner's motion for reconsideration and affirmed the RTC Makati Decision dated October 7, 2011.[39] Aggrieved, respondents appealed the Amended Decision of the CA to the Court in G.R. No. 216172.[40] In the Resolution[41] dated March 16, 2015, the Court affirmed the Amended Decision of the CA ""for failure of [respondents] to sufficiently show that the Court of Appeals committed any reversible error in the challenged [A]mended [D]ecision as to warrant the exercise of this Court's discretionary appellate jurisdiction.""[42] Undaunted, respondents moved for reconsideration of the Court's ruling, but the Court denied it in the Resolution[43] dated September 9, 2015. Consequently, the Court issued an Entry of Judgment[44] dated February 9, 2016 decreeing the finality of the RTC Makati Decision dated October 7, 2011 in Civil Case No. 10-639. Meanwhile, to protect its interest over the plant asset acquired from petitioner, Global Steel, on September 20, 2015, filed with the RTC of Iligan City a Petition for Indirect Contempt and Declaration of Nullity of Notice of Tax Delinquency, Warrants of Levy, etc. against the City Treasurer of Iligan docketed as Case No. 06-7829 (RTC Iligan Case). The petition was amended on February 28, 2017.[45] Despite the finality of the RTC Makati Decision, respondents still included petitioner in the list of delinquent real property taxpayers and proceeded to levy upon the plant assets.[46] Acting on petitioner's application,[47] the RTC of Makati issued on October 18, 2016 a Writ of Execution[48] to implement its final and executory Decision. Despite having received a copy of the Writ of Execution in the morning of October 19, 2016, respondents still proceeded with the scheduled auction of the subject plant assets that day.[49] There being no other bidders, the City Government of Iligan forfeited the subject plant assets in its favor, entered the premises, and exercised acts of ownership over the properties.[50] On November 2, 2016, petitioner filed with the RTC of Makati an Omnibus Motion seeking the following reliefs: (a) to direct respondents and the Sangguniang Panlungsod of the City of Iligan to show cause why they should not be held in contempt; and (b) to annul the auction sale of petitioner's properties held on October 19, 2016 (Omnibus Motion).[51] Meanwhile, Global Steel amended its petition in the RTC Iligan Case by impleading the City Government of Iligan and including in its prayer the nullification of the auction sale and the recovery of possession of the auctioned properties.[52] The Ruling of the RTC of Makati In the Omnibus Order[53] dated April 4, 2017, the RTC of Makati declared the tax delinquency sale of the subject plant null and void and ordered respondents to defer from collecting the real property taxes of petitioner.[54] In its Omnibus Order[55] dated May 21, 2018, the RTC of Makati denied respondents' motion for reconsideration of the Omnibus Order dated April 4, 2017.[56] Prior to the issuance of the Omnibus Orders of the RTC of Makati, respondents continued to exercise acts of ownership over the plant assets. This prompted petitioner to file a Petition for Prohibition before the CA. The case was docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 149852 (Prohibition Case).[57] The Ruling of the CA In its assailed Decision,[58] the CA dismissed petitioner's Petition for Prohibition on the ground that it violated the rule against forum shopping. It explained: It is beyond question that petitioner and Global Steel have a common interest in the petition before this Court and that pending with the RTC of the City of Iligan. In fact, petitioner and Global Steel's causes of action are anchored on their common claim as purported owners of the auctioned properties. Also, as aptly pointed out by the respondents, the facts, subject matter, and reliefs prayed for in the two petitions are substantially similar. Indeed, petitioner and Global Steel, in their respective petitions, ultimately seek a single relief albeit worded differently, i.e., recovery of possession of the forfeited properties grounded primarily on petitioner and Global Steel's common assertion that the 19 October 2016 tax delinquency sale was null and void.[59] Likewise, the CA ruled that petitioner failed to observe the doctrine of hierarchy of courts, to wit: ""[i]nasmuch as the acts sought to be enjoined pertain to a municipal corporation, petitioner should have filed its petition before the RTC of the City of Iligan and not directly before this Court.""[60] Petitioner moved for reconsideration, but the CA denied it in its Resolution[61] dated December 18, 2019. Hence, the instant petition.","WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated July 24, 2019 and the Resolution dated December 18, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 149852 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE.","By virtue of the doctrine of immutability of judgment, the Resolution of the Court dated March 16, 2015 in G.R. No. 216172 can no longer be altered in any way by any court.[69] Thus, there is nothing more to be done but to enforce the RTC Makati Decision. ... There is No Identity of Parties, Rights or Causes of Action, and Reliefs Sought in the Instant Case. Primarily, no forum shopping exists in the case as petitioner and Global Steel are two different entities. ... There being no factual issues left to be resolved in the Prohibition Case, petitioner properly proceeded to the CA, especially that the broader interest of justice demands it. ... Considering all the circumstances, the Court holds the levy and tax delinquency sale of the subject plant assets as invalid having been conducted in defiance of the RTC Makati Decision which ordered respondents to clear petitioner of its real property tax liabilities. Inasmuch as the right of the City Government of Iligan to possess and own the plant assets proceeded from a void tax delinquency sale, the City Government of Iligan is commanded to desist from further possessing and exercising acts of ownership over the plant assets. Lastly, the Court refrains from awarding the .possession and enjoyment of the plant assets to petitioner in view of its existing asset purchase agreement with Global Steel.","A writ of prohibition is ISSUED commanding the City Government of Iligan to permanently desist from possessing and exercising acts of ownership over the subject plant assets pursuant to the final and executory Decision dated October 7, 2011 of Branch 57, Regional Trial Court, Makati City in Civil Case No. 10-639."
"G.R. Nos. 226887-88, July 20, 2022","MARIANO MALONES Y MALIFICIO AND EDNA M. MADARICO, PETITIONERS, VS. SANDIGANBAYAN (THIRD & SEVENTH DIVISIONS) AND PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENTS.","Petitioners Mariano Malones (Malones) and Edna M. Madarico (Madarico) (together, petitioners) were the Mayor and the Treasurer, respectively, of the Municipality of Maasin, Iloilo. On May 31, 2002, Winefredo C. Maternal (Maternal) a former Member of the Sangguniang Bayan of Maasin, Iloilo, filed a complaint-affidavit against petitioners before the Office of the Ombudsman, for irregularities in the acquisition of a garbage compactor truck from Tomitzu Corporation without any public bidding, thereby leading to the loss of public funds amounting to P380,000.00. The complaint was referred to COA on August 27, 2002, which submitted an Evaluation Report on March 25, 2004. On September 28, 2011, the PACPO issued a Final Evaluation Report recommending the filing of formal criminal charges. PACPO filed its formal complaint-affidavit on March 12, 2012. The Ombudsman issued an Order on April 13, 2012, directing petitioners to file their counter-affidavits, which were received on July 18, 2012 (Malones) and August 9, 2012 (Madarico). In their Position Paper filed July 29, 2013, petitioners asserted that their constitutional right to speedy disposition of cases was violated by the Ombudsman due to the delay since 2002. On August 29, 2013, the Ombudsman rendered a Resolution recommending the filing of Informations, which was affirmed by an Order dated November 3, 2014. Two Informations were filed before the Sandiganbayan on August 27, 2014, docketed as Criminal Case Nos. SB-15-CRM-0092 (Violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019) and SB-15-CRM-0093 (Falsification). On January 20, 2016, the OSP filed a Motion for the Suspension Pendente Lite of Accused Malones, which Malones opposed, reiterating his position on the violation of the right to speedy disposition of cases. On June 7, 2016, the Third Division of the Sandiganbayan issued the first assailed Resolution granting the motion to suspend Malones pendente lite, and denying petitioners' motion to dismiss, holding that petitioners failed to show that the delay was vexatious, capricious, and oppressive. The Sandiganbayan denied the motion for reconsideration in the second assailed Resolution dated September 6, 2016.","WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED. The Resolutions dated June 7, 2016 and September 6, 2016 of the Sandiganbayan, Third Division, in Criminal Case Nos. SB-15-CRM-0092 and SB-15-CRM-0093 are hereby ANNULLED and SET ASIDE.","The prosecution failed to justify the inordinate delay in this case. In its Comment/Opposition to petitioners' motion to dismiss, the OSP acknowledged before the Sandiganbayan that the former had repeatedly raised the violation of their right to speedy disposition in every stage of the proceedings. However, the OSP merely brushed aside petitioners' argument as one that ""only interrupts the orderly proceedings and wastes the time of the Honorable Court."" Too, in its Comment to the instant petition, the OSP hinged on the principle of presumption of regularity in the performance of its duties in an attempt at shifting to petitioners the burden of proving how the inordinate delay oppressed them. The present case involves only one transaction, i.e., the acquisition of one garbage compactor truck worth P380,000.00. It does not involve a review of voluminous documents, nor does it require an assiduous study of complex legal issues. The failure of the prosecution to provide an adequate explanation for the Ombudsman's inordinate delay in the conduct of the preliminary investigation all but confirms that there was indeed a violation of petitioners' constitutional right to the speedy disposition of the cases filed against them.","For violation of their constitutional right to speedy disposition of cases, the charges against petitioners MARIANO MALONES y MALIFICIO and EDNA M. MADARICO are ordered DISMISSED."
"G.R. No. 238910, July 20, 2022","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. PERLITA CASTRO URQUICO @ FHEY, CARLO VILLAVICENCIO, JR. @ BOYET, AND ELNORA EBO MANDELMA* @ LATHEA ESTEFANOS STELLIOS, ACCUSED, ELNORA EBO MANDELMA @ LATHEA ESTEFANOS STELLIOS, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","The facts (based on the testimonies of the prosecution's and defense's witnesses) as found by the lower courts, are as follows: Sometime in the months of November 2009 to May 2010, accused-appellant and her co-accused, Perlita Castro Urquico a.k.a. ""Fhey"" (Urquico), and Carlo Villavicencio, Jr. a.k.a. ""Boyet"" (Villavicencio), operating under Mheyman Manpower Agency (MMA), had a series of transactions that involved the collection of money from at least 31 individuals who were looking for employment abroad. However, despite paying all the supposed fees, none of these individuals were actually able to go abroad, and hence, resulted to the filing of several complaints against the accused trio. Five Informations charging the accused with violation of RA 8042 and Estafa under Article 315, par. 2 (a) of the RPC were filed by the Office of the Prosecutor, to wit: 1) Information dated November 2, 2010 in Criminal Case No. 17318 for violation of RA 8042; 2) Information dated November 2, 2010 in Criminal Case No. 17326 for Estafa under Article 315, par. 2(a), RPC (Lopez case); 3) Information dated November 2, 2010 in Criminal Case No. 17327 for Estafa under Article 315, par. 2(a), RPC (Lozano case); 4) Information dated November 2, 2010 in Criminal Case No. 17332 for Estafa under Article 315, par. 2(a), RPC (Calma case); and 5) Information dated November 2, 2010 in Criminal Case No. 17346 for Estafa under Article 315, par. 2(a), RPC (Galendez case). Upon arraignment on April 25, 2011, accused-appellant, with assistance of counsel, pleaded not guilty in Criminal Case Nos. 17318 to 17349. The RTC, upon motion of the prosecution and without objection from the defense, also ordered that these cases be tried jointly. Thereafter, trial ensued. On February 15, 2012, the RTC granted accused-appellant's Motion for Leave of Court to File Demurrer to Prosecution's Evidence, which she filed on February 9, 2012. On March 6, 2012, accused-appellant filed a Demurrer to Evidence (With Leave of Court) to which the prosecution filed its Comment/Opposition (To Demurrer to Evidence) arguing that it established accused-appellant's guilt for violation of RA 8042 and Estafa. On March 16, 2012, the RTC issued an Order denying accused-appellant's demurrer to evidence in Criminal Case Nos. 17318, 17326, 17327, 17332, and 17346. However, in the same Order, the RTC granted her demurrer to evidence in Criminal Case Nos. 17319 to 17325, 17328 to 17331, 17332 to 17345, and 17347 to 17349, dismissing said cases only as to her. The dispositive portion of the Order reads: VIEWED IN THE LIGHT OF THE FOREGOING, the Demurrer to Evidence is DENIED in as (sic) Criminal Case Nos. 17318, 17326, 17327, 17332, and 17346. There being no evidence presented against accused Elnora Ebo Mandelma in Criminal Case Nos. 17319 to 17325, 17328 to 17331, 17333 to 17345, and 17347 to 17349, the Demurrer to Evidence is GRANTED and the said cases are ordered DISMISSED only as against accused Elnora Ebo Mandelma. Considering that the other accused - Perlita Castro Urquico @ 'Fhey' and Carlo Villavicencio Jr. @ 'Boyet' are at large and Alias Warrants of Arrest were already issued against them, let Criminal Case Nos. 17319 to 17325, 17328 to 17331, 17333 to 17345, and 17347 to 17349 be sent to the archives subject to their revival upon apprehension of the said accused or their voluntary surrender to this Court. x x x x SO ORDERED. The prosecution did not object to the dismissal of the above cases against accused-appellant. During trial, the prosecution presented Bienvenida R. Galendez (Galendez), Saigee C. Lozano (Lozano), Arnold M. Lopez (Lopez), Andy M. Calma (Calma), and Ferdinand Jose E. Merrera (Merrera) as witnesses. Testimony of Galendez Galendez, the private complainant in Criminal Case No. 17346, testified that on February 2, 2010, a certain ""Mang Kiting,"" supposedly an agent, accompanied Galendez to MMA, an overseas recruitment agency in San Fernando City, Pampanga. There, she met Urquico who informed her of a job opening in Cyprus, and that their broker is a certain ""Lathea,"" later identified as accused-appellant. Accused-appellant will bring their documents to Manila and look for work in Cyprus for the applicants. Urquico asked Galendez to pay MMA a total of P52,000.00 in order for her to secure employment in Cyprus. On three separate instances from February 4 to March 10, 2010, Galendez was able to pay a total of P34,000.00 to MMA, and during all three instances, Villavicencio was beside Urquico while she was preparing the receipts. On June 11, 2010, Galendez was in MMA and saw accused-appellant for the first time. Galendez thought accused-appellant was a foreigner as the latter looked like one and spoke the English language. After hearing stories from other applicants that MMA was a fake entity, Galendez requested for a refund of her money from Urquico. Nevertheless, Galendez was not able to get a refund because Urquico and Villavicencio were arrested on July 5, 2010 when the matter was brought to attention of the television program ""Imbestigador."" Galendez was not able to go to Cyprus for employment and hence, filed the instant complaint against the accused. Testimony of Lozano Lozano is the private complainant in Criminal Case No. 17327. On December 9, 2009, he paid Urquico P16,500.00 for processing and transmittal fees although the acknowledgement receipt only shows P13,800.00. Additionally, on December 24, 2009, in the presence of accused-appellant, Lozano paid Urquico and Villavicencio P35,000.00 for the plane ticket, as reflected in the acknowledgement receipt issued on the same date. On December 27, 2009, he was with other applicants in the house of Urquico and Villavicencio in San Fernando City, Pampanga. Accused-appellant arrived and she was introduced as a broker named ""Lathea Estefanos Stellios."" Accused-appellant spoke in English and carried a bag containing a list of all applicants, his name included. However, Lozano was also not able to go to Cyprus as promised, and thus filed a complaint against the accused. Testimony of Lopez Lopez is the private complainant in Criminal Case No. 17326. Sometime in October 2009, he met ""Fhey"" and her spouse ""Boyet,"" later identified as Urquico, and Villavicencio, respectively, at their house in front of Camp Olivas in San Fernando City, Pampanga. Urquico allegedly offered Lopez a job in Cyprus as a grape-picker with a salary of $23.00 per hour, excluding overtime. On December 27, 2009, at around 9:00 to 10:00 a.m., Lopez, along with other applicants were gathered in the house of Urquico as they were told that accused-appellant, who was later introduced to them as the broker and recruiter, would meet them for contract signing. On that occasion, Lopez, paid P51,500.00 to Urquico who counted it and afterwards, gave the same to accused-appellant. This was supported by two Acknowledgement Receipts. Accused-appellant spoke in English when she told Lopez that he is one of the applicants who would undergo a Pre-Departure Orientation Seminar (PDOS) the next day. Villavicencio was the one in charge of the applicants undergoing medical examination for the PDOS. As with the other private complainants, Lopez was not able to go and work in Cyprus. Thus, Lopez filed the instant complaint. Testimony of Calma Calma is the private complainant in Criminal Case No. 17332. He was likewise informed by a ""Mang Kiting"" that the group of ""Fhey"" was recruiting people to work abroad. Sometime in November 2009, Calma went to the house of Urquico, who was then known to him as ""Fhey."" Urquico informed him and the other applicants present that they were recruiting people to become fruit-pickers in Cyprus at a rate of $23.00 per hour, but the applicants would need to pay for the processing of their papers. Accused-appellant, who was introduced to the applicants as ""Lathea,"" and Villavicencio, who was then known as Urquico's spouse ""Boyet,"" were also present. On December 9, 2009, Calma paid Urquico P16,500.00, and P34,500.00, as supported by two acknowledgement receipts. Calma later paid the balance of P500.00 on January 9, 2010, as shown in an acknowledgement receipt with the same date. On December 27, 2009, Calma signed his contract and was advised to wait, but he was not able to go to Cyprus. Thus, he filed the instant complaint. Testimony of Merrera Merrera, a Senior Labor and Employment Officer of the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA), Satellite Office III, San Fernando City, Pampanga, testified that among his functions is to give legal assistance to victims of illegal recruitment, which is the subject matter of Criminal Case No. 17318. Merrera testified that Director Melchor B. Dizon (Dir. Dizon), the POEA Director for Licensing and Adjudication Branch, issued a certification dated May 25, 2011 stating the following, among others: This is to certify that based on available records of this Office, MHEYMAN MANPOWER INTERNATIONAL, with office address at 94 Gil Puyat Avenue, Makati City, represented by Elena M. Buenaventura, Proprietor, is a landbased agency whose licence is valid until September 21, 2010. It is further clarified that Perlita Urquico a.k.a. Perlita Ramos, Claro Aniceta Villavicencio Jr., Lathea Estefanos Stellios are not included in the list of employees submitted to this office by the above agency. Moreover, the agency has no registered branch office m San Fernando City, Pampanga. Merrera claimed that he is familiar with Dir. Dizon's signature, having already received multiple certifications from the latter. Furthermore, Merrera personally verified in their system whether the persons mentioned in the certification were licensed or not, but he found no records of them having authority to recruit workers for overseas employment. Version of the Defense For her defense, accused-appellant maintained that she is not one and the same person as ""Lathea Estefanos Stellios."" She denied having known or even seen any of her co-accused and the private complainants. It was only during trial that she saw complainants for the first time. She is not familiar with MMA, and that she did not promise employment abroad to private complainants. Aside from invoking the defense of denial, accused-appellant also presented an alibi. She alleged that she was not in the house of Urquico on December 27, 2009 because she was at Cambatutay and Rama Islands, Samar from December 15 or 17, 2009 until January 6, 2010. She also denied having been present at the MMA office on June 11, 2010 because she was at Santiago City at the time.","On September 14, 2017, the CA rendered a Decision denying accused-appellant's appeal and affirming the RTC Joint Decision with modification. The CA held that as to the crime of Illegal Recruitment, all the elements of the same were established by the prosecution. Moreover, since it was also established that the Illegal Recruitment was committed against three or more persons, the CA ruled that the crime was Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale and thus, the penalty imposed by the RTC was proper. As to the four counts of Estafa, the CA also affirmed accused-appellant's conviction as all the elements of the same were proven by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt. However, the CA modified the penalty imposed by the RTC. The dispositive portion reads as follows: WHEREFORE, the Appeal is DENIED. We AFFIRM with MODIFICATIONS the January 16, 2014 Joint Decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 41, San Fernando City, Pampanga to read as follows: 1) In Criminal Case No. 17318 (Illegal Recruitment), the Court finds accused-appellant Elnora Ebo Mandelma alias ""Lathea Estefanos Stellios"" GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Illegal Recruitment committed in Large Scale, constituting economic sabotage, as defined and penalized in Sections 6 and 7(b) of Republic Act No. 8042, as amended.

Galendez the amount of Fifty One Thousand Five Hundred Pesos (Php 51,500.00) with legal interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from November 2, 2010, until such amount is fully paid; 6) Accused-appellant Elnora Ebo Mandelma alias ""Lathea Estefanos Stellios"" shall pay the costs of suit. SO ORDERED.","Our Ruling There is no merit in this appeal. The prosecution has successfully established accused-appellant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale (Criminal Case No. 17318) Article 13(6) of the Labor Code defines recruitment and placement as ""any act of canvassing, enlisting, contracting, transporting, utilizing, hiring or procuring workers, and includes referrals, contract services, promising or advert1smg for employment, locally or abroad, whether for profit or not."" Illegal recruitment, on the other hand is defined under Article 38 of the Labor Code as follows: ART. 38. Illegal Recruitment. (a) Any recruitment activities, including the prohibited practices enumerated under Article 34 of this Code, to be undertaken by non-licensees or non-holders of authority shall be deemed illegal and punishable under Article 39 of this Code. The Department of Labor and Employment or any law enforcement officer may initiate complaints under this Article. (b) Illegal recruitment when committed by a syndicate or in large scale shall be considered an offense involving economic sabotage and shall be penalized in accordance with Article 39 hereof. Illegal recruitment is deemed committed by a syndicate if carried out by a group of three (3) or more persons conspiring and/or confederating with one another in carrying out any unlawful or illegal transaction, enterprise or scheme defined under the first paragraph hereof. Illegal recruitment is deemed committed in large scale if committed against three (3) or more persons individually or as a group. (c) The Secretary of Labor and Employment or his duly authorized representatives shall have the power to cause the arrest and detention of such non-licensee or non-holder of authority if after investigation it is determined that his activities constitute a danger to national security and public order or will lead to further exploitation of job-seekers. The Secretary shall order the search of the office or premises and seizure of documents, paraphernalia, properties and other implements used in illegal recruitment activities and the closure of companies, establishments and entities found to be engaged in the recruitment of workers for overseas employment, without having been licensed or authorized to do so. Illegal recruitment, as defined under Article 38 of the Labor Code, encompasses recruitment activities for both local and overseas employment. However, illegal recruitment under this article is limited to recruitment activities undertaken by non-licensees or non-holders of authority. Thus, under the Labor Code, to constitute Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale, three elements must concur: 1. The accused undertook any recruitment activity defined under Art. 13 (b) or any prohibited practice enumerated under Art. 34 of the Labor Code. 2. He did not have the license or the authority to lawfully engage in the recruitment and placement of workers. 3. He committed the same against three or more persons, individually or as a group. RA 8042, otherwise known as the ""Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act of 1995,"" established a higher standard of protection and promotion of the welfare of the migrant workers, their families and overseas Filipinos in distress. RA 8042 also broadened the concept of illegal recruitment for overseas employment and increased the penalties, especially for Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale and Illegal Recruitment Committed by a Syndicate, which are considered offenses involving economic sabotage. Part II of RA 8042 defines and penalizes illegal recruitment for employment abroad, whether undertaken by a non-licensee or non-holder of authority or by a licensee or holder of authority. Section 6 of RA 8042 defines illegal recruitment, while Section 7 enumerates the penalties therefor, thus: SEC. 6. Definition. - For purposes of this Act, illegal recruitment shall mean any act of canvassing, enlisting, contracting, transporting, utilizing, hiring, or procuring workers and includes referring, contract services, promising or advertising for employment abroad, whether for profit or not, when undertaken by a non-licensee or non-holder of authority contemplated under Article 13(f) of Presidential Decree No. 442, as amended, otherwise known as the Labor Code of the Philippines: Provided, That any such non-licensee or non-holder who, in any manner, offers or promises for a fee employment abroad for two or more persons shall be deemed so engaged. It shall likewise include the following acts, whether committed by any person, whether a non-licensee, non-holder, licensee or holder of authority: (a) To charge or accept directly or indirectly any amount greater than that specified in the schedule of allowable fees prescribed by the Secretary of Labor and Employment, or to make a worker pay any amount greater than that actually received by him as a loan or advance; (b) To furnish or publish any false notice or information or document in relation to recruitment or employment; (c) To give any false notice, testimony, information or document or commit any act of misrepresentation for the purpose of securing a license or authority under the Labor Code; (d) To induce or attempt to induce a worker already employed to quit his employment in order to offer him another unless the transfer is designed to liberate a worker from oppressive terms and conditions of employment; (e) To influence or attempt to influence any person or entity not to employ any worker who has not applied for employment through his agency; (f) To engage in the recruitment or placement of workers in jobs harmful to public health or morality or to the dignity of the Republic of the Philippines; (g) To obstruct or attempt to obstruct inspection by the Secretary of Labor and Employment or by his duly authorized representative; (h) To fail to submit reports on the status of employment, placement vacancies, remittance of foreign exchange earnings, separation from jobs, departures and such other matters or information as may be required by the Secretary of Labor and Employment; (i) To substitute or alter to the prejudice of the worker, employment contracts approved and verified by the Department of Labor and Employment from the time of actual signing thereof by the parties up to and including the period of the expiration of the same without the approval of the Department of Labor and Employment; (j) For an officer or agent of a recruitment or placement agency to become an officer or member of the Board of any corporation engaged in travel agency or to be engaged directly or indirectly in the management of a travel agency; (k) To withhold or deny travel documents from applicant workers before departure for monetary or financial considerations other than those authorized under the Labor Code and its implementing rules and regulations; (l) Failure to actually deploy without valid reason as determined by the Department of Labor and Employment; and (m) Failure to reimburse expenses incurred by the worker in connection with his documentation and processing for purposes of deployment, in cases where the deployment does not actually take place without the worker's fault. Illegal recruitment when committed by a syndicate or in large scale shall be considered an offense involving economic sabotage. Illegal recruitment is deemed committed by a syndicate if carried out by a group of three (3) or more persons conspiring or confederating with one another. It is deemed committed in large scale if committed against three (3) or more persons individually or as a group. The persons liable for the above offenses are the principals, accomplices and accessories. In case of juridical persons, the officers having control, management or direction of their business shall be liable. SEC. 7 of RA 8042, as amended by Section 6 of RA 10022 provides for the penalties, thus: (a) x x x (b) The penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of not less than Two million pesos (P2,000,000.00) or more than Five million pesos (P5,000,000.00) shall be imposed if illegal recruitment constitutes economic sabotage as defined herein. Provided, however, That the maximum penalty shall be imposed if the person illegally recruited is less than eighteen (18) years of age or committed by a non-licensee or non-holder of authority x x x As applied in this case, the records would show that the prosecution has indeed proven beyond reasonable doubt each of the elements constituting the crime of Illegal Recruitment of a Large Scale as follows: (1) Regarding the first element that the accused undertook any recruitment activity defined under Article 13(b), or any prohibited practice enumerated under Article 34 of the Labor Code, the prosecution was able to prove through the testimony of its witnesses that accused-appellant was introduced by her co-accused as the job broker for Cyprus, ""Lathea Estefanos Stellios."" Under this fake identity, accused-appellant committed various overt acts of recruitment such as giving orders to her co-accused to check the names of applicants who already paid, calling the names of applicants who will undergo PDOS, giving a supposed contract to the applicants for their signature and collecting it afterwards, and even writing the names of applicants ready for deployment, among other things. There is no doubt that accused-appellant participated in recruitment or placement activities. (2) For the second element, it was satisfactorily established that accused-appellant clearly did not have a license or authority to lawfully engage in the recruitment and placement of workers. Merrera, a Senior Labor and Employment Officer of the POEA, Satellite Office III, San Fernando City, Pampanga, testified that Dir. Dizon, POEA's Director for Licensing and Adjudication Branch, issued a certification dated May 25, 2011 stating the following, among others: This is to certify that based on available records of this Office, MHEYMAN MANPOWER INTERNATIONAL, with office address at 94 Gil Puyat Avenue, Makati City, represented by Elena M. Buenaventura, Proprietor, is a landbased agency whose licence is valid until September 21, 2010. It is further clarified that Perlita Urquico a.k.a. Perlita Ramos, Claro Aniceta Villavicencio, Jr., Lathea Estefanos Stellios are not included in the list of employees submitted to this office by the above agency. Moreover, the agency has no registered branch office in San Fernando City, Pampanga. Aside from this public document issued by the POEA, Merrera also testified that he personally verified in their system whether the persons mentioned in the certification were licensed or not, but he found no records of them having authority to recruit workers for overseas employment. Clearly, the prosecution was able to show that accused-appellant and her cohorts have no lawful authority to engage in recruitment and placement activities. (3) Lastly, the prosecution has established that there were at least four victims in this case – Galendez, Lozano, Lopez, and Calma. Estafa (Criminal Case Nos. 17326, 17327, 17332, 17346) It is established that a person, for the same acts, may be convicted separately for Illegal Recruitment under RA 8042 (or under the Labor Code) and Estafa under Article 315, par. 2 (a) of the RPC. Article 315, par. 2 (a) of the RPC provides: Article 315. Swindling (estafa). — Any person who shall defraud another by any of the means mentioned herein below x x x x x x 2. By means of any of the following false pretenses or fraudulent acts executed prior to or simultaneously with the commission of the fraud: (a) By using fictitious name, or falsely pretending to possess power, influence, qualifications, property, credit, agency, business or imaginary transactions, or by means of other similar deceits. Arias v. People enumerated the following elements of this kind of Estafa. The elements of estafa under Article 315, paragraph 2(a) of the RPC, are the following: That there must be a false pretense, fraudulent act or fraudulent means; That such false pretense, fraudulent act or fraudulent means must be made or executed prior to or simultaneously with the commission of the fraud; That the offended party must have relied on the false pretense, fraudulent act, or fraudulent means, that is, he was induced to part with his money or property because of the false pretense, fraudulent act or fraudulent means; and That as a result thereof, the offended party suffered damage. In this case, all the elements of Estafa are present. The testimonies of the private complainants, coupled with the documentary and object evidence, demonstrated that accused-appellant, under the false pretense of being a legitimate overseas worker recruiter, fraudulently induced private complainants to part with their money as part of the supposed recruitment process. Given that none of the private complainants was deployed abroad as they were just being scammed, they clearly suffered damage. The RTC and the CA were correct in finding that accused-appellant deceived private complainants into believing that she had the authority and capability to send them to Cyprus for employment. Particularly, the RTC aptly found that Mandelma used a fictitious-sounding name, ""Lathea Estefanos Stellos,"" to conceal her true identity and spoke English with a feigned foreign accent or diction to induce private complainants, who relied on these false pretenses, to part with their money amounting to P51,500.00 each in exchange for the promise of future work abroad. However, this promise of overseas employment was never fulfilled. Mandelma's defenses of denial and alibi failed to overturn the positive and categorical testimonies of the prosecution's witnesses It must be reiterated that the factual findings of the trial court, especially those which revolve around matters of credibility of witnesses deserve to be respected when no glaring errors bordering on a gross misapprehension of the facts, or where no speculative, arbitrary and unsupported conclusions, can be gleaned from such findings. The evaluation of the credibility of witnesses and their testimonies are best undertaken by the trial court because of its unique opportunity to observe the witnesses' deportment, demeanor, conduct, and attitude under grueling examination. Such findings of the trial court are even more convincing when affirmed by the CA, as in this case. With the above in mind, the Court finds that the RTC correctly held that the bare denial of accused-appellant must yield to the categorical statements of the prosecution witnesses. Jurisprudence has held that denial and alibi as defenses are negative and self-serving evidence undeserving of weight in law, unless substantiated by clear and convincing evidence. It is considered with suspicion and always received with caution, not only because they are inherently weak and unreliable, but also because they are easily fabricated and concocted. As applied in this case, accused-appellant was not able to present any clear and convincing evidence to support her self-serving statements. In fact, she did not even present any other witness to corroborate her alibi that she was not in the house of Urquico on December 27, 2009 because she was in Samar, and that she was not in the MMA office on January 11, 2010 because she was at Santiago City. If she was confident in the truth of her statements, there is no reason as to why she could not even present another witness to vouch for her presence or absence. Moreover, there is no proof of ill intent on the part of the private complainants to falsely impute the crime charged against the accused. Verily, accused-appellant's self-serving testimonies without any other corroborating evidence cannot overcome the positive testimonies of the prosecution's witnessess that were corroborated by the other evidence on record, i.e., acknowledgement receipts. Accused-appellant's denial and alibi are nothing but a desperate attempt to escape the clutches of the law. Penalty As to the penalty to be imposed, this Court finds the modifications made by the CA to the RTC Decision to be outdated. RA 10951 which was enacted into law on August 29, 2017, already amended Article 315 of the RPC. Particularly, Section 85 of RA 10951 provides: Section 85. Article 315 of the same Act, as amended by Republic Act No. 4885, Presidential Decree No. 1689, and Presidential Decree No. 818, is hereby further amended to read as follows: Art. 315. Swindling (estafa). - Any person who shall defraud another by any of the means mentioned hereinbelow shall be punished by: 1st. The penalty of prisión correccional in its maximum period to prisión mayor in its minimum period, if the amount of the fraud is over Two million four hundred thousand pesos (P2,400,000) but does not exceed Four million four hundred thousand pesos (P4,400,000), and if such amount exceeds the latter sum, the penalty provided in this paragraph shall be imposed in its maximum period, adding one year for each additional Two million pesos (P2,000,000); but the total penalty which may be imposed shall not exceed twenty years. In such cases, and in connection with the accessory penalties which may be imposed and for the purpose of the other provisions of this Code, the penalty shall be termed prisión mayor or reclusion temporal, as the case may be. 2nd. The penalty of prisión correccional in its minimum and medium periods, if the amount of the fraud is over One million two hundred thousand pesos (P1,200,000) but does not exceed Two million four hundred thousand pesos (P2,400,000). 3rd. The penalty of arresto mayor in its maximum period to prisión correccional in its minimum period, if such amount is over Forty thousand pesos (P40,000) but does not exceed One million two hundred thousand pesos (P1,200,000). 4th. By arresto mayor in its medium and maximum periods, if such amount does not exceed Forty thousand pesos (P40,000): Provided, That in the four cases mentioned, the fraud be committed by any of the following means: 1. With unfaithfulness or abuse of confidence, namely: (a) altering the substance, quantity, or quality of anything of value which the offender shall deliver by virtue of an obligation to do so, even though such obligation be based on an immoral or illegal consideration. (b) By misappropriating or converting, to the prejudice of another, money, goods, or any other personal property received by the offender in trust or on commission, or for administration, or under any other obligation involving the duty to make delivery of or to return the same, even though such obligation be totally or partially guaranteed by a bond; or by denying having received such money, goods, or other property. (c) By taking undue advantage of the signature of the offended party in blank, and by writing any document above such signature in blank, to the prejudice of the offended party or any third person. 2. By means of any of the following false pretenses or fraudulent acts executed prior to or simultaneously with the commission of the fraud: (a) By using fictitious name, or falsely pretending to possess power, influence, qualifications, property, credit, agency, business or imaginary transactions, or by means of other similar deceits. (b) By altering the quality, fineness or weight of anything pertaining to his art or business. (c) By pretending to have bribed any Government employee, without prejudice to the action for calumny which the offended party may deem proper to bring against the offender. In this case, the offender shall be punished by the maximum period of the penalty. (d) By postdating a check, or issuing a check in payment of an obligation when the offender had no funds in the bank, or his funds deposited therein were not sufficient to cover the amount of the check. The failure of the drawer of the check to deposit the amount necessary to cover his check within three (3) days from receipt of notice from the bank and/or the payee or holder that said check has been dishonored for lack or insufficiency of funds shall be prima facie evidence of deceit constituting false pretense or fraudulent act. Any person who shall defraud another by means of false pretenses or fraudulent acts as defined in paragraph 2(d) hereof shall be punished by: 1st The penalty of reclusion temporal in its maximum period, if the amount of fraud is over Four million four hundred thousand pesos (P4,400,000) but does not exceed Eight million eight hundred thousand pesos (P8,800,000). If the amount exceeds the latter, the penalty shall be reclusion perpetua. 2nd. The penalty of reclusion temporal in its minimum and medium periods, if the amount of the fraud is over Two million four hundred thousand pesos (P2,400,000) but does not exceed Four million four hundred thousand pesos (P4,400,000). 3rd. The penalty of prisión mayor in its maximum period, if the amount of the fraud is over One million two hundred thousand pesos (P1,200,000) but does not exceed Two million four hundred thousand pesos (P2,400,000). 4th. The penalty of prisión mayor in its medium period, if such amount is over Forty thousand pesos (P40,000) but does not exceed One million two hundred thousand pesos (P1,200,000). 5th. By prisión mayor in its minimum period, if such amount does not exceed Forty thousand pesos (P40,000). 3. Through any of the following fraudulent means: (a) By inducing another, by means of deceit, to sign any document. (b) By resorting to some fraudulent practice to insure success in a gambling game. (c) By removing, concealing or destroying, in whole or in part, any court record, office files, document or any other papers. In this case, the total amount defrauded is P51,500.00, and thus, pursuant to the above provision, the penalty prescribed is arresto mayor in its maximum period to prisión correccional in its minimum period, as the amount is over P40,000 but does not exceed P1,200,000. Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law (ISL), the Court is guided by its disposition in People v. Dejolde, Jr., which also involved the application of RA 10951 vis-a-vis the third paragraph of Article 315, as amended, to wit: However, in view of the recent enactment of RA 10951, there is a need to modify the penalties imposed by the CA insofar as the two counts of estafa, docketed as Criminal Case Nos. 27592-R and 27602-R, are concerned. For committing estafa involving the amounts of [P]440,000.00 and [P]350,000.00, Article 315 of the RPC, as amended by RA 10951, now provides that the penalty of arresto mayor in its maximum period to prision correccional in its minimum period shall be imposed if the amount involved is over [P]40,000.00 but does not exceed [P]1,200,000.00. There being no mitigating and aggravating circumstance, the maximum penalty should be one (1) year and one (1) day of prision correccional. Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the minimum term of the indeterminate sentence is arresto mayor in its minimum and medium periods, the range of which is one (1) month and one (1) day to four (4) months. Thus, the indeterminate penalty for each count of estafa should be modified to a prison term of two (2) months and one (1) day of arresto mayor, as minimum, to one (1) year and one (1) day of prision correccional, as maximum. In addition, an interest rate of 6% [per] annum is likewise imposed on the amounts of [P]440,000.00 and [P]350,000.00 from the date of finality of this Resolution until full payment. Thus, in Criminal Case Nos. 17326, 17327, 17332, and 17346, considering that there are no mitigating or aggravating circumstances present, accused-appellant is sentenced to suffer an indeterminate penalty of two (2) months and one (1) day of arresto mayor, as minimum, to one (1) year and one (1) day of prision correccional, as maximum.","WHEREFORE, the appeal is hereby DISMISSED. The September 14, 2017 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR HC No. 07170 is AFFIRMED WITH MODIFICATIONS that, insofar as Criminal Case Nos. 17326, 17327, 17332, and 17346, accused-appellant Elnora Ebo Mandelma @ Lathea Estefanos Stellios, is sentenced to suffer the indeterminate penalty of two (2) months and one (1) day of arresto mayor, as minimum, to one (1) year and (1) day of prision correccional, as maximum, is hereby imposed for each count of Estafa. SO ORDERED."

INOY, COURT STENOGRAPHER III, BRANCH 266, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, TAGUIG CITY, RESPONDENT.","Complainant alleged that she is the legal wife of respondent as evidenced by their Certificate of Marriage. On February 16, 2018, while complainant was browsing their laptop, she saw romantic and intimate photographs of respondent and his alleged mistress named Mary Ann. Complainant also saw a sex video involving the two. She confronted respondent about what she saw and the latter allegedly admitted that it was indeed him in the photographs and video. Respondent in his Comment denied the charge and asserted that the photographs were taken by complainant from his Google account without his knowledge and consent. He further asserted that the photographs and screenshots were inadmissible in evidence as these were obtained in violation of his constitutional right to privacy of communication and correspondence. Respondent explained that Mary Ann was one of his business partners and coaches at Unlimited Network of Opportunities, Inc., and their relationship was purely professional. On November 20, 2018, the complainant filed an Affidavit of Desistance requesting the dismissal of the case she filed against respondent, alleging that whatever transpired between her and respondent was due to misunderstanding and misapprehension of facts. The Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) issued a letter informing complainant that the Affidavit of Desistance could not be given due course. The case was transmitted to the Judicial Integrity Board (JIB). The JIB held that the totality of the evidence presented by complainant established respondent's illicit affair with Mary Ann and was sufficient to hold respondent guilty of Disgraceful and Immoral Conduct.","The Court adopts the findings of the JIB with modification in view of the Further Amendments to Rule 140 of the Rules of Court issued on February 22, 2022.

"G.R. No. 248675, July 20, 2022","CLAUDINE MONETTE BALDOVINO-TORRES, PETITIONER, VS. JASPER A. TORRES AND THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENTS.","Claudine and Jasper met in the year 2000 through text messaging. They learned that they had common friends and had met before at a party. Eventually, they were drawn to each other and started to go on dates. After a few months, they got romantically involved until Claudine became pregnant with their child, Justin Clyde Baldovino Torres (Justin).[6] Despite the initial objection from Claudine's mother, the couple got married on July 10, 2002 before Judge Encarnacion Jaja Moya‐Balbastro of Branch 62, RTC, Makati City. Thereafter, they lived with Jasper's family at San Pedro, Laguna.[7] Early on in their married life, Claudine began to notice Jasper's strong attachment with his friends as he would often go out with them until the wee hours of the morning. Jobless, he would always wake up around noontime and rely solely on the support of his parents who owned a sari-sari store.[8] On December 5, 2002, Claudine decided to go back to school after the birth of their son, Justin. She took up Mass Communications at St. Scholastica's College where she graduated with distinction. On the other hand, Jasper finished a certification course in culinary arts. He got a job as a cook in Boracay, but he quit his job only after two weeks. Subsequently, he was able to get a two-year contract to work in Dubai; he also quit his job after only three months.[9] Jasper continued to live a carefree life. His drinking habits worsened: when drunk, he would force Claudine to have sex that the latter felt like being raped. He had likewise become increasingly aggressive towards Claudine. In the meantime, both continued to depend on Jasper's parents because he refused to work elsewhere; he reasoned that his parents would not let them go hungry.[10] Eventually, Claudine decided to leave him. She left their son with Jasper's parents to work in Manila. Later on, she went to Singapore. Her efforts to reconcile with Jasper proved to be futile as she later learned that Jasper had a child with another woman.[11] The antecedents prompted Claudine to file a Petition for Declaration of Nullity of Marriage under Article 36 of the Family Code[12] against Jasper before the RTC. In addition to Claudine's testimony in court, the following also testified: Nora Ng Baldovino (Nora), Claudine's mother; and Clinical Psychologist Nedy Tayag (Dr. Tayag). Nora testified that she was displeased when her daughter married Jasper because both of them were still studying during that time. She also described Jasper as irresponsible, both as a husband and father, as he depended too much on his parents.[13] On the other hand, Dr. Tayag testified that she was able to conduct a series of psychological evaluations on both Claudine and Jasper and that based on her observations and the results of the tests which she administered on them, she found Jasper to be suffering from Antisocial Personality Disorder. Dr. Tayag described the disorder as a pervasive pattern of disregard for and violation of the rights of others as shown by impulsivity, irresponsible attitude, and lack of regard for others.[14] Moreover, Dr. Tayag stated that Jasper was short-sighted, incautious, and imprudent; that he failed to plan for himself and his family and did not consider alternatives or heed consequences; and that Jasper was untrustworthy and unreliable as he failed to meet personal obligations of a marital, parental, occupational, or financial nature.[15] Dr. Tayag further averred that, in her opinion, Jasper's condition has been ingrained in his core personality since childhood. He developed his antisocial, unruly, and carefree ways because of parental attachment and the kind of home environment in which he grew up.[16] Jasper's mother smothered him with affection and she would get furious at his father for scolding Jasper. This arrangement had amplified Jasper's feelings of entitlement and importance as he has always felt that he had the support of his mother no matter what he does.[17] In addition, because his father was often away to manage their store in Makati City, there was no one to balance his mother's leniency. Thus, Jasper went on to live his life in a manner that is pleasure-seeking, disregarding the rules and norms of the society for the sake of the fulfillment of his desires and other caprices.[18] In sum, Dr. Tayag maintained that Jasper's psychological incapacity is grave, serious, chronic, severe, and incurable by any form of treatment. She recommended that the marriage between Jasper and Claudine be declared null and void as it was doomed from the start.[19]","The Court grants the petition. On the procedural issue that the Motion for Reconsideration was filed out of time in the RTC. The Court finds no merit in the contention that the OSG filed its Motion for Reconsideration out of time in the RTC. The period to file a motion for reconsideration in the present case should be counted from the receipt by the OSG of a copy of the RTC Decision on April 4, 2017. Consequently, the filing by the OSG of its Motion for Reconsideration questioning the RTC Decision on April 18, 2017 was well within the reglementary period for filing such motion. The totality of evidence sufficiently proves the psychological incapacity of Jasper to comply with his essential marital obligations. Applying the ruling in Andal in the case, the Court finds that the totality of evidence presented in the RTC sufficiently proves that Jasper is psychologically incapacitated to comply with his essential marital obligations. The psychological incapacity of Jasper was grave, incurable, and with juridical antecedence. All told, the Court finds that Claudine was able to prove with clear and convincing evidence that Jasper was psychologically incapacitated to perform his essential marital obligations. This renders their marriage void under Article 36 of the Family Code.","WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated March 22, 2019 and the Resolution dated July 9, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 109403 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

"G.R. No. 254552, July 20, 2022","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. RICO P. VALDELLON, LORENZO L. JACINTO,[1] JACINTO M. ILAGAN, DON THED J. RAMIREZ AND RENATO R. VEHEMENTE,[2] ACCUSED, DON THED J. RAMIREZ, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","Under RA 9136, otherwise known as the Electric Power Industry Reform Act of 2001, the Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation ("" PSALM "") is mandated to manage, among others, the orderly sale and disposition of the National Power Corporation (NAPOCOR) generation assets, real estate, and other disposable assets.
Pursuant to this mandate, PSALM issued Memorandum Order No. 2011-015 dated August 9, 2011 which created a Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) for the sale/disposal of waste oil located at the Sucat Thermal Power Plant ("" STPP ""). On November 3, 2011, the BAC conducted a Pre-Bid Conference for the sale/disposal of waste oil in STPP. The bidding involved pre-qualification (strict pass/fail criteria requiring submission of all documents, including the Environmental Compliance Certificate or ECC) and post-qualification (where the BAC members are vested with discretion).
On November 17, 2011, the BAC conducted its pre-qualification process. Far East was declared the highest bidder but was disqualified during the post-qualification stage because its Treatment, Storage, Disposal (TSD) plant facility did not meet PSALM requirements.
The second highest bidder, Joint Venture (composed of Genetron International Marketing, Atomillion Corporation, and Safeco Environmental Services, Inc.), advanced to the post-qualification process. The Joint Venture submitted an Amended ECC dated November 21, 2011, which reflected increased capacity. Although the Technical Working Group (TWG) initially recommended disqualification based on the Joint Venture's original ECC, the BAC studied the recommendation, held deliberations, and, based on a 2-1 vote (Jacinto and Ramirez voting yes, Ilagan voting no) and advice from PSALM Vice President Tolentino, resolved to accept the Amended ECC, declaring the Joint Venture post-qualified and recommending the award. The Notice of Award was issued on January 12, 2012.
Upon the complaint of Bensan Industries, Inc., Valdellon, Jacinto, Ilagan (whose case was dismissed due to death), Ramirez, and Vehemente were charged before the Sandiganbayan with violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019 for giving unwarranted benefit or advantage to the Joint Venture by accepting the Amended ECC belatedly submitted during the post-qualification stage. The defense maintained that the submission and acceptance of the Amended ECC were permissible under Clause 24.2(c) and 24.3 of the ITB, which allows the submission of ""Other appropriate licenses and permits required by law"" during the post-qualification stage, and that they acted in good faith based on expert advice and internal investigation reports which confirmed the acceptance was legally permissible. Ramirez appeals from the adverse judgment, arguing that he did not exhibit manifest partiality and the admission of the Amended ECC was sanctioned by the ITB, and that he should not be liable as a co-conspirator.","By its assailed Decision dated May 31, 2019, the Sandiganbayan found all the accused guilty of violation of Section 3 (e) of RA 3019, as amended, viz.: WHEREFORE , in light of all the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered finding accused Rico P. Valdellon, Lorenzo L. Jacinto, Don Thed J. Ramirez and Renato R. Vehenente a.k.a. Vehemente GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 3 (e) of R.A. No. 3019, as amended, and are hereby SENTENCED to suffer the indeterminate penalty of [six] (6) years and one (1) month, as minimum, to ten (10) years, as maximum, and to suffer perpetual disqualification from holding public office. SO ORDERED . The Sandiganbayan held that the prosecution established beyond reasonable doubt all the elements of violation of Section 3 (e) of RA 3019: (1) the accused is a public officer discharging administrative, judicial or official functions; (2) the accused acted with manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence; and (3) the accused caused undue injury to any party including the government, or gave any private party unwarranted benefits, advantage, or preference in the discharge of his or her functions. The court found all the accused gave unwarranted benefit, preference, and advantage to the Joint Venture when it allowed the submission of the Joint Venture's Amended ECC during the post-qualification stage. The Sandiganbayan ruled that by allowing the Joint Venture to belatedly submit an amended ECC, the BAC gave it an opportunity to enhance or improve its bid, enabling it to qualify. By Resolution dated August 25, 2020, the Sandiganbayan denied these motions for lack of merit.","The Supreme Court acquitted Appellant Ramirez and his co-accused. The Court found that the second element of Section 3 (e) of RA 3019—manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence—was absent. The BAC members, including Ramirez, engaged in extensive deliberations and sought expert advice (from PSALM Vice-President Atty. Conrad S. Tolentino) regarding the interpretation of ITB Clause 24.2(c), which allowed the submission of ""Other appropriate licenses and permits required by law and stated in the BDS"" during the post-qualification stage. The BAC’s decision to accept and consider the Amended ECC was a reasonable reliance in good faith on expert opinion and was consistent with an internal Task Force Investigation Report which concluded that the acceptance was ""well within the provisions of the ITB, BDS and SBB."" Since the Joint Venture had already informed the BAC of the pending amendment application during the pre-qualification stage, and the Amended ECC was approved before the next highest bidder (Far East) was disqualified, the submission was neither surreptitious nor manipulative, but rather necessary to provide the BAC with current, relevant data regarding the bidder’s capacity. The Court held that resolving a legitimate question of law, even if subject to differing interpretations among experts, when done with transparency and due diligence, does not constitute manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence. Consequently, the third element (undue injury or unwarranted benefit) was also absent, as the Joint Venture was entitled to the acceptance and consideration of its Amended ECC pursuant to the ITB terms, and the Joint Venture was otherwise qualified to perform the project.","ACCORDINGLY , the appeal is GRANTED . The Decision dated May 31, 2019 and Resolution dated August 25, 2020 of the Sandiganbayan in Criminal Case No. SB-15-CRM-0079 are REVERSED . Appellant DON THEO J. RAMIREZ and his co-accused, namely, RICO P. VALDELLON, LORENZO L. JACINTO, and RENATO R. VEHEMENTE are ACQUITTED on reasonable doubt. Let entry of judgment be issued immediately. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 250618, July 20, 2022","JENNIFER A. DEDICATORIA, PETITIONER, VS. FERDINAND M. DEDICATORIA AND REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENTS.","Jennifer and Ferdinand were married on December 20, 1995.[6] However, on October 23, 2014, Jennifer filed a Petition for Declaration of Nullity of Marriage[7] due to Ferdinand's psychological incapacity. Summons was served through substituted service, but Ferdinand failed to file an answer. The Office of the Solicitor General entered its appearance for the Republic of the Philippines (Republic), and deputized the Office of the City Prosecutor of Pasay City on its behalf. After investigation, the Assistant City Prosecutor found no collusion between the parties.[8] During trial, Jennifer testified that she noticed how irresponsible, immature, insensitive, self-centered, and dependent on his parents Ferdinand was, since they lived in her in-laws' residence after the exchange of vows. Ferdinand's mother continued to take care of him so he found no reason to look for a permanent job. She experienced how her in-laws' interests prevail over hers. She was also made to do all the household chores for Ferdinand's entire family. Distressed, she decided to leave and move in to her parents' house. But Ferdinand never visited her so she eventually decided to go back to her in-laws' house to be with Ferdinand. When she got pregnant, her father rented an apartment for her and Ferdinand to have their own place, but Ferdinand still opted to go to his parents' house every day and return to the apartment only at night. When confronted about it, Ferdinand reasoned: ""Ewan ko, hinahanap ko aruga ng nanay ko. Hindi ka naman katulad ng nanay ko. Dapat bumalik na tayo sa amin.""[9] After Jennifer gave birth, the couple returned to live with Ferdinand's family. Jennifer expected Ferdinand to change his ways for their baby, but her ordeal only became worse as Ferdinand remained unemployed and took no part in looking after their newborn. Distraught, Jennifer decided to move out with their son in 1999 for good and all. Like before, Ferdinand never visited them. Worse, she became completely estranged from her husband upon the passing of her mother-in-law. Later on, Jennifer discovered that Ferdinand was already living with another woman with whom he had sired a child.[10] To support her claim Jennifer presented the testimony of Dr. Sheila Marie O. Montefalcon (Montefalcon), a clinical psychologist who conducted psychological tests on her, as well as clinical interviews on Ferdinand's sister, Teresita Dedicatoria (Teresita), and the couple's long-time common friend, Anarose Talag-Aguirre (Anarose). Ferdinand was invited for a psychological assessment, but to no avail. With the available resources, Montefalcon diagnosed Ferdinand to be suffering from Dependent Personality Disorder, rendering him incapacitated to perform his marital obligations. Montefalcon described Ferdinand's psychological incapacity as follows: (1) grave for being chronic and pervasive, which made him socially immature, inflexible, and ill-equipped to perform his marital obligations; (2) incurable as it is deeply ingrained in his personality structure; and (3) with juridical antecedence as it roots from dysfunctional factors involved in his childhood, unreliable parenting style from figures around him, and unfavorable early life experiences, which affected his perceptions of himself and his environment.[11] Anarose was also presented in court. She testified that Jennifer and Ferdinand have not been living together since 1999 — this fact being privy to her as she has always been Jennifer's confidant. She also alleged that Jennifer usually takes refuge at her house every time the couple had altercations. As the couple's close friend, she claimed to have personally witnessed the breakdown of the marriage, Jennifer's emotional sufferings, and Ferdinand's neglect of his son. In brief, Anarose characterized Ferdinand as immature, irresponsible, and a ""mama's boy.""[12] No countervailing evidence was presented.[13]","On appeal, the CA found no sufficient evidence to prove the juridical antecedence, gravity, and incurability of Ferdinand's psychological incapacity. It found Jennifer's testimony and Montefalcon's Psychological Evaluation Report to have merely described Ferdinand's negative traits as grave without relating them to his inability to assume his essential marital obligations. Anent juridical antecedence, the CA ruled that Jennifer's allegations were self-serving and not supported by any evidence from an independent source. According to the appellate court, Anarose cannot be considered as independent source to prove that Ferdinand's psychological incapacity existed at the time of celebration of marriage because she only testified as to what transpired between the couple during their marriage. Lastly, the CA held that the psychologist's findings cannot be given weight as there was no statement that Ferdinand's Dependent Personality Disorder is medically or clinically permanent to satisfy the requisite incurability of the incapacity. Thus, in the assailed Decision dated May 31, 2019, the CA disposed: We REVERSE and SET ASIDE the Decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 109, Pasay City, dated 23 November 2015, in Civil Case No. R-PSY-14-18009-CV. Instead, we DISMISS the Petition filed before the Regional Trial Court, Branch 109, Pasay City. IT IS SO ORDERED.[19] Jennifer moved for reconsideration, but was denied in the CA's assailed Resolution[20] dated November 26, 2019.","The petition basically impels the Court to re-evaluate the pieces of evidence and resolve if they are sufficient to declare the marriage void ab initio due to Ferdinand's psychological incapacity. ... [T]he totality of clear and convincing evidence must be considered to determine that the essential requisites of the incapacity are satisfied. ... The Court rules in the affirmative. ... Jennifer's account of her experiences with Ferdinand, corroborated by the testimonies of the couple's long-time friend, Anarose, and the expert evaluation of Montefalcon who examined, not only Jennifer and Anarose, but also Teresita, clearly and convincingly prove that Ferdinand's incapacity to fulfill his marital and parental obligations are deeply-rooted from his childhood experiences carried on to his married life. ... As discussed earlier, proof of juridical antecedence may consist of testimonies of ordinary witnesses who have been present in the couple's life before marriage, and are competent to describe the environment where the alleged incapacitated spouse lived that may have led to the incapacity as manifested through [their] errant behavior. Thus, Teresita's narration on what could have given rise to her brother's psychological incapacity, as evaluated by an expert witness, should be a sufficient basis to determine juridical antecedence of Ferdinand's incapacity. We acknowledge Montefalcon's assessment, and find no reason to discredit her testimony on this matter. ... In all, the totality of evidence presented, comprising of Montefalcon's psychological report, and the testimonies of Jennifer and Anarose, sufficiently prove Ferdinand's psychological incapacity as contemplated under Article 36 of the Family Code, warranting the declaration of nullity of his marriage with Jennifer.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is GRANTED.

"G.R. No. 250287, July 20, 2022","ZETH D. FOPALAN, PETITIONER, VS. NEIL F. FOPALAN, RESPONDENT.","On June 25, 2013, petitioner Zeth D. Fopalan filed the petition[3] for declaration of nullity of her marriage to respondent Neil F. Fopalan. She alleged that she met respondent in college as they were both taking up Political Science at Arellano University. One day, respondent just grabbed her hand while she was walking and told her he was infatuated with her.[4] Thereafter, he started sending her love letters and roses. It took a couple of months before she and respondent became a couple but they soon broke up when she learned that respondent had another girlfriend.[5] Respondent later explained that he was actually dating five different women simultaneously because he was ""keeping his options open.""[6] After they broke up, she focused on her studies and entertained other suitors. After some time, she and respondent started talking again and overtime, they developed a mutual understanding. Even then, she knew that respondent was also seeing another girl, a certain Shirley, and their relationship had been going on for the past seven years.[7] Respondent confessed to her that he cannot break up with Shirley because the latter had threatened to commit suicide if he did. She (petitioner) also learned that respondent's mother disliked Shirley who worked as a helper to support her studies. Respondent's mother threatened to disinherit him if he married Shirley.[8] Despite respondent's other relationship, she (petitioner) continued to see him.[9] She and respondent eventually became sexually intimate but she never thought of demanding from respondent to break up with Shirley.[10] She just accepted the reality that sooner or later, respondent would have to choose between her and Shirley.[11] Shirley, however, got married to another man. This prompted respondent to follow her (petitioner) to her hometown in Dumaguete City where her mother had opened a school. Respondent decided to stay with her in Dumaguete and they lived with the school janitor and the latter's family.[12] Later on, her mother advised her that her live-in arrangement may not set a good influence to the students.[13] On August 7, 1995, she and respondent got married in church rites in Dumaguete City. After the wedding, she and respondent continued living in their family-owned school where they worked as canteen helpers and later, as office staff.[14] Much later, they moved to the petitioner's hometown in Romblon.[15] When her entire savings got depleted, she went back to Manila to look for a job. Respondent stayed in Romblon though.[16] When she found a job in Manila, she rented a small space where she lived alone.[17] Later on, she got lucky to land a job as a school teacher. She then rented a place in Sta. Mesa where she and respondent lived for two years. She was the only one working and earning while respondent took charge of the household.[18] Respondent, however, soon got tired of this arrangement so they decided to move back to Dumaguete City.[19] They went back to work in her family-owned school.[20] On October 16, 1999, she gave birth to their son, Matthew Joseph D. Fopalan (Matthew). But she got disappointed with how respondent hostile-treated their new born child. One time, he shook the infant to stop him from crying.[21] The child was later diagnosed with autism.[22] As soon as he learned of his son's autism, respondent's attitude toward the latter turned from bad to worse. He never played with his son though he always found time playing basketball with his co-workers every Saturday afternoon.[23] He would not even allow the child to switch channels whenever they happen to watch television together. Over the years, respondent would distance himself farther from the child.[24] He never bonded with his son. He even did bad things to the child, leaving an imprint in the latter's young and vulnerable mind. She could only cry in frustration and pray for respondent to change for the better.[25] Due to his neglect and indifference, she assumed the role of both mother and father to their child Matthew. Aside from his manifest inability to love and support his own son, respondent was also unfaithful to her. Sometime in 2011, she read a message on his phone: ""Ingat ka. I miss you. I love you.""[26] She suspected that the message came from a working student in their school.[27] She also found a photo of a naked teen girl in his phone.[28] But her desire to preserve their marriage prevailed so she just ignored these things and focused instead on taking care of Matthew.[29] She also adopted another child so Matthew will have a brother and a playmate.[30] Then, she read yet another message from respondent's phone: ""Alam mo naman mahal kita 18 years na.""[31] Right off, it dawned upon her that respondent was a hopeless case. He would never change. She confronted him about his attitude and his illicit affairs.[32] But he quickly turned the tables on her, blaming her for causing him to get jealous of her adopted child.[33] She knew he was just making it up since his extramarital affairs long preceded the birth of their son and the adoption of their second child. Realizing once more that respondent would never change, she left their home and billeted in a hotel with her two sons.[34] She was, nonetheless, forced to return due to her mother's prodding to work things out with respondent. He also threatened to kill himself if she did not return. Even then, he carried on with his illicit affairs and never stopped even during and after she underwent breast operation.[35] She realized it was time to leave for good. She consulted psychologist Dr. Nedy Lorenzo Tayag for a psychiatric evaluation of herself and respondent. When Dr. Tayag talked to respondent's brother to ascertain respondent's whereabouts and invite him to come to her clinic for psychological evaluation, the brother informed Dr. Tayag that he did not know how to contact respondent since he kept changing his phone number. Hence, Dr. Tayag never got the chance to interview respondent himself. In her Psychological Report,[36] Dr. Tayag observed that petitioner has an average intellect and her logical reasoning is well within the expected range for her age group.[37] She is practical and her ambitions provide her determination and focus.[38] Her triumphs and accomplishments make up for all her frustrations.[39] She gets easily affected, thus, needs constant reassurance. Although she strives to show her autonomy, there are times when she doubts herself as she relies on support and motivation from other people.[40] While she had her own shortcomings and flaws which affected her relationship with respondent, she remained aware of the roles and responsibilities she had to fulfill as wife and made efforts to fulfill them with sincerity.[41] As for respondent, Dr. Tayag found him to be suffering from narcissistic and anti-social personality disorder and his psychological condition had caused the deterioration of his marriage to petitioner.[42] This condition is primarily characterized by respondent's ""patterns of pervasive grandiosity, need for admiration, and lack of empathy along with a complete disregard for, and violation of, the rights of others.""[43] She noted that based on respondent's behavior, he had a ""sense of entitlement,""[44] was ""short-sighted, incautious, and imprudent,"" and has failed to ""plan ahead, consider alternatives, or heed consequences.""[45] Respondent had no future plans for his family even though his son was suffering from autism. He left to petitioner the sole obligation to care and provide for him. Respondent also persistently engaged in extramarital affairs despite the pressing domestic concerns facing the family which he just ignored.[46] Respondent was also found to be ""insensitive, irritable, and aggressive"" and had ""deficit in social charitableness, compassion, and remorse.""[47] Dr. Tayag further reported that respondent's personality disorder is considered grave as it started in his early years of life, which had become a permanent aspect of his personality structure and is deemed to be difficult to cure by any clinical intervention.[48] Respondent was, thus, declared psychologically incapacitated to fulfill his essential marital obligations to petitioner. By Order[49] dated June 28, 2013, the trial court directed the service of summons on respondent. Despite receipt of notice, however, respondent failed to file his answer. In yet another Order[50] dated August 12, 2013, the trial court directed the public prosecutor to investigate whether there was collusion between the parties. The public prosecutor subsequently reported there was no collusion between the parties. Petitioner, Dr. Tayag, and petitioner's co-worker Araceli Nobleza (Nobleza) each testified and affirmed the contents of their respective judicial affidavits. The judicial affidavit of Mark Anthony De Vera, petitioner's brother, was marked but his testimony was dispensed. Respondent, on the other hand, did not take any part in the proceedings. RULING OF THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT By Decision[51] dated February 24, 2016, the trial court declared the marriage between petitioner and respondent void ab initio on ground of the psychological incapacity on the part of respondent. On motion for reconsideration[52] by the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), the trial court reversed, per Order[53] dated August 25, 2016. It declared the marriage between petitioner and respondent to be valid and subsisting. PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COURT OF APPEALS On appeal, petitioner challenged the trial court's finding that the failure of Dr. Tayag to personally examine respondent was fatal to the petition and that the evidence adduced was insufficient to establish respondent's psychological incapacity to perform his marital duties to petitioner. By Decision[54] dated September 10, 2018, the Court of Appeals affirmed. It ruled that the totality of petitioner's evidence failed to sufficiently establish respondent's alleged psychological incapacity. For one, the result of the psychological assessment on respondent was based solely on petitioner's version of events during their marriage, albeit the same was corroborated by her friend and respondent's brother. Their accounts though were hearsay. For another, a marital relationship overwhelmed by disappointment and disillusionment may have produced a sad but not a void marriage. By Resolution[55] dated August 19, 2019, the Court of Appeals denied petitioner's motion for reconsideration.","The Court of Appeals affirmed the RTC's reversal, upholding the validity of the marriage, ruling that the totality of petitioner's evidence failed to sufficiently establish respondent's alleged psychological incapacity, stating there was nothing to illustrate the gravity, incurability, or root cause of respondent's alleged narcissistic and anti-social personality disorder. By Resolution dated August 19, 2019, the Court of Appeals denied petitioner's motion for reconsideration.","We grant the petition. The Court applied the modified guidelines set forth in Tan-Andal v. Andal, which revisited the interpretation of psychological incapacity under Article 36 of the Family Code, viewing it more in a legal rather than a medical concept. Psychological incapacity is defined as a 'personal condition that prevents a spouse from complying with fundamental marital obligations toward a specific partner and that may have existed at the time of marriage but became evident only through behavior subsequent to the marriage ceremony.' Applying the modified characterizations (gravity, juridical antecedence, and incurability in the legal sense), the Court found that petitioner sufficiently established, by clear and convincing evidence, that respondent is psychologically incapacitated to fulfill the essential marital obligations. Respondent's inability was manifested by his utter failure to provide financial and emotional support, his indifference and maltreatment toward his autistic son Matthew, and his repeated acts of infidelity, all stemming from a disordered personality structure that predated the marriage. These acts were deemed clear manifestations of a disordered personality structure, existing even before the celebration of his marriage to petitioner, which prevents him from complying with his essential marital obligations. Thus, the Court must declare his marriage void ab initio on ground of psychological incapacity under Article 36 of the Family Code.","ACCORDINGLY, the petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated September 10, 2018 and Resolution dated August 19, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 107835 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The Decision dated February 24, 2016 of the Regional Trial Court- Branch 31, San Pedro, Laguna is REINSTATED. The marriage between Zeth D. Fopalan and Neil F. Fopalan is declared VOID ab initio on the ground of psychological incapacity on the part of Neil F. Fopalan. Their property relation as husband and wife is DISSOLVED. SO ORDERED."

FERNANDEZ, GERARDO PLANTIG, GUILLERMO BANAGA AND RODOLFO REYES, RESPONDENTS.","Respondent security guards, Rogelio M. Fernandez, Gerardo Plantig, Guillermo Banaga and Rodolfo Reyes (Fernandez et al.), were engaged to provide security service to CFI under a security service agreement with PVC. On March 31, 2003, they filed a Complaint[10] against CFI before the DOLE­National Capital Region for underpayment of wages based on the prevailing wage order, and for non-payment of legal and special holiday pay, premium pay on rest days, 13th month pay, and emergency cost of living allowance. The complaint neither contained an allegation of illegal dismissal nor prayed for reinstatement.[11] Subsequently, the Regional Director (RD) set out to inspect PVC's premises, but having been denied access to employment records, interviewed the employees instead and found violations of the prevailing wage order.[12] Based on the Interview Sheet[13] made of record, it appears that Fernandez et al. were each paid P198.00 per 8-hour working day or P5,940.00/month as salary.[14] Then, in an Order dated August 20, 2003, the RD directed PVC as well as CFI to pay Fernandez et al. the corresponding wage and benefits differentials.[15] CFI and PVC filed their respective motions for reconsideration, which the RD dismissed in a Resolution[16] dated July 29, 2004. From there, the case took a two-pronged course. CFI, upon posting a supersedeas bond, filed a petition assailing the RD's jurisdiction before the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC). PVC, on the other hand, appealed to the Secretary of Labor likewise upon filing of its supersedeas bond. On February 15, 2005, the Secretary of Labor issued an Order[17] dismissing PVC's appeal and directing the liability to be satisfied out of its supersedeas bond.[18] It held that CFI could not be held liable because it has not been subjected to the same inspection as with PVC that gave rise to the case. Acting on the motion for partial reconsideration filed by PVC, the Secretary of Labor issued an Order[19] on June 15, 2007 declaring PVC and CFI solidarily liable to Fernandez et al. CFI filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which the Secretary of Labor denied in a Resolution[20] dated May 6, 2008. PVC, for its part, insisted on its non-liability and elevated the matter on certiorari to the CA which was docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 100291. Pending resolution of the petition, the Secretary of Labor, on April 27, 2009, issued a Notice of Garnishment[21] against CFI's bank account. On April 30, 2009, the CA dismissed the petition for lack of merit and reinstated the Secretary of Labor's decision absolving CPI from liability and holding PVC's bond to be solely liable for the satisfaction of the judgment obligation.[22] As such, CPI filed a Motion to Lift Garnishment on the ground of improvidence in view of the subsistence of the bond it earlier posted. Here, CPI also manifested to the Secretary of Labor that per the April 30, 2009 Decision of the CA, PVC was the only party liable to satisfy the labor claims of Fernandez et al. Despite these, the Secretary of Labor declined to lift the writ of garnishment in an Order[23] dated December 1, 2009. Meanwhile, on March 20, 2009, at the instance of Fernandez et al., the RD issued a Writ of Execution[24] relative to its earlier directive for both PVC and CFI to pay the subject labor claims. CFI, for its part, likewise elevated the Resolution of the Secretary of Labor dated May 6, 2008 via a petition for certiorari with the CA imputing grave abuse of discretion to the Secretary of Labor in holding it liable to pay the labor claims despite proof that it had earlier remitted to PVC the amounts necessary to pay Fernandez et al. the legally mandated wages and benefits. The case was docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 104756 which, in its Decision dated June 28, 2010, the CA dismissed in this wise – In this case, [PVC] had already filed an appeal bond; thus, the interests of the complainants are already adequately protected and there is no need to continue holding [CFI] solidarily liable with [PVC.] The [Secretary of Labor] may have erred on the side of caution when it reversed its ruling that [PVC's] appeal bond will answer for the judgment award in favor of the complainants and held that the judgment award may be collected from [PVC] and [CFI]. But such error will not affect the outcome of the case. In solidary obligations, the creditor may proceed against any one of the solidary debtors or some or all of them simultaneously. Under Article 1217 of the Civil Code, the solidary debtor who made the payment has the right of reimbursement from his co-debtor. Thus, even if the judgment amount will be collected against [CFI], it may demand reimbursement from [PVC] and collect against [PVC's] bond. Grave abuse of discretion is defined as such capricious or whimsical exercise of judgment equivalent to lack of jurisdiction. x x x The error committed by the [Secretary of Labor] is not of the grave kind. ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DISMISSED. SO ORDERED.[25] On a related matter, as the CFI's Motion to Lift Garnishment with the Secretary of Labor was denied, it filed another petition for certiorari with the CA, which was docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 112229. Here, CFI objected to the restoration of its solidary liability with PVC against whom and against whose bond sole liability has been adjudged in the intervening April 30, 2009 Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 100291. However, finding no merit in the arguments and noting CFI's lapse in filing the pre-requisite motion for reconsideration, the CA dismissed the petition in its Decision[26] dated March 12, 2012. On the merits, the CA noted that inasmuch as the accreditation of PVC's surety company had expired in the interim, the labor claims must then be paid by CFI as the other solidary party. The disposition of the CA Decision reads: WHEREFORE, the Petition for Certiorari is DENIED DUE COURSE and accordingly, DISMISSED for lack of merit. The assailed Order dated December 1, 2009 of the DOLE-NCR in NCR00-LSED-0303-IS-069 is hereby AFFIRMED. SO ORDERED.[27] PVC and CFI are now before this Court in these consolidated petitions.","This Court held that the Regional Director (RD) has jurisdiction over the present case because the controversy arose during the existence of an employer-employee relationship and the complaint did not include a prayer for reinstatement, falling under the visitorial and enforcement powers of the Secretary of Labor (Article 128(b), Labor Code), notwithstanding that the individual claims exceeded P5,000.00. The Court affirmed the solidary liability of CFI (as principal/indirect employer) and PVC (as contractor) for the payment of monetary awards to the security guards, pursuant to Articles 106, 107, and 109 of the Labor Code. The Court further ruled that PVC's filing of a supersedeas bond did not automatically discharge CFI from its solidary liability, especially considering that the accreditation of PVC's surety company had expired in the interim, thereby making it proper to hold CFI, the other solidary party, liable. Claims by PVC and CFI regarding previous remittances and the extinguishing effect of the appeal bond are irrelevant to the immediate enforcement of payment and must be resolved in an opportune time through the concomitant right of reimbursement under Article 1217 of the Civil Code.","The RD has jurisdiction over the present case. Articles 129, 217 and 128(6) of the Labor Code, as amended by Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7730, affirm the power of the Secretary of Labor or his duly-authorized representatives to issue compliance orders based on inspection findings, retaining jurisdiction over matters involving the recovery of any amount of wages and other monetary claims arising out of employer-employee relations at the time of inspection, even if the money claim exceeds P5,000.00, provided that the employer-employee relationship still exists and the complaint does not include a claim for reinstatement. PVC and CFI are solidarily liable for the payment of the monetary awards to respondents under Articles 106, 107, and 109 of the Labor Code. This solidary liability assures compliance with the Labor Code and ensures the speedy recovery and payment of wages. PVC's filing of supersedeas bond did not necessarily discharge CFI from liability because an appeal bond is merely a guarantee of recovery and does not extinguish the principal’s statutory solidary obligation. Since CFI is solidarily liable, the denial of CFI’s Motion to Lift Garnishment and the subsequent garnishment of its properties were proper to fully satisfy the payment of the monetary awards due to respondents. Any determination on the relative rights and obligations between PVC and CFI should be made in an opportune time and before a forum outside of the present proceedings.","ACCORDINGLY, premises considered, this Court rules as follows: 1. In G.R. No. 190509, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is PARTIALLY GRANTED. The Decision dated April 30, 2009 and the Resolution dated December 3, 2009 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 100291 are PARTIALLY REVERSED insofar as it held that Peak Ventures Corporation's filing of a supersedeas bond released Club Filipino, Inc. from liability for the payment of the unpaid wages and monetary benefits due to respondents Rogelio M. Fernandez, Gerardo Plantig, Guillermo Banaga and Rodolfo Reyes; 2. In G.R. No. 196143, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED. The Decision dated June 28, 2010 and the Resolution dated March 3, 2011 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 104756 are AFFIRMED. Club Filipino, Inc. and Peak Ventures Corporation are solidarity liable for the payment of the unpaid wages and monetary benefits due to respondents Rogelio M. Fernandez, Gerardo Plantig, Guillermo Banaga and Rodolfo Reyes, in accordance with the August 20, 2003 Order of the Department of Labor and Employment – National Capital Region. 3. In G.R. No. 201041, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED. The Decision dated March 12, 2012 of the Court of Appeals in CA­G.R. SP No. 112229 is AFFIRMED. The Motion to Lift Garnishment filed by Club Filipino, Inc. before the Secretary of Labor is DENIED. SO ORDERED."

AND ANTONIO G. TAMON, RESPONDENTS.","On September 19, 2008, the Bureau of Internal Revenue ( BIR ) issued RR 13-2008, prescribing the updated and consolidated policies and procedures for the advance payment of VAT on the sale of refined sugar pursuant to Republic Act No. 9337. Under Section 2(b) thereof, 'raw sugar' is defined as: (b) Raw Sugar refers to sugar whose content of sucrose by weight in dry state, corresponds to a polarimeter reading of less than 99.5°. Cane sugar produced each production year shall be classified, for internal revenue purposes, as follows: 'A' is raw sugar which is intended for export to the United States Market... On September 20, 2013, then Department of Finance Secretary Cesar Antonio V. Purisima ( DoF Sec. Purisima ), upon recommendation of Commissioner of Internal Revenue Kim S. Jacinto-Henares ( CIR Henares ), issued RR 13-2013, defining raw sugar, as follows: ... '(b) Raw Sugar refers to sugar produced by simple process of conversion of sugar cane without a need of any of mechanical or similar device such as muscovado. For this purpose, raw sugar refers only to muscovado sugar. Centrifugal process of producing sugar is not in itself a simple process. Therefore, any type of sugar produced therefrom is not exempt from VAT.' On October 3, 2013, respondents Rural Sugar Planters' Association, Inc., Northern Negros Planters Association, Inc., Confederation of Sugar Producers Associations, Inc., United Sugar Producers Federation of the Philippines, Inc. and NFSP, Inc. initiated a petition for declaratory relief to declare as unconstitutional RR 13-2013. The case was docketed as SCA No. 88-C and got raffled to the RTC­Branch 60, Cadiz City. By Consolidated Order dated October 22, 2013, the trial court granted the Writ of Preliminary Injunction against the implementation of RR 13-2013 and required respondents to procure a corresponding surety bond equivalent to P1,000,000.00. Petitioners, through the Office of the Solicitor General ( OSG ), charged the trial court with grave abuse of discretion amounting to excess or lack of jurisdiction for issuing the writ of preliminary injunction. They invoked the following grounds: (1) Section 218, NIRC, as amended, explicitly prohibits the issuance of a writ of injunction against collection of taxes; (2) the issuance of the writ of injunction would, in effect, dispose of the main case without trial; (3) the writ of injunction was issued despite respondents' utter failure to prove the essential requisites for its issuance;... Meantime, respondents filed a Manifestation dated June 8, 2015, informing the Court that on May 22, 2015, DoF Sec. Purisima, upon the recommendation of CIR Henares, issued RR 8-2015, amending RR 13-2008 insofar as the definition of raw sugar is concerned... which has the consequent effect of restoring the VAT exempt status of raw sugar.",The petition is DISMISSED on the ground of mootness.,"RR 8-2015 restored the VAT exempt status of raw sugar previously withdrawn under the subject RR 13-2013. Surely, this development is a supervening event which renders the main action for declaratory relief against the constitutionality of the old RR 13-2013 academic. Petitioners do not refute this. Where the main action has become academic, so have the ancillary relief for TRO or writ of injunction and all related incidents, including petitioners' opposition to its issuance and the present petition seeking to nullify the writ of injunction issued by the trial court. For petitioners to insist on the resolution of how the 'no injunction rule' was supposedly violated when the trial court issued the assailed writ of injunction is actually asking the Court to render an advisory opinion, resolve a hypothetical or feigned problem, or a mere academic answer, which is beyond the Court's power of review, thus: The power of judicial review is limited to actual cases or controversies. Courts decline to issue advisory opinions or to resolve hypothetical or feigned problems, or mere academic questions. The limitation of the power of judicial review to actual cases and controversies defines the role assigned to the judiciary in a tripartite allocation of power, to assure that the courts will not intrude into areas committed to the other branches of government. An actual case or controversy involves a conflict of legal rights, an assertion of opposite legal claims, susceptible of judicial resolution as distinguished from a hypothetical or abstract difference or dispute. There must be a contrariety of legal rights that can be interpreted and enforced on the basis of existing law and jurisprudence. The Court can decide the constitutionality of an act or treaty only when a proper case between opposing parties is submitted for judicial determination. Besides, the injunctive writ, together with petitioners' opposition, and petition for certiorari relative thereto are a mere adjunct to the main case for declaratory relief. Since the main case has already become academic, the ancillary relief and all incidents related thereto necessarily have become academic, as well. For the spring cannot rise above its source.","ACCORDINGLY , the petition is DISMISSED on the ground of mootness."
"[ G.R. No. 236263, July 19, 2022 ]","OCEANMARINE RESOURCES CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. JENNY ROSE G. NEDIC, ON BEHALF OF HER MINOR SON, JEROME NEDIC ELLAO, RESPONDENT.","The controversy stemmed from a Complaint dated 16 April 2012 filed by respondent on behalf of her minor son, Jerome Nedic Ellao (Jerome), for P3,383,640.00 representing the ""Lost Future Income"" of Jerome's father and her common-law partner, Romeo. According to the Complaint, Romeo worked as a company driver for petitioner. On or about 02 November 2011, Romeo was instructed to drive for several company employees. They first went to the Allied Bank located along Domestic Road, Pasay City to withdraw money for the company. Thereafter, he was instructed to drive to a Metrobank branch along Roxas Boulevard near the intersection of MIA Road, Parañaque City for another transaction. They then proceeded to a Bank of the Philippine Islands branch in Barangay La Huerta, along Quirino Avenue, Parañaque City. While driving along Bayview Drive in Barangay Tambo, Parañaque City, two (2) unidentified motorcycle-riding assailants stopped the vehicle and shot Romeo to death. The assailants immediately took the bag of money in the vehicle and escaped. Following Romeo's death, respondent, through her counsel, wrote a letter to petitioner demanding P3,382,560.00 in damages by way of loss of future income. Petitioner, through a letter dated 27 January 2012, denied the claim for being unfounded and premature since she had yet to be designated as the guardian of Jerome. Petitioner's refusal prompted respondent to file the present claim under Article 1711 of the Civil Code, which expressly holds owners of enterprises and other employers liable to pay compensation for the death of their employees if the death arose out of and in the course of employment even if it was accidental or entirely due to a fortuitous cause. At the time of his death, Romeo was thirty-three (33) years old. In its Answer, petitioner denied liability and argued that the complaint had no cause of action. It maintained that it did not commit any act constituting fault or negligence, which was the proximate cause of Romeo's demise. Moreover, cases where indemnity for loss of earning capacity was awarded involved a tortfeasor or a criminal whose act was the proximate cause of the death of the victim under Article 2176 of the Civil Code. These have no application to an employer's liability under Article 1711, which does not even contain the manner of computation of death compensation. Petitioner further argued that Romeo's death had already been compensated under existing labor laws.","In the assailed Decision dated 19 December 2017, the CA reversed the RTC's ruling and awarded respondent actual damages for loss of earning capacity: ""WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Appeal filed by Jenny Rose G. Nedic on 14 November 2014 on behalf of Jerome Nedic Ellao, her minor son with deceased Romeo S. Ellao, is GRANTED. The Decision rendered by Branch 258 of the Regional Trial Court of Parañaque City on 22 September 2014 is REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Oceanmarine Resources Corporation is ORDERED to pay the amount of PHP1,409,850.00, as actual damages for the loss of Romeo S. Ellao's earning capacity, plus 10% o{ the amount awarded as attorney's fees, plus costs of suit, with legal interest thereon at 6% per annum computed from the date the judgment of this Court is made until fully satisfied. SO ORDERED.""","The Court declares that Title II, Book IV of the Labor Code has impliedly repealed Article 1711 of the Civil Code. The doctrine in Candano Shipping Lines, Inc. v. Sugata-on, which sanctioned the filing of an action for work-related compensation under Article 1711 of the Civil Code and applied the formula for computation of loss of earning capacity, is ABANDONED, but the abandonment shall be APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY. The remedies of compensation under the Labor Code and damages under the Civil Code are selective, not cumulative or exclusive. Since the action was filed during the applicability of Candano, the claim based on Article 1711 must be upheld, and the indemnity for loss of earning capacity may be awarded to the heirs of Romeo S. Ellao.","WHEREFORE, the petition is PARTLY GRANTED. The Decision dated 19 December 2017 promulgated by the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 103881 is hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION.

"G.R. No. 256141, July 19, 2022","BELINDA ALEXANDER, PETITIONER, VS. SPOUSES JORGE AND HILARIA ESCALONA, AND REYGAN ESCALONA, RESPONDENTS.","Respondents Spouses Jorge Escalona (Jorge) and Hilaria Escalona (Hilaria; collectively, Spouses Escalona) were married on November 14, 1960. Thereafter, Spouses Escalona acquired unregistered parcels of land identified as Lot Nos. 1 and 2 with a combined area of 100,375 square meters in Barangay Sta. Rita, Olongapo City. On June 16, 1998, Jorge waived his right over Lot No. 1 in favor of his illegitimate son, respondent Reygan Escalona (Reygan). On July 28, 2005, Reygan relinquished his right over Lot No. 1 to petitioner Belinda Alexander (Belinda). On August 8, 2005, Reygan likewise transferred Lot No. 2 to Belinda through a Deed of Renunciation and Quitclaim. On August 10, 2005, Reygan and Belinda entered into a Deed of Absolute Sale covering Lot Nos. 1 and 2 for P1,600,000.00. Spouses Escalona confronted Belinda and explained that Reygan cannot validly sell the lots. Aggrieved, Spouses Escalona filed on September 5, 2005 a Complaint for annulment of documents with damages against Belinda and Reygan, averring that Hilaria did not consent to the waiver of rights over Lot No. 1 and that Reygan fraudulently sold Lot No. 2. The Regional Trial Court of Olongapo City, Branch 72 (RTC) upheld the transactions and dismissed Spouses Escalona's complaint for being time-barred in a Decision dated February 20, 2017. Spouses Escalona appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA).","In a Decision dated October 26, 2020, the CA reversed the RTC's findings. The CA ruled that Lot Nos. 1 and 2 are conjugal properties of Spouses Escalona and that the contracts over these lots are void absent Hilaria's consent. The action to nullify these transactions are imprescriptible under Article 1410 of the Civil Code. The CA rejected Belinda's theory that she is a buyer in good faith. The CA rendered a new judgment declaring void the following: (a) Waiver and Quitclaim dated 16 June 1998; (b) Waiver and Quitclaim dated 28 July 2005; (c) Deed of Renunciation and Quitclaim dated 8 August 2005 and (d) Deed of Absolute Sale dated 10 August 2005. This is however without prejudice to any action that may be filed by Belinda Alexander against Reygan Escalona for the amounts she paid him for the purchase of lots 1 and 2.","The Court holds that Lot Nos. 1 and 2 are conjugal properties. The applicable law must be reckoned on the date of the alienation or encumbrance of the conjugal property made without the consent of the other spouse. The alienation of Lot No. 1 (1998) is void under Article 124 of the Family Code because it was made without Hilaria's consent, and the action to nullify the transaction is not imprescriptible under Article 1410 of the Civil Code, but must be filed before the continuing offer becomes ineffective. Reygan and Belinda did not acquire a vested right over Lot No. 1 before the Family Code took effect. The alienation of Lot No. 2 is inexistent under Article 1318 of the Civil Code because it was made without Spouses Escalona's consent, and Reygan never acquired ownership; thus, the action to nullify the transaction is imprescriptible pursuant to Article 1410 of the Civil Code. Belinda is not a buyer in good faith. Belinda is entitled to reimburse from Reygan the purchase price for the sale of Lot Nos. 1 and 2. The duty of restitution arises if the ground justifying the retention of payment ceases.","FOR THESE REASONS, the petition is PARTLY GRANTED. The Decision dated October 26, 2020 and the Resolution dated March 5, 2021 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 110958 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION in that respondent Reygan Escalona is ORDERED to reimburse petitioner Belinda Alexander the amount of P1,600,000.00 representing the purchase price of Lot Nos. 1 and 2.

"G.R. No. 252073, July 18, 2022","SPOUSES LOURDES V. RAFAEL AND RAUL I. RAFAEL, PETITIONERS, VS. GOVERNMENT SERVICE INSURANCE SYSTEM (GSIS), RESPONDENT.","Petitioners Spouses Lourdes and Raul Rafael filed a complaint for specific performance, injunction, and damages against respondent Government Service Insurance System (GSIS), docketed Civil Case No. BCV-2005-125 and raffled to the Regional Trial Court (RTC) – Branch 89, Bacoor City. In their Complaint dated November 14, 2005, petitioners alleged that Lourdes Rafael is an employee of the Department of Budget and Management (DBM). On May 9, 1990, she submitted an Application for a House and Lot with respondent GSIS. Subsequently, GSIS issued a Buyer's Data Sheet and a loan evaluation form, stating that the term of the loan is ""15 years graduated"" or ""15 years GPS"" – graduated payment scheme with monthly amortization of P3,094.35. On November 20, 1990, Lourdes and her husband Raul Rafael, on one hand, and ARB Construction Company, Inc. (ARB), on the other, entered into a Deed of Conditional Sale over a 140-square-meter lot identified as Block 23, Lot 18, Phase IV, Soldier Hills 4, Molino 6, Bacoor City, Cavite. Under the deed of conditional sale, they (petitioners) agreed: a) to pay the purchase price of P310,800.00, payable within 15 years or 180 equal monthly installments of P3,094.35 beginning February 1991; b) to pay ""interest at six per centum (6%) for the first P30,000.00 and 9% & 40,000[.00] and twelve per centum (12%) for the balance of individual purchase price, per annum, compounded monthly, until fully paid;"" and c) ""[a]ny installment due and unpaid shall bear additional interest at the rate of one-half per centum (½%) per month until the same is fully paid."" In May 1991, the property was turned over to them. The DBM started to deduct the monthly amortization of P3,094.35 from the salary of Lourdes. On March 11, 1992, ARB transferred all its interests, rights, and participation in the Deed of Conditional Sale to GSIS via a Deed of Absolute Sale with Assignment. Sometime in February 2005, petitioners received a Letter dated January 25, 2005 from GSIS informing them that as of December 31, 2004, they had an outstanding balance of P384,354.72 and that final demand was being made to settle the amount within 15 days from notice, otherwise, the deed of conditional sale would be cancelled. On April 18, 2005, they received a notarized Letter dated February 21, 2005, cancelling the Deed of Conditional Sale effective 30 days from notice with demand to vacate and turn over the property to GSIS. Another notice to vacate was sent to them on July 22, 2005, prompting Lourdes to inquire from GSIS why the deed of conditional sale was cancelled. GSIS responded: 1) since the monthly amortizations were graduated, the monthly amortization of P3,094.35 increased to P3,548.40 (from the 6th to 10th year of the Deed of Conditional Sale) and P5,365.15 (from the 11th to the 15th year of the Deed of Conditional Sale); 2) Lourdes was informed that they were not paying the correct monthly installments based on Board Resolution No. 365 of the GSIS Board of Trustees; and 3) deductions for the monthly amortizations should have started in January 1991 and not May 1991. As a result, the monthly amortizations deducted from her salary were not credited to the payment of her loan but instead applied to interests and penalties for her supposed failure to pay the monthly amortizations from January to April 1991. They claimed they had already paid P532,248.20, representing 172 monthly installments deducted from the salary of Lourdes from May 1991 up to September 2005. They concluded that the act of GSIS in unilaterally increasing the required monthly installment payment was made without legal authority and was a blatant and abusive breach of the provisions of the Deed of Conditional Sale. In its Answer, GSIS insisted that the remaining balance of the housing loan is P384,354.72. The adjustment of the monthly installments was made pursuant to Board Resolution No. 365, recalculating the interest in Deeds of Conditional Sale under the Graduated Payment Scheme, and Lourdes was allegedly notified thereof. GSIS posited that the RTC had no jurisdiction over the subject matter of the complaint because jurisdiction was vested with the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB). Later, GSIS pleaded anew lack of jurisdiction and/or failure to exhaust administrative remedies, arguing that jurisdiction was vested with the GSIS-Board of Trustees (GSIS-BOT) per Section 30 of Republic Act No. 8291 (RA 8291).","By its Decision dated January 12, 2015, the trial court ruled in petitioners' favor. It held that an action to declare as void the cancellation of the Deed of Conditional Sale is not within the jurisdiction of the HLURB. It ruled the subject matter was incapable of pecuniary estimation, hence, within the jurisdiction of the RTC. The trial court likewise held that Board Resolution No. 365 is an internal rule of GSIS, hence, inapplicable to petitioners because there was no showing that the application of the Graduated Payment Scheme was even indicated in their Deed of Conditional Sale or that GSIS ever notified Lourdes or her disbursing office, the DBM, of the supposed graduated deduction and its application to her account. The Decision disposed, as follows: ACCORDINGLY, judgment is rendered: Declaring defendant's cancellation of the Deed of Conditional Sale Account No. HSH4224433 as null and void; Ordering the defendant to apply the 167 monthly amortizations made by the plaintiffs to their principal obligations corresponding to the period from February 1991 through February 2005; Ordering the plaintiffs to pay defendant the unpaid balance corresponding to thirteen (13) monthly installments as well as P77,892.52 as additional interests due for the 167 monthly installments. By its assailed Decision dated July 23, 2019, the Court of Appeals reversed. It held that jurisdiction over the case was vested in the GSIS-BOT, pursuant to Section 30 of RA No. 8291, which grants original and exclusive jurisdiction to the GSIS to settle any dispute arising under this Act, including housing loans and all its related policies. Consequently, the Court of Appeals dismissed the complaint without prejudice.","We reverse. The GSIS-Board of Trustees has no jurisdiction over complaints involving the validity and enforcement of its own actions. ... We cannot interpret and apply Section 30 [of RA 8291] in the manner the Court of Appeals did. To do so would violate the aggrieved party's right to due process. ... the clause any dispute arising under this Act and any other laws administered by the GSIS – the basis for the jurisdiction of the GSIS-BOT jurisdiction under Section 30 of RA 8291 – cannot be invoked as regards disputes that compromise the due process requirement of impartiality and independence of the hearing officer, the decision-maker, and the investigation and adjudication they each perform. ... In this instance, GSIS descended to the level of an ordinary contracting party whose actions under the relevant contractual undertakings are subject to review by our courts and certainly not by the GSIS-BOT. To espouse otherwise is to institutionalize an unfair scheme where the fulfillment of undertakings depends upon the sole will of the obligor. ... Verily, the trial court correctly exercised jurisdiction over petitioners' Complaint. ... The trial court correctly set aside the cancellation of the Deed of Conditional Sale. Petitioners were not at fault about the delayed payments of their amortizations or the incorrect amounts of amortizations they had been paying. They were not in control of the amortization payments as to time and amount of payments. The entity in control of all these was the GSIS. At the very least, it was negligent in performing its tasks. ... Besides, a perusal of the stipulations of the Deed of Conditional Sale readily reveals that GSIS was never given the discretion to unilaterally adjust interest rates, other than those stipulated in this Deed. Nor are there stipulations that the monthly amortizations should first be applied to fire insurance premium, sales redemption insurance premium, and a portion of the interest. In this regard, the trial court correctly held that: GSIS is legally obligated to credit the monthly amortizations of petitioners beginning May 1991 to their arrears beginning February 1991 onward pursuant to the provision of the Civil Code that where application of payments is not specified, the payments shall be first applied to the most onerous obligation. GSIS is legally obligated to apply a total of 167 monthly amortizations to petitioner's principal obligation.","ACCORDINGLY, the petition is GRANTED. The assailed Decision dated July 23, 2019 and Resolution dated February 13, 2020 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 108659 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The Decision dated January 12, 2015 and Order dated December 28, 2015 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 89, Bacoor City, in Civil Case No. BCV-2005-125, are REINSTATED with the following modifications: Petitioners shall pay the remaining balance of thirteen (13) monthly amortizations at P3,094.35, without any interests, surcharges, or penalties whatsoever; and After petitioners shall have paid these thirteen (13) monthly amortizations of P3,094.35, without need of demand, Government Service Insurance System shall execute the Deed of Absolute Sale and cause the transfer of the document of title to petitioners, cleared of all encumbrances thereto."

MGI is also a registered VAT taxpayer with the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) under Certificate of Registration No. OCN3RC0000483772 and Taxpayer's Identification Number (TIN) 007-843-328-000. In addition, MGI is registered as a Renewable Energy Developer of a 20 MW Maibarara Geothermal Power Generation Project in Batangas and Laguna under Certificate of Registration No. GRESC 2011-01-025 issued by the Department of Energy and Certificate of Registration No. 2011-06 issued by the Board of Investments. MGI filed its quarterly VAT returns for the first, second, third, and fourth quarters for taxable year 2011 on April 25, 2011, on July 25, 2011, on October 19, 2011, and on January 20, 2012, respectively. On March 22, 2013, MGI filed with the BIR Revenue District Office (RDO) No. 43A in Pasig City an administrative claim for refund of its unutilized input VAT for the first quarter of taxable year 2011 in the total amount of P10,095,979.46. On June 24, 2013, MGI filed with the BIR another administrative claim for refund of its unutilized input VAT for the second quarter of taxable year 2011 in the total amount of P3,134,942.99. On September 26, 2013, MGI filed its third administrative claim for refund of its unutilized input VAT for the third quarter of taxable year 2011 in the total amount of P1,534,692.20. On December 13, 2013, petitioner filed its fourth administrative claim for refund of its unutilized input VAT for the fourth quarter of taxable year 2011 in the total amount of P1,023,598.99. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue failed to act on MGI's administrative claims for refund of its unutilized input VAT for the first, second, third, and fourth quarters of taxable year 2011. This prompted MGI to file various petitions for review before the CTA, docketed as CTA Case Nos. 8699, 8732, 8771, and 8811 on August 16, 2013, November 15, 2013, February 21, 2014, and April 30, 2014, respectively. In its Decision dated August 18, 2017, the CTA First Division denied the consolidated petitions for review for lack of merit. Aggrieved, MGI moved for reconsideration, which was denied by the CTA First Division in its Resolution dated January 3, 2018. After the denial of its motion for reconsideration, petitioner elevated the case before the CTA En Banc. On March 14, 2019, the CTA En Banc rendered the assailed Decision denying the petition for review and affirming the rulings of the CTA First Division. MGI moved for the reconsideration of the CTA En Banc decision. However, the same was denied in a Resolution dated November 15, 2019. Hence, the instant petition.","This Court resolves a Petition for Review on Certiorari filed by Maibarara Geothermal, Inc. (MGI) assailing the Decision dated March 14, 2019 and Resolution dated November 15, 2019 of the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) En Banc in CTA EB No. 1765. The CTA En Banc earlier affirmed the Decision of the CTA First Division dated August 18, 2017 in CTA Case Nos. 8699, 8732, 8771, and 8811, which denied petitioner's claim for tax refund/credit of unutilized input value-added taxes (VAT) for the first, second, third, and fourth quarters of taxable year 2011. The Supreme Court denied the petition, finding that MGI failed to establish its claim for refund or tax credit of its unutilized input VAT for the first, second, third, and fourth quarters of taxable year 2011.","Any claim for refund or tax credit of unutilized input VAT must be attributable to zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sales as required by Section 112(A) of the NIRC. The refund or tax credit of unutilized input VAT is premised on the existence of zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sales. The phrase 'when the relevant sales were made pertaining to the input VAT' refers to zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sales made by the taxpayer-claimant, not to the purchase of goods and services from which input VAT was incurred. Since Petitioner MGI admitted that it had no zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sales during the first to fourth quarters of taxable year 2011, the attribution requirement under Section 112(A) cannot be fulfilled or complied with. Hence, MGI is not entitled to the claimed refund or tax credit.","FOR THESE REASONS, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED. The assailed Decision of the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc dated March 14, 2019 and Resolution dated November 15, 2019 are AFFIRMED. Consequently, the CTA First Division's Decision dated August 18, 2017 and Resolution dated January 3, 2018 are AFFIRMED."

QUINTIN J. PEDRERO, JR., GRAFT INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION OFFICER II AND HON. RANDOLPH C. CADIOGAN, JR., GRAFT INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION OFFICER I AND NICASIO E. SULAPAS (FORMER SANGGUNIANG BAYAN MEMBER OF GENERAL LUNA, SURIGAO DEL NORTE), RESPONDENTS.","On July 21, 2006, former Sangguniang Bayan (SB) of General Luna Surigao del Norte member, Nicasio E. Sulapas (Sulapas), filed a verified letter-complaint[4] with the Office of the Ombudsman for Mindanao against Vice Mayor Nemia T. Magaluna (Magaiuna), along with other members of the SB, namely, Anecia C. Pore (Pore), Charlito B. Plaza (Plaza), Edelyn D. Espejon (Espejon), Hermes P. Forcadilla (Forcadilla), Eutiquio C. Paler (Paler), Glendale F. Escatron (Escatron), arid former SB acting secretary Juanito A. Antolin (Antolin). Sulapas also included Barangay Captain Erlinita B. Sta. Romana (Sta. Romana) in the letter complaint. In his letter-complaint, Sulapas alleged that on January 25, 2004, the Sangguniang Barangay of Tawin-Tawin of General Luna, Surigao del Norte passed Brgy. Resolutions No. 1 and 2, series of 2004, requesting that Lot No. 2874 and Lot No. 2872, respectively, be certified and identified as barangay sites. On February 23, 2004, the SB of General Luna passed SB Resolution Nos. 3 and 4 which certified and identified Lot No. 2874 and Lot No. 2872 as barangay sites, respectively. In both resolutions, petitioners affixed their signatures, certifying that the minutes for the resolutions were duly taken up, passed and approved in the regular session of the SB members. Antolin being the SB secretary, signed the resolutions, certifying their correctness. On September 23, 2004, SB Resolution Nos. 3 and 4 was submitted to the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) while SB Resolution No. 4 was submitted on September 28, 2004 in the same office. On November 30, 2004, the Sangguniang Barangay of Tawin-Tawin submitted another resolution dated November 25, 2004 to the DENR for the subdivision of the two lots. On December 6, 2004, acting on SB Resolution Nos. 3 and 4, DENR subdivided the lots. Sulapas claimed that petitioners, along with Sta. Romana, committed two counts of Falsification of Official Documents when they passed SB Resolution Nos. 3 and 4 since the said resolutions were never mentioned in the February 23, 2004 minutes of meeting. Furthermore, they were submitted to the DENR without the Municipal Mayor's approval. Moreover, in both SB Resolutions, Magaluna, Pore, Plaza, Espejon, Forcadilla, Paler, and Escatron were marked as present, while Sulapas, Nilo Bordas (Bordas), Rito P. Lim (Lim), and Oscar Navarro (Navarro) were marked absent. However, in the minutes for the SB session for that day, Sulapas, Lim, and Navarro were declared present. Upon receipt of the letter-complaint, the Central Records Division of the Ombudsman Mindanao conducted a pre-evaluation of the same and indicated therein the following petitioners: (i) Magaluna, (2) Pore, (3) Espejon, (4) Forcadilla, (5) Paler, (6) Escatron, (7) Antolin, and (8) Sta. Romana. Plaza was not named in the pre-evaluation. On August 3, 2006, acting on the letter-complaint, Ombudsman Mindanao initiated a fact-finding investigation, through its Fact-Finding Investigation Unit (FFIU). On September 11, 2006, the FFIU issued a subpoena duces tecum directing the SB secretary to submit the original copy of the following documents: SB Resolution No. 3 Series of 2004 dated 23 February 2004. SB Resolution No. 4 Series of 2004 dated 23 February 2004. Minutes of meeting of the Regular Session of the SB Members of General Luna, Surigao del Norte held on 23 February 2004. On September 29, 2006, SB Secretary Peejay B. Gorgonio (Gorgonio) submitted a certified true copy of the February 23, 2004 minutes and a letter explaining that he cannot submit the original thereof as there is only one copy left in his office. He also executed and submitted an affidavit stating that SB Resolution Nos. 3 and 4 do not exist in record and that the February 23, 2004 minutes never mentioned them nor were they passed upon during the session for that day. To further prove the non-existence of SB Resolution Nos. 3 and 4, Gorgonio said that SB Resolution No. 19, Series of 2004 was passed on January 12, 2004, or on a date even prior to when SB Resolution Nos. 3 and 4 were allegedly passed. Due to Gorgonio's disclosure, the FFIU issued, on March 11, 2008, another subpoena duces tecum directing Gorgonio to submit the original copy of SB Resolution No. 19, series of 2004 dated January 12, 2004. On the same date, it also issued another subpoena duces tecum directing Ulpiano D. Dasilao (Dasilao) of the Community Environment and Natural Resources Office (CENRO) of Dapa, Surigao del Norte to submit the original copies of SB Resolution Nos. 3 and 4. On March 31, 2008, Gorgonio submitted a certified true copy of SB Resolution No. 19, series of 2004 since he had only one original copy on file. On April 3, 2008, Dasilao submitted a March 25, 2008 letter requesting for an extension of another five (5) days to submit the originals of SB Resolution Nos. 3 and 4, Series of 2004 due to his reassignment to DENR-CENRO of Surigao City. On April 18, 2008, the CENRO of Dapa, Surigao del Norte submitted the originals of SB Resolution Nos. 3 and 4 dated February 23, 2004 to FFIU. On April 7, 2009, upon review of the evidence, FFIU released its Memorandum declaring that since the necessary documentary evidence were on hand, the fact-finding investigation was terminated, and the conduct of preliminary investigation was now proper. It then recommended the preliminary investigation of the case for Falsification of Public Documents as defined in Article 171 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) against Magaluna, Pore, Espejon, Forcadilla, Paler; Escatron, Antolin, and Sta. Romana, excluding Plaza. Thus, in April 2009, Sulapas' letter-complaint was docketed as Case No. OMB-M-C-09-0168-D. Ombudsman Mindanao issued an Order dated May 4, 2009 directing Magaluna, Pore, Espejon, Forcadilla, Paler, Escatron, Antolin, and Sta. Romana to submit their counter-affidavits and controverting evidence to Sulapas' letter-complaint within ten (10) days from receipt of notice. As such, petitioners, with the exception of Plaza, filed a joint counter-affidavit dated June 9, 2009. In the said counter-affidavit, they contend that no falsification occurred because (1) they actually deliberated upon the matter prior to the start of the formal session; and (2) their signatures are genuine. On July 19, 2009, Sulapas filed his Reply. On January 13, 2014, Ombudsman Mindanao issued an Order, impleading Plaza and directed the latter to file his counter-affidavit. Ombudsman Mindanao admitted that Plaza was one of the individuals charged in Sulapas, letter-complaint but was inadvertently omitted in the Order dated May 4, 2009. On February 11, 2014, in compliance with Ombudsman Mindanao's Order, Plaza filed his counter-affidavit. In it, Plaza asserted that his right to speedy disposition of case was violated. On April 25, 2014, Ombudsman Mindanao approved a Resolution dated April 14, 2014, the dispositive portion of which reads: 'WHEREFORE, as for SB Resolution No. 03, this Office finds probable cause to indict respondents Nemia T. Magaluna, Anecia C. Pore, Edelyn D. Espejon, Hermes P. Forcadilla, Eutiquio C. Paler, Glendale F. Escatron, Charlito B. Plaza and Juanito A. Antolin for violation of Article 171, paragraph 4, of the Revised Penal Code. As for SB Resolution No. 04, this Office finds probable cause to indict respondents Nemia T. Magaluna, Anecia C. Pore, Edelyn D. Espejon, Hermes P. Forcadilla, Eutiquio C. Paler, Charlito B. Plaza and Juanito A. Antolin. The case is dismissed as for respondent Erlinita B. Sta. Romana for lack of probable cause. SO RESOLVED.' On May 26, 2014, Plaza filed his Motion for Reconsideration (MR), in which he again asserted his right to speedy disposition of case. On the other hand, on May 30, 2014, Magaluna, Pore, Paler, Espejon, and Forcadilla jointly filed their own Motion for Reconsideration contending that (1) the matter was actually deliberated upon; (2) affixing their signature on the pre-prepared resolutions was a usual practice; (3) the resolutions were ultra vires since designation of barangay sites are made through an ordinance and not resolution; and, (4) they acted in good faith. In their Motion for Reconsideration, they did not invoke their right to speedy disposition of cases. On June 4, 2014, Sulapas filed an Affidavit of Desistance wherein he declared: '4. The truth of the matter is that the case is just a product of political conflict. x x x 5. After long consideration of the circumstances and facts surrounding the case, I can honestly say that what arose was a simple misapprehension of facts. That the respondents in question had no intention to falsify the document.' Despite such Affidavit, Ombudsman Mindanao issued an Order dated August 4, 2014 denying petitioners' motion for reconsideration.","The Court applies the rules set forth in Cagang v. Sandiganbayan. The reckoning point for determining delay is April 7, 2009, when the preliminary investigation commenced. Up to the approval of the assailed resolution (April 25, 2014), five (5) years have already passed, going beyond the ten (10) day period required by the Rules of Court (applied suppletorily). The Ombudsman Mindanao's excuse that the delay was due to the voluminous number of cases being handled by the assigned investigating officer is untenable, especially since the crime (falsification of document) is not of extraordinary complication. However, petitioners, except for Plaza, acquiesced to the delay and failed to timely raise their right, amounting to laches, as they waited five years after filing their counter-affidavits before raising the issue in their Petition for Certiorari before this Court. Hence, the Court finds that petitioners, except for Plaza, waived their right to a speedy disposition of case. With that said, Ombudsman Mindanao did not commit grave abuse of discretion in issuing the Resolution dated April 14, 2014 and the Order dated August 4, 2014 finding probable cause to indict petitioners, with the exception of Plaza. Respondent committed grave abuse of discretion in indicting petitioner Plaza, who timely asserted his right after being impleaded, having been unaware of the ongoing investigation for almost five years due to the Ombudsman’s inadvertence.","ACCORDINGLY, the petition is PARTIALLY GRANTED. The assailed Resolution dated April 14, 2014 and the Order dated August 4, 2014 of the Office of the Ombudsman for Mindanao is ANNULLED and SET ASIDE in so far as petitioner Charlito B. Plaza is concerned, in view of the violation of his right to a speedy disposition of cases. The Office of the Ombudsman for Mindanao is hereby enjoined from filing an Information against petitioner Charlito B. Plaza. The petition is hereby DENIED with respect to petitioners Nemia T. Magaluna, Anecia C. Pore, Edelyn D. Espejon, Hennes P. Forcadilla, Eutiquio C. Paler, and Glendale F. Escatron. SO ORDERED.",PARTIALLY GRANTED
"G.R. No. 249668, July 13, 2022","CITY OF DAVAO AND BELLA LINDA N. TANJILI, IN HER OFFICIAL CAPACITY AS CITY TREASURER OF DAVAO CITY, PETITIONERS, VS. ARC INVESTORS, INC., RESPONDENT.","ARCII is a domestic corporation whose primary purpose includes purchasing, subscribing for, or otherwise acquiring and owning, holding, using, selling, assigning, transferring, mortgaging, pledging, exchanging, or otherwise disposing of real or personal property of every kind and description, including shares of stock, provided however that the Corporation shall not act as an investment company or a securities broker and/or dealer nor exercise the functions of a trust corporation. In 2010, ARCII earned P801,634,060.07, by way of dividends from its preferred shares of stocks in San Miguel Corporation (SMC) and interests on its money market placements. On January 20, 2014, the City of Davao and Bella Linda N. Tanjili, in her official capacity as City Treasurer of Davao, (petitioners) assessed ARCII of local business taxes (LBT) in the amount of P4,381,431.90, equivalent to 0.55% of the foregoing dividends and interests for the third and fourth quarters of 2011. ARCII filed a written administrative protest, characterizing the assessment as erroneous and illegal, arguing it is not a bank or financial institution, its receipt of dividends and interests is merely incidental, and citing Section 27(D) of RA 8424 (NIRC) and the COCOFED ruling regarding the public character of the SMC shares. The Regional Trial Court (RTC) denied ARCII's petition, ruling that ARCII is engaged in business as a financial intermediary and subject to LBT under Section 143(f), in relation to Section 151, of the LGC. ARCII appealed to the CTA Division, which reversed the RTC and cancelled the assessment. The CTA En Banc affirmed the CTA Division, holding that ARCII cannot be considered either as a financial intermediary or a non-bank financial intermediary (NBFI) based on lack of BSP authorization, its functions not principally relating to NBFI activities, and lack of showing of regularity and recurrence.","The Court of Tax Appeals, En Banc (CTA En Banc) sustained the CTA Division in canceling and setting aside the assessment against respondent ARC Investors, Inc. (ARCII) for local business taxes.","The Court holds in the negative. ARCII is not an NBFI subject to LBT under Section 143(f), in relation to Section 151, of the LGC. To be considered an NBFI, the entity must be authorized by the BSP to perform quasi-banking functions, its principal functions must include the lending, investing or placement of funds, and these functions must be performed on a regular and recurring basis. ARCII is one of the 14 CIIF holding companies established to own and hold SMC shares of stock, which are government assets used only for the benefit of coconut farmers. The management of dividends derived from the SMC preferred shares of stock, including placing them in interest yielding market, does not of itself amount to doing business, either as a bank or other financial institution, i.e., an NBFI, because it is merely incidental to its restricted underlying purpose as a CIIF holding company. Lacking in the element of regularity or recurrence for the purpose of earning a profit, ARCII's money market placements cannot amount to 'doing business' as an NBFI. Furthermore, interest, dividends, and gains from sale of shares are merely passive investment income for non-bank and non-financial institutions and are not subject to local business tax.","WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED. The Decision dated January 29, 2019 and the Resolution dated September 11, 2019 of the Court of Tax Appeals, En Banc in CTA EB No. 1589 are AFFIRMED."
"G.R. No. 249178, July 13, 2022","AIDA EGMALIS-KE-EG, PETITIONER, VS. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","The case stemmed from the petition for declaration of nullity of marriage under Article 36 of the Family Code filed by Aida against Ireneo before the RTC. Aida and Ireneo met in high school and dated. In 1982, Aida became pregnant. To avoid embarrassment to the Kankana-ey Tribe, elders compelled them to marry on January 18, 1983. Ireneo was jobless, preferred drinking with friends, and was irresponsible. Aida relied on both families for support. After their son, Kurk, was born on July 2, 1983, Ireneo still failed to secure a job or provide support. Aida worked abroad (Baguio, Singapore, Hong Kong, England) as a domestic helper to support Kurk and her family. Since 1988, Aida and Ireneo ceased communication, and Aida learned Ireneo was involved in a murder case. A psychologist, Ms. Nabua, diagnosed Ireneo with Antisocial Personality Disorder and Aida with Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder. The RTC declared the marriage null and void ab initio due to the psychological incapacity of both parties. The OSG appealed to the CA, which reversed the RTC, holding that Aida failed to prove Ireneo’s psychological incapacity met the standards of juridical antecedence, gravity, and incurability, finding only emotional immaturity and irresponsibility.","In the assailed Decision dated October 29, 2018, the CA granted the OSG's appeal and reversed and set aside the RTC Decision dated February 1, 2017. The CA found the totality of the evidence insufficient to establish Ireneo's psychological incapacity. It held that Aida failed to prove that Ireneo's psychological incapacity is characterized by juridical antecedence, gravity, and incurability. For the CA, at best, what Aida managed to prove was Ireneo's emotional immaturity and irresponsibility as a husband and a father. The CA further ruled that the marriage cannot be nullified on the ground of Aida's supposed psychological incapacity as it was not averred in her petition. In the Resolution dated July 24, 2019, the CA denied Aida's Motion for Reconsideration.","The petition has merit. The marriage between Ireneo and Aida is null and void ab initio on the ground that Ireneo is psychologically incapacitated to assume the essential obligations of marriage. The Court applied the standards set in Tan-Andal v. Andal, abandoning the second Molina guideline pertaining to the requirement of juridical antecedence and clarifying incurability in the legal sense. The totality of evidence, including the diagnosis of Antisocial Personality Disorder, clearly and convincingly showed Ireneo's psychological incapacity (characterized by gravity, juridical antecedence, and incurability in the legal sense) manifested through his irresponsibility, habitual drinking, failure to secure a job or support his family, and lack of communication. The RTC erred in declaring Aida psychologically incapacitated because the RTC is precluded from granting a relief not prayed for in the pleadings (Aida only prayed for nullity based on Ireneo's incapacity), and in any case, the evidence did not show that Aida was psychologically incapacitated, as she exerted efforts to contribute to the marriage.","WHEREFORE, the petition for review is GRANTED. The Decision dated October 29, 2018 and the Resolution dated July 24, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 108998 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The marriage between petitioner Aida Egmalis-Ke-eg and Ireneo Ke-eg is declared null and void ab initio."

PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","At around 10:00 p.m. of July 9, 2015, a confidential informant (CI) tipped off the Station Anti-Illegal Drugs-Special Operation Task Group operatives of Talipapa Police Station, Quezon City that a certain Sandra Young (Young), who had been a subject of past surveillance operations on illegal drug activity in Quezon City, was selling illegal drugs at Certeza Compound, Luzon Ave., Brgy. Culiat, Quezon City. The police chief immediately formed a buy-bust operation team composed of Police Officer 1 John Paul Rebustes (PO1 Rebustes) as poseur-buyer, and Senior Police Officer 1 Johnny Mahilum and Police Officer 1 Erwin Fegason as back-ups. The team, together with the CI, proceeded to the Certeza Compound. Upon arrival, the CI received a phone call from Young instructing them to meet her on Commonwealth Ave. corner San Simon St., Brgy. Holy Spirit. The team arrived at the new designated area and waited for Young to arrive. The CI received another phone call from Young instructing them to meet her at the agreed-upon spot. At around 12:00 a.m., a black Honda CRY arrived driven by Young and accompanied by petitioner. Then, the CI and PO1 Rebustes were ordered to board the back seat of the vehicle. Inside the vehicle, Young ordered PO1 Rebustes to give payment to petitioner, who in turn handed one heat-sealed plastic sachet of suspected shabu to PO1 Rebustes. Unable to execute the pre-arranged signal, PO1 Rebustes decided to introduce himself as a police officer, and attempted to arrest Young and petitioner. Young floored the accelerator and sped off. The CI managed to jump from the car, while petitioner wrestled with PO1 Rebustes. At the Quezon City Circle, Young rammed the car into a gutter and got stuck. Young was able to escape, while petitioner and PO1 Rebustes continued wrestling each other. The back-up officers then arrived and helped PO1 Rebustes apprehend petitioner. PO1 Rebustes conducted a body search on petitioner and recovered from his waist a Norinco caliber 9mm gun with serial number 160447275 loaded with five pieces of live ammunition. The search also yielded two small heat-sealed transparent plastic sachets containing suspected shabu. The vehicle was likewise searched and two small heat-sealed transparent plastic sachets containing suspected shabu were recovered from the dashboard drawer. The police officers brought petitioner to the police station. PO1 Rebustes marked the firearm with JPR/PC-10-07-15, and the ammunitions with JPR/PC-2-10-07-15, JPR/PC-3-10-07-15, JPR/PC-4-10-07-15, JPR/PC-5-10-07-15, JPR/PC-6-10-07-15 in the presence of petitioner. During trial, PO1 Rebustes was able to identify the loaded firearm as the same one he recovered from petitioner based on the markings he made. During his cross-examination, petitioner admitted that he did not have a license to own or possess a gun, or previously applied for such. Petitioner denied the charge. He alleged that on that night, he received a text message from his friend that her car stalled near 'COA' (Commission on Audit Building) because of a flat tire. When he arrived there, some individuals approached him and asked him to go with them to the police station. On board a van, petitioner claimed that these persons asked him who the owner of the gun was; however, they did not show him any gun of sorts nor recover any from him. When they arrived at the police station, petitioner was arrested.","In its March 21, 2018 Decision, the RTC convicted petitioner for Illegal Possession of Firearms. Evidence show that petitioner was found in possession of a firearm with live ammunition without the requisite license. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the conviction, ruling that petitioner's warrantless arrest was valid, leading to a valid incidental search. It found that the elements of Illegal Possession of Firearms were proved, specifically noting that the second element (lack of license) was established by petitioner's admission in court.","The Court ruled that petitioner's warrantless arrest was valid, as he was caught in flagrante delicto during the buy-bust operation for illegal sale of dangerous drugs (Section 5, RA 9165). Consequently, the warrantless search incidental to that lawful arrest, which yielded the subject firearm and ammunition, was also valid and the evidence admissible. Regarding the elements of Illegal Possession of Firearms (RA 10591), the first element (existence of the firearm) was established by positive identification. For the second element (lack of license), the Court held that petitioner's own judicial admission during cross-examination (stating he did not have and had never applied for a license) was sufficient proof beyond reasonable doubt, dispensing with the need for a negative certification from the PNP.","The Petition is DENIED. The October 14, 2019 Decision and October 9, 2020 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 42335 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. Petitioner Paulo Castil y Alvero is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 28, paragraphs (a) and (e) of Republic Act No. 10591, otherwise known as the ""Comprehensive Firearms and Ammunition Regulation Act."" He is sentenced to suffer the penalty of imprisonment for a period of eight (8) years, eight (8) months, and one (1) day of prision mayor in its medium period, as minimum, to ten (10) years, eight (8) months, and one (1) day of prision mayor in its maximum period, as maximum."

ORTILE [.] IN HIS CAPACITY AS DEPUTY ADMINISTRATOR OF THE LAND REGISTRATION AUTHORITY AND REGISTER OF DEEDS, CITY OF MANILA, RESPONDENTS.","Petitioner [Du] x x x averred that on June 25, 2008, Malayan x x x Savings and Mortgage Bank (Malayan Bank) purchased through a foreclosure sale, a parcel of land located at No. 2161 Taft Avenue, Malate, Manila covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 194618 (subject property). Thereafter, Malayan Bank entered into a memorandum of agreement (MOA) with petitioner [Du] and Primarosa B. Cuison (Cuison), wherein Malayan Bank agreed to sell the subject property for the amount of P20,500,000.00. Pursuant to the MOA, petitioner [Du] paid P11,000,000.00 as downpayment while Malayan Bank warranted that the subject property will be free from all liens and encumbrances by August 15, 2008. Malayan Bank incurred delays in performing its undertaking. Thus, petitioner [Du] sent a letter dated November 5, 2012 demanding Malayan Bank to fulfill its commitment. Still, Malayan Bank failed. On September 4, 2013, Malayan Bank informed petitioner [Du] that it cannot fulfill its undertaking to free the subject property from all liens and encumbrances as an action for annulment of the foreclosure sale of the subject property was filed by Melissa Tuason-Principe (Melissa Principe), heir of the subject property's former owner, Pacita Tuason-Principe. Malayan Bank advised petitioner [Du] that it shall return all the amounts paid including the interest pursuant to their MOA. When Melissa Principe successfully redeemed the subject property, Malayan Bank reiterated its intention to rescind the MOA which was rejected by petitioner [Du]. It was found that Melissa Principe was able to reacquire the subject property through a compromise agreement with Malayan Bank which was approved by the Regional Trial Court [(RTC)] of Manila Branch 17. Aggrieved petitioner [Du] filed a petition for annulment of judgment against Malayan Bank, George J. Martinez and Melissa Principe (annulment case) before [the CA) docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 141881. Thereafter, petitioner [Du] filed a notice of [lis pendens] before the Register of Deeds of Manila (Register of Deeds). On September 18, 2015, the Register of Deeds denied the registration of the notice of [lis pendens] on the ground that the registered owners of the subject property were not impleaded as parties in the petition. Petitioner [Du] filed an appeal by [consulta] before the Land Registration Authority (LRA) which was denied by [Ronald] Ortile [(Ortile)] in the assailed Resolution [dated June 6, 2018 of the LRA in Consulta No. 002-2015-000017 (LRA Resolution)). Aside from petitioner [Du's] failure to implead the registered owners in the petition, Ortile opined that a notice of [lis pendens] cannot be registered when the object of the proceeding is for the recovery of money. x x x Dissatisfied, petitioner [Du] filed [a petition for review via Rule 43 of the Rules of Court assailing the LRA Resolution]. The CA Decision denied the Rule 43 petition for review filed by petitioner Du.",The Petition lacks merit.,"The Court takes the view that Section 76 of PD 1529 and Section 19, Rule 13 of the Rules impliedly require the registered owner to be a party or be impleaded as a party to such pending case. This interpretation of the said provisions is evident from the very nature of the action wherein a notice of lis pendens is appropriate, or from the first requisite enunciated in Villanueva: “the property must be of such character as to be subject to the rule.” Since the rights of ownership are directly affected by the action, it is imperative that the registered owner/s, the very person/s appearing on the certificate of title as the owner/s, should be party/ies or impleaded as party/ies. Firstly, it is for the protection of the registered owner. Secondly, the annotation of a notice of lis pendens necessarily creates a cloud on the registered owner's certificate of title. x x x Thirdly, notifying the registered owner of the pendency of a case directly affecting the titled realty will prevent the commission of fraud upon the registered owner. And, fourthly, as noted by the CA and enunciated by the Court in Ver-Reyes, justice and fair play demand that the registered owner be made a party to the pending case; otherwise, the right of the registered owner to due process would be infringed. Given the foregoing reasons, the CA correctly ruled that the registered owners, Pacita Tuason and Pacita T. Principe, should first be impleaded as parties to the pending case. The Court fully agrees with the CA that despite her claim that Pacita Tuason and Pacita T. Principe are the same person, no evidence has been presented to prove the same and her assertion that Melissa Principe is the sole heir of Pacita Tuason and Pacita T. Principe remained unsubstantiated. The facts obtaining in Voluntad are incomparable to the facts of the instant case. Thus, Voluntad and the portion in Ver-Reyes reiterating Voluntad find no application in the present case.","WHEREFORE, the Petition is hereby DENIED. Accordingly, the Decision dated September 11, 2020 and Resolution dated February 10, 2021 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 156777 are AFFIRMED. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 254747, July 13, 2022","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. ROD ANGELES Y MANLAPAZ @ ""URO,"" ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","The case stemmed from an Information charging accused-appellant and his co-accused Ronnel Dela Vega (Ronnel), Marjune Lalikan (Marjune), Reymark Angeles (Reymark), and Jomar Mediola (Jomar), with Murder under Article 248 of the RPC in connection with the death of Joey Puro Toong (victim). The accusatory portion of the Information reads: That on or about the 15th day of July 2009, in Quezon City Philippines, the said accused conspiring together, confederating with and mutually helping one another with intent to kill, qualified by superior strength, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and employ personal violence upon the person of JOEY PURO TOONG, by then and there mauling and stabbing him[,] hitting him on the different parts of his body, thereby inflicting upon him serious and mortal wounds which were the direct and immediate cause of his untimely death, to the damage and prejudice of the heirs of said JOEY PURO TOONG. On 15 July 2009, at around 8:00 o'clock in the evening, prosecution witness Philip Baltes (Baltes), a friend of the victim, saw a group of about seven (7) to eight (8) male teenagers attack and maul the victim near the Bread Line Bakery. Baltes saw the victim stand but then the latter was dragged by Reymark towards the bakery. Five (5) of the assailants continued beating the victim, and then Baltes saw appellant stab and skewer the victim on the chest using a double-edged knife. After further mauling, the assailants fled. Accused-appellant denied the charge against him, insisting that he was in Tarlac City on July 15, 2009, the alleged date of the incident, having transferred there in October 2008 when he got married. On March 29, 2016, Baltes, testifying for the defense, retracted his previous testimony. He testified that he never saw accused-appellant and Ronnel on the night of July 15, 2009. He insisted that there was just a misunderstanding and that accused-appellant and Ronnel are both innocent.","The RTC rendered its Decision dated September 15, 2017 finding accused-appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Murder. However, it acquitted Ronnel of the charge. The dispositive portion of the Decision states: IN VIEW THEREOF, judgment is rendered as follows: 1. Accused RONNEL DELA VEGA y BUÑING is hereby ACQUITTED of the crime of Murder for insufficiency of evidence; and 2. Accused ROD ANGELES y MANLAPAZ is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of MURDER qualified by the aggravating circumstance of abuse of superior strength. The Court sentences ROD ANGELES y MANLAPAZ to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua. The RTC gave credence to the earlier testimony of Baltes and rejected the recantation made seven years later. In the assailed Decision dated February 10, 2020, the CA dismissed the appeal and affirmed in toto the RTC Decision; thus: FOR THESE REASONS, the instant appeal is hereby DISMISSED, and the appealed Decision dated 15 September 2017 rendered by Branch 215 of the National Capital Judicial Region of the Regional Trial Court (""RTC"") of Quezon City in Criminal Case No. Q-10-162801 is AFFIRMED in toto.","The Court finds no compelling reason to depart from the RTC and the CA's uniform factual findings. The Court affirms accused-appellant's conviction. All the elements of Murder were proven beyond reasonable doubt. Baltes, the lone prosecution eyewitness, testified in a categorical and straightforward manner that accused-appellant was one of the persons who stabbed the victim in the chest. The killing was attended by the qualifying circumstance of abuse of superior strength, given the notorious inequality of forces between the victim (alone and defenseless) and the numerous aggressors, including the accused-appellant. The courts a quo are correct in not giving credence to Baltes' recantation. A recantation does not necessarily cancel an earlier declaration, and the retraction made by Baltes in 2016, seven years after his initial statements and testimony, deserves scant consideration, especially since his earlier statements were spontaneous and detailed. Furthermore, the recantation was rendered questionable by accused-appellant's own filing of an Urgent Motion for Early Setting with Request for Subpoena Ad Testificandum dated March 22, 2016 wherein he informed the RTC that he and the private complainant successfully entered into an amicable settlement of the civil aspect of the case and that the witnesses for the prosecution were ready to recant their previous testimonies. Accused-appellant failed to substantiate his defenses of denial and alibi, as he failed to present clear and convincing evidence that it was physically impossible for him to travel from Tarlac City to Novaliches, Quezon City, where the crime was committed, considering he admitted being a resident of Novaliches.","WHEREFORE, the appeal is DISMISSED. The Decision dated February 10, 2020 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 10073 is AFFIRMED.

"A.C. No. 10294, July 12, 2022","MARYANNE MERRIAM B. GUEVARRA-CASTIL, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. EMELY REYES TRINIDAD, RESPONDENT.","The present case arose from a Complaint
[3]
dated November 29, 2013, filed by Maryanne Merriam B. Guevarra-Castil (Maryanne), accusing her husband, Orlando L. Castil, Jr. (Orlando), and Atty. Trinidad, of maintaining an extra- marital affair.
Maryanne narrated that Atty. Trinidad and Orlando are both officers of the Philippine National Police (PNP), and got to know each other by reason of their work. Several years back, Maryanne started receiving reports from friends and Orlando's co-workers of the pair's supposed fling. Consumed by her deep love for Orlando, Maryanne chose to shrug off these rumors and discount them as exactly that: rumors.
However, sometime in January of 2009, unable to contain the doubts and speculations any longer, Maryanne confronted Orlando. It was at this point that Orlando confirmed his infidelity with Atty. Trinidad – likewise a married woman.
[4]
Desperate to save her marriage, Maryanne contacted Atty. Trinidad to beg her to stop seeing Orlando, and end their romantic entanglement. However, instead of showing remorse, Atty. Trinidad allegedly insulted and demeaned Maryanne, bragging about her being a lawyer and a ranking PNP personnel. Atty. Trinidad allegedly said,
""kayang-kaya ko maging business[person] tulad mo, pero ikaw hindi mo kaya maging abogado tulad ko!""
[5]
Moreover, Atty. Trinidad belittled Maryanne, saying that any complaint against her would be futile because of her legal knowledge and position in the PNP. In one of their exchanges, Atty. Trinidad allegedly told Maryanne,
""kahit na ipatanggal mo ako sa trabaho ko, lawyer pa rin naman ako. Na hindi kamukha mo, pag nawala si Orlando wala nang mangyayari sa buhay mo!""
[6]
Maryanne recounted that after the incident, her marriage with Orlando started falling apart. However, her nightmare did not end there. One day, as she was cleaning their room, Maryanne stumbled upon a birth certificate. This surprised her because she and Orlando do not have any children. Upon perusal, Maryanne was shocked to see the child's name – and the indicated parents – Atty. Trinidad and Orlando. The birth certificate also contained an ""Affidavit of Acknowledgment/Admission of Paternity"" executed by Orlando. Maryanne confronted Orlando about the birth certificate and demanded from the latter an explanation. Eventually, Orlando admitted that the child, whose details are indicated in the birth certificate Maryanne found, belongs to him and Atty. Trinidad. Maryanne likewise alleged that Atty. Trinidad shamelessly flaunted online the fruit of their unfaithfulness by uploading, and posting photos of her with Orlando, and their child.
In her defense, Atty. Trinidad contended that she does not personally know Maryanne, nor does she have any knowledge of the latter's relationship with Orlando. Atty. Trinidad claimed that she only got to know of Maryanne being the wife of Orlando, when she started receiving complaints from the former. She likewise vehemently denied that she communicated with Maryanne, and asserted that the complaint filed against her is based on nothing but hearsay, self-serving claims, and illegally obtained documentary evidence. Nevertheless, Atty. Trinidad admitted that she had ""committed some acts which are not to be proud of.""
[7]","For Our review is Resolution No. XXII-2017-1086
[1]
issued by the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) Board of Governors (Board), which adopted the findings and recommendation
[2]
of the IBP Commission on Bar Discipline (Commission) to impose the ultimate penalty of disbarment against respondent Atty. Emely Reyes Trinidad (Atty. Trinidad), for violations of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR). The Court adopts the findings of the Commission, as affirmed by the Board, and sustains the imposition of the penalty of disbarment upon Atty. Trinidad.","The sole issue for the resolution of the Court is whether Atty. Trinidad should be disbarred for the acts complained of. The Court clarified the rules on jurisdiction over government lawyers, stating that if the allegations of malfeasance touch upon the errant lawyer's continuing obligations under the CPR and/or the Lawyer's Oath, making the lawyer unfit to practice the profession, the case properly lies before the Court. The Court held that Maryanne complained of Atty. Trinidad's illicit affair with Orlando – something which is totally unrelated to, and may be accomplished, even without Atty. Trinidad's position in the PNP. Assuming that these allegations are true, they make Atty. Trinidad unfit to be a member of the legal profession; thus, the Court has jurisdiction. The Court found that Atty. Trinidad's actions of maintaining an adulterous affair with Orlando, which even produced a child, falls under the definition of grossly immoral conduct, in violation of Canon 1, Rule 1.01, and Canon 7, Rule 7.03 of the CPR. These acts are not only grossly immoral and unlawful, but more importantly, ""adversely reflects on [Atty. Trinidad's] fitness to practice law.""
[35] Her failure to dispute the existence of the birth certificate and the other allegations signaled nothing but guilt and shame for the despicable acts committed.","WHEREFORE,
the Court finds respondent Atty. Emely Reyes Trinidad
GUILTY
of Gross Immorality, in violation of Canon 1, Rule 1.01, and Canon 7, Rule 7.03 of the Code of Professional Responsibility. Accordingly, she is hereby ordered
DISBARRED,

Bahia, an immediate financial audit on the books of accounts of the OCC, RTC, Davao City was ordered due to the continued failure of Clerk of Court VI Edipolo P. Sarabia, Jr. (Sarabia) to submit his monthly financial report of collections, deposits and withdrawals despite notice from the OCA's Financial Management Office's (FMO) Accounting Division. Pursuant to Travel Order No. 83-2015 dated August 7, 2015 issued by the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA), a financial audit was conducted by a team led by Mr. Romulo E. Tamanu, Jr. in the Office of the Clerk of Court OCC, RTC, Davao City. The extensive findings of the audit examination showed total initial computed shortages of Atty. Sarabia amounted to P16,704,893.46 across the Fiduciary Fund (FF), Judiciary Development Fund (JDF), Special Allowance for the Judiciary Fund (SAJF), and Sheriffs Trust Fund (STF), mainly resulting from his failure to deposit his Fiduciary Fund collections in full and intact, thereby appropriating them for personal use. The final computed grand total accountability (including undocumented withdrawals) was P18,458,356.64. The audit team also questioned Cash Clerk III Haydee B. Salazar's involvement, noting that she was in overall charge of safekeeping collections and, along with Sarabia, knew the safety vault combination lock, yet she failed to report Sarabia's alleged misappropriation of funds which spanned four (4) years. Executive Judge Emmanuel C. Carpio conducted a preliminary investigation and verbally reported suspicions about Salazar's sudden acquisition of a condominium unit and three cars, suggesting possible involvement. Sarabia submitted a one-page Memorandum dated April 4, 2016, admitting negligence and apologizing for failing to account for the shortage, attributing it to his full trust in the cash section staff. Salazar denied participation, justifying her assets through an affidavit from her live-in partner and her car rental business. Executive Judge Carpio found Salazar guilty of gross neglect of duty and dishonesty, and Marifi Oquindo guilty of simple neglect of duty, but recommended exoneration for Aimee May Agbayani and Orlando Marquez.","The Court adopted the OCA's recommendation partially, applying the recently promulgated amendments to Rule 140 of the Rules of Court retroactively.

Ms. Haydee B. Salazar was found guilty of Gross Neglect of Duty (for consciously allowing Sarabia to take possession of funds and failing to submit monthly reports) and Serious Dishonesty (for concealing Sarabia's criminal acts, causing grave prejudice to the government). Marifi A. Oquindo was found guilty of Serious Dishonesty, reclassifying the charge from simple neglect of duty, because her silence despite knowledge of Sarabia's malfeasance caused damage and prejudice to the government. Respondents Aimee May D. Agbayani and Orlando A. Marquez were exonerated due to insufficient substantial evidence proving they had personal knowledge of the wrongdoings, as their information was based merely on hearsay.","WHEREFORE, Atty. EDIPOLO P. SARABIA, JR., Clerk of Court VI, Office of the Clerk of Court, Regional Trial Court of Davao City, Davao del Sur, is hereby found GUILTY of Gross Misconduct, Gross Neglect of Duty, and Commission of a Crime Involving Moral Turpitude for malversation of public funds amounting to Eighteen Million Four Hundred Fifty-Eight Thousand Three Hundred Fifty-Six and 64/100 Pesos (P18,458,356.64). Accordingly, he is DISMISSED from the service, with forfeiture of all benefits, except accrued leave credits, and disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office, including government-owned or controlled corporations. The Court likewise FINDS and DECLARES Ms. HAYDEE B. SALAZAR, Cash Clerk III GUILTY of Gross Neglect of Duty, which allowed Atty.

Customs Administrative Order (CAO) No. 7-2011, issued on 15 July 2011, prescribing the official hours of work at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport and other international airports of entry; providing a shifting schedule of three 8-hour shifts for continuous 24-hour service; and stating the policy on night-shift differential pay. 1.1.2.

Memorandum, dated 10 August 2012, issued by BOC Commissioner Biazon addressed to all customs collectors, reiterating the 24/7 shifting schedule and stating that effective immediately, the BOC - applying government rates - shall pay any overtime work rendered by its personnel.

Customs Memorandum Circular[5] (CMC) No. 195-2012, dated 28 August 2012, issued by Commissioner Biazon addressed to all deputy commissioners, directors, division chiefs, collectors, officials and employees of the BOC, informing them that the 24/7 shifting schedule is being implemented to avoid rendering overtime work in response to the complaint of airline companies that they are paying for the overtime work rendered by government personnel assigned to customs, immigration and quarantine. On 7 March 2013, BOCEA filed the instant petition seeking to invalidate the foregoing administrative orders, circulars and memoranda issued by the Department of Finance and the Bureau of Customs, which put an end to the long practice of Customs employees charging overtime pay against private airlines and other private entities served. On the basis of their assertion that the discontinuance of the practice of charging private entities for overtime work has ""worsened the situation of the already economically dislocated customs personnel,""[6] petitioners posit that the assailed administrative issuances are unconstitutional, patently illegal and issued with grave abuse of discretion.",The petition is partly meritorious.,"In sum, the Court rules that respondents validly exercised the ordinance-making authority of the Executive to control work within the Bureau of Customs when they limited overtime work by implementing a shifting schedule through CAO No. 7-2011. On the other hand, respondents committed grave abuse of discretion correctible by certiorari when they prohibited Customs employees from collecting overtime pay from airline companies and other private entities prior to the effectivity of RA 10863 on 16 June 2016. It was only on such date when overtime work rendered by Customs employees became payable by the Bureau itself. Prior to 16 June 2016, the private airlines and other private entities served should have paid such overtime work actually rendered at rates not lower than those paid to employees of private enterprises, in accordance with Section 3506 of the Tariff and Customs Code.","WHEREFORE, the petition is PARTIALLY GRANTED.

SARMIENTO-FLORES, IN HER CAPACITY AS ACTING PRESIDING JUDGE OF BRANCH 69, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, TAGUIG CITY, AND ROSALINA SIBAL KNUTSON, RESPONDENTS.","In 2005, Randy Michael Knutson (Randy), an American citizen, met Rosalina Sibal Knutson (Rosalina) in Singapore. They got married and had a daughter named Rhuby Sibal Knutson (Rhuby). In 2011, the family lived in the Philippines. However, Randy and Rosalina became estranged after he discovered her extra-marital affairs. Anyhow, Randy supported Rosalina and Rhuby. Thereafter, Rosalina got hooked in casinos. Randy learned that Rosalina spent weeks in gambling dens and left Rhuby under the care of strangers. Worse, Rosalina incurred large debts from casino financiers prompting her to sell the house and lot, condominium unit, and vehicles that Randy provided for the family. Rosalina then rented an apartment and got herself a boyfriend. Randy advised Rosalina to be discreet in her illicit affairs because it is not good for Rhuby to see her mother with another man. Later, Randy discovered that Rosalina maltreated her own mother in Rhuby's presence. Rosalina also hurt Rhuby by pulling her hair, slapping her face and knocking her head. One time, Rosalina pointed a knife at Rhuby and threatened to kill her. Rosalina even texted Randy about her plan to kill their daughter and commit suicide. Randy reported the matter to the police station but the authorities explained that they cannot assist him in domestic issues. Afterwards, Rosalina sent Randy her naked pictures with a message that he would not see that body again. Meantime, the neighbors of Rosalina complained about noisy parties and pot sessions in her apartment. The lessor even terminated the lease after marijuana plants were confiscated in the premises.[2] On December 7, 2017, Randy, on behalf of minor Rhuby, filed against Rosalina a petition under RA No. 9262 for the issuance of Temporary and Permanent Protection Orders before the Regional Trial Court of Taguig City, Branch 69 (RTC) docketed as JDRC Case No. 313. Randy averred that Rosalina placed Rhuby in a harmful environment deleterious to her physical, emotional, moral, and psychological development.[3] In an Order[4] dated January 10, 2018, the RTC dismissed the petition explaining that protection and custody orders in RA No. 9262 cannot be issued against a mother who allegedly abused her own child. The RTC ratiocinated that the child's mother cannot be considered as an offender under the law. Moreover, the remedies are not available to the father because he is not a ""woman victim of violence.""[6] Randy moved for a reconsideration[8] and argued that RA No. 9262 used the term ""any person"" which is not limited to male offenders. In an Order[9] dated March 14, 2018, the RTC denied the motion and reiterated that RA No. 9262 does not apply to a situation where the mother committed violence against her own child. Aggrieved, Randy directly filed a Petition for Certiorari[12] before the Court.","The Supreme Court found that direct recourse to the Court was justified due to exceptions to the hierarchy of courts (case of first impression and public welfare). The Court held that the RTC committed grave abuse of discretion in dismissing the petition, finding that: (1) RA No. 9262 allows the father of the offended party to apply for protection and custody orders, and (2) RA No. 9262 covers a situation where the mother committed violent and abusive acts against her own child.","The RTC gravely abused its discretion by ignoring the evidence on the pretext that the father is not allowed to apply for protection and custody orders because he is not a woman victim of violence. Section 9 (b) of RA No. 9262 explicitly allows ""parents or guardians of the offended party"" to file a petition for protection orders, without distinguishing which parent may file. The ruling in Ocampo v. Arcaya-Chua is inapplicable because Randy filed the petition on behalf of the minor child Rhuby, not for himself. The definition of violence against women and their children under Section 3 (a) of RA 9262 applies to acts committed by ""any person"" (gender-neutral) against the woman OR against ""her child."" The restrictive interpretation by the RTC requiring the mother and child to both be victims violates the liberal construction mandate of Section 4 of RA No. 9262 and frustrates the law's policy of protecting children, especially since the penal provisions under Section 5 use the disjunctive term ""or."" Mothers may be offenders under RA No. 9262, and the law must be interpreted in keeping with the principle that right and justice prevail.","FOR THESE REASONS, the Petition for Certiorari is GRANTED. The Orders dated January 10, 2018 and March 14, 2018 of the Regional Trial Court of Taguig City, Branch 69 in JDRC Case No. 313 are SET ASIDE. Let a PERMANENT PROTECTION ORDER be issued immediately."
"A.C. No. 9161 [Formerly CBD Case No. 07-1925], July 12, 2022","MARIE JUDY BESA-EDELMAIER, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. RESTITUTO M. AREVALO, RESPONDENT.","In February 2003, complainant engaged the legal services of respondent, then a senior official of the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT), to pursue a monetary claim against MR Knitwear Specialist Phil., Inc. (MR Knitwear). Complainant, then an employee of the Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI), had receivables from MR Knitwear, a client of BPI, in the amount of approximately P10,000,000.00 arising out of several transactions under which complainant would supply foreign currency to Mr. Knitwear with interest. Respondent accepted the engagement and pegged his legal fees in the amount of One Million Pesos (P1,000,000.00), covering legal services up to the appellate level, to which complainant agreed. Respondent demanded an advance payment of Nine Hundred Thousand Pesos (P900,000.00), purportedly to be turned over to his law firm. Complainant acceded and in March 2003 she paid the amount of Eight Hundred Thousand Pesos (P800,000.00) in cash to respondent. In April 2003, she deposited the amount of One Hundred Thousand Pesos (P100,000.00) to respondent's bank account. At both instances, respondent did not issue receipts therefor. . . . respondent filed no case for complainant as of October 2003, thereby prompting the latter to terminate the services of the former and seek reimbursement of the P900,000.00 paid to him. However, respondent paid no heed to complainant's demand. . . . A month after receiving the foregoing letter [from IBP Commissioner], respondent met complainant, who was then accompanied by a certain Atty. Ysobel S. Yasay­ Murillo (Atty. Yasay-Murillo), in a coffee shop in Makati City. In that meeting, respondent refused to acknowledge receipt of the P800,000.00 cash from complainant, although he did so as to the P100,000.00 deposited to his bank account. . . . Her demand for reimbursement having fallen on deaf ears for years, complainant filed an administrative complaint against respondent before the IBP-CBD in February 2007. . . . On September 3, 2008, after several clarificatory hearings, Commissioner Oliver A. Cachapero (Commissioner Cachapero) of the IBP­ CBD issued a Report and Recommendation, finding respondent guilty of breaching his duties to complainant and to the legal profession and recommending that he be meted the penalty of disbarment. . . . During the pendency of the motion for reconsideration, respondent filed a Manifestation and Motion, in which he claimed that he, without admitting liability or abandoning his Motion, voluntarily returned the P900,000.00 to complainant by issuing several checks; complainant acknowledged receipt of the checks.","After a punctilious review of the case, the Court finds that respondent's actions fell short of the lofty standards imposed upon him as a member of the bar. . . . Accordingly, this Court finds it judicious to sustain the IBP Board of Governors' finding that respondent should be held administratively liable for his acts.","Plain as a pikestaff, respondent, despite having received from complainant a considerable amount of money as attorney's fees, failed to institute an action for collection of money against MR Knitwear - the very reason for which his legal services were engaged by complainant in the first place. . . . It is clear as day that respondent not only failed to file the collection of money suit against MR Knitwear - which, again, was the one thing for which he was engaged as a lawyer in the first place - but also kept complainant in the dark about why he never did so. This undoubtedly is a wanton violation of Canon 18 of the Code, particularly Rules 18.03 and 18.04. Moreover, his unjustified failure to reimburse the amounts paid in a timely manner despite consistent demand from his client is a clear violation of Rule 16.03 of the Code. . . . respondent prefatorily refused to acknowledge receipt of the P800,000.00 cash given to him by complainant as legal fees, only to turn around and later admit otherwise. Corollary thereto, respondent never issued receipts for the amounts he received in violation of Rule 16.01 of the Code. . . . Nevertheless, the Court finds the penalty of disbarment as recommended by the IBP too severe and harsh under the circumstances. . . . the Court finds it proper to consider the following circumstances in the determination of the appropriate penalty: first, this is respondent's first infraction, at least on record; second, respondent had actually reimbursed the entire amount which he received from complainant, albeit late in the day; and third, complainant seemed to have abandoned her administrative case against respondent after receiving the money from respondent, as evinced by her failure to participate in any meaningful manner in the proceedings before the Court. In précis, this Court finds and so holds that given the factual milieu of the case, a penalty of suspension from the practice of law for a period of two years is justified.","WHEREFORE, respondent Atty. Restituto M. Arevalo is hereby found GUILTY of violation of Canons 16 and 18 of the Code of Professional Responsibility. Accordingly, he is hereby SUSPENDED from the practice of law for a PERIOD OF TWO (2) YEARS, effective immediately upon his receipt of this Decision. He is STERNLY WARNED that a repetition of the same or similar acts will be dealt with more severely."
"G.R. No. 257450, July 11, 2022","IAN AGRAVANTE Y DE OCA, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","The instant case has its provenance in an Information charging petitioner Ian Agravante y De Oca with illegal possession of firearm and ammunition, defined and penalized under Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1866, as amended, the accusatory averments of which read: That on or about the 14th day of July 2012, in the City of Bacolod, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the herein [petitioner], did, then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have in his possession, custody and control and carry outside of his residence one (1) Improvised Homemade Firearm containing a cal. 357 live ammunition being chambered at the barrel, two (2) cal. 357 live ammunitions and one (1) .12 gauge live ammunition without a permit and/or authority duly and legally issued for that purpose, in violation of the aforementioned law. The prosecution averred that at around 3:10 a.m. of 14 July 2012, the Philippine National Police Mobile Patrol Group (PNP-MPG) received a call from a certain Engineer Vicente Genova (Genova) that several items were stolen from his vehicle. An informant, Romeo Tabigne (Tabigne), claimed that he witnessed the incident and named Rainhart Colangco, a certain Balweg, and petitioner as the perpetrators thereof. Around two o'clock in the afternoon of that fateful day, Tabigne led a team of police officers, including PO1 Teodorico, to a house where petitioner and his companions were purportedly staying. PO1 Teodorico peered inside the house through the spaces between the bamboo slats of the window and saw petitioner sleeping inside. They then entered the house and found two bags beside him, one of which was the Nike bag similar to that described by Genova as stolen from his vehicle. Upon opening the other bag, they discovered that it contained two pieces of .357 live ammunition and an improvised gun containing a live ammunition. When petitioner was frisked, a live ammunition for a shotgun was recovered from his pocket. Petitioner was arrested when he failed to show any license or authority to possess the seized firearms and ammunitions. Petitioner, in his defense, denied the charges, claiming he was merely exploring the plaza when he met his friend Tabigne, who led him to the house of a certain 'Bek-bek.' He was awakened when three people entered the house, pulled his shirt, punched him, and one of the intruders showed him an improvised firearm. On 28 September 2017, the RTC rendered a Decision finding petitioner guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violation of illegal possession of firearm and ammunition, defined and penalized under Section 1, Paragraph 2 of PD No. 1866, as amended by Republic Act (RA) No. 8294, and accordingly sentenced him to suffer the penalty of indeterminate imprisonment of four (4) years, two (2) months, and one (1) day of prision correccional, as minimum, to six (6) years, eight (8) months, and one (1) day of prision mayor, as maximum, and to pay a fine of P30,000.00. The CA affirmed petitioner's conviction in toto. It found that petitioner was validly arrested without a warrant under Section 5(b), Rule 113 of the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure and upheld the subsequent search pursuant to Section 13, Rule 126 thereof.","WHEREFORE, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is hereby GRANTED. The Decision dated 8 September 2020 and the Resolution dated 27 May 2021 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CEB-CR No. 03144 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE.","The Court finds and so holds that the acquittal of petitioner for the crime charged is in order. The foregoing circumstances distinctly demonstrate that petitioner's arrest, contrary to the findings of the CA, failed to meet the required elements of a valid warrantless arrest under Sec. 5 (b) of Rule 113 as one, the police officers did not have personal knowledge of any fact or circumstance indicating that petitioner had just committed an offense; and two, petitioner's warrantless arrest was not attended by the element of immediacy. By the time the police officers effected the warrantless arrest upon petitioner's person, investigation and verification proceedings were already conducted and the police officers acquired sufficient information on the suspects of theft. Instead, notwithstanding the possession of such information and the passing of 11 hours from the report of the crime, the police officers opted to conduct a 'hot pursuit' operation that, unfortunately, failed to meet the legal requirements therefor. There being no valid warrantless arrest under Sec. 5 (b) of Rule 113, the CA committed reversible error in ruling that petitioner was lawfully arrested. As a consequence of petitioner's unlawful warrantless arrest, it necessarily follows that there could have been no valid search incidental to a lawful arrest. Further, it is emphasized that the search was made even before petitioner was arrested, violating the cardinal rule that there must first be a lawful arrest before a search can be made. The waiver to question an illegal arrest only affects the jurisdiction of the court over his person, but does not constitute a waiver of the inadmissibility of evidence seized during an illegal warrantless arrest. Absent the requisite lawful arrest that must precede the search, such search cannot be considered legal and the pieces of evidence obtained therefrom are inadmissible.","Accordingly, petitioner Ian Agravante y De Oca is ACQUITTED of the crime of Illegal Possession of Firearm and Ammunition, defined and penalized under Section 1, Paragraph 2 of Presidential Decree No. 1866, as amended."

No. 3019) that on December 2, 2009, Marty, Municipal Mayor of Sta. Cruz, Zambales, issued a Memorandum directing the Municipal Treasurer not to accept payment of occupation fees from holders of MPSA (Mineral Production-Sharing Agreement) without Mayor's permit, thereby preventing Zambales Diversified Metals Corporation (ZDMC) from paying the fees and conducting operations, causing undue damage to ZDMC, the Province of Zambales and the Municipality of Sta. Cruz. Criminal Case No. SB-17-CRM-0051 (Violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019) that in April 2011, Marty refused to issue/grant business permits to ZDMC and Zambales Chromite Mining Company, Inc. (ZCMC) despite their compliance, causing undue damage to said entities. Criminal Case No. SB-17-CRM-0052 (Usurpation of legislative powers under Article 239 of the RPC) that on December 2, 2009, Marty encroached upon the lawmaking power of Congress by issuing the Memorandum making a Mayor's Permit a prerequisite for accepting occupation fees under R.A. 7942. ZDMC was a holder of MPSA No. 191-2004-III. On December 2, 2009, Marty issued the Memorandum. On July 6, 2010, the Office of the Municipal Treasurer refused ZDMC's tender of payment for occupation fees (P113,550.00) because clearance from Mayor Marty's office was required. In April 2011, Marty denied business permit applications from ZCMC and ZDMC, requiring additional requirements like an Environment Protection and Enhancement Program (EPEP) and a Social Development and Management Program (SDMP) approved by the concerned government agency, which he claimed were incomplete. Marty argued his actions were based on promoting the general welfare of the people due to the threat posed by the mining industry to the environment. The Sandiganbayan denied Marty's Motion to Quash and Demurrer to Evidence without leave.","In its Decision dated February 15, 2019, the Sandiganbayan found Marty guilty of violating Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 in Criminal Case No. SB-17-CRM-0050 and usurpation of legislative powers under Article 239 of the RPC in Criminal Case No. SB-17-CRM-0052. It, however, acquitted Marty of violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 in Criminal Case No. SB-17-CRM-0051.

Accordingly, he is hereby sentenced to suffer the indeterminate penalty of six (6) years and one (1) month, as minimum, to ten (10) years, as maximum, and to suffer the penalty of perpetual disqualification from holding public office. 2. In Criminal Case No. SB-17-CRM-0051, for violation of Section 3 (e) of R.A.

In Criminal Case No. SB-17-CRM-0052, the Court finds accused Luisito E.

KENNETH JOHN GRAHAM AND JOCELYN ORDINARYO, ACCUSED; ROSARIO CRASTE Y SOLAYAO, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","Private complainants BBB 253287, aged 16 years old; III 253287, 14 years old; and JJJ 253287, 16 years old, were former employees at xxxxxxxxxxx located at xxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx. On March 19, 2012, they sought the help of Barangay Chairperson Rodelio Mamac (Chairperson Mamac) to file criminal charges against Rosario and her co-accused Kenneth John Graham (Kenneth) and Jocelyn Ordinaryo (Jocelyn). They alleged that Rosario recruited them to work at xxxxxxxxxxx, allegedly owned by Kenneth and managed by Jocelyn. They were forced to engage in prostitution and made to dance wearing only their underwear, specifically panties and bra. Customers who avail of a girl's service, which includes taking them out of the bar and performing sexual services, were charged a ""bar fine"" of PHP 1,800.00. Rosario acts as their pimp and Jocelyn constantly checks on them. Meanwhile, Kenneth collects money everyday from the cashier. After work, they stayed at xxxxxxxxxxx and were not allowed to go out except when they report for work at xxxxxxxxxxx. On March 24, 2012, Police Superintendent Jacqueline Puapo (P/Supt. Puapo) led a surveillance operation. On March 31, 2012, P/Supt. Puapo performed an entrapment operation using marked money and foreigner assets. P/Supt. Puapo entered xxxxxxxxxxx and observed for about 30 minutes then called the attention of ""mamasang"" Mommy Rose (later identified as Rosario). Rosario asked them to choose a girl for sexual services for a bar fine of PHP 1,800.00. After P/Supt. Puapo gave Rosario the PHP 2,000.00 in marked money, the search warrant was implemented. The entrapment resulted in the arrest of Rosario and Kenneth, and the rescue of 17 victims. Rosario, Kenneth, and Jocelyn were charged in eight Informations with Qualified Trafficking in Persons (violations of RA No. 9208). During trial, Kenneth died, resulting in the dismissal of cases against him. Rosario presented the defense of denial, claiming she was merely instigated by a certain Mommy Lai to be pointed to as the perpetrator.","In a Judgment dated May 2, 2017, the RTC adjudged Rosario guilty of eight counts of qualified trafficking in persons in Criminal Case Nos. 12-8901 to 12-8907 and 12-8910. The trial court sentenced her to suffer LIFE IMPRISONMENT and to pay a fine of One Million Pesos ([PHP] 1,000,000.00) in each of these cases. She was acquitted in Criminal Case Nos. 12-8908 and 12-8909. In a Decision dated October 14, 2019, the CA affirmed the RTC's ruling with modification as to the fine and damages, ordering Rosario to pay in each case: (1) [F]ine in the amount of [PHP] 2,000,000.00; (2) [PHP] 500,000.00 as moral damages; and (3) [PHP] 100,000.00 as exemplary damages.","The Supreme Court found that the police operatives conducted a valid entrapment operation, not instigation, as Rosario was predisposed to commit the offense. Her defense of instigation was also incompatible with her defense of denial. The alleged inconsistencies in the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses were deemed immaterial as they did not relate to the elements of the crime. For Criminal Case Nos. 12-8902, 12-8904, 12-8905, 12-8906, and 12-8910, Rosario was properly convicted of qualified trafficking in persons because the victims (BBB 253287, JJJ 253287, III 253287, OOO 253287, and DDD 253287) were minors recruited and maintained for prostitution, qualifying the offense under Section 6(a) of RA No. 9208. For Criminal Case Nos. 12-8901 (AAA 253287) and 12-8907 (LLL 253287), the RTC erred in admitting their sworn statements as exceptions to the hearsay rule, as the prosecution failed to present the victims as witnesses and failed to prove their unavailability as required by the Child Witness Rule, resulting in Rosario's acquittal in these two cases. For Criminal Case No. 12-8903 (Large Scale), Rosario was properly convicted. However, victims already subject to conviction in individual cases (BBB 253287, DDD 253287, III 253287, JJJ 253287, and OOO 253287) cannot be awarded damages again due to the proscription against double jeopardy (identity of elements). Damages were limited to victims GGG 253287, FFF 253287, and KKK 253287 in this case.","ACCORDINGLY, the appeal is PARTLY GRANTED.

AZ 17/31 REALTY, INC., RESPONDENT.","AZ 17/31 Realty, Inc., a close corporation, was incorporated on April 23, 2008. Locsin-Garcia sought to revoke the incorporation and registration on the ground of fraud, alleging that one of the incorporators, Pacita Javier, had been dead since August 17, 2004 (three and a half years prior to incorporation), and her signature in the Articles of Incorporation (AOI) was falsified. Per verification, the SEC's Compliance and Enforcement Department found that Pacita died on August 17, 2004. The SEC-CRMD, affirmed by the SEC-En Banc, ordered the revocation of AZ 17/31 Realty, Inc.'s certificate of registration, ruling that Pacita lacked legal capacity and the misrepresentation constituted fraud. AZ 17/31 Realty, Inc. appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA), arguing Pacita's inclusion was surplusage as the minimum requirement for incorporators was met, and the act was done to perpetuate her memory, not commit fraud. The CA reversed the SEC order and lifted the revocation. Locsin-Garcia and the SEC filed separate Petitions for Review on certiorari before the Supreme Court.","ACCORDINGLY, the petition of the Securities and Exchange Commission in G.R. No. 239010 is DENIED on ground that it is not a real party in interest. The petition of Azucena Locsin-Garcia in G.R. No. 240888 is also DENIED and the Decision dated April 24, 2018 and Resolution dated July 16, 2018 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 152300 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION.","The Supreme Court denied the SEC's petition (G.R. No. 239010) for lack of capacity to sue, as a quasi-judicial body is not a real party in interest. On Locsin-Garcia's petition (G.R. No. 240888), the Court ruled that the inclusion of the deceased Pacita Javier as an incorporator did not constitute fraud warranting revocation of the certificate of registration under PD No. 902-A. Fraud for revocation contemplates either (1) a dominant intention of pursuing a fraudulent business purpose, or (2) misrepresentations in the AOI to meet the minimum qualifications for incorporation. Since AZ 17/31 Realty, Inc. had seven incorporators (more than the required minimum of five) and met the minimum required paid-up capital even without Pacita's contribution, the error was not fraud for dissolution. However, the deceased Pacita had no legal capacity to be an incorporator. Instead of dissolution, the SEC should have ordered AZ 17/31 Realty, Inc. to amend its AOI pursuant to Section 103 in relation to Section 17 of BP Blg. 68 to correct the erroneous inclusion.","AZ 17/31 Realty, Inc. is ORDERED to: 1.) AMEND its Articles of Incorporation and drop Pacita Javier as incorporator within six (6) months from notice of this Decision; and 2.) RETURN the property of Pacita Javier, including its accrued earnings, to her estate.

MARTINEZ, PETITIONERS, vs. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","The Information dated 25 March 2009 filed before the CTA First Division charged petitioners Alicia O. Fernandez (Corporate Secretary), Anthony Joey S. Tan (Vice-President), Reynaldo V. Cesa (President), and Edgardo V. Martinez (Treasurer), all officers of Kingson Trading International Corporation (Kingson), with violation of Section 3602, in relation to Section 2503, of the TCCP and RA 7103. The charge alleged that on or about 06 May 2006 to 21 July 2006, the accused conspired to knowingly, willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously import, misdeclare, misclassify and undervalue a shipment of 2,406 bundles of steel bars (valued at PhP89,737,127.00) through the use of falsified/spurious shipping documents to evade payment of correct duties and taxes amounting to PhP15,870,438.00. The customs examiner found that the shipment, declared as 'round bars' with a 1% tariff rate, were actually 'rebars' carrying a 7% rate, and noted undervaluation ($0.26/kg instead of $0.48/kg). A Warrant of Seizure and Detention (WSD) was issued. The Office of the District Collector received an alleged chemical analysis report from MIRDC, which the OIC of MIRDC later declared as 'not authentic' and 'not issued by the MIRDC'. Counterpart export documents secured by the Philippine Embassy in Beijing from GAC-PRC showed significant discrepancies, including the consignee's name (Solid Sea Products H.K. vs. Kingson) and the value of shipment (Kingson declared US$692,254.00, while counterpart documents showed US$1,281,271.86), representing an undervaluation of more than 30%. The shipment was subsequently forfeited in favor of the government for violation of the TCCP. Petitioners pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges, and trial ensued.","The Court of Tax Appeals En Banc affirmed the CTA First Division's Decision dated 20 September 2017 in CTA Crim. Case No. O-133, finding petitioners Alicia O. Fernandez, Anthony Joey S. Tan, Reynaldo V. Cesa, and Edgardo V. Martinez, guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Section 3602, in relation to Section 2503, of the TCCP, and sentencing them to an indeterminate penalty of imprisonment of eight (8) years and one (1) day, as minimum, to ten (10) years, as maximum, and to each pay a fine of Eight Thousand Pesos (PhP8,000.00). The CTA En Banc upheld the finding that the misdeclaration and undervaluation of more than 30% constituted prima facie evidence of fraud and that petitioners, as responsible corporate officers, failed to rebut the presumption of fraud and were aware of the unlawful transaction.","The Court resolved to deny the instant Petition for Review on Certiorari. The Court ruled that the issues raised by petitioners (lack of fraud, lack of knowledge/participation) involve questions of fact and are generally beyond the scope of a Rule 45 petition. The Court affirmed the factual findings of the CTA En Banc and CTA First Division, holding that all essential elements of violation of Section 3602, in relation to Section 2503 of the TCCP, were established by the prosecution. Specifically, the undervaluation of the shipment by more than 30% constitutes prima facie evidence of fraud, which petitioners failed to overcome. The Court emphasized that the existence of the corporate entity does not shield from prosecution the corporate agent who knowingly and intentionally caused the corporation to commit a crime. Petitioners, as responsible corporate officers, assented to Kingson's unlawful acts or were grossly negligent in directing the corporate affairs, particularly petitioner Fernandez who signed the Import Entry and Internal Revenue Declaration containing the fraudulent information.","WHEREFORE, the Petition is DENIED. The Decision dated 27 September 2019 of the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc in CTA Crim. Case No. 048 is hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. Petitioners ALICIA O. FERNANDEZ, ANTHONY JOEY S. TAN, REYNALDO V. CESA, and EDGARDO V. MARTINEZ are GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of violating Section 3602, in relation to Section 2503, of the Tariff and Customs Code of the Philippines. They are SENTENCED to suffer an indeterminate penalty of imprisonment of eight (8) years and one (1) day, as minimum, to twelve (12) years, as maximum, and are ORDERED to each pay a fine of Eight Thousand Pesos (P8,000.00)."
"G.R. Nos. 247414-18, July 06, 2022","ROLANDO MAGAÑA PACURIBOT, PETITIONER, VS. HONORABLE SANDIGANBAYAN (SECOND DIVISION) AND PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENTS.","Petitioner Rolando Magaña Pacuribot (Pacuribot), at the time of filing of the Petition, was the City Engineer of Cagayan de Oro City. On February 3, 2015, one Antonio M. Nuñez, Jr. (Nuñez) filed a complaint against Pacuribot and several other former officials of the province of Misamis Oriental, charging them with illegally awarding lease contracts of various machinery and heavy equipment to Equiprent Corporation (Equiprent) and Earth Tools Development Corporation (Earth Tools) without the benefit of public bidding and despite the two corporations being mere dummies, as they had the same set of officers.[10] Nuñez's complaint was referred to the Office of the Ombudsman (OMB)-Mindanao Field Investigation Unit (FIU) which, after conducting a fact-finding investigation, subsequently filed several Complaints against Pacuribot and his then co-respondents for twenty-four (24) counts of violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. (RA) 3019,[11] four (4) counts of falsification of public documents under Article 171, paragraph 2 of the Revised Penal Code, and twenty-four (24) administrative cases for Grave Misconduct.[12] The FIU's investigation was concluded on October 30, 2015, and adopted the observations contained in the Special Audit Report for 2007 to 2012 issued by the Commission on Audit.[13] After the parties were given the opportunity to respond to the complaints, the OMB Mindanao prepared Resolutions finding probable cause against Pacuribot and his co-respondents for violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019.[20] These Resolutions were submitted for the approval of then Ombudsman Conchita Carpio Morales (Ombudsman Carpio Morales), and became the basis of filing various Informations before the Sandiganbayan. On May 18, 2018, Pacuribot filed Omnibus Motions (with Urgent Prayer to Defer Arraignment) in Criminal Case Nos. SB-18-CRM-0137,[32] SB-18-CRM-0274,[33] and SB-18-CRM-0229.[34] On July 10, 2018, he filed a similar Omnibus Motion in Criminal Case Nos. SB-18-CRM-0395 and SB-18-CRM-0405.[35] All his Omnibus Motions sought to quash the five (5) informations on the ground that the facts charged therein do not constitute an offense, and that there was inordinate delay in the conduct of the preliminary investigation in violation of Pacuribot's right to speedy disposition of cases. The Sandiganbayan denied Pacuribot's Omnibus Motions on October 24, 2018 for Criminal Case No. SB-18-CRM-0137,[36] October 17, 2018 for Criminal Case No. SB-18-CRM-0229,[37] November 27, 2018 for Criminal Case Nos. SB-18-CRM-0395 and SB-18-CRM-0405,[38] and December 10, 2018 for Criminal Case No. SB-18-CRM-0274.[39] Pacuribot filed Motions for Reconsideration, which were also denied on March 4, 2019 for Criminal Case Nos. SB-18-CRM-0137, SB-18-CRM-0229, SB-18-CRM-0395 and SB-18-CRM-0405;[40] and on March 15, 2019 for Criminal Case No. SB-18-CRM-0274.[41] Hence, this Petition.","The Petition is impressed with merit. In the case of Cagang v. Sandiganbayan, 5th Division, Quezon City, et al.[43] (Cagang), the Court prescribed guidelines for analyzing cases involving alleged violations of the right to speedy disposition of cases. Applying the guidelines, the Court finds that there was delay by the OMB, specifically in the approval by the Ombudsman herself of the Resolutions finding probable cause, as well as in the filing of the Informations before the Sandiganbayan. Relevantly, Section 4, Rule 112 of the Rules of Court provides that, upon forwarding the record of the case by the investigating prosecutor to the Ombudsman or his/her deputy, the latter shall act thereon within ten (10) days from receipt and shall immediately inform the parties of such action. Clearly, in Pacuribot's case, there was a significant delay in this stage of the proceedings. The burden of proof shifted to the prosecution, but its justifications (complexity, volume of evidence) failed, as the delays occurred at stages (Ombudsman approval and filing of Information) where no further investigation or pleading was expected. These unjustified delays undoubtedly caused prejudice to Pacuribot. Lastly, consistent with Cagang, the Court finds that Pacuribot timely asserted his right to speedy disposition of his cases.","Given the foregoing, and consistent with the guidelines in Cagang, the Court finds that there was inordinate delay in the conduct of preliminary investigation against Pacuribot, and the cases against him should be dismissed due to Violation of his right to speedy disposition of cases. WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Petition is GRANTED.","The (a) Resolutions dated October 24, 2018 and March 4, 2019 in Criminal Case No. SB-18-CRM-0137, (b) Resolutions dated October 17, 2018 and March 4, 2019 in Criminal Case No. SB-18-CRM-0229, (c) Resolutions dated November 27, 2018 and March 4, 2019 in Criminal Case Nos.

"G.R. No. 206327, July 06, 2022","INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE BANK, PETITIONER, VS. RUDY S. LABOS AND ASSOCIATES, INC., SPS. RODOLFO S. LABOS AND CONSUELO R. LABOS, AND ROCKWELL LAND CORPORATION, RESPONDENTS.","The instant case stemmed from an action for sum of money with prayer for preliminary attachment[5] filed by herein petitioner International Exchange Bank (IEB), now Union Bank of the Philippines, against respondents Rudy S. Labos & Associates, Inc. (RSLAI), spouses Rodolfo S. Labos and Consuelo R. Labos (spouses Labos), and Rockwell Land Corporation (Rockwell).[6] The facts, as summarized by the RTC, are as follows: [The] factual antecedents of the case, as culled from the body of evidence, both testimonial & documentary[,] shows that [respondent] Rudy S. Labos & Associates, Inc. or RSLAI, represented by its President, [respondent] Rodolfo S. Labos, was granted by [IEB] a 10 million peso credit line under a Letter Agreement dated June 6, 2003 & Credit Agreement dated July 2, 2003. As partial security for the credit line & all availments thereunder, RSLAI assigned to [IEB] all its rights, title & interest over one (1) condominium unit identified as Unit 23-A Luna Gardens, Rockwell Center, Makati City under a Deed of Assignment dated July 2, 200[3] whereunder [respondent] RSLAI represented by Rodolfo S. Labos & [IEB] agreed not to sell, assign or transfer the assigned property to another person without the consent of the [IEB]. The condominium unit was purchased by RSLAI from [Rockwell] under a Contract to Sell dated December 20, 1999. As additional security for the credit line, Rodolfo S. Labos in his behalf & as attorney-in-fact of Consuelo R. Labos, executed a Continuing Surety Agreement dated July 2, 2003 in favor of [IEB]. [Respondent] RSLAI availed of its credit line under 1) Promissory Note No. 0210401052 dated January 30, 2004 in the amount of Php 3,240,000.00, 2) Promissory Note No. 02104012036 dated January 30, 2004 in the amount of Php 1,978,755.94, 3) Promissory Note No. 0210401044 dated January 30, 2004 in the amount of Php 920,000.00, & 4) Promissory Note No. 0210401061 in the amount of Php 3,300,000.00. All promissory notes [were to] mature on July 30, 2004. However, upon maturity of the promissory notes, RSLAI defaulted in the payment thereof. This prompted [IEB] to demand payment of the outstanding obligation under its demand letter dated September 8, 2004. Upon receipt of the demand letter, RSLAI, through Rodolfo S. Labos, requested for an extension of the maturity date of the subject promissory notes with the end view of restructuring its loan obligations. Pending negotiations for the loan restructure, [IEB] agreed to extend & consolidate all the outstanding promissory notes into one (I) promissory note, Promissory Note No. SCL04469 dated October 29, 2004 in the amount of Php 5,434,709.95 to mature on January 31, 2005. In the meantime, negotiations for a restructure of the loans failed. When Promissory Note No. SCL04469 matured on January 31, 2005, [respondent] RSLAI again, failed to pay. [IEB] sent demand letters both dated April 5, 2005 to RSLAI & the Sps. Labos. Per Statement of Account dated April 5, 2005, RSLAI and the Spouses Labos' total outstanding obligation amounted to Php 5,729,726.94. Despite demands for payment, RSLAI & the Sps. Labos failed to pay the [IEB]. [IEB]'s witness Vicente de Ocampo III declared in his Judicial Affidavit that because of the non-payment of the outstanding notes of RSLAI on their maturity dates, as well as Rodolfo S. Labos' request for extension, [IEB] wrote a letter dated August 31, 2004 to [Rockwell] to inquire about the status of the assigned condominium unit. In a letter dated September 9, 2004 from Rockwell's Assistant Vice President-Legal, Ma. Fe Carolyn Go-Pinoy, Rockwell confirmed that Rodolfo S. Labos wrote them on July 13, 2004 informing Rockwell of the transfer of ownership over the subject unit to JHL & Sons Realty, Inc. by virtue of a Deed of Assignment dated August 25, 2004. With the transfer of the assigned property, [IEB] lost substantial collateral for the loan of RSLAI. Notwithstanding the agreement under Section 2.04 of the Deed of Assignment that any transfer of the assigned property shall require the written conformity of [IEB], Rockwell allowed the transfer of the same by RSLAI to JHL & Sons Realty, Inc. without securing [IEB]'s written conformity. [IEB]'s letters to Rockwell dated October 5, 2004 & March 14, 2005, informed Rockwell of the latter's violation of the requirement of conformity under the Deed of Assignment & that it would institute action against Rockwell. [IEB] prays that [Rockwell] be made jointly and severally liable with RSLAI & the Spouses Labos for the amount of the unpaid loan of Php 5,729,726.94 as of April 5, 2005. In their [Answer], RSLAI averred by way of affirmative & negative defenses that the omnibus credit line granted by [IEB] to [RSLAI] was novated by the subsequent loan restructure. According to [RSLAI], the credit line granted by [IEB] in the amount of 10 million pesos on June 2003 for a term period of one (1) year or until July 30, 2004 was secured by several collaterals namely: 1) Continuing Surety Agreement in the amount of 10 million pesos executed by the Spouses Labos; 2) the Assignment of the Contract to Sell of Unit 23-A Luna Gardens, Rockwell Center worth 23 million pesos; & assignment of receivables from several projects of RSLAI. During the effectivity of the credit line agreement, [RSLAI] obtained loans covered by the four (4) promissory notes for the aggregate sum of Php 9,438,744.94 but because [RSLAI was] having a difficult time collecting their receivables from their clients, [RSLAI] failed to pay the promissory notes as they fell due. [RSLAI was] then constrained to request for a restructuring of the credit line to which [IEB] agreed. In the negotiations for the restructure, it was agreed by the parties that [respondent] RSLAI pay first the amount of Php 4,004,046.89 & that all maturing notes be disregarded. [RSLAI] paid the same amount & accordingly, [IEB] cancelled all four promissory notes. In that regard, RSLAI executed a new promissory note in the amount of Php 5,434,079.05. According to [RSLAI], when [IEB] approved the loan restructure & required [RSLAI] to execute the new promissory note, it had, by all intents & purposes, entered into a new contract with [RSLAI]. Novation having taken place, [RSLAI's] obligation under the omnibus credit line was already extinguished. [Respondents RSLAI and Spouses Labos] averred that the court did not acquire jurisdiction over them because of improper service of summons. [Respondent] RSLAI assail[ed] the service of summons made upon Arlene dela Victoria, one who is not among the officers specifically mentioned under Section 11, Rule 14 of the Rules of Court, upon whom service of summons to a domestic private juridical entity may be served. Likewise, [respondent] Spouses Labos assail[ed] the substituted service upon Dennis Estrimera, of the summons addressed to them. [Respondents claimed] that granting there was no novation, [IEB] erroneously enforced the acceleration clause of the contract because [IEB] failed to divulge that there were other securities or collateral given by [respondent] RSLAI that there were more than sufficient to cover the original loan such as 1) JSS of Spouses Labos; & 2) assignment of project receivables/progress billings as enumerated under 'Supplemental Conditions' of the Credit Agreement. By way of counterclaim, RSLAI & the Spouses Labos pray that they be awarded Php 500,000.00 as moral damages for besmirched reputation, sleepless nights & wounded feelings they suffered by the filing of this case. To set an example to the public & to deter others under similar circumstances, [IEB] should indemnify [respondents] the sum of Php 500,000.00 as exemplary damages. They also claim by way of attorney's fees the amount of Php 100,000.00 & P3,500.00 per court appearance, as they were constrained to secure service of counsel in order to protect their interests & defend themselves against the baseless complaint. [Respondent Rockwell] alleged in [its Answer] that on December 20, 1999, RSLAI entered into a Contract to Sell with [Rockwell] over a 247 square meter residential condominium unit designated as 23A Luna Gardens Building for a total contract price of Php 23,635,370.00. On April 10, 2002, Rockwell issued a notice to Rudy S. Labos, president of RSLAI[,] that his account was overdue & that the total outstanding amount of Php 9,706,185.62 had to be settled on or before April 17, 2002. On April 26, 2002, Rockwell issued a notice of cancellation to RSLAI since the account was already 120 days overdue. In a letter dated May 9, 2002, RSLAI requested for additional time within which to settle the outstanding account. In a letter dated June 24, 2002 to Rockwell, Rudy S. Labos signified the intent to restructure the obligation, & proposed that the unpaid amounts be paid over a period of one (1) year beginning July 2002. On August 25, 2004, RSLAI executed a Deed of Assignment in favor of JHL & Sons Realty, Inc. over the subject property whereby RSLAI assigned to JHL its rights under the contract to sell. Consequently, a Deed of Absolute Sale over the subject property was executed in favor of JHL upon full payment of the purchase price recomputed to Php 21,148,670.00. On September 1, 2004, Rockwell received a letter dated August 31, 2004 from [IEB] requesting for a copy of the latest statement of account over the condominium unit & to confirm that ownership of the subject property had not been transferred to another party. In his letter dated September 15, 2004, Rudy S. Labos acknowledged RSLAI's obligation & offered to settle the same by assigning its cash receivables from existing projects, as well as its office condominium unit in Petron Towers in Makati City. But RSLAI's offer was allegedly rejected by [IEB]. In a letter dated September 23, 2004, Rockwell advised [IEB] that it shall proceed with the transfer of the unit to JHL since there was no reason to suspect that the assignment of rights over the subject property was tainted with irregularity. On October 1, 2004, Condominium Certificate No. 85534 was issued by the Register of Deeds of Makati City over the subject property in the name of JHL & Sons Realty, Inc. On October 5, 2004, Rockwell received [IEB]'s letter threatening to take legal action for the supposed breach under the Deed of Assignment dated July 2, 2003. Rockwell alleged by way of special & affirmative defenses that [IEB] has no cause of action against it because the purported Deed of Assignment does not impose any obligation or liability upon Rockwell, not being a party to the Deed of Assignment. Despite the absence of privity between [IEB] & Rockwell, the former insisted on the liability of Rockwell by virtue of its alleged conformity to the Deed of Assignment. According to Rockwell, its act of signing the Deed of Assignment was merely [a] recognition of RSLAI's right to alienate or encumber the property. Rockwell asserts that Section 2.04 under the Deed of Assignment invoked by [IEB], is a void stipulation inasmuch as it forbids Rockwell as the owner from alienating its mortgaged property. Finally, Rockwell averred that the Deed of Assignment was not registered with the Register of Deed[s] of Makati hence does not bind the property. Thus, the assignment of the subject property as well as the subsequent transfer of the same to JHL & Sons Realty, Inc. were proper & did not violate any vested rights.","In its Decision dated December 22, 2009, the RTC ruled in favor of IEB and found RSLAI and the spouses Labos jointly and severally liable for the payment of their loan obligations. However, it held that Rockwell cannot be made liable to pay the amount owed by RSLAI and/or the spouses Labos as it is not a party to the Deed of Assignment dated July 2, 2003. The dispositive portion of the Decision states: 'WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of plaintiff International Exchange Bank & against defendants Rudy S. Labos & Associates, Inc. & the Spouses Rodolfo S. Labos & Consuelo R. Labos, who are ordered to pay jointly & severally pay plaintiff (1) the sum of Php 5,729,726.94 representing their total outstanding obligation as of April 5, 2005 plus interest thereon at the rate of 16% per annum from April 12, 2005 up to finality of this judgment & 12% per annum from finality of judgment until fully paid; & (2) the amount equivalent to 10% of the total outstanding obligation as of April 5, 2005 due as collection & attorney's fees, plus cost of suit. Considering that the liability of defendant Rockwell Land Corporation was not duly established by preponderance of evidence, the complaint as against said defendant is hereby dismissed. SO ORDERED.' Dissatisfied, IEB filed a partial appeal before the CA. In its Decision dated November 23, 2011, the CA granted IEB's appeal and MODIFIED the RTC decision to hold Rockwell JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY LIABLE with the other defendant-appellees, finding that novation took place and that Rockwell violated IEB's rights. Aggrieved, Rockwell filed its Motion for Reconsideration. In its Resolution dated December 20, 2012, the appellate court found Rockwell's motion to be impressed with merit. Ultimately, it ruled that Rockwell cannot be made liable to IEB since it did not assume any obligation under the Deed of Assignment, nor did novation take place. The CA Resolution reversed and set aside its Decision dated November 23, 2011, and AFFIRMED in toto the RTC's December 22, 2009 [Decision] in Civil Case No. 05-313. IEB then filed the present petition for review.","The petition is unmeritorious. The Court finds that the lower courts correctly absolved Rockwell from any liability. The basic principle of relativity of contracts (Art. 1311 of the Civil Code) dictates that contracts only bind parties who entered into them. A plain perusal of the Deed of Assignment dated July 2, 2003 shows that the parties involved were only RSLAI and IEB; Rockwell was not a party. Rockwell's signature on the 'conforme' portion was merely to signify its express consent to the assignment, as required by Section 9, paragraph (e) of the Contract to Sell, and cannot be construed as an assumption of liability for RSLAI's loans. Moreover, even if Rockwell were considered a party, the relevant provision (Section 2.04) imposed the warranty and undertaking not to assign, sell, or transfer the property without IEB's consent solely upon RSLAI, the assignor. The Court finds that no novation ever took place because there was no express agreement to do away with the original Contract to Sell, nor was there an irreconcilable incompatibility between the Contract to Sell and the Deed of Assignment (which was, in essence, a mortgage serving as interim security for RSLAI's loan obligations). The Court also found no basis to hold Rockwell liable for damages under the principle of abuse of rights (Article 19 of the Civil Code) or contractual breach (Articles 1170 to 1173) as IEB failed to provide clear and convincing evidence of bad faith, dishonest purpose, or moral obliquity on the part of Rockwell. Finally, Rockwell cannot be held jointly and solidarily liable with RSLAI and the spouses Labos, as solidary liability is never inferred lightly and must be expressly stated or required by law or the nature of the obligation (Article 1207), none of which applies here.","WHEREFORE, We DENY the petition for lack of merit, and accordingly AFFIRM the challenged Resolution of the Court of Appeals dated December 20, 2012 in CA G.R. CV No. 95810, absolving Rockwell Land Corporation of any liability to herein petitioner International Exchange Bank. Correspondingly, the Decision dated December 22, 2009 of the Regional Trial Court of Makati City, Branch 62, in Civil Case No. 05-313, is hereby AFFIRMED in toto."
"G.R. No. 248495, July 06, 2022","ENGR. RUBEN Y. YU, DOING BUSINESS UNDER THE NAME AND STYLE RYU CONSTRUCTION, PETITIONER, VS. HEIRS OF MANUEL SIA, REPRESENTED BY MAYOR ROSEMARIE H. SIA, RESPONDENTS.","On 18 March 2002, respondents Heirs of Manuel Sia, represented by Rosemarie Sia (Rosemarie; collectively respondents), and Ryu Construction, represented by its owner Engr. Ruben Y. Yu (Ruben), entered into a Construction Contact. The contract reads in part: 1. Subject Matter of the Contract. This agreement pertaining to the construction of [a] 4-Storey Commercial Building, hereafter referred to as PROJECT and more adequately described as follows: THE PROPOSED CONSTRUCTION OF FOUR STOREY COMMERCIAL BUILDING FOR HEIRS OF MANUEL SIA REPRESENTED BY MAYOR ROSEMARIE SIA LOCATED AT F. IMPERIAL ST., LEGAZPI CITY. . . 2. Contract Price. The consideration of this agreement shall be in the lump sum amount of PESOS, NINE MILLION EIGHT HUNDRED FOURTY EIGHT THOUSAND & TWO HUNDRED FORTY PESOS Only, (PHP 9,842,240.00). . . On 27 July 2006, Ruben instituted a Complaint against Rosemarie for the collection of P448,240.00, representing the remaining balance from the contract price. Ruben alleged that the subject building has been completed in accordance with the plans and specifications and the same has been turned over to Rosemarie in 2003. However, Rosemarie refused to pay the remaining balance despite written demand. Rosemarie, on the other hand, admitted non-payment of the remaining balance but argued that the same could not be released until the issuance of the occupancy permit and the repair of the defects in the 3rd and 4th [floors] of the subject building, specifically the undersized rooms, which failed to meet the minimum standards under Presidential Decree No. (PD) 1096 or the National Building Code. In 2009, counsel for Rosemarie inquired with the Office of the City Engineer of Legazpi City about the supposed violation of PD 1096 so that the same may be corrected. The office responded with an Inspection Report enumerating the following violations: 1. The following guest rooms/hotel rooms did not complied [sic] with the minimum requirement as per Rule XVI – 5.1 and 6.3 of PD 1096. Room numbers: 304, 305, 306, 314, 315, 316, 317, 318, 319, 413, 414, 415, 416, 417, 418 and 419. 2. Toilets and baths of guest rooms 303 and 308 have no ventilation which is a violation of Rule XVI – 7.1. 3. Modifications were made in the layout of rooms 406 and 407 wherein windows and A.C.U. openings on firewalls were introduced. The report was allegedly communicated to Ruben for the necessary corrective measures, but he failed to act on it. Consequently, to address the violations in the Inspection Report, Rosemarie secured the services of one (1) Architect Leo Del Rosario (Del Rosario) for the renovation plan, which was submitted to and approved by the Office of the City Engineer of Legazpi City. The renovations were implemented in 2013 by Del Rosario and one (1) Engr. Fernando Joquico, the proprietor of J-Squared Construction, who were paid P1,576,163.86. After the renovations, a certificate of occupancy was finally issued for the third and fourth floors of the subject building in 2014. Meanwhile, sometime in 2012, Ruben filed an amended complaint naming as defendants Rosemarie, Theresa, Emilyne, Dianne, Emmanuel, Michael, and Manuel, all surnamed Sia. The RTC admitted the Amended Complaint and accordingly ordered the issuance of summons. Except for Rosemarie, all the other respondents raised want of consent and minority as defense in their respective answers. On 12 March 2013, the RTC issued an Order dropping all the other defendants except Rosemarie.","The RTC rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff Engr. Ruben U. Yu, doing business under the name and styule (sic), RYU Construction and against the defendants Heirs of Manuel sia (sic), represented by Mayor Rosemarie Sia, as follows: 1.

The CA reversed and set aside the RTC Decision. The appeal was GRANTED and a new Judgment was ENTERED, ORDERING Ruben U. Yu to pay Rosemarie H. Sia the following amounts: 1. One Million One Hundred Twenty Seven Thousand Nine Hundred Twenty Three Pesos and Eighty Six Centavos (P1,127,923.86) as reimbursement for the amount Rosemarie H. Sia spent for the renovation of the subject building. This amount shall earn interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the time this judgment is promulgated until the same becomes final. 2. Two Hundred Thousand Pesos (P200,000.00) as moral damages. 3. Two Hundred Thousand Pesos (P200,000.00) as exemplary damages. 4. Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as attorney's fees, plus the amount of Two Thousand Five Hundred Pesos (P2,500) for every court appearance. 5. Costs of suit. Thereafter, upon the finality of this Decision, the total monetary award shall earn interest at the rate of 6% per annum until its satisfaction. SO ORDERED.","The Court found that Ruben and Rosemarie are in pari delicto and thus have no action against each other pursuant to Article 1411 of the Civil Code. The doctrine of in pari delicto holds that no action arises from an illegal contract, and no affirmative relief will be given when both parties are equally at fault. It is undisputed that the subject building was erected in violation of the minimum air space requirements in PD 1096, which constitutes an illegal contract within the purview of Article 1411. The building plan approved by Rosemarie and implemented by Ruben was non-compliant from the very start. Ruben, as a licensed contractor and engineer, was expected to know and follow the provisions of PD 1096 and should not have blindly agreed to the construction. Rosemarie, as the owner, is deemed to have done so with knowledge of the law (Article 3, Civil Code) and actively pushed for smaller rooms, failed to exercise due diligence, and began operating the hotel in violation of PD 1096 notwithstanding the lack of a full occupancy permit. Since both parties voluntarily entered into and implemented an illegal contract (in violation of PD 1096, which is an act constituting a criminal offense), neither party can seek affirmative relief against the other.","WHEREFORE, the foregoing premises considered, the Petition is DENIED. The Decision dated 29 March 2019 and the Resolution dated 18 July 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 107708 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The Complaint of Ruben Yu and the Counterclaim of Rosemarie Sia in Civil Case No. 10577 are hereby DISMISSED. SO ORDERED."

Under a Sale of Shares of Stock and Escrow Agreement dated 24 May 1984, FPHC sold 6,119,067 shares of stock in PCI Bank to TMEE. On 15 April 1986, the PCGG sequestered the TMEE shares, alleging they constituted ill-gotten wealth of former Governor Benjamin Romualdez. The Republic filed Civil Case No. 0035 (31 July 1987). TMEE was eventually impleaded in the Third Amended Complaint (1997). On 28 January 1997, TMEE moved to nullify the writ of sequestration. In a Resolution dated 02 January 2003, the Sandiganbayan nullified the writ of sequestration for having been issued by only one PCGG commissioner, but ordered the shares placed in custodia legis. The Sandiganbayan later dismissed the Third Amended Complaint against TMEE (25 January 2010), which was affirmed with finality by the Court (G.R. Nos. 192651 and 192653). TMEE filed G.R. No. 180350 assailing the Sandiganbayan’s Resolutions dated 09 June 2006 and 08 October 2007, which kept the shares in custodia legis. FPHC filed a second complaint-in-intervention (G.R. No. 205186) to recover the same shares, arguing the Republic would be guilty of unjust enrichment if it recovered them, but the Sandiganbayan dismissed it based on prescription. The Republic and FPHC filed motions for production and inspection of documents pertaining to TMEE's shares in BDO (G.R. Nos. 222919 and 223237), claiming the shares were sold despite being in custodia legis. The Sandiganbayan denied these motions.","The Court finds merit in TMEE's petition under G.R. No. 180350. With the nullification of the writ of sequestration and subsequent dismissal of the complaint against TMEE, no basis remains for holding its shares of stock in custodia legis. The Court denies FPHC's petition in G.R. No. 205186 for lack of merit, finding FPHC's cause of action barred by prescription. The Court dismisses the petitions in G.R. Nos. 222919 and 223237, finding that the Sandiganbayan did not commit grave abuse of discretion in denying the motion for production and inspection of documents or records.","Sequestration is a conservatory and provisional writ. By the dismissal of the case against TMEE, there is ipso facto no more writ of sequestration to speak of, and TMEE, as the registered owner, cannot be deprived of its property without due process of law, especially since there was no clear judicial determination that the shares were ill-gotten. The Sandiganbayan committed grave abuse of discretion when it retained the shares of stock in custodia legis. FPHC's second complaint-in-intervention is a blatant attempt to circumvent the bar by prescription, as the cause of action, which attempts to establish ownership based on fraud, is time-barred by the four-year prescriptive period under Article 1391 of the Civil Code, as previously ruled with finality. The Sandiganbayan properly denied the motion for production and inspection (G.R. Nos. 222919 and 223237) because BDO was never impleaded as a party, and TMEE is no longer a party-defendant in the pending action, thus failing to satisfy the requirement under Rule 27 that documents must be in the possession, custody or control of the other party.","WHEREFORE, the Petition for Certiorari in G.R.

"G.R. No. 234365, July 06, 2022","PHILIPPINE TRANSMARINE CARRIERS, INC. AND/OR SEASPAN CREW MANAGEMENT LTD. AND/OR CARLOS SALINAS, PETITIONERS, VS. ALLAN N. TENA-E, RESPONDENT.","On July 8, 2014, petitioner Philippine Transmarine Carriers, Inc. (PTCI) hired respondent Allan N. Tena-e (Allan) as a seafarer for and in behalf of its foreign principal, Seaspan Crew Management Limited (Seaspan), under a nine-month contract with a monthly salary of US$575.00. [6] After undergoing his pre-employment medical examination, Allan boarded the vessel M/V Mol Efficiency. On October 5, 2014, while on cargo-watch duty, Allan figured in an accident when a turnbuckle fell on his right shoulder. Upon feeling extreme pain and swelling on his shoulder, he reported the incident to the ship captain, and was referred to the medical staff for treatment. In the October 11, 2014 Medical Report, [7] Allan was declared unfit for sea duty due to his displaced right clavicular fracture. The following day, he was taken to a hospital in Panama where the attending physician gave him a similar diagnosis. [8] On October 20, 2014, Allan was medically repatriated to the Philippines. The following day, he was immediately referred to ShiptoShore Medical Assist (ShiptoShore) and St. Luke's Medical Center (St. Luke's) for examination, management, and treatment. In a Medical Report [9] dated October 22, 2014, company-designated doctors John Ericson T. Sañez (Dr. Sañez) and Marilar F. De Guzman (Dr. De Guzman), diagnosed Allan with a fractured and displaced right clavicle. Thereafter, Allan was placed under the care of an Orthopedic Shoulder Specialist. In a Medical Report dated October 23, 2014, [10] Allan was advised to continue wearing a clavicular strap for two to three months and do home exercises, with formal rehabilitation to begin on the third month. Notwithstanding the treatment, Allan continued to feel pain, discomfort, swelling, and limited range of motion on his right collarbone. To address this, he was given a treatment plan consisting of home exercises, regular x-rays, and therapy sessions. From November 2014 to March 2015, Allan continued with his therapy and rehabilitation as supervised by the company-designated doctors, who issued medical reports on the following dates: 1. November 17, 2014 [11] 2. December 2, 2014 [12] 3. January 12, 2015 [13] 4. February 5, 2015 [14] 5. March 16, 2015 [15] In the Medical Report dated March 16, 2015, [16] Dr. Sañez and Dr. De Guzman made an interim assessment of Disability Grade 12 with the following findings: At present, patient started to engage in his regular activities and simulate his work on board as an able-bodied seaman. However, patient still complains of pain graded 5/10 on certain movements of the right shoulder and prolonged carrying of loads, which spontaneously resolves with rest. x x x x As previously advised, projected return to full load capacity is anywhere from 4 to 6 months post trauma event. Patient will be further observed as he was advised to continue with his usual activities while using the prescribed medicated patch. INTERIM DISABILITY GRADE: 12 – collarbone fracture, but able to raise arm above shoulder level Impression: Fracture, closed, complete, displaced, middle third of clavicle, radiographically healed. The patient's medical condition is work-related. Plan: For re-evaluation with Orthopedic-Shoulder specialist tentative 13 April 2015. [17] (Emphasis in the original) On March 26, 2015, Allan, through counsel, sent a letter [18] to Dr. Sañez asking if further treatment was still needed beyond the 120-day period after his repatriation, considering that he was still under persistent pain. He requested a response from ShiptoShore before April 7, 2015, but his query was left unanswered. [19] On April 18, 2015, Allan consulted his physician of choice and Orthopedic Specialist, Dr. Rogelio Catapang, Jr. (Dr. Catapang Jr.). In a Medical Report [20] dated April 18, 2015, Dr. Catapang Jr. declared Allan unfit for sea duty. The next day, Allan also consulted Rehabilitation Medicine Expert, Dr. Francis N. Pimentel (Dr. Pimentel), who similarly declared him unfit for sea duty with permanent disability. [21] On April 20, 2015, Allan initiated Single-Entry Approach (SEnA) proceedings before the National Capital Region (NCR) Arbitration Branch of the NLRC to claim permanent and total disability benefits. [22] Subsequently, on July 24, 2015, Allan filed a Complaint [23] against herein petitioners and Carlos Salinas (Salinas), as representative of PTCI, for disability benefits, unpaid sick wages, reimbursement for transportation and medical expenses, as well as damages with attorney's fees. Both parties appeared during the preliminary conference where Allan moved for the appointment of a third doctor. However, the Labor Arbiter (LA) denied the request. [24] After failing to settle during the preliminary mandatory conference, the parties submitted their respective position papers. In petitioners' Position Paper, [25] they averred that Allan abandoned his treatment by not showing up on the date of his follow up check-up. In effect, they claimed that Allan forfeited his right to claim for disability benefits pursuant to Section 20 (a), no. 3, par. (3) of the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration-Standard Employment Central (POEA-SEC). They also argued that Allan's complaint was prematurely filed, considering that the latter was still undergoing treatment, and no final disability assessment by the company-designated physician has been issued. [26] Petitioners alleged that Allan can no longer claim for sickness allowance since they already paid him P99,686.69 for the period of October 13, 2014 – February 9, 2015. [27] In the same vein, they contended that Allan is not entitled to damages and attorney's fees since they constantly dealt with respondent in good faith. [28] Additionally, petitioners argued that Salinas was wrongly impleaded in the case. As a mere officer of PTCI, he has a separate and distinct personality from the corporation. [29] In Allan's Position Paper, [30] he maintained that he is entitled to total and permanent disability benefits. He argued that 181 days have lapsed since his repatriation and PTCI still failed to issue a final assessment of his disability. Thus, his disability became total and permanent after the lapse of 120 days considering that he is unable to engage in gainful employment. [31] As to his claim for sickness allowance, Allan admitted that PTCI already partially paid him. Nevertheless, he averred that there is still a remaining balance left to be paid. [32] Lastly, Allan alleged that PTCI fraudulently and wantonly disregarded its duty which forced him to litigate his claims. As such, he is entitled to damages and attorney's fees. [33]","The issue for resolution is whether Allan is entitled to permanent total disability benefits. The petition is meritorious. Based on the foregoing, Allan breached his duty by not showing up on his scheduled April 13, 2015 appointment thereby effectively preventing Dr. Sañez from making a final disability assessment. Since Allan was still undergoing treatment by the company doctor and has been showing signs of improvement, and was even asked to come back for possible clearance, there was an indication that further treatment would address his temporary disability. This Court emphasizes that a temporary total disability only becomes permanent if the company-designated physician declares it to be so within the 120-day period, or 240-day period, provided the extension was justified in the latter case, or after the lapse of such periods, and no declaration is made by the company-designated physician. [57] The mere lapse of the 120/240-day period does not automatically entitle a seafarer to total and permanent disability benefits. In any case, as between the medical reports issued by the company-designated physicians, on one hand, and Allan's own physicians of choice, on the other, the former must prevail. ... Therefore, the NLRC gravely abused its discretion in disregarding the POEA-SEC rules which provide that it is the seafarer's duty to attend regular check-ups, and by not finding that Allan abandoned his treatment which effectively prevented Dr. Sañez from making an assessment when he failed to show up on the scheduled April 13, 2015 appointment. At most, Allan is only entitled to disability benefits equivalent to Grade 12 under the POEA-SEC, as reflected in the last report by Dr. Sañez. As to the award of attorney's fees in favor of Allan, We find the same unwarranted. Attorney's fees are recoverable only when the defendant's act or omission has compelled the plaintiff to incur expenses to protect his interest. [62] Since Allan did not appear during his scheduled re-evaluation, which is within the 240-day period, PTCI is not guilty of any act or omission constituting bad faith. Hence, Allan's claim for attorney's fees must be denied.","It is settled that the entitlement of a seafarer on overseas employment to disability benefits is governed by law, by the parties' contracts, and by the medical findings. Section 20 (A) of the 2010 POEA-SEC, [45] which is the rule applicable to this case since Allan was employed in 2014, governs the procedure for compensation and benefits for a work-related injury or illness suffered by a seafarer on board sea-going vessels during the term of his employment contract, to wit: [Details POEA-SEC Section 20]... In summary, if there is a claim for total and permanent disability benefits by a seafarer, the following rules shall govern: [Details Elburg Shipmanagement Phils., Inc. v. Quiogue rules]... At this point, Allan's treatment already went beyond 120-day period, and the doctor's findings and schedule for re-evaluation clearly constitute a significant act that justified the extension of petitioner's treatment period to 240 days. [49] Notably, Dr. Sañez only issued an interim assessment, which is not the final and definitive assessment required under the law. ... However, We cannot fault PTCI for its company-designated physician's failure to issue a final and definitive disability assessment. Dr. Sañez had until June 17, 2015, or before the lapse of 240 days from repatriation, within which to issue his final assessment. However, Allan did not appear on the scheduled re-evaluation on April 13, 2015 making it impossible for Dr. Sañez to examine him. ... Allan breached his duty by not showing up on his scheduled April 13, 2015 appointment thereby effectively preventing Dr. Sañez from making a final disability assessment. ... In any case, as between the medical reports issued by the company-designated physicians, on one hand, and Allan's own physicians of choice, on the other, the former must prevail. As explained in Philman Marine v. Cabanban: [58] In several cases, we held that the doctor who have had a personal knowledge of the actual medical condition, having closely, meticulously and regularly monitored and actually treated the seafarer's illness, is more qualified to assess the seafarer's disability. ... Under these circumstances, the assessment of Dr. Sañez should be given more credence for having been arrived at after months of medical attendance and diagnosis, compared with the assessment of Allan's private physicians that was issued after a single examination and based on Allan's existing medical records. In other words, Dr. Sañez is more qualified to assess Allan's disability.","WHEREFORE, the instant Petition is GRANTED. The April 4, 2017 Decision and the September 14, 2017 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 147227 awarding Allan N. Tena-e total and permanent disability benefits, are SET ASIDE.

LISA GRACE BERSALES, IN HER CAPACITY AS THE ADMINISTRATOR AND CIVIL REGISTRAR GENERAL, HIROSHI EGAMI, THE LOCAL CIVIL REGISTRAR OF SAN MIGUEL, BULACAN, REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, AND THE FORMER FOURTH DIVISION, COURT OF APPEALS, RESPONDENTS.","On 18 May 1994, petitioner Maria Teresa Dino Basa-Egami (petitioner), a Filipina, married Hiroshi Egami (Egami), a Japanese national. However, their union did not last long, as they eventually parted ways in October 2006. Not long after, Egami begot a child with another woman, prompting him to ask for divorce from petitioner. Petitioner was initially averse to Egami's idea. After Egami's relentless prodding, however, petitioner relented and agreed to sign the divorce papers.[6] On 03 April 2008, petitioner and Egami were issued a Japanese Divorce Decree,[7] which was duly recorded in the Family Register at Nakagawa-ku, Nagoya City. A Certificate of Receiving[8] was also issued by the Head of Nakagawa-ku, Nagoya City, stating that petitioner and Egami's Divorce Decree was duly reported to the said office on 03 April 2008. Subsequently, petitioner filed before the RTC a Petition for Recognition of Foreign Judgment/Final Order,[9] to be able to remarry.[10] During trial on the merits, petitioner testified and submitted the following documents as her evidence: 1) certified copy of the Notification of Divorce/Report of Divorce, duly authenticated by Consul Jerome John O. Castro (Consul Castro), Consul for the Philippine Consulate General, Osaka, Japan; 2) Family Register of Egami, stating the fact of divorce between him and petitioner, as certified by Hirchika Hyase, Head of Nakagawa-Ku, Nagoya City on 04 August 2014, and duly certified and authenticated by Naomi Asano, an official from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Consular Service, Division) and Consul Castro; 3) a Certificate of Acceptance of Divorce/Certificate of Receiving which states that the Divorce obtained by Egami and petitioner were reported on 03 April 2008, similarly certified and authenticated by Naomi Asano, an official from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Consular Service Division) and Consul Castro; and 4) excerpts from the Book ""The Civil Code of Japan,"" as certified and notarized by Kenji Sugimori, a notary from the Osaka Legal Affairs Bureau, and duly authenticated by Consul Castro.[11] The Republic of the Philippines, through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), sought the dismissal of the petition, arguing in the main that a consensual or mutual divorce, such as the divorce obtained by petitioner; is not contemplated by Article 26(2) of the Family Code;[12] hence, it cannot be recognized by Philippine courts.[13]","The Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Quezon City, Branch 86, in Civil Case No. R-QZN-14-11882, granted the petition, recognizing the divorce decree, dissolving the marriage, and ordering the annotation thereof. The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) moved for reconsideration but the same was denied. On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) issued the assailed Decision dated 25 March 2019, reversing the RTC ruling and ordering the Petition for Recognition of Foreign Judgment/Final Order dismissed. Petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration was denied, prompting her to file the present Petition for Certiorari before the Supreme Court.","The Supreme Court gave due course to the petition despite being an improper remedy (Rule 65 instead of Rule 45) in the interest of substantial justice. The Court ruled that contrary to the OSG's posture, the divorce by mutual consent between petitioner and her foreigner spouse may be recognized in this jurisdiction, pursuant to *Republic v. Manalo* and *Racho v. Tanaka*. The Court held that Article 26(2) only requires that there be a divorce validly obtained abroad, without regard as to who initiated it. Furthermore, the documents submitted by petitioner (Notification of Divorce, Certificate of Acceptance of Divorce) were sufficient to prove the fact of divorce, following judicial precedents. However, the Court sustained the CA's finding that petitioner failed to properly plead and prove the Japanese law on divorce. The Civil Code of Japan submitted was found insufficient because it did not comply with the attestation requirements under Sections 24 and 25 of the Revised Rules of Court, as the excerpts were a mere photocopy of a book published by a private company and not duly authenticated.","WHEREFORE, the Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 is GRANTED. The Decision dated 25 March 2019 and Resolution dated 22 July 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA G.R. CV No. 109890 are REVERSED AND SET ASIDE. The case is REMANDED to Branch 86, Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, for further proceedings and reception of evidence on the pertinent Japanese law on divorce and the document proving Hiroshi Egami is now recapacitated to marry. SO ORDERED."
"[ G.R. No. 233679, July 06, 2022 ]","ADSTRATWORLD HOLDINGS, INC., JUDITO B. CALLAO AND JUDITO DEI R. CALLAO, PETITIONERS, VS. CHONA A. MAGALLONES AND PAULINE JOY M. LUCINO, RESPONDENTS.","In their Position Paper, respondents alleged that: From January 2012 to July 15, 2013, respondents worked for petitioners as events marketing and logistics officers without any written contract. They were given a basic monthly salary of P10,000.00 with no benefits, other than 13th month pay of P4,000.00 and cash bonus of P1,000.00 given during the Christmas party. On July 16, 2013, petitioners issued probationary contracts commencing on the same date and until December 16, 2013, giving respondents a basic salary of P11,000.00. On January 8, 2014, respondents were illegally dismissed and were no longer allowed to report for work. Respondents argued that they were regular employees of petitioners as they rendered more than one year of continuous service and the nature of their work was necessary in the usual business of Adstratworld. Respondents' probationary contracts were also just a ploy to circumvent their right to security of tenure; and that their dismissal from work was without any just or authorized cause. Apart from reinstatement and payment of full backwages, respondents prayed that petitioners be ordered to settle their underpaid salary, holiday premium pay, rest day pay, and 13th month pay for 2012 and 2013; unpaid holiday pay, overtime pay, service incentive leave pay, emergency cost of living allowance, and night shift differentials; nominal, moral, and exemplary damages; and attorney's fees. Meanwhile, petitioners denied in their Position Paper that respondents were illegally dismissed and narrated instead the following matters: On July 16, 2013, Adstratworld, a domestic corporation engaged in advertising business, hired respondents as events marketing and logistics officers on probationary status. It tasked respondents to organize events such as festivals, basketball leagues, and sports fests. It made respondents to understand that their performance shall be evaluated on the third to fifth month of their probationary status to determine whether they would qualify as regular employees. Subsequently, respondents' evaluation slips indicated a decline in their average scores that reflected their overall work performance. Petitioners later on served upon respondents a Notice of Disciplinary Action dated August 8, 2013 requiring them to explain why they should not be held accountable for distributing items (jersey shirts) from their work project to company executives without the permission of the officer-in-charge and in violation of the employee's code of ethics. Despite submitting their written explanations, petitioners suspended Magallones and Lucino for five and three days, respectively. On November 12, 2013, petitioners reprimanded Lucino for bringing items (singlet) inside the company premises without an entry pass to which she submitted her explanation. It also reprimanded Lucina for her accumulated tardiness for the months of August, September, and October 2013. By reason of her tardiness, it suspended Lucino from work for three days, or from December 16, 2013 to December 18, 2013. On December 12, 2013, petitioners notified respondents regarding the termination of their probationary status and their failure to qualify as regular employees. Petitioners gave respondents until January 7, 2014 to complete the turnover of their tasks and transactions to petitioners. Petitioners contended that at the time of their engagement, respondents were aware that they must abide by the standards set forth to attain regular status; respondents failed to comply with these standards which proved them unfit for permanent employment. According to petitioners, the dismissal of respondents was legal as it was pursuant to a valid exercise of management prerogative.","The Court found that the CA did not err in ruling that the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion when it affirmed the dismissal of the complaint. Petitioners' contentions are unavailing. The probationary contracts issued by Adstratworld only indicated a change in the employment status and an increase in the salary of the latter. These changes presuppose that respondents were already working for Adstratworld and that they were not just newly hired employees. Pieces of substantial evidence support the finding of the CA that from the time they were employed, respondents were regular employees of Adstratworld because they performed tasks necessary and desirable in the usual business of Adstratworld, and even assuming their engagement in January 2012 was merely probationary, they were already regular employees by July 16, 2013 due to having served for more than one year. The Court also found that respondents were illegally dismissed from work because petitioners failed to discharge their burden to establish compliance with substantive and procedural due process. Adstratworld dismissed respondents on the latter's alleged failure to adhere to the standards set forth at the time of hiring and which standards would determine whether respondents would qualify as regular employees, which was inconsistent and absurd since respondents had already attained regular employment status. Furthermore, there was no evidence that Adstratworld set forth reasonable standards for respondents' regularization which were made known at the time of their engagement. Thus, Adstratworld dismissed respondents without observing substantive and procedural due process required under the law.","WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED. The Decision dated November 29, 2016 and the Resolution dated July 10, 2017 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 140702 are AFFIRMED with the following MODIFICATIONS: (1) the grant of premium pay for holidays and for rest days, overtime pay, and night shift differential pay is DELETED; and (2) Petitioner Adstratworld Holdings Inc. is ordered to pay each respondent, Chona A.

Farm 1 (respondent), a corporation based in Davao City which is engaged in the plantation and exportation of Cavendish bananas. [9] On February 14, 2016, Anthony R. Pablo (Anthony), the Security Officer of respondent, announced that all watchmen would be reassigned to farm operations effective the following day. The watchmen allegedly raised their voices in protest, questioned the management's decision on their reassignment, and insisted that ""they are children of the landowners who leased their farms to [respondent]; hence, they should not be farm workers"" [10] or assigned to do production work. [11] On February 15, 2016, respondent received a report that several banana bunches were chopped down in Block 6A and Block 7A of HKJ 2 Farm. Respondent thereafter initiated an investigation. While it was ongoing, respondent issued to the watchmen on March 3, 2016 a notice that they were to be preventively suspended for 15 days [12] or from March 8, 2016 to March 24, 2016. [13] On March 22, 2016, a grievance meeting was scheduled between respondent and the watchmen, but only Ernesto attended the same. [14] On March 23, 2016, respondent issued another notice to the watchmen of an additional 15-day preventive suspension, effective on March 26, 2016 up to April 13, 2016. [15] On April 12, 2016, after the investigation had been concluded, respondent issued to the watchmen a notice of termination. The termination was made effective on April 14, 2016. [16] This notwithstanding, a second grievance conference was still held on April 15, 2016 where the parties ultimately agreed to elevate their issues to a third party for resolution. [17] The watchmen claimed that they were not afforded with due process of law and that respondent relied on mere hearsay evidence in terminating their employment. Respondent disagreed and maintained that the watchmen's dismissal was legal. [18]","The CA in its assailed Decision [24] reversed the ruling of the Voluntary Arbitrator. ... The CA found that the alleged meeting on February 19, 2016 really took place. The CA weighed this finding and that of the testimony of another witness, Florentino Avenido (Florentino), who allegedly heard as well that the watchmen were planning on cutting down the banana trees. [25] The CA held that these testimonies may be used as circumstantial evidence to establish the fact in issue and which, when taken together with other pieces of evidence like the watchmen's reaction after the announcement, may lead to the reasonable conclusion that they, indeed, committed the act. [26] The CA further held that respondent substantially complied with the procedural requirements of the termination. Although the first letter (notice of preventive suspension) was not worded as to apprise the watchmen of the particular acts for which their dismissal was sought, the CA took note of the alleged meeting or conference on February 19, 2016 where Ranel categorically and specifically testified against the watchmen and to no one else. The CA concluded that even before the letter was issued to the watchmen, they already knew that they were the suspects in the banana­cutting incident. Hence, they were already informed of the acts levelled against them. [27] Moreover, according to the CA, respondent called for a grievance meeting to specifically give the watchmen an opportunity to explain their side. After said meeting, respondent did not terminate the watchmen just yet, but issued another notice of preventive suspension to them. It was only on April 12, 2016, after a thorough investigation, that the watchmen were finally terminated. The termination letter contained respondent's decision to dismiss them due to the offense they had committed. [28] The decretal portion of the CA Decision reads: WHEREFORE, the instant Petition for Review is GRANTED. The Decision of the Voluntary Arbitrator dated September 28, 2016 is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The dismissal of private respondents Ernesto Suril, Jr., Elvin Suril, Nonito Cabillon, Jhonel Suril and Nanding Abana were valid and legal. SO ORDERED. [29]","The Court finds that the dismissal of the watchmen failed to meet the substantive requirement of the law. There was no just cause to terminate the watchmen... In light of the foregoing, with neither direct nor circumstantial evidence to establish substantial evidence against the watchmen, the charges against them for serious misconduct or loss of trust and confidence crumble. Due process of law was observed in terminating the watchmen... The Court finds that there was substantial compliance with the twin notice requirements under the law. ... The watchmen certainly held positions of trust and confidence, where greater trust was placed by management and from whom greater fidelity to duty was correspondingly expected. [78] It cannot be gainsaid that in the normal and routine exercise of their functions, a watchman regularly handles the delicate matter of caring for and protecting the property and assets of his/her employer. [79] This is all the more true in this case where the watchmen were tasked to guard a huge banana plantation. ... An illegally dismissed employee is entitled to reinstatement without loss of seniority rights and other privileges, and to full backwages, inclusive of allowances and other benefits or their monetary equivalent. [72] In case the reinstatement is no longer possible, however, an award of separation pay, in lieu of reinstatement, will be justified. [73] ... Reinstatement is no longer possible due to strained relations between the employee and the employer. The watchmen are entitled to separation pay and backwages.","WHEREFORE, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is PARTIALLY GRANTED. The Decision dated January 22, 2018 of the Court of Appeals, Twenty-First Division and its Resolution dated May 31, 2018 in CA-G.R. SP No. O7812-MIN are REVERSED and SET ASIDE insofar as they hold that Ernesto Suril, Jr., Elvin Suril, Jhonel Suril, Nanding Abana, and Nonito Cabillon were validly dismissed. The Decision of the Voluntary Arbitrator dated September 28, 2016 is REINSTATED to the extent that respondent is ORDERED to PAY Ernesto Suril, Jr., Elvin Suril, Jhonel Suril, Nanding Abana, and Nonito Cabillon: FULL BACKWAGES, inclusive of allowances and other benefits or their monetary equivalent, computed from April 14, 2016, or from the time that their compensation was withheld from them, until finality of this judgment; and SEPARATION PAY in lieu of reinstatement at one-month salary for every year of service, with a fraction of at least six (6) months considered as one whole year computed from the date of hiring until finality of this judgment. The monetary award shall earn legal interest of six percent (6%) per annum from the date of finality of this Decision until full satisfaction of the award. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 242866, July 06, 2022","ALBERT K.S. TAN II, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","AT Intergrouppe, Inc. (ATII), represented by its corporate president petitioner Albert K.S. Tan II (Tan), applied for a loan with the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) to finance its purchase of materials and equipment which would form part of an automotive painting and finishing system to be exported to Indonesia. DBP approved an omnibus credit facility in favor of ATII in the total amount of P260,500,000.00, secured by a real estate mortgage over a property located in Parañaque City. The components of the credit facility were (a) an Export Advance/Packing Credit Facility in the amount of P190.5 Million; (b) an Import/Domestic Regular/Standby Letter of Credit/Trust Receipt Facility in the amount of P55 Million; and (c) Domestic Bills Purchase Line in the amount of P15 Million. In availing of (b) or the Letter of Credit/Trust Receipt Facility, ATII applied for, and DBP accordingly issued Domestic Letters of Credit, which were used by ATII to pay its suppliers for the materials it needed for the automotive system. For its part, ATII, represented by Tan, also executed three (3) trust receipts in favor of DBP covering the materials to be purchased. All of the trust receipts expressly contained the following undertaking: And in consideration thereat I/WE HEREBY AGREE TO HOLD THE SAID GOODS IN TRUST FOR THE SAID BANK AS ITS PROPERTY, with permission to sell them for its account at not less than the invoice value plus all charges and expenses. but without authority to make any other disposition whatsoever of the said goods, or any part thereof (or the proceeds thereof of title thereto) or in any manner to encumber the same by means of conditional sale, pledge, chattel mortgage, assignments, etc. In case of sale, I/WE further agree to hand the proceeds as soon as received to DBP, to apply against the relative acceptance (as described above) and for the payment of any other indebtedness of mine/ours whether due or not yet due to DBP. The items subject of the trust receipts were delivered to ATII. ATII subsequently defaulted on the payment of its loan, and despite repeated demands by DBP, ATII failed to either pay the loan or turn over the items subject of the trust receipts to DBP. DBP filed a criminal complaint against Tan and the other officers of ATII for three (3) counts of Estafa under Article 315 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), in relation to Presidential Decree No. (PD) 115, before the Makati City Prosecutor's Office (OCP Makati). However, the complaint was dismissed because the OCP Makati found ATII's liability to DBP to be only civil in nature. DBP filed a Petition for Review with the Department of Justice (DOJ) praying that the criminal complaint be reinstated. The DOJ initially affirmed the findings of the OCP Makati, but subsequently reversed itself and granted DBP's Motion for Reconsideration. Hence, an Information against Tan was filed before and raffled to the RTC of Makati City, Branch 143, the accusatory portion of which states: On the 7th of August 2007, in the [C]ity of Makati, the Philippines, accused as the responsible officer of [ATII] having executed the following to wit: IC Nos.

CONTRARY TO LAW.","This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari (Petition) filed under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the Decision dated March 23, 2018 (Assailed Decision) and the Resolution dated October 23, 2018 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 140576, which granted herein respondent People of the Philippines' Petition for Certiorari, and remanded the case to the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Makati City for re-raffling and for further presentation of evidence by the parties.","The Petition has no merit. x x x The CA rightly reversed the dismissal of the case by the RTC. x x x PD 115 remains good law, there being no subsequent law repealing the same, nor any decision by the Court striking it down as unconstitutional. x x x The foregoing supports a finding of probable cause for Estafa under Article 315(1)(b) of the RPC, in relation to PD 115. It does not matter that the goods to be purchased using the credit extended by DBP to ATII would first be processed as part of the automotive painting and finishing system, since Section 4 of PD 115, in defining a trust receipt transaction, covers goods which are held by the entrustee for the following purpose: 1. In the case of goods or documents, (a) to sell the goods or procure their sale; or (b) to manufacture or process the goods with the purpose of ultimate sale: Provided , That, in the case of goods delivered under trust receipt for the purpose of manufacturing or processing before its ultimate sale, the entruster shall retain its title over the goods whether in its original or processed form until the entrustee has complied fully with his obligation under the trust receipt; or (c) to load, unload, ship or transship or otherwise deal with them in a manner preliminary or necessary to their sale[.] (Emphasis supplied) In conclusion, it was indeed error for the RTC to outrightly dismiss the criminal case against Tan. Double jeopardy had not set in. x x x In Tan's case, the fifth requisite is lacking. It is clear that he was neither convicted nor acquitted by the trial court, since the criminal case against him was not concluded in a full-blown trial. Neither was the case dismissed or terminated without his express consent. On the contrary, it was dismissed upon his instance, through his Motion to Dismiss. Hence, double jeopardy does not attach. x x x Tan failed to establish a violation of his right to speedy disposition of cases. x x x The CA erred in declaring that the RTC judge should have inhibited from resolving the case against Tan. x x x To be clear, while the CA erred in this respect, it is not enough to reverse its Assailed Decision, as the essence thereof is consistent with applicable laws and prevailing jurisprudence. The CA did not err in granting the OSG's Motion for Extension of Time to File Petition for Certiorari.","WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Petition is DENIED.

Camsol (Camsol), Municipal Treasurer Anecita C. Suyat (Suyat), Municipal Accountant Marcelino P. Endi, and Municipal Agricultural Officer Asano E. Aban (Aban). Petitioners were charged with violations of Section 3(b), (e), and (g) of Republic Act No. (RA) 3019[5] and Article 315, paragraph 1(b) of the Revised Penal Code in connection with the so-called Fertilizer Fund Scam. The amount of P1,050,000.00 was released to the Municipality of Buguias, Benguet, represented by then Mayor Camsol. On 23 June 2006, the Commission on Audit (COA) issued Notice of Disallowance No. 06-01 disallowing in audit the amount of P1,049,992.00 since the purchase was made through personal canvass, and considering the amount involved, should have been made through competitive bidding. After preliminary investigation, the Office of the Ombudsman issued Resolution dated 10 November 2015 which found probable cause to indict petitioners with violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019. On 20 April 2018, an Information[9] dated 05 January 2018 was filed.

"G.R. No. 243399, July 06, 2022","C.F. SHARP CREW MANAGEMENT INC. AND/OR REEDEREI CLAUS-PETER OFFEN (GMBH & CO.), PETITIONERS, VS. ROBERTO B. DAGANATO RESPONDENT.","CF Sharp is a domestic corporation engaged in the hiring and deployment of seafarers on board ocean-going vessels. Meanwhile, petitioner Reederei Claus-Peter Offen (GMBH & CO.) (Reederei), is the principal foreign employer of CF Sharp. On June 25, 2014, respondent signed a Contract of Employment (Contract) with CF Sharp as Chief Cook for six months (+/-)1 on board the vessel MV Vancouver Express, owned by Reederei, with a total monthly salary of USD 1,805.00. The contract expressly incorporated the provisions of the current ITF Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). After undergoing premedical examination, respondent was declared fit to work. Thereafter, or on December 27, 2014, while carrying a heavy provision of food, respondent claimed that he suddenly slipped and fell causing mild to moderate pain on his lower back area. The pain persisted and his condition worsened until he was medically repatriated on January 10, 2015. He was referred to Cardinal Santos Medical Center where he was subjected to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Computed Tomography (CT) Scan of the Lumbar Spine. Respondent's MRI results dated January 22, 2015 yielded the following impressions: Mild L4-5 disc bulge, asymmetric to the right, abutting the traversing right L5 nerve root. No focal disc herniation at any level. Mild bilateral L4-5 facet and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy with no associated spinal canal or foraminal narrowing. Diffuse heterogeneous vertebral marrow signal, of uncertain etiology. Meanwhile, respondent's CT scan results dated January 26, 2015 showed that he was suffering from MILD POSTERIOR DISC BULGE, L4-L5, FACET HYPERTROPHY, L4-L5, THORACOLUMBAR SPONDYLOSIS. Due to the aforesaid findings, respondent underwent physiotherapy but to no avail. Thus, on February 3, 2015, respondent underwent bilateral polypectomy and endoscopic sinus surgery. Sometime in March of 2015, respondent underwent spinal surgery and a series of physiotherapy. However, despite the medical procedures and treatments, respondent claimed that he never regained the necessary fitness to resume seafaring duties. Respondent then sought the opinion of Dr. Manuel M. Magtira (Dr. Magtira) from the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery & Traumatology of the Armed Forces of the Philippines Medical Center. Based on the latest MRI conducted on respondent's lumbosacral spine on July 27, 2015, it was shown that he was suffering from the following: 1. L4-L5 diffuse disk bulge with a central/right paracentral disk protrusion at L4-L5 along with bilateral facet joint hypertrophy causing bilateral moderate neutral foraminal stenosis. 2. Slight exaggerated lumbar lordosis. 3. No evident intradural lesion. Dr. Magtira made the following observations in his July 30, 2015 Medical Report: Mr. Daganato continues to complain and suffer from back pain. The pain is made worse by prolonged standing and walking. He has difficulty climbing up and down the stairs. He has lost his pre-injury capacity and is UNFIT to work back at his previous occupation. Mr. Daganato is now permanently disabled. Considering these medical findings, respondent sent CF Sharp a letter dated August 14, 2015 where he claimed for total and permanent disability benefits and expressed his willingness to undergo another examination to confirm his physical condition. According to respondent, CF Sharp simply ignored his letter. Thus, respondent was constrained to file a grievance before the Associated Marine Officer's and Seamen's Union of the Philippines (AMOSUP) which, however, did not yield a positive result. In view of the foregoing, respondent filed a Complaint for total permanent disability benefits, medical reimbursement, moral and exemplary damages, and attorney's fees against petitioners before the NCMB, which was assigned to a PVA... For their part, petitioners argued that respondent is disqualified to claim disability compensation under the CBA since respondent failed to present proof of the accident that occurred on board the vessel. At most, respondent is only entitled to partial disability compensation of Grade 11 as assessed by the company-designated physician. According to CF Sharp, under Section 32 of the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration Standard of Employment Contract (POEA-SEC), only diseases or injuries enumerated therein, including the occupational diseases and illnesses that were categorized as Grade 1 disability, will be entitled to full disability benefits. Since respondent's illness is not listed or categorized as Grade 1 disability, his claim for permanent total disability should be dismissed. In its February 29, 2016 Decision, the PVA dismissed respondent's claims for damages but nonetheless granted his claims for total permanent disability benefits and attorney's fees, to wit: WHEREFORE, the foregoing premises being considered, respondent C.F. Sharp Crew Management, Inc. is hereby ordered to pay Roberto B. Daganato his permanent total disability benefits pursuant to the TCC IMEC IBF 2012 in the amount of USD 121,176.00 or its peso equivalent at the time of payment, and attorney's fees equivalent to ten percent of the award, or USD 12,117.60, all in the total amount of USD 133,293.60. Aggrieved, CF Sharp filed a Motion for Reconsideration on June 16, 2016, which the PVA denied in its July 22, 2016 Resolution. On August 19, 2016, petitioners filed a Petition for Review... before the CA, reiterating the arguments they raised before the PVA. The appellate court, however, dismissed the appeal in its January 25, 2018 Decision, and affirmed with modification the PVA Decision, to wit: WHEREFORE, the Decision dated 29 February 2016 of the Office of the Panel of Voluntary Arbitrators, National Conciliation and Mediation Board, National Capital Region, Department of Labor and Employment, in Case No. AC-698-RCMB-NCR-MVA-143-14-10-2015 is hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION in that the award of attorney's fees in favor of private respondent Roberto Daganato representing ten percent (10%) of his total monetary award is DELETED. Petitioners subsequently filed a Motion for Reconsideration which was denied by the CA in its Resolution dated November 21, 2018. Thus, petitioners filed this instant Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court arguing that the CA committed grave errors in finding respondent entitled to total and permanent disability benefits considering that: (a) the CBA is inapplicable there being no accident leading to respondent's medical condition; (b) the computation for a seafarer's disability benefits should be calculated on the basis of the POEA's Schedule of Disability; and, (c) assuming arguendo that the CBA is applicable, the award of USD 121,176.00 under the CBA is erroneous as the said amount is a compensation for Junior Officers and not for Ratings which respondent's position falls under.",The petition is partly meritorious.,"The Court has consistently held that only questions of law may be raised in a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, as amended. The Court is not a trier of facts, and its jurisdiction is limited to errors of law. x x x There is sufficient showing that respondent suffered an accident on board the vessel... We have no reason to deviate from the factual findings of the PVA and the CA. x x x All of these circumstances and substantial evidence taken together strongly indicate that respondent indeed met an accident while on board the vessel. Respondent suffered total and permanent disability as a result of his accident on board the vessel; hence the CBA applies. The Court has recognized the application of the CBA over the POEA-SEC provisions on disability compensation when the same provide for better benefits to laborers. x x x Applying the abovementioned rules, We find and so hold that respondent suffered from a total and permanent disability. x x x The company-designated physician, however, was able to issue a Certification declaring respondent with a disability rating of 'Grade 11-slight rigidity or 1/3 loss of lifting power of the trunk,' only on June 15, 2015, which is the 157th day reckoned from the time respondent was medically repatriated, without any assessment or indication as to his capacity to resume to work, or any justification to extend the 120-day period. Clearly, respondent's disability has become total and permanent upon failure by the company-designated physician to issue a final and determinative assessment within the 120-day period required under the rules. x x x As aptly observed by the PVA and as affirmed by the CA, due to his injuries, respondent can no longer resume his seafaring activities or work as a chief cook as it requires him to be in excellent physical condition. Perforce, respondent should be entitled to total and permanent disability benefits under the CBA. Based on the CBA, respondent's position as a chief cook falls under 'Ratings'. We find petitioners' claim that respondent should only be entitled to the benefits corresponding to 'Ratings' as he is not a Junior Officer impressed with merit. x x x Thus, consistent with these rulings, while respondent is entitled to total and permanent disability benefits, the Court deems it proper to adjust the award to correspond to his rank under the CBA. Allowing respondent to take home the amount of USD 121,176.00 (the rate for Junior Officers), as opposed to USD 95,949.00 under Appendix 3 of their CBA for Ratings to which he belongs, would be unjust enrichment on his part and would clearly be unfair to petitioners. x x x Nonetheless, the Court deems it proper to reinstate the award of attorney's fees consistent with Abasta Shipmanagement Corp v. Segui, citing Gomez v. Crossworld Marine Services, Inc., which declared that 'under Article 2208, paragraph 8 of the Civil Code, attorney's fees can be recovered in actions for indemnity under workmen's compensation and employer's liability laws.' Finally, in line with jurisprudence, the Court imposes on the monetary award for permanent and total disability benefits an interest at the legal rate of 6% per annum from the date of finality of this judgment until full satisfaction.","WHEREFORE, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is PARTIALLY GRANTED. The January 25, 2018 Decision and the November 21, 2018 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 147111 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION in that the award of USD 121,176.00 is REDUCED to USD 95,949.00, while the award of attorney's fees equivalent to ten percent (10%) of the award is REINSTATED. A legal interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum is also imposed on the monetary award for permanent and total disability benefits due Roberto B. Daganato, to be reckoned from the finality of this Decision until full satisfaction thereof. SO ORDERED."

Ni pagalitan nga itong Raffy dahil di nagagalit sa babae basta kahit mali. Napaka-saksakan kayo ng sinungaling. At ikaw Mr. Raymart Santiago malakas ang loob nyo dahil kinuyog nyo ang Utol namin. Eh masarap sana siguro kung 4-on-8 eh kayang kaya namin eh. Apat [kami] v. walo kayo. Tama itong sinabi ni Raffy, tayo din eh nagkikita sa airport, ipagdasal mo lang muna at pinapayo ko [sayo] at sa asawa mo, wag ka muna lumabas ng bansa dahil nagpang-abot tayo sa NAIA Terminal 1, Terminal 2, Terminal 3 tatamaan at tatamaan ka wala akong pakialam, pati asawa mo tatamaan sa akin. Ipagdasal mo na lamang na wag tayong mag-krus ng landas.
Ben Tulfo: Pero sa akin isa lang ang gagawin ko, Raymart pakinggan mo sasabihin ko – binabangga ko ang mga criminal, mamamatay tao, matinong tao pero kung gusto mo malaking warehouse sarado, mag-aantay mga ambulansya, last man standing, lalabas sa loob, magsasara tayo ng pinto. Titignan ko ang galing mo.
Erwin Tulfo: 'Di pa tayo tapos Raymart, di pa tayo tapos [Antabayanan] mo ang lintik ng ganti ng Tulfo.
The MTRCB Chief Legal Counsel found probable cause for violation of Section 3 (c) of Presidential Decree No. 1986, recommending the case for Formal Adjudication and thus, summonses were sent to the respondents TV5 and Ramon del Rosario as head of the Airtime Management Department of TV5. Finding the said Subject Utterances as ""clear violation of ethical standards set and followed in the Broadcasting industry, TV5 directed the hosts to explain in 24 hours from 07 May 2012 why they should not be sanctioned. T3's hosts submitted their respective letter-responses to TV5's show cause memorandum, wherein the Tulfo brothers apologized and expressed their regret for their actions. On 09 May 2012, TV5 issued letters informing the Tulfos that their actions were sufficient cause to terminate their engagements with TV5 but considering the circumstances of the hosts' emotions, their admissions and subsequent apologies, the sanction for their actions was reduced to a three­ episode suspension. Likewise[,] on 09 May 2012, TV5 received a Letter-Complaint filed by MTRCB's Legal Counsel Jonathan S. Presquito alleging that the [Tulfos'] statements and comments on the mauling of Ramon Tulfo were ""indecent, contrary to law, or with dangerous tendency to encourage the commission of violence, or of a wrong or crime,"" and ordering TV5 to a preliminary hearing. On 10 May 2012, the preliminary hearing was conducted by the MTRCB Hearing and Adjudication Committee, which issued a Preventive Suspension Order against T3 for a period of twenty (20) days. On 11 May [2012], TV5 filed, under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, a Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition with Urgent Application for the Ex Parte Issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction before the Court of Appeals. Another hearing was held by the MTRCB Hearing and Adjudication Committee on 14 May 2012 wherein the said Committee required the respondents to submit their Position Paper on 21 May 2012. On 16 May 2012, this Court conducted oral arguments on TV5's petition for certiorari and did not issue a temporary restraining order against the MTRCB from continuing its proceedings (CA-G.R. SP No. 124590). On 30 May 2012, the MTRCB Hearing and Adjudication Committee issued the assailed Decision against T3, meting out the penalty of suspension of three (3) months, a fine in the amount of One Hundred Thousand Pesos (P100,000.00) and after the completion of the suspension, placing the show on probation or on a per-episode basis.","In its Decision[11] dated March 7, 2013, the CA held thus: 1) The MTRCB has the statutory authority to regulate the television and movie industry and the content shown therein, including the utterances complained in the instant case; 2) The utterances herein cannot be strictly categorized as obscene and indecent, conclusively defamatory nor constituted fighting words but rather ordinary threats as understood in their totality and the context in which they were made; 3) In light of the threats uttered by its program hosts, TV5 took appropriate action and imposed discipline consistent with its right and duty to regulate itself under its charter RA 7831; 4) Given the exercise of self-regulation under RA 7831 and the constitutional protection on free speech, the penalties imposed by the MTRCB were no longer warranted. The dispositive portion of the CA Decision reads: WHEREFORE, the Petition is GRANTED. The MTRCB Decision is SET ASIDE for being unwarranted and effectively constituting prior restraint. SO ORDERED.","The case at bar is very similar to the landmark case of Iglesia ni Cristo (INC) v. Court of Appeals, Board of Review for Moving Pictures and Television (Board) (INC). In this case, the Court similarly applies the INC ruling in affirming the CA ruling. The Court agrees with the CA in ruling that the MTRCB wrongfully used ""the literal approach from the perspective of an average child""[21] by categorizing the Tulfo brothers' utterances as ""vulgar, indecent, crude, coarse, threatening, defamatory and unrefined,""[22] and branding the same as ""personal attacks with a dangerous tendency to encourage the commission of violence or of a wrong or crime.""[23] This literal approach thus led the MTRCB to wrongfully rule that the utterances made in the show, T3, were in violation of Section 3 (c) of PD 1986. Applying the INC ruling, the Court holds as follows: First, it is fundamental law that any act that restrains or censors speech is presumed invalid. However, the freedom of speech is not absolute and the burden of overthrowing the presumption of invalidity rests on the one restraining or censoring the same in accordance with applicable law. In this case, the MTRCB has a reviewing and restraining power over speech, pursuant to Section 3 (b) of PD 1986, to wit: SEC. 3. Powers and Functions. – The BOARD shall have the following functions, powers and duties: x x x x (b) To screen, review and examine all motion pictures as herein defined, television programs, including publicity material such as advertisements, trailers and stills, whether such motion picture and publicity materials be for theatrical or non-theatrical distribution, for television broadcast or for general viewing, imported or produced in the Philippines, and in the latter case, whether they be for local viewing or for export; x x x x. The provision simply gives the MTRCB the power to screen, review and examine all ""television programs,"" whether religious, public affairs, news documentary, etc., including the show, T3. Second, however, is the importance of knowing the extent of the MTRCB's power to screen, review and examine. Section 3 (c) of PD 1986 is clear: Section 3 (c) of PD 1986, creating the Movie and Television Review and Classification Board, states: SEC. 3. Powers and Functions. – The BOARD shall have the following functions, powers and duties: x x x x (c) To approve or disapprove, delete objectionable portions from and/or prohibit the importation, exportation, production, copying, distribution, sale, lease, exhibition and/or television broadcast of the motion pictures, television programs and publicity materials subject of the preceding paragraph, which, in the judgment of the BOARD applying contemporary Filipino cultural values as standard, are objectionable for being immoral, indecent, contrary to law and/or good customs, injurious to the prestige of the Republic of the Philippines or its people, or with a dangerous tendency to encourage the commission of violence or of a wrong or crime, such as but not limited to: i) Those which tend to incite subversion, insurrection, rebellion or sedition against the State, or otherwise threaten the economic and/or political stability of the State; ii) Those which tend to undermine the faith and confidence of the people in their government and/or the duly constituted authorities; iii) Those which glorify criminal or condone crimes; iv) Those which serve no other purpose but to satisfy the market for violence or pornography; v) Those which tend to abet the traffic in and use of prohibited drugs; vi) Those which are libelous or defamatory to the good name and reputation of any person, whether living or dead; and vii) Those which may constitute contempt of court or of any quasi- judicial tribunal, or pertain to matters which are sub-judice in nature. Provided, however, That deletions or cuts must not be made on the master negative of the films, and that such master negative shall be deposited with the Film Archives of the Philippines and shall be released for export purposes to the film owner only upon showing of the proper export permit; Provided, finally, That the film owner shall execute a sworn undertaking that such master negative shall be exclusively used for export purposes and not for local viewing. In ruling whether the MTRCB's determination of the subject utterances are within the purview of Section 3 (c) of PD 1986, the Court rules in the negative. The CA, in defining the words ""vulgar,"" ""indecent,"" ""threatening and contrary to law and/or good customs,"" and ""defamatory,"" concluded that all the words uttered by the Tulfo brothers, taken as a whole, are more of a ""threatened vengeance upon Santiago who allegedly mauled x x x Ramon [Tulfo],"" to wit: We have determined above that the utterances complained of and penalized by the MTRCB are not separately and individually vulgar, indecent and defamatory but rather one in which the hosts Tulfos threatened vengeance upon Santiago who allegedly mauled their brother Ramon. Being threatening, do the utterances fall under the category of ""fighting words"" and therefore considered as unprotected speech? We hold that the utterances are not fighting words. The Court agrees with the CA. Insulting or ""fighting words,"" together with libelous statements, defamation, obscenity or pornography, false or misleading advertisement are considered unprotected speech or low-value expression. ""Fighting words"" are those words which by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of peace and expression endangering national security. The utterances made by the Tulfo brothers, although in the guise of ""fighting words,"" were not sufficient to stir and constitute a clear and present danger to the State that is grave and imminent. ... Thus, the Tulfo brothers' utterances are only considered threats against Santiago. Nothing more. The utterances made by them, although profane and vulgar, did not incite its audience to lawless action that may lead to a breach of peace of the State. With regard to the imposition of penalties, the Court affirms the conclusion reached by the CA. TV5 appropriately took action and correctly imposed discipline on the Tulfo brothers as the hosts of the show, T3, consistent with TV5's right and duty to regulate itself under its charter, Republic Act No. 7831. Given this charter, the penalties imposed by the MTRCB were thus no longer warranted. ... MTRCB did not have to impose any longer the three-month suspension, fine and probationary status as TV5's act of self-regulation in accordance with its charter was sufficient enough...","WHEREFORE, the Court DENIES the Petition for Review on Certiorari and AFFIRMS the March 7, 2013 Decision and May 15, 2014 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 125005. SO ORDERED."

VIBAT, PETITIONERS, VS. FELICIANA BRAVANTE, RESPONDENT.","Petitioners (Heirs of Aniolina H. Sebua and her husband Exequeil) were owners of Cadastral Lot No. 1525-E. Sometime in 1985, Exequeil mortgaged the subject land to respondent's husband Julian Bravante for a P30,000.00 loan, agreeing that Julian would cultivate the land until redemption. Exequeil attempted to pay the loan and redeem the land in 1995 and 2003, but Julian had died. After Exequeil died in 2003, petitioners sought redemption, but respondent Feliciana Bravante claimed ownership over the property.

Respondent denied petitioners' ownership, asserting that the land was initially mortgaged to Recto Debuque. In 1982, petitioners borrowed P7,000.00 from respondent and Julian (P5,000.00 paid to Debuque, P2,000.00 to petitioners), secured by the lot. Petitioners subsequently made additional loans, totaling P22,202.00 by 23 March 1985. Since the loan exceeded the original mortgage consideration, respondent alleged that petitioners agreed to waive their rights to the subject land for a total consideration of P30,000.00, which Julian and respondent completed paying in installments by 03 October 1985.","The Court of Appeals (CA) Decision dated 22 January 2019 partly granted respondent Feliciana Bravante's appeal and dismissed petitioners’ complaint for lack of cause of action. The CA found that both parties failed to establish their respective causes of action and left things as they were. This reversed the Decision dated 16 October 2014 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), which had ruled that the parties entered into an equitable mortgage and allowed petitioner to redeem the subject property upon payment of P30,000.00.","The Court finds merit in the Petition. The transaction between the parties is deemed an equitable mortgage, as the real intention was to secure the payment of a debt (Article 1602(6) in relation to Article 1604 of the Civil Code). The financial status of petitioners and the repeated attempts to recover the land supported this assessment. Respondent's consolidation of ownership over the subject property due to petitioners' failure to pay the obligation is considered as pactum commissorium, which is contrary to morals and public policy and thus void. If respondent desired to obtain title, the proper remedy was judicial foreclosure, which she did not pursue. The Court upheld the RTC's ruling that the transaction was an equitable mortgage but deleted the award of attorney's fees.","WHEREFORE, the present petition is GRANTED. The Decision of the Court of Appeals – Cagayan de Oro City in CA-G.R. CV No. 03974-MIN is REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The Decision of Branch 26, Regional Trial Court of Surallah, South Cotabato in Civil Case No. 989 is REINSTATED and AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION that petitioners Heirs of Aniolina H. Sebua, are liable for interest at the rate of 12% per annum computed from 06 August 2009 until 30 June 2013. From 1 July 2013 until finality of this Decision, the interest rate of 6% per annum shall be imposed to the unpaid obligation. In case of default on the part of petitioners to settle their obligations within ninety (90) days from finality of this Decision, the property shall be sold at public auction and the proceeds applied to the mortgage debt.

"G.R. No. 235086, July 06, 2022","DEPARTMENT OF AGRARIAN REFORM, PETITIONER, VS. JUSTINIANA ITLIONG, DAVID C. DAKANAY AND THE OTHER LEGITIMATE CHILDREN OF THE LATE LOURDES CADIZ DAKANAY RESPONDENTS.","The subject matter in this case is an 11.16885-hectare landholding which is a portion of a 22.3377-hectare agricultural landholding covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-104039, situated in Tagpore, Panabo City, Davao, and conjugally owned by Spouses Emigdio and Lourdes Dakanay. Lourdes died on 20 September 2004, leaving Emigdio and their four children (David et al.). Emigdio waived his hereditary rights over the subject landholding in favor of his four children via an Extrajudicial Partition of Estate dated 01 October 2004. On 31 May 2005, the MARO issued a Notice of Coverage (NOC) over the entire 22.3377 hectares, addressed to Emigdio. On 02 August 2005, respondents David, et al. filed a Petition to Lift Notice of Coverage with respect to their 11.16885-hectare share, claiming their individual shares (2.7922 hectares each) were below the 5-hectare retention limit. Regional Director Rodolfo T. Inson denied the petition on 15 February 2006, holding that only registered owners as of the effectivity of RA 6657 (15 June 1988) are entitled to retention. Secretary Nasser Pangandaman granted David et al.'s appeal on 13 November 2009, lifting the NOC over the 11.16885 hectares, finding the NOC erroneously sent to Emigdio. Intervenor Justiniana Itliong filed a Motion for Reconsideration. Secretary Virgilio De Los Reyes granted Justiniana's motion on 08 August 2012, reversing Pangandaman's order and reinstating Inson's orders. Secretary De Los Reyes ruled that David et al.'s retention rights derived from Lourdes, limiting them to a proportionate share of 2.5 hectares (0.625 hectares each), and required Emigdio and the children to jointly choose a five (5) hectare compact and contiguous retained area.","In its Decision dated 22 May 2017, the Court of Appeals (CA) ruled in favor of respondents David, et al. The appellate court agreed with Secretary Pangandaman's ruling that at the time the NOC was issued, the subject 11.16885-hectare landholding already had several owners, and the NOC was erroneously sent to Emigdio. The CA held that upon Lourdes' death, her heirs (David, et al.) became co-owners by intestate succession, and since each of their resultant shares (2.7922 hectares) was below the retention limit, their right of absolute ownership must be respected. The dispositive portion reads: WHEREFORE, premises considered, the assailed Orders dated August 8, 2012 and March 18, 2015 issued by DAR Secretary Virgilio R. De Los Reyes are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE and the Order dated November 13, 2009 issued by DAR Secretary Nasser Pangandaman is REINSTATED. No costs. SO ORDERED.","The Supreme Court ruled that the CA erred in holding that the subject property is exempt from DAR coverage under RA 6657. The Court held that the inclusion of the landholding and the status as landowners under RA 6657 are reckoned at the time of its effectivity on 15 June 1988, not the date of the issuance of the Notice of Coverage (NOC). Respondents David, et al. are considered children of landowners, not landowners themselves as of 1988, and are not entitled to a separate five-hectare retention limit unless they meet the qualifications for a three-hectare award (at least 15 years old as of 15 June 1988 and actually tilling/managing the land), which they failed to show. The Court found no conflict between RA 6657 and the Civil Code on succession, as heirs who do not qualify for retention are still entitled to the proceeds of the land. Furthermore, David, et al. were deemed to have waived their right to claim under Lourdes' retention limit by failing to file an affidavit manifesting their intention to retain the land within 60 calendar days from receipt of the NOC.","WHEREFORE, the Petition is GRANTED. The assailed Decision dated 22 May 2017 and the Resolution dated 11 September 2017 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 140066 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The Order dated 08 August 2012 of the Secretary of the Department of Agrarian Reform is REINSTATED with MODIFICATION that herein respondents David C.

The prosecution alleged that during a buy-bust operation on November 10, 2015, PO1 Lubrin, acting as poseur-buyer, met accused-appellant Fandialan at a waiting shed. PO1 Lubrin handed the P500-bill buy-bust money to Fandialan, who handed over a small plastic sachet of suspected shabu. Fandialan was immediately apprehended, and the marked money was recovered by PO2 Caparas. A ""Mentos"" candy container was also recovered from Fandialan containing three small plastic sachets of suspected shabu. Inventory and marking were conducted at the target area with a media representative. Fandialan denied the charges, claiming that two men barged into his yard while he was smoking, grabbed him by his hair, ordered him to kneel down, struck his head with a gun, and handcuffed him. He alleged that the men ordered him to bring out the shabu he was keeping, and subsequently brought out a small container with a sachet of shabu and money inside, before taking a picture.","The Regional Trial Court (RTC) found Joel Fandialan y Bernaldez guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Sections 5 and 11, Article II of Republic Act No. (RA) 9165. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the Decision dated October 11, 2017 of the RTC.","The Supreme Court found the appeal meritorious, noting that while the prosecution established the first three links in the chain of custody, there was a gap or break in the fourth link (the turnover and submission of the illegal drug from the forensic chemist to the court). The Court held that the stipulation on the proposed testimony of Forensic Chemist Grace Plantilla Bombasi was insufficient because it failed to mention: (1) the condition of the specimens when FC Bombasi received them; (2) the description of the method utilized in analyzing the chemical composition of the drug samples; (3) whether she resealed the specimens after examination of the content and placed her own marking on the drug items; and (4) the manner of handling and storage of the specimens before, during, and after the chemical examination. The prosecution's failure to establish with moral certainty the identity and the unbroken chain of custody of the dangerous drugs creates reasonable doubt and compromises the integrity of the corpus delicti.","The appeal is GRANTED. The Decision dated June 22, 2020 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 10170 is REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Accordingly, accused-appellant Joel Fandialan y Bernaldez is ACQUITTED of violation of Sections 5 and 11, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165, as amended, for failure of the prosecution to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt, and is ordered immediately RELEASED from detention, unless he is confined for any other lawful cause."

Suddenly, Leo saw Cesar Tapel (Cesar) and his son, Charles Tapel (Charles), who were armed with a fan knife (balisong) and a gun, respectively. Thereafter, Cesar and Charles blocked Leo's way. Leo swerved the motorcycle and sped towards his father Leonardo Abuyo's house. Charles followed, kicked the fence, and yelled for Leo to come out. Leonardo tried to pacify Charles, but Cesar arrived and stabbed Leonardo in the lower left part of his chest. Leonardo ran towards Leo's house, but Cesar still pursued him with the fan knife. Leo went outside, and when Cesar tried to stab him, Leo got a bolo and hacked Cesar's right hand, causing Cesar to drop the fan knife. Cesar managed to pick up the fan knife, but Leo stabbed him again in the lower part of his stomach, which caused Cesar's death. Leo voluntarily surrendered. He was charged with Homicide. The Regional Trial Court (RTC) convicted Leo of Homicide, finding he failed to prove complete self-defense, but appreciated incomplete self-defense and voluntary surrender, sentencing him to four (4) years, two (2) months, and one (1) day prision correccional, as minimum, to eight (8) years of prision mayor, as maximum, and ordered him to pay damages. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the RTC's finding of guilt with modification on damages.","the petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated June 28, 2019 and the Resolution dated November 12, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 41325 are REVERSED.","The petition is meritorious. The admission of self-defense or defense of a relative shifts the burden of proof to the accused. The Court finds that the first element (unlawful aggression) and the third element (lack of sufficient provocation) of self-defense and defense of a relative are present. The Court ruled that the second element, 'reasonable necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel such aggression,' was also present. The law requires rational equivalence, not material commensurability, and the accused cannot be expected to reflect coolly when under imminent threat of fatal harm. The CA and the RTC’s reasoning that Leo could have grabbed Cesar's knife or run away ignored the reality of the pressing situation, where Cesar immediately regained possession of the knife and Charles was present holding a gun. Leo was animated only by his mortal fear and the instinct of self-preservation to defend his life and his father's life. The measure of rational necessity is found in the situation as it appeared to Leo at the time of the incident, and inflicting a fatal wound does not make the means employed any less reasonable under the circumstances.","Petitioner Leo Abuyo y Sagrit is ACQUITTED of the crime of Homicide and ORDERED to be RELEASED IMMEDIATELY from detention, unless he is being lawfully held for another cause."

When respondents opened the chocolate bars, they discovered that these were infested with maggots, maggot eggs, and cobwebs. A similar incident happened on January 29, 2008 when respondents once again bought Cadbury chocolate bars from petitioner as gifts for Frank Rhedey's (Frank) brother-in-law. All eight chocolate bars they purchased were likewise found to have been infested with live maggots, maggot eggs, and cobwebs. Respondents communicated with Cadbury, which assured them that they will conduct an investigation on the matter. There being no positive result on the investigation allegedly conducted by Cadbury, respondents filed a complaint before the Department of Health (DOH), Region 10, Carmen, Cagayan de Oro City. The DOH conducted an investigation by purchasing a Cadbury chocolate bar from petitioner and subjecting it to laboratory examination. After testing and analysis, the result showed that the chocolate was no longer fit for consumption. Despite this finding, however, the complaint was dismissed by the DOH on the ground of lack of jurisdiction over respondents' claim for damages amounting to P10,000,000.00. Respondents still tried to demand compensation from Cadbury and petitioner as a last-ditch effort but to no avail. This prompted respondents to file a case in the RTC against Cadbury and petitioner for damages for their alleged malicious and fraudulent acts of selling infested products and refusing to give compensation. In its Answer, petitioner asserted that respondents have no cause of action against it: first, because the complaint is already barred by laches and prescription as the supposed purchase of the chocolates took place almost four (4) years before the filing of the complaint; and second, because there was no proof of purchase of the chocolate bars attached to the complaint. Meanwhile, because summons was left unserved, the RTC ordered the archiving of the case with respect to Cadbury for failure of the RTC to acquire jurisdiction over it.","The Regional Trial Court (RTC) rendered a Decision on December 9, 2016 finding Gaisano Superstore, Inc. liable for damages for selling contaminated food products under Republic Act No. (RA) 7394, otherwise known as The Consumer Act of the Philippines. The RTC ordered petitioner to pay respondents P50,000.00 as temperate damages and P10,000.00 as actual damages (representing litigation expenses). The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the ruling of the RTC, finding that the fact of purchase was established by the positive testimony of Frank Rhedey despite the absence of receipts, and that petitioner was negligent in selling spoiled or defective Cadbury chocolates under Articles 97 and 98 of RA 7394. Petitioner appealed the CA ruling to the Supreme Court.","The Supreme Court found the petition without merit, reiterating that a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 is limited only to questions of law, and petitioner was merely challenging the factual findings affirmed by both the RTC and the CA regarding the proof of purchase. The Court found no reversible error and upheld the finding that petitioner was liable for negligence (quasi-delict) under Article 2176 of the Civil Code for selling maggot-infested chocolate bars. The award of P50,000.00 as temperate damages was affirmed under Article 2224, as respondents suffered pecuniary loss although the exact amount could not be proven with certainty. The Court modified the P10,000.00 award from actual damages to attorney's fees, pursuant to Article 2208(2) of the Civil Code, as respondents were forced to litigate. Legal interest of six percent (6%) per annum was imposed on the monetary awards.","WHEREFORE, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED.

She and petitioners, along with five (5) other girls recruited by petitioners, boarded a boat bound for Cebu. During the boat ride, petitioners instructed them to say they were going for a vacation. Upon docking in Cebu, a police officer approached them, and they were subsequently brought to the police station. Then 17-year-old BBB223042 corroborated this, testifying that petitioners recruited her and friends to work as dancers in Cebu, detailing the work: 8 PM to 3 AM, uniform (bra and panty/t-back), salaries (P200-P300/day), and they would earn half of the bar fine worth P6,000.00 should a customer request for them. Then 15-year-old CCC223042 had similar experience, testifying petitioners told her customers would be allowed to bring her to a hotel and have sex with her upon paying a bar fine. They were intercepted at the pier.
Version of the Defense: Petitioners denied the charges, claiming they are also victims since they too are prostitutes. Candy testified that she only agreed to help the victims who requested to come with her to Cebu because the pay was better there, and she paid for their fare subject to reimbursement using P25,000 sent by her Korean boyfriend. Nikki testified she went along because she was also interested in the bigger income in Cebu and paid for her own fare, and never forced the other girls.","Under Decision dated July 22, 2015, the Court of Appeals affirmed with modification, awarding moral and exemplary damages to complainants, viz.: WHEREFORE, this appeal is DENIED. The Decision dated November 28, 2011 and Order dated August 7, 2012 of Branch 6 of the Regional Trial Court of Cebu City in Crim. Case No. CBU-86668 is AFFIRMED. Accused-appellants are likewise required to jointly and severally pay each of the victims AAA, BBB, CCC, DDD, EEE, FFF, and GGG the amount of P500,000 as moral damages and P100,000 as exemplary damages. SO ORDERED.","The Supreme Court denied the Petitions. Preliminarily, the Court noted that both Candy (Rule 45) and Nikki (Rule 65) availed of improper remedies, as appeals in criminal cases where life imprisonment is imposed must be by mere notice of appeal (Section 3(c), Rule 122). However, in the interest of substantial justice, the Court treated the petitions as ordinary appeals. The Court rejected Candy's arguments on the invalidity of the warrantless arrest and Nikki's argument on the sufficiency of the Information, ruling that these objections were waived as they were raised for the first time on appeal. The Court affirmed that petitioners are guilty of Qualified Trafficking in Persons under Section 4(a), in relation to Section 6(a) and (c) of RA 9208. All elements were established: petitioners recruited and transported the victims (all minors) to Cebu for the purpose of prostitution, taking advantage of their vulnerability. The victims' consent was immaterial as they were minors. Furthermore, the Court rejected the defense that the crime was merely attempted because the victims were intercepted; the crime is consummated when a person is recruited and transported for the purpose of prostitution, and actual sexual exploitation is not required by RA 9208.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petitions in G.R. Nos. 223042 and 223769 are DENIED. The Decision dated July 22, 2015, and Resolution dated February 11, 2016, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CEB-C.R.-H.C. No. 01570 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. Petitioners Dhayme Jamuad a.k.a. Nikki Muring Ferrer and Candy a.k.a. Baby/Jillian Muring Ferrer are found GUILTY of QUALIFIED TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS under Section 4(a), in relation to Section 6(a) and (c) of Republic Act No. 9208. They are each sentenced to life imprisonment and ordered to pay a fine of P2,000,000.00. Petitioners are further ORDERED to jointly and severally pay each of the victims AAA223042, BBB223042, CCC223042, DDD223042, EEE223042, FFF223042, and GGG223042 the amounts of P500,000.00 as moral damages and P100,000.00 as exemplary damages. These amounts shall earn six percent (6%) legal interest per annum from the finality of this Decision until fully paid."
"G.R. No. 238468, July 06, 2022","PERLITA MABALO, PETITIONER, VS. HEIRS OF ROMAN BABUYO, REPRESENTED BY VIRGILIO L. BABUYO,RESPONDENTS.","During his lifetime, Roman owned a 5,599-square-meter parcel of land located in Kauswagan, Lagonglong, Misamis Oriental (subject lot), particularly described as follows: A parcel of land, Lot 943-Cad-361-D, covered under Original Certificate of Title No. P-10402, Free Patent No. 575915 with an area of 5,599 square meters... When Roman died, his children... took physical possession and introduced improvements on the subject lot. As of date, the subject lot remains undivided among them. Later on, the children of Roman discovered their father had another heir named Rufino Babuyo (Rufino), who had begotten a daughter named Segundina Taranza Baboyo (Segundina). Segundina claimed that she inherited a portion of the subject lot comprised of 3,664 square meters from her father Rufino, and later on sold a portion thereof consisting of 364 square meters to Mabalo on June 2, 2014. On June 3, 2014, the heirs of Roman hired laborers to trim the branches of a tree planted on the subject lot, but Mabalo arrived and ordered them to desist from further work. Thereafter, she constructed a fence on this section with a sign that says, ""No Trespassing Private Property."" Mabalo also caused the demolition of two houses and pruned the plants growing on the subject lot. Infuriated, the heirs of Roman demanded Mabalo to vacate the subject lot, but she refused, which compelled them to file a complaint for forcible entry against her on July 10, 2014.","The MCTC rendered its Decision dated February 24, 2015, and held that the heirs of Roman have established all the requisites for a complaint of forcible entry to prosper... The dispositive portion of the MCTC Decision states: WHEREFORE, by a preponderance of evidence, a judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiffs represented by their attorney-in-fact Virgilio Babuyo and against defendant Perlita Mabalo ordering said defendant: 1) And all persons claiming rights under her to immediately vacate the portion of the land owned by the Heirs of Roman Babuyo she bought from Segundina Baboyo Fernandez which land is covered by Original Certificate of Title No. P-10402, Free Patent No. 575915 and to remove the improvements she introduced thereon; 2) To pay the plaintiff the sum of P 5,000.00 as attorney's fees 3) To pay rental equivalent to P 300.00 per month from June 03, 2014 until the portion occupied by her is surrendered to the plaintiffs 4) And ordering the dismissal of defendant's counter-claim for lack of merit Cost against the defendant. SO ORDERED. The RTC affirmed the ruling of the MCTC... The CA, in its Decision dated March 15, 2018, affirmed the RTC Resolution and ruled that the subject lot remains undivided and co-owned by the parties. For this reason, what was sold to Mabalo was only Segundina's pro indiviso rights as a co-owner, nothing more.","The petition is bereft of merit. . . While the sale between them covered a specific area of the subject lot purportedly pertaining to Segundina, the sale remains effective to the extent that it only transferred her pro-indiviso share to petitioner. Accordingly, petitioner, as the buyer, stepped into Segundina's shoes and made her a co-owner of the subject lot until it is partitioned. The Supreme Court established new rules which govern ejectment suits between co-owners as embodied in Art. 487 of the Civil Code: If a co-owner takes possession of a definite portion of the common property in the exercise of their right to possession as a co-owner, they may not be ejected as long as they recognize the co-ownership... If a co-owner takes exclusive possession of a specific portion of the common property, which results in the exclusion or deprivation of another co-owner in prior possession, any co-owner may file an action for ejectment to evict the co-owner who wrested its possession by force. The Court found that respondents established all the requisites of forcible entry: a) respondents have prior physical possession of the common property; b) they were deprived of possession when petitioner claimed a specific portion already occupied by her co-owners and had the improvements therein removed, from which the employment of force can be deduced; and c) the action was filed within one year from the time of the dispossession.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DENIED. The Decision dated March 15, 2018 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 07450-MIN, is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. Petitioner Perlita Mabalo and all persons claiming rights under her are ordered to immediately VACATE the portion of land owned by the Heirs of Roman Babuyo, which she bought from Segundina Babuyo Fernandez covered by Original Certificate of Title No. P-10402, Free Patent No. 575915 and to remove the improvements she introduced thereon. Meanwhile, the award of rent and attorney's fees are hereby DELETED."
"G.R. No. 255864, July 06, 2022","UNIVERSAL ROBINA CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. ROBERTO DE GUZMAN MAGLALANG, RESPONDENT.","In his complaint, Roberto alleged that he started working as URC's machine operator on November 17, 1997. On March 26, 2015, he went to the parking lot to clean his motorcycle seat using the alcohol provided by the company for the employees' use within the company premises. Afterward, he submitted a bag for inspection before going home. The security guard noticed a bottle. Roberto realized that the alcohol was still in his bag. Roberto panicked and threw the bottle away before the security guard could retrieve it. When the security guard recovered the bottle, he discovered that it contained ethyl alcohol belonging to the company. Roberto was brought to the police station for investigation. The following day, he was criminally charged with qualified theft. He was detained at the police station for five days and was placed under preventive suspension for 30 days, which was extended for another 30 days. On March 27, 2015, URC issued a Notice to Explain, informing Roberto of the charges against him and giving him five days to submit a written explanation. Roberto submitted a written explanation to the union, but URC refused to accept it. He also asked for the union's help to be reinstated, but to no avail. For its part, URC alleged that Roberto failed to submit a written explanation, so they gave him another opportunity to present his side. In an administrative hearing held on April 27, 2015, Roberto admitted that he took the bottle but denied stealing it. URC was not convinced. Thus, on May 14, 2015, URC issued a Notice of Termination. URC added that during the pendency of the criminal case, they received various apology letters with pleas for the withdrawal of the criminal case and reinstatement from Roberto. On July 15, 2016, the parties entered into a compromise agreement wherein they agreed to waive any and all claims or cause of actions that they may have against one another, given URC's withdrawal of the criminal case. However, URC denied Roberto's request for reinstatement and payment of money claims. On August 23, 2016, the criminal case against Roberto was dismissed. But then, Roberto filed an illegal dismissal case against URC. On September 29, 2017, the Labor Arbiter (LA) dismissed the case for lack of merit. The LA found Roberto guilty of serious misconduct for theft of company property. The LA ordered URC to pay Roberto P12,939.81, representing the balance of his money claims, thus: WHEREFORE, premises considered, the complaint for illegal dismissal is DISMISSED for lack of merit. However, respondent [URC] is ordered to pay complainant [P]12,939.81 representing the balance of his money claims, after deducting government loans in the amount of [P]13,843.50 and [P]15,249.66 from Pag-ibig and SSS, respectively. SO ORDERED. In a Decision dated December 29, 2017, the NLRC upheld the LA's findings that Roberto was validly dismissed for committing serious misconduct. Unable to secure a reconsideration, Roberto filed a petition for certiorari with the CA. He argued that the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion when it dismissed his complaint for illegal dismissal.","On September 15, 2020, the CA issued a Decision finding that Roberto was illegally dismissed. The CA ruled that Roberto was only guilty of simple misconduct because URC recovered the bottle of alcohol, and its value was only P60.00. Roberto was also not guilty of willful breach of trust because he was not occupying a position of trust and confidence. With this, the penalty of dismissal was not commensurate with the misconduct. However, since reinstatement was no longer possible because of strained relations between the parties, the CA granted Roberto separation pay in lieu of reinstatement, with backwages. The dispositive part of the CA's Decision reads: WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Petition is GRANTED. The Decision and Resolution dated 29 December 2017 and 19 February 2018, respectively, of the [NLRC], Sixth Division in NLRC LAC No. 12-003716-17 / RAB Case No. 05-07755-17 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. A new judgment is ENTERED finding [Roberto] as illegally dismissed from his employment by [URC]. Furthermore, the [LA] of origin is DIRECTED to compute the following with dispatch: [Roberto's] backwages from the time his salary was withheld on 26 March 2015 up to the date of finality of this Decision; [Roberto's] separation pay from the date he was employed on 17 November 1997 up to the date of finality of this Decision. [URC] is also ordered to pay [Roberto] attorney's fees equivalent to 10% of the total monetary award. Furthermore, the total monetary award shall earn legal interest at the rate of 6% from the date of the finality of this Decision until fully paid.","Here, Roberto had been in URC's employ for 18 years, and this is the first time that he had been involved in taking company property. The bottle of ethyl alcohol valued at P60.00 is very minimal. URC did not lose anything as the bottle was timely retrieved. Further, it was not shown that Roberto's retention would work undue prejudice to the viability of URC's operations, or is patently inimical to its interest. Neither does Roberto occupy a position of trust and confidence, the loss of which would justify his dismissal. Hence, the Court finds that the penalty of dismissal is not proportional with Roberto's misconduct. His preventive suspension was a sufficient penalty for the misdemeanor. [...] In fine, Roberto's misconduct is not serious to constitute a just cause for dismissal under Article 297 [282] of the Labor Code. Neither does Roberto hold a position of trust and confidence, which could justify his dismissal based on loss of trust. Therefore, Roberto was illegally dismissed. [...] An illegally dismissed employee is also entitled to backwages. However, backwages may not be awarded to an illegally dismissed employee if dismissal is too harsh of a penalty and the employer terminated the employment in good faith. Such is the case here. Certainly, Roberto violated the company rules when he took a bottle of ethyl alcohol. But then, the penalty of dismissal is not commensurate to his infraction. As the Court held in Caltex, preventive suspension, not to mention Roberto's imprisonment, is a sufficient penalty for the misdemeanor. Believing that Roberto committed serious misconduct under the Labor Code, URC acted in good faith in dismissing him. For these reasons, Roberto is not entitled to backwages. Lastly, Roberto is not entitled to attorney's fees. [...] Considering that Roberto was not dismissed in bad faith, the Court cannot sustain the award of attorney's fees.","ACCORDINGLY, the petition is PARTLY GRANTED. The Court of Appeals' Decision dated September 15, 2020 and Resolution dated February 8, 2021 in CA-G.R. SP No. 155421 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION in that the award of backwages and attorney's fees are DELETED. This case is REMANDED to the Labor Arbiter for the computation of separation pay due to Roberto De Guzman Maglalang from the date of his employment on November 17, 1997, up to the date of his illegal dismissal, subject to legal interest at the rate of six (6%) per annum from the date of finality of this Decision until full payment."
"G.R. No. 187175, July 06, 2022","XXX, PETITIONER, VS. AAA, BBB, AND MINOR CCC, RESPONDENTS.","AAA and XXX were longtime live-in partners whose relationship begot three children, namely: (1) BBB, born on February 13, 1986; (2) DDD, born on January 23, 1989; and (3) CCC, born on October 31, 1990. AAA filed charges against XXX for physical violence, psychological violence, economic violence, and sexual abuse, in violation of Republic Act No. 9262, before the Office of the City Prosecutor in xxxxxxxxxx. The case was docketed as I.S. No. 07J-03232. AAA alleged physical violence (hitting her twice in the face with his forearm), psychological abuse (verbal abuse, threats), sexual abuse (forced sex, including anal sex, even while pregnant or near their dying daughter), and economic abuse (abandonment and refusal to give sufficient financial support since June 2007). XXX denied most allegations and claimed AAA was attempting to extort PHP 50,000,000.00 from him. On October 23, 2007, AAA and her children filed an Urgent Petition for Issuance of Ex Parte Temporary Protection Order and Permanent Protection Order with Petition for Support and Support Pendente Lite (Civil Case No. 07-104). The trial court issued a Temporary Protection Order (TPO) on November 16, 2007. The Office of the City Prosecutor later partially reconsidered its initial dismissal and found probable cause to indict XXX of the charge for economic abuse (Criminal Case No. 08-347). The Regional Trial Court eventually made the temporary protection order permanent on March 6, 2009 (Permanent Protection Order or PPO). XXX filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the PPO and challenging the constitutionality of Republic Act No. 9262 on grounds that it violates the right to equal protection and due process, and is an improper exercise of police power. He also argued that AAA, being his paramour, was excluded from the law's coverage, and that his children, BBB and CCC, were already adults when the PPO was issued, thus excluding them from the definition of 'children' under RA 9262.",The Petition is DENIED for lack of merit.,"The Court declined to rule on the constitutionality of Republic Act No. 9262 because the issue was not raised at the earliest opportunity during the proceedings below. Nonetheless, the Court noted that petitioner's arguments against the constitutionality of RA 9262 (on equal protection and due process) lack merit, citing the binding precedent in Garcia v. Drilon, which held that RA 9262 rests on substantial distinctions and provides adequate procedural safeguards. The Court ruled that respondent AAA, as petitioner's live-in partner to whom he has common children, falls under the coverage of RA 9262, as the law protects women in dating or sexual relationships regardless of any legal impediment to marry. Further, the Court ruled that the trial court did not err in including respondents BBB and CCC in the Permanent Protection Order, even though they had attained the age of majority. Citing Estacio v. Estacio, the Court held that neither RA 9262 nor the Rule distinguishes the age of children when they are referred to as being covered by protection orders, as the law covers 'designated family or household member[s],' which includes descendants as a whole class.","The Permanent Protection Order issued by the Regional Trial Court in favor of AAA, BBB, and CCC is affirmed."
"G.R. No. 249859, July 06, 2022","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. MARK ANTHONY YULO Y GALLO A.K.A. ""TATA"" AND MARK RYAN BUENO Y CORONA A.K.A. ""NONOY"", ACCUSED-APPELLANTS.","In the evening of January 2, 2005, Felix Sabasan y Magango (Felix) was stabbed multiple times outside his house in Sitio Culasisi, Brgy. San Luis, Antipolo City. Yulo and Bueno were identified as the suspects, and they were arrested in the early hours of January 3, 2005.[4] A search on their persons revealed a blood-stained ice pick in the possession of Yulo.[5] Subsequently, an Information for murder dated January 6, 2005 was filed against them, thus: That on or about the 2nd day of January, in the City of Antipolo Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, while armed with a bladed weapon, conspiring and confederating with one unidentified person whose true name, identity and whereabouts are still unknown[,] and mutually helping and aiding [one] another, with intent to kill, and with abuse of superior strength and treachery, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault, stab with said bladed weapon one Felix Sabasan y Magango @ ""Bochok,"" thereby inflicting upon the latter fatal wounds which directly caused his death. CONTRARY TO LAW.[6] Upon arraignment, Yulo and Bueno pleaded ""not guilty.""[7] During the pre-trial, the parties stipulated on the jurisdiction of the RTC, the identities of Yulo and Bueno, and the place and date of the incident.[8] Thereafter, trial commenced. The prosecution presented four witnesses: Lucena Abayon[9] (Abayon), Nehemias Sabasan[10] (Sabasan), Cristy Cardinal[11] (Cardinal), and Police Chief Inspector Jose Arnel Marquez[12] (PCI Marquez). Their testimonies established that: At around 11:30 in the evening on January 2, 2005, Abayon was inside her house at Sitio Culasisi, Brgy. San Luis, Antipolo City when she heard someone shout ""Pa!"" Recognizing the voice as that of Felix, a neighbor and a fellow security guard at a nearby establishment, she went out to see what was going on. She was surprised to see Felix being chased by three men, two of whom she identified as Yulo and Bueno.[13] Since the area was illuminated by street lamps, she saw Felix stumble outside his house, allowing the men to catch up with him. When they did, Bueno and the third man held Felix in place while Yulo stabbed him. Abayon rushed to Felix's house where she told his mother that she saw Yulo and Bueno stab Felix. Felix's family then asked her to help them report the incident at the police station in Cogeo, Antipolo City. Once Abayon gave her statement of the incident, the police officers went to the house of Bueno's employer where he was known to be staying. Yulo and Bueno were arrested shortly thereafter.[14] For his part, Nehemias was at home at around 11:30 in the evening on that fateful night when he heard Felix shouting from outside. When he went out, he saw his son covered in blood. He also noticed that there were three men running away.[15] Shocked, Nehemias asked Felix who stabbed him, and Felix answered, ""Tata Manukan and Nonoy.""[16] Nehemias knew them because Tata Manukan (later identified as Yulo)[17] worked at a nearby poultry farm, while Nonoy (later identified as Bueno)[18] was the son of his kumpare. With another neighbor's help, Nehemias brought Felix to the Bagong Nayon Community Hospital. On the way there, Felix expressed his fear that he was not going to survive, but Nehemias encouraged his son, who was also studying at the International College of Business and Accountancy while working as a security guard, to remain strong. Unfortunately, Felix passed away[19] while receiving treatment. The medico-legal officer, PCI Marquez,[20] listed Felix's cause of death as ""Stab wounds, trunk,""[21] which he explained could have been caused by coming in contact with a sharp and pointed object. Based on the wounds inflicted, PCI Marquez surmised that it was possible that more than one sharp-edged instrument was used in the attack. He also explained that out of the 11 stab wounds on his front and back, the ones on Felix's nape, neck and trunk were the fatal injuries. Meanwhile, Cardinal, a neighbor of Felix and of Yulo and Bueno, narrated that she and her husband were at home that evening when Yulo arrived at around 11:00 in the evening to ask for a glass of water. After that, Yulo confided to her that he stabbed Felix.[22] When Cardinal dismissed his claim, Yulo left. For their defense, Yulo[23] testified that at around the time that Felix was killed, he and Bueno were sleeping at the house of their employer. He was only awakened when someone kicked the door open and men with flashlights came in. With guns pointed at him and Bueno, the unidentified men ordered them to go with them to the police station. Overcome with fear, they went along peacefully. They were immediately detained when they arrived there. Yulo recalled that he advised Bueno, who was only 18 years old at the time, to call his mother. However, this request was not granted by the police officers. Meanwhile, Bueno[24] testified that he knew Felix because they were close friends and had been neighbors since he was seven years old. Bueno narrated that on the night Felix was killed, he was at the barracks with Yulo. He was about to go to sleep when suddenly the door was kicked with much force that its lock broke. Around five to eight unidentified men then barged in and one of them ordered him and Yulo to go with them peacefully. He noticed that Nehemias was accompanying the men and he was surprised when Nehemias pointed at him and Yulo, and said, ""Yan 'yung mga pumatay sa anak ko.""[25] Bueno recalled that they were brought to the police station for investigation before being transferred to the Antipolo City Jail. Bueno explained that he tried to ask permission to call his parents, but the police officers refused on the ground that they were only being investigated in connection with Felix's death. He then lamented that he had no conflict with Felix before the latter died.","WHEREFORE, the instant appeal is DISMISSED. The Decision dated March 4, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 09490 finding accused-appellants Mark Anthony Yulo y Gallo a.k.a.""Tata"" and Mark Ryan Bueno y Corona aka. ""Nonoy"" GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder is AFFIRMED with MODICATION.","Accused-appellants have been proved with certainty by the prosecution as the ones who inflicted the mortal wounds (second element). Eyewitness Abayon clearly and categorically told the trial court that she saw accused-appellants and one John Doe[39] chase Felix, and that when they caught up with him, Bueno held him immobile while Yulo proceeded to stab Felix.[40] As the area was well illuminated, Abayon clearly saw the incident and she was able to identify the accused-appellants as those who attacked Felix. . . The RTC and the CA also correctly gave credence to the testimony of Cardinal who testified that Yulo admitted to her that he killed Felix. This circumstance falls squarely as an admission against interest. . . Felix's statement may be admitted as part of res gestae. . . All these elements are present in the instant case. First, the stabbing of Felix constituted a startling occurrence. Second, there was not enough time for him to contrive or devise a false accusation when he identified accused- appellants since it was only moments after the attack when his father asked him who stabbed him. Finally, the statement concerns the stabbing incident which led to the death of the declarant, Felix. . . it is clear that Bueno is equally liable as principal for the death of Felix. . . Nonetheless, the manner of the commission of the crime clearly shows that the aggravating circumstance of abuse of superior strength attended the killing of Felix (third element). ""This circumstance is present whenever there is inequality of force between the victim and the aggressor, assuming a situation of superiority of strength notoriously advantageous for the aggressor, and the latter takes advantage of it in the commission of the crime.""[63] Here, accused-appellants teamed up to launch a simultaneous attack against the unarmed and defenseless Felix.[64] Based on his participation, it is clear that Bueno is equally liable as principal for the death of Felix. . . In the absence of any mitigating or aggravating circumstance,[65] Article 63 of the RPC provides that the lesser penalty of reclusion perpetua shall be imposed. [66] Verily, both the RTC and the CA correctly sentenced accused-appellants to reclusion perpetua.","Accused-appellants are SOLIDARILY ORDERED TO PAY the heirs of Felix Sabasan y Magango the amounts of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages, and P75,000.00 as exemplary damages.

SALVADO, RESPONDENT.","In his complaint, complainant alleged that he asked for legal assistance from respondent on November 23, 2013 relating to the annulment of the previous marriage of his mother, Feliza Asuncion (Feliza); that the total legal fee respondent charged was P700,000.00, wherein they agreed that he would pay 50%, or P350,000.00 up front to respondent; that in exchange, respondent will contact officials from the National Statistics Office (NSO) so they can prepare the requested documents and secure a favorable judgment in two months; and that he paid P70,000.00 as acceptance fee on November 23, 2013, P50,000.00 on December 4, 2013, P200,000.00 on January 7, 2014, and P100,000.00 on February 4, 2014, for a total amount of P420,000.00. Complainant further alleged that when he asked for an update regarding the case, respondent got angry and said ""[w]ag nyo ko madaliin, hindi lang ako ang gumagawa ng papeles na pinapagawa ninyo!""; that respondent promised that he will deliver the NSO documents requested, but the former failed; that respondent stopped going to his office and ignored his calls; that he had no idea as to the status of the documents he requested; and that he received a call from respondent asking for one week to return the amount he received, but he never heard from respondent again. The Memorandum of Agreement provided that the SECOND PARTY shall pay the FIRST PARTY the sum of SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND PESOS (P700,000.00) in exchange for certain legal documents showing, that the SECOND PARTY'S previous marriage with Julio Asuncion in 1983 had already been dissolved and/or that she had no existing/subsisting marriage at the time she contracted marriage with one Charles Ferrari on July 28, 1988. Respondent failed to file an answer before the IBP and failed to appear at the mandatory conferences.","The IBP Investigating Commissioner recommended finding respondent guilty of violating Canon 17 and Rules 18.03 and 18.04 of Canon 18 (infidelity and negligence) and suspending him for five years, which the IBP Board of Governors adopted. The Supreme Court found that respondent received ample opportunity to defend himself, noting his propensity to ignore notices from the IBP. The Court held that text messages (ephemeral electronic communications) submitted by the complainant were admissible and proved the contents of the agreement. The Court found that respondent impliedly admitted he promised to deliver an antedated decree/decision of annulment using his 'connections' and not his skills as a lawyer, violating Rule 15.06 (influence peddling), Canon 1, Rule 1.01, and Rule 1.02. His offense was compounded by his failure to return the P420,000.00 paid (Rule 16.01) and his failure to update the client (Canons 17 and 18, Rule 18.04). Considering respondent’s repeated violations of the Lawyer's Oath and the CPR in this case, as well as in prior cases (Aca and Ereñeta), which demonstrate he lacks good moral character, the penalty of disbarment was imposed.","WHEREFORE, the Court finds respondent Atty. Ronaldo P. Salvado GUILTY of violating the Lawyer's Oath, Canon 1, Rules 1.01 and 1.02, Canon 13, Rule 15.06, Canons 17 and 18, and Rule 18.04 of the Code of Professional Responsibility. Thus, the Court imposes upon him the penalty of DISBARMENT from the practice of law. His name is ORDERED STRICKEN from the Roll of Attorneys, effective immediately. Respondent Atty. Ronaldo P. Salvado is likewise ORDERED to return within 10 days from notice of this Decision the amount of P420,000.00 to Roger D. Asuncion with interest at the legal rate of 6% per annum from his date of receipt until full payment. Respondent Atty. Ronaldo P. Salvado is directed to submit to the Court proof of payment within 10 days thereof. Let copies of this Decision be furnished the Office of the Bar Confidant to be appended to respondent Atty.

"G.R. No. 258448, July 05, 2022","WILSON CARITERO AMAD, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, RESPONDENT.","On October 7, 2021, Amad filed his Certificate of Candidacy (COC) for Vice President for the May 9, 2022 National and Local Elections (NLE). The COMELEC filed a Petition dated October 11, 2021 entitled 'In Re: Motu Proprio Petition to Declare Wilson Caritero Amad as Nuisance Candidate,' docketed as SPA No. 21-057 (DC)(MP). The COMELEC (First Division) Resolution dated December 13, 2021 granted the Nuisance Petition, declaring Amad a NUISANCE CANDIDATE and CANCELLED his COC, based on lack of nationwide network of supporters or political machinery. Amad filed a Motion for Reconsideration on December 20, 2021, which the COMELEC (En Banc) denied in an Order dated January 3, 2022, claiming it was defective and filed out of time (allegedly at 5:01 p.m.). Amad timely filed a Petition for Certiorari before the Supreme Court. The Court issued a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) on January 20, 2022, enjoining the COMELEC from enforcing its rulings. However, Amad filed an Extremely Urgent Motion because COMELEC released the ballot face without his name (Jan 25, 2022). The COMELEC argued the case was moot and academic, stating that pre-election activities, including the printing of serialized ballots, had commenced starting January 23, 2022, after the TRO was issued.","The Court ruled that while the Petition was rendered moot by the conclusion of the NLE, it must be decided because the issue was capable of repetition yet evading review. The Court found that the COMELEC committed grave abuse of discretion in denying Amad's motion for reconsideration, as the records clearly showed it was timely filed and verified, and proof of payment was submitted. The Court also found that the COMELEC committed grave abuse of discretion in declaring Amad a nuisance candidate because the criteria used (lack of nationwide support/political machinery) are not legal qualifications for office nor grounds specified under Section 69 of the Omnibus Election Code. Finally, the Court found the members of the COMELEC GUILTY of CONTEMPT for violating the TRO dated January 20, 2022, by commencing the printing of ballots without Amad's name on January 23, 2022.","WHEREFORE, the Petition for Certiorari filed by Wilson Caritero Amad is DENIED insofar as it has become MOOT and ACADEMIC. Nevertheless, the members of the Commission on Elections are found GUILTY of CONTEMPT of the Supreme Court for their disobedience to the Court's lawful directive, specifically the Temporary Restraining Order dated January 20, 2022. Accordingly, they are REPRIMANDED for this disobedience. SO ORDERED.",The Petition for Certiorari is DENIED insofar as it has become MOOT and ACADEMIC. The members of the Commission on Elections are found GUILTY of CONTEMPT and are REPRIMANDED for their disobedience to the Temporary Restraining Order.

SECRETARY OF FINANCE, COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, AND CHAIRPERSON OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, RESPONDENTS.","On December 17, 2013, the Department of Finance (DOF), upon recommendation of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR), issued RR 1-2014, which amended the provisions of RR 2-1998, as further amended by RR 10-2008, otherwise known as the Consolidated Withholding Tax Regulations. The pertinent provisions of RR 2-1998 and RR 10-2008 read: RR 2-1998 Section 2.83.3. Requirement for income payees list. - In lieu of the manually prepared alphabetical list of employees and list of payee's and income payments subject to creditable and final withholding taxes which are required to be attached as integral part of the Annual Return (Form No. 1604), the Withholding Agent may, at its option, submit computer-processed tapes or cassettes or diskettes, provided that the said list has been encoded in accordance with the formats prescribed by Form 1604. RR 10-2008 Section 2.83.3. Requirement for list of payees. - In addition to the manually prepared alphabetical list of employees and list of payees and income payments subject to creditable and final withholding taxes which are required to be attached as integral part of the Annual Information Returns (BIR Form No. 1604CF/1604E), Monthly Remittance Returns (BIR Form No. 1601C etc.), the withholding agent may submit soft copy in 3.5-inch floppy diskettes/CD or email: esubmission@bir.gov.ph, containing the said alphalists. However, taxpayers, whose number of employees or income payees are ten (10) or more, are mandatorily required to submit the said lists in 3.5-inch floppy diskettes/CD or email: esubmission@bir.gov.ph, using the existing CSV data file format, together with the manually prepared alphabetical list. In order to comply with this format, the withholding agents shall have the option to use any of the following: 1. Excel format provided under the Revenue Regulations No. 7-2000, as amended, following the technical specifications required by the BIR; 2. Their own extract program that shall meet the technical specifications required by the BIR; or 3. Data Entry Module using Visual FoxPro that will be available upon request or by downloading from the BIR's website http://www.bir.gov.ph with the corresponding job aid. For those who would choose either option 1 or 2, such taxpayers shall use a validation module developed by the BIR, which can be downloaded from the BIR website. In any case, the withholding agents are required to save the same to a secondary storage as back up for a period of three (3) years from submission of the diskette, as aforementioned, for future reference. For withholding agents classified as large taxpayers and excise taxpayers falling within the jurisdiction of the Large Taxpayers Service and/or Large Taxpayers District Office, the Annual Information Return of Income Taxes Withheld on Compensation and Final Withholding Taxes (BIR Form No. 1604-CF) and the Annual Information Return of Creditable Income Taxes Withheld (Expanded)/ Income Payments Exempt from Withholding Tax (BIR Form No. 1604-E) shall be submitted to the Large Taxpayers Assistance Division, Large Taxpayers District Offices or Excise Taxpayers Assistance Division, as the case may be. For other withholding agents, the aforesaid annual returns shall be submitted to their respective Revenue District Offices. BIR Form No. 1604-CF shall be submitted on or before January 31 of the succeeding year while BIR Form No. 1604-E shall be filed on or before March 1 of the following year. Only diskettes/CD/email: esubmission@bir.gov.ph readable and virus free files upon submission shall be considered as duly filed ""Alphabetical List of Employees/Payees"" by the employer. Violation hereof, shall be a ground for the mandatory audit of violator's income tax liabilities (including withholding tax). Diskettes/CDs must be uploaded by the abovementioned offices within fifteen (15) days from receipt. The manually prepared (hard copy for below 10 employees/payees) alphabetical list of employee shall be filed in triplicate copies (two copies for the BIR) to be stamped ""received"" by the BIR-Large Taxpayers Assistance Division, Large Taxpayers District Office of the Excise Taxpayers Assistance Division, or the Revenue District Office where the payor/employer is registered as Withholding Agent. Manually filed alphalists must be encoded and uploaded by the abovementioned offices within thirty (30) days from receipt. (Underline & emphasis in original) Under RR 2-1998, all withholding agents are required to submit a manual alphabetical list (alphalist). RR 2-1998 was amended by RR 10-2008, which provides the general rule that all withholding agents are required to submit manual and digital alphalists. The exception is if the withholding agent has less than 10 employees, in which case, a manual alphalist is then required. Under RR 1-2014, withholding agents are now required to submit a digital copy of the alphalist of their employees and payees. Although the Annual Information Return of Income Taxes Withheld on Compensation and Final Withholding Taxes Withheld on Compensation and Final Withholding Taxes (Form 1604-CF), and the Annual Information Return of Creditable Income Taxes Withheld (Expanded)/Income Payments Exempt from Withholding Tax (Form 1604-E), are still required to be filed manually, their attachments or alphalists should now be in digital format. The pertinent provision of RR 1-2014 reads: Section 2.83.3 Requirement for list of payees. – All withholding agents shall, regardless of the number of employees and payees, whether the employees/payees are exempt or not, submit an alphabetical list of employees and list of payees on income payments subject to creditable and final withholding taxes which are required to be attached as integral part of the Annual Information Returns (BIR Form No. 1604CF/1604E) and Monthly Remittance Returns (BIR Form No. 1601C, etc.), under the following modes: (1) As attachment in the Electronic Filing and Payment System (eFPS); (2) Through Electronic Submission using the BIR's website address at esubmission@bir.gov.ph; and (3) Through Electronic Mail (email) at dedicated BIR addresses using the prescribed CSV data file format, the details of which shall be issued in a separate revenue issuance. In cases where any withholding agent does not have its own internet facility or unavailability of commercial establishments with internet connection within the location of the withholding agent, the alphalist prescribed herein may be electronically mailed (e-mail) thru the e-lounge facility of the nearest revenue district office or revenue region of the BIR. The submission of the herein prescribed alphalist where the income payments and taxes withheld are lumped into one single amount (e.g., ""Various employees"", ""Various payees"", ""PCD nominees"", ""Others"", etc.) shall not be allowed. The submission thereof, including any alphalist that does not conform with the prescribed format thereby resulting to the unsuccessful upload into the BIR system shall be deemed as not received and shall not qualify as deductible expense for income tax purposes. Accordingly, the manual submission of the alphabetical lists containing less than ten (10) employees/payees by withholding agents under Annual Information Returns BIR Form No. 1604CF and BIR No. 1604E shall be immediately discontinued begi1ming January 31, 2014 and March 1, 2014, respectively, and every year thereafter. (Underline & emphasis in original) To reiterate, the rule under RR 1-2014 is that all withholding agents are required to submit only a digital alphalist. By the express provision of RR 1- 2014, the submission of alphalist where the income payments and taxes withheld are lumped into one single amount (e.g., ""various employees,"" ""various payees,"" ""PCD nominees,"" ""others,"" etc.) is not allowed. On January 29, 2014, the CIR issued RMC 5-2014 clarifying, in a Question and Answer format, the provisions of RR 1-2014 on the submission of the alphalist of employees/payees of income payments. It requires submission of the tax identification number (TIN) and the complete name of the payees, together with the corresponding amount of income and withholding tax. Then the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) followed suit and issued SEC MC 10-2014. It directs the Philippine Depository and Trust Corporation (PDTC) and broker dealers to provide the listed companies or their transfer agents an alphalist of all depository account holders and the total shareholdings in each of the accounts and sub-accounts. The pertinent provisions of the issuance state: Section 2. List of PDTC Accounts and [C]orresponding Shareholdings. — The Philippine Depository and Trust Corporation (PDTC) shall prepare an alphalist of all depository account holders and the total shareholdings in each of the accounts and sub-accounts as of Record Date upon receiving information on a dividend declaration. PDTC shall provide the Issuer or its authorized Transfer Agent with the alphalist and all the depository account holders with their respective shareholdings as reflected in their depository accounts and sub-accounts, if any, not later than 12:00 noon of the day following such Record Date. Section 3. List of Payees and [C]orresponding Shareholdings. — All depository account holders which are registered broker dealers and which hold shares, for the account of their clients or for their own account, and which are payees of dividend declared by the Issuer/Paying Company shall prepare an alphalist showing the total shareholding of each account and sub-account belonging to these payees and the dealer account as of Record Date. In determining the alphalist, the broker dealers shall take into account the Philippine Stock Exchange's (PSE) conventions on transactions effected during cum and ex-dates. The broker dealers shall also ensure that the account balances are consistent with the respective balances as reflected in the PDTC alphalist of depository account holders and corresponding total shareholdings. The broker dealer alphalist shall provide the following information. (Please refer to the attached format — Annex A): 1. Name of Client/Payee (Last Name, First Name, Middle Name for Individuals, complete name for non-individuals) 2. Tax Identification Number (TIN) 3. Address of Payee 4. Status (Residence/Nationality) 5. Total Shareholding 6. Birth date (for Individuals)/Registration Number (for non-individuals) The broker dealers shall submit the alphalist certified true and correct by their President and the Head of Settlement Unit in soft and hard copies to the Issuer or its authorized Transfer Agent not later than three (3) days from the Record Date. (Emphasis in original) Failure to comply with these issuances will result to imposition of administrative and penal sanctions. Claiming to be adversely affected, petitioners filed the instant Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition directly with this Court to question the issuances, raising the following grounds: A. RESPONDENTS ACTED WITH GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR EXCESS OF JURISDICTION WHEN THEY ISSUED THE QUESTIONED REGULATIONS WHICH VIOLATE THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS OF PETITIONERS AND THEIR CUSTOMERS. 1. The requirement under the Questioned Regulations for listed companies and broker dealers to disclose the payee of dividend payments is vague, and therefore void, due to the prohibition on the identification of PCD Nominee as the payee. 2. The requirement under RR 01-14 and RMC 05-14 for listed companies to disclose the payee of dividend payments and the prohibition on the identification of the PCD Nominee as the payee is unreasonable since listed companies, by themselves are not capable of accurately providing the required information. 3. Respondents Secretary of Finance and Commissioner of Internal Revenue failed to comply with the requirements of notice and hearing prior to the issuance of RR 01-14 and RMC 05-14. B. RESPONDENTS ACTED WITH GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR EXCESS OF JURISDICTION WHEN THEY ISSUED THE QUESTIONED REGULATIONS IN VIOLATION OF THE PETITIONERS' RIGHT TO PRIVACY. 1. The Questioned Regulations require the disclosure of sensitive personal information regarding an investor to a private third party, not to a government or public authority. 2. The Questioned Regulations do not provide a mechanism to protect sensitive personal information relating to each disclosed investor. 3. The Questioned Regulations violate the express provisions of banking laws and regulations. C. THE SEC CHAIRPERSON ACTED WITH GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR EXCESS OF JURISDICTION WHEN SHE ISSUED SEC MC 10-14, WHICH VIOLATES THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE ON NON-IMPAIRMENT OF CONTRACTS. D. RESPONDENTS ACTED WITH GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR EXCESS OF JURISDICTION WHEN THEY ISSUED THE QUESTIONED REGULATIONS WHICH ARE CONTRARY TO THE STATE POLICIES UNDER THE SRC, THE TAX CODE, AND THE DATA PRIVACY ACT. E. THE SEC CHAIRPERSON ACTED WITHOUT JURISDICTION WHEN SHE ISSUED SEC MC 10-14 TO SUPPLEMENT THE PROVISIONS OF RR 01-14. F. RESPONDENTS ACTED WITHOUT JURISDICTION WHEN THEY ISSUED THE QUESTIONED REGULATIONS TO AMEND SECTION 43.1 OF THE SRC AND PROHIBIT THE USE OF ""PCD NOMINEE"" AS THE PAYEE OF THE DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND SHAREHOLDER OF SCRIPLESS SHARES IN LISTED COMPANIES IN VIOLATION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES OF SEPARATION OF POWERS. On September 9, 2014, this Court issued a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) prohibiting respondents from enforcing the questioned regulations.","The Petition has merit. The Court finds that the questioned regulations are void for being unconstitutional. WHEREFORE, the Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition is GRANTED. Revenue Regulations No. 1-2014, Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 5-2014, and Securities and Exchange Commission Memorandum Circular No. 10-14 are STRUCK DOWN for being UNCONSTITUTIONAL. The Temporary Restraining Order issued by this Court on September 9, 2014 is MADE PERMANENT.","The Court finds that the questioned regulations are void for being unconstitutional. Petitioners have legal standing under the third-party standing exception. The questioned regulations are not mere interpretative issuances; they are legislative in nature that change, if not increase, the burden of those governed. For failure to conduct notice and hearing prior to issuance and publication, the questioned regulations are therefore void. The questioned regulations violate the right to privacy because, applying the strict scrutiny test, respondents failed to show that the regulations were narrowly drawn to prevent abuses, as the collection of information was not necessary for the BIR to carry out its functions (Sec. 4[e] of Data Privacy Act was not met). The questioned regulations also failed to include guarantees to protect the sensitive information (TINs) to be collected, violating Section 13(b) of the Data Privacy Act. The SEC Chairperson had no authority to issue SEC MC 10-2014 because compliance with tax laws and regulations is outside the scope of authority granted to the SEC under the SRC. The DOF and the CIR also acted outside their scope of authority in issuing RR 1-2014 and RMC 5-2014 by prohibiting the use of PCD Nominees as payees, delving into matters under securities regulation (SEC's domain), thereby contravening Section 43.1 of the SRC and acting ultra vires. However, the Court finds that the requirement for disclosure of payees is clear and unequivocal (not vague) and that the issuances do not violate the Bank Secrecy Law or FCDA, nor do they impair contracts.","Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition is GRANTED. Revenue Regulations No. 1-2014, Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 5-2014, and Securities and Exchange Commission Memorandum Circular No. 10-14 are STRUCK DOWN for being UNCONSTITUTIONAL. The Temporary Restraining Order issued on September 9, 2014 is MADE PERMANENT."

Cañaveras and Ofelia B. Cañaveras (collectively, petitioners) are the accused in a criminal case for Falsification of Public Documents by a Private Individual under Article 172 in relation to Article 171 of the Revised Penal Code docketed as Criminal Case No. 17-0597 before the MTCC, City of San Fernando, Pampanga, presided by Judge Jocelyn P. Gamboa-Delos Santos. On May 23, 2018, the prosecution was scheduled to present its witness, Nenita G. Mariano (Nenita). Atty. Vicente Dante P. Adan (Atty. Adan), counsel for petitioners, failed to attend the scheduled hearing. In the Order dated May 23, 2018, Judge Gamboa-Delos Santos ruled that 'the absence of counsel for the defense despite notice is construed as waiver on the part of the defense to cross examine witness [Nenita].' On June 6, 2018, Atty. Adan orally moved for reconsideration, explaining that he consulted a doctor on the date of the hearing because of the pain he experienced in his eyes, presenting an unnotarized Medical Certificate dated May 23, 2018. Public Prosecutor Rowena Figueroa and Atty. Raul Macalino objected, arguing the medical certificate was unnotarized and postponement under the Revised Guidelines for Continuous Trial of Criminal Cases is only allowed for force majeure or physical inability of the witness. Judge Gamboa-Delos Santos denied Atty. Adan's motion for reconsideration in the Order dated June 6, 2018. Trial proceeded, and Atty. Adan objected to the presentation of Rodel G. Mariano (Rodel) whose Complaint-Affidavit was being used, arguing non-compliance with the Judicial Affidavit Rule. Judge Gamboa-Delos Santos ruled that under the Revised Guidelines for Continuous Trial of Criminal Cases, prosecutors are allowed to utilize the affidavit used before the Office of the City Prosecutor. Petitioners filed the present petition for certiorari assailing the June 6, 2018 Order and seeking to declare unconstitutional the second sentence of Section 10(b) of A.M. No. 12-8-8-SC, or the Judicial Affidavit Rule.","The Court found that direct resort to the Court was permissible by relaxing the rule on hierarchy of courts given that petitioners' liberty was at stake. The Court declined to resolve the issue of the constitutionality of the second sentence of Section 10(b) of the Judicial Affidavit Rule because it was not the lis mota of the case, as Judge Gamboa-Delos Santos did not rely on it. The Court found no error (no grave abuse of discretion) in Judge Gamboa-Delos Santos' reliance on the motion for postponement provision under the Revised Guidelines for Continuous Trial of Criminal Cases, which strictly limits the allowable reasons for postponement, thus strictly enforcing the appropriate rules. The Court also found no grave abuse of discretion in allowing the taking of Rodel’s testimony using his affidavit from the investigating prosecutor, as this is one of the three options allowed under the Revised Guidelines on Continuous Trial of Criminal Cases. Nonetheless, the Court ruled that the circumstances impel it to afford petitioners the opportunity to cross-examine Nenita, holding that procedural rules must yield to the demands of substantial justice when strict application would hinder it, especially concerning the paramount constitutional right of the accused to cross-examine witnesses.","WHEREFORE, the petition is PARTLY GRANTED. The Orders dated May 23, 2018 and June 6, 2018 issued in Criminal Case No. 17-0597 by Presiding Judge Jocelyn P. Gamboa-Delos Santos of Branch 4, Municipal Trial Court in Cities (MTCC), City of San Fernando, Pampanga are SET ASIDE insofar as they deemed petitioners Loreto A. Cañaveras and Ofelia B. Cañaveras to have waived their right to cross-examine prosecution witness Nenita G. Mariano. The trial court is DIRECTED to proceed with the cross-examination of Nenita G. Mariano and to continue the criminal proceedings with dispatch.",PARTLY GRANTED
"G.R. No. 215159, July 05, 2022","CHEVRON HOLDINGS, INC. (FORMERLY CALTEX ASIA LIMITED), PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, RESPONDENT.","Chevron Holdings is a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, United States of America. It is licensed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to transact business in the Philippines as a Regional Operating Headquarter (ROHQ). For the taxable year 2006, Chevron Holdings rendered services to its affiliates in the Philippines (12% VAT) and abroad (zero-rated). It incurred input taxes, which were allocated proportionately, but the input taxes attributable to zero-rated sales were not credited against output taxes because of substantial input taxes carried forward from the previous quarters (P55,784,357.71). Chevron Holdings filed administrative and judicial claims for refund or credit of excess input VAT for 2006. The CTA Division initially denied the claims for being prematurely filed, but the CTA En Banc later reversed this finding on the ground of relief granted by BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 (San Roque doctrine). The CTA En Banc, however, partly granted the petition, but disallowed substantial amounts of zero-rated sales (P10,025,869.35 for lack of inward remittance proof) and input VAT (P24,598,395.58 for failure to comply with invoicing requirements, and P56,564,096.77 carry-over for lack of substantiation). The CTA En Banc charged the validated input taxes against output taxes and concluded that there was no excess input VAT for the second, third, and fourth quarters, resulting in an awarded refund of P47,409.24 in its Amended Decision.","The Court upholds the CTA findings on Chevron Holdings' partial non-qualification of sales for zero-rating (for failure to prove foreign entity status of some clients and lack of inward remittance proof for P10,025,869.35) and the disallowance of P24,598,395.58 input tax for non-compliance with the invoicing requirements (VAT not separately indicated). However, the Court rules that the CTA erred in its method of calculating the refundable input tax. The Court holds that it will not deny the request for a refund of unutilized input Value-Added Tax (VAT) from zero-rated sales on the basis that the taxpayer does not have 'excess' input VAT from the output VAT when the law does not require its compliance with the taxpayer to be entitled to a refund. The remedies of charging the input tax against the output tax and applying for a refund or tax credit of unutilized input VAT from zero-rated sales are alternative and cumulative, and the law (Section 112[A]) only requires proving that the input tax subject of the claim has not been applied against output tax. Furthermore, the Court finds that the CTA erred in requiring Chevron Holdings to substantiate its excess input tax carried over from previous quarters in the amount of P55,784,357.71 as this is not a requirement for entitlement to a refund of unused or unutilized input VAT from zero-rated sales.","The Court finds that Chevron Holdings sufficiently proved compliance with all the requisites for entitlement to a refund or credit of unutilized input tax allocable to zero-rated sales under Section 112 (A) of the Tax Code. Applying the proportionate allocation method to the valid input tax (P9,081,815.00) attributable to the valid zero-rated sales (P155,654,748.22) based on sales volume, the Court computes the total refundable unutilized input tax allocable to zero-rated sales for the period January 1 to December 31, 2006, to be P1,140,381.22. The CTA En Banc's Decision and Amended Decision are Affirmed with Modifications.","The Commissioner of Internal Revenue is ordered to refund, or in the alternative, issue a tax credit certificate in favor of Chevron Holdings, Inc. in the total amount of One Million One Hundred Forty Thousand Three Hundred Eighty-One Pesos and 22/100 (P1,140,381.22), representing unutilized input tax attributable to zero-rated sales for the period of January 1 to December 31, 2006."

DRILON, AND SENATE COMMITTEE ON ACCOUNTABILITY OF PUBLIC OFFICERS AND INVESTIGATIONS CHAIRPERSON RICHARD J. GORDON, AND IN THEIR OFFICIAL AND INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES AS MEMBERS OF THE SENATE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PETITIONERS, VS. THE EXECUTIVE SECRETARY SALVADOR C. MEDIALDEA AND SECRETARY OF HEALTH FRANCISCO T. DUQUE III, RESPONDENTS.","The facts are undisputed. The Covid-19 pandemic caused the stoppage of commerce and trade. People suddenly found themselves in the comfort of their homes on a daily basis. Their daily hustle suddenly stopped. Most citizens lost their sources of income. Inevitably, the State had to promptly step in. The Congress itself passed unprecedented appropriations to address the adverse effects of the pandemic. The Department of Health (DOH) alone received seventy-seven billion pesos (P77,000,000,000.00) to address the health crisis. Of the said fund, thirty-seven billion pesos (P37,000,000,000.00) was allotted for the procurement of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).[3] In its 2020 Annual Audit Report, the Commission on Audit (COA) noted a deficiency of P67,323,186,570.57 in public funds intended for the government's Covid-19 response. This spurred an investigation by the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee on the budget utilization of the DOH.[4] Meantime, several senators authored resolutions directing various committees of the Senate to conduct inquiries relative to the disbursement of funds to address the Covid-19 pandemic, viz.: 1. Senate Resolution No. 858 entitled Resolution Directing the Senate Committee of the Whole on the Vaccination Program to Conduct an Inquiry on the Procurement of COVID-19 Vaccines by Local Government Units and the Private Sector Through the Multi-Party Agreements, with the End in View of Ramping Up Vaccination in the Rural Areas and in the Private Sector, and Achieving Herd Immunity Against COVID-19 for the Country authored by Senator Juan Miguel F. Zubiri.[5] 2. Senate Resolution No. 859 entitled Resolution Directing the Appropriate Senate Committee to Conduct an Inquiry, in Aid of Legislation, on the Findings of Commission on Audit (COA) Report on the Department of Health (DOH) on the Reported Unspent Funds, Misstatements, Irregularities[,] and Deficiencies, with the End View of Addressing Recurrent Issues that has Plagued its Services, as well as the Persistent Faults and Lapses that Gave Rise to Wastage Even Amidst Times of Scarcity and Shortage, and Identifying and Holding Accountable Those Responsible for the Same authored by Senator Leila M. De Lima.[6] 3. Senate Resolution No. 880 entitled Resolution Directing the Appropriate Senate Committee to Conduct an Investigation in Aid of Legislation on the Payment Claims issues between PhilHealth and Private Hospitals with the End in View of Ensuring Uninterrupted Health Care and Social Protection for Filipinos authored by Senator Risa Hontiveros.[7] The Senate Blue Ribbon Committee claims it had been undertaking an inquiry in aid of legislation on the following matters: DOH's underutilization of its 2020 budget; Inquiries on the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines by local government units and the private sector. Unspent funds, misstatements, irregularities, and deficiencies of the DOH, as noted in the COA findings; and Payment claims issues between Philippine Health Insurance Corporation and private hospitals.[8] Questions propounded during the inquiry included but were not limited to: Did key purchases undergo any public bidding? How did the government spend the appropriations made by Congress for healthcare workers? How expensive were government purchases of personal protective equipment (PPE) in relation to alternatives? Did executive officials perform due diligence on prospective suppliers? How did procurement contracts end up with foreign companies instead of Filipino suppliers[?][9] The inquiry had been taking place for several hearings already when President Duterte initially complained of the alleged browbeating of Executive Department officials appearing as resource persons at these hearings. The President's reaction came to a head when, through Executive Secretary Medialdea, he authorized the issuance of the subject Memorandum dated October 4, 2021 prohibiting all officials and employees of the Executive Department from appearing and attending the inquiry, viz.: The Senate Blue Ribbon Committee hearings on the 2020 Audit Report of the Commission on Audit have been going on for nearly two months now. The Executive has been showing due respect to such Committee, through the faithful attendance and participation of its officials and employees in the aforesaid hearings. However, the point has been reached where the participation of the Executive is already greatly affecting its ability to fulfill its core mandates in the Constitution and laws, most of all[,] the protection of our people's right to health in this time of pandemic. Moreover, given the manner that the inquiry has been conducted, and clear indications that the hearings are meant to go on indefinitely, it has become evident that the said hearings are conducted not in aid of legislation, but to identify persons to hold accountable for alleged irregularities already punishable under existing laws. In so doing, the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee has stepped into the mandates of other branches of government, and has deprived itself of the only basis to compel attendance to its hearings. Thus, on the premise that the principle of separation of powers requires mutual respect among the different branches of government, and in view of Article II, Section 15 of the 1987 Constitution on the protection and promotion by the State of the right to health of the people, the President has DIRECTED all officials and employees of the Executive Department to no longer appear before or attend the abovementioned Senate Blue Ribbon Committee hearings, effective immediately. Instead, they shall focus all their time and effort on the implementation of measures to address the current State of Calamity on account of COVID-19, and in carrying out their other functions. All officials and employees of the Executive Department are reminded to perform their functions in accordance with the Constitution and laws, and observe utmost responsibility, integrity and efficiency. This Administration shall continue and shall not hesitate to investigate and file charges against corrupt officials and employees in the proper forum. For strict compliance. By order of the President: Sgd. SALVADOR C. MEDIALDEA[10] As worded, the Memorandum bore an instruction '[f]or strict compliance.' It did not bear though the initial ground of the President for objecting to the appearance and attendance of Executive Department officials at the hearings. Instead, the Memorandum complained of their inability to fulfil their duties in relation to the people's right to health during the pandemic and contested the purpose of the inquiry as being in aid of legislation. The Memorandum further asserted that the inquiry has turned into a preliminary investigation of sorts meant to identify the person or persons allegedly liable for irregularities that existing statutes already define and punish – However, the point has been reached where the participation of the Executive is already greatly affecting its ability to fulfil its core mandates in the Constitution and laws, most of all the violation of our people's right to health in this time of pandemic. Moreover, given the manner that the inquiry has been conducted, and clear indications that the hearings are meant to go on indefinitely, it has become evident that the said hearings are conducted not in aid of legislation, but to identify persons to hold accountable for alleged irregularities already punishable under existing laws. In so doing, the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee has stepped into the mandates of other branches of government, and has deprived itself of the only basis to compel attendance to its hearings.[11] x x x x The Senate noted that after the issuance of the Memorandum, Executive Department officials invited to attend the inquiry had begged off citing the prohibition. This Senate invitation uniformly stated: In accordance with Rule X, Section 13 (2) of the Senate Rules, please be informed that the Committee on Accountability of Public Officers and Investigations (Blue Ribbon), motu proprio ... In this connection, may we request your presence during the [________ NTH] public hearing thereon (via videoconferencing) on [_____ day], [ _____________ ] at [ ______________ ]. The Committee will be using the CISCO Webex as virtual platform. Please send to blueribbon.hearings@gmail.com the email addresses that Your Honor and your staff will be using for the link. For your Honors' information and guidance. Thank you.[12] x x x x Executive officials, including DOH Secretary Francisco T. Duque, III (DOH Secretary Duque), who initially graced the hearings, had ceased to attend the subsequent hearings on the inquiry. In his Letter[13] dated October 5, 2021 addressed to Senator Gordon, Secretary Duque stated: 5 October 2021 HON. RICHARD J. GORDON Chairperson Committee on Accountability of Public Officers and Investigation Senate of the Philippines GSIS Building, Financial Center, Roxas Boulevard, Pasay City Dear Senator Gordon: The Department of Health extends our gratitude to the Committee on Accountability of Public Officers and Investigations for your vigilance and resolve to surface the truth, particularly in matters that relate to the use of government funds during the course of our pandemic response. In as much as we would like to maintain our faithful attendance and participation as we have in the past ten hearings, the DOH family extends our sincere regrets for being unable to send representative officials and employees to attend today's hearing. We have been directed to give way to equally important COVID-19 response activities, as communicated through the Memorandum from the Executive Secretary dated October 4, 2021 on the Attendance in the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee Hearings on the 2020 Commission on Audit Report. The said memorandum is attached for your reference. We give you our firm assurances that we remain cooperative with the Committee and commit to submit any and all documents that may aid the good Committee over the course of their investigations. Once again, we thank you and we are one with you in your pursuit of truth and integrity in public service. Thank you very much. Very truly yours, Sgd. FRANCISCO T. DUQUE III, MD, MSc Secretary of Health[14] DOH Secretary Duque referenced the Memorandum as the reason he had to excuse himself. Viewing the subject Memorandum as an obstruction to their constitutional function to conduct inquiries in aid of legislation, the Senate, through Resolution no. 131[15] dated November 9, 2021, resolved to challenge it before the Court, viz.: RESOLUTION AUTHORIZING AND DIRECTING THE FILING OF THE APPROPRIATE PETITION IN THE SUPREME COURT TO ASSERT THE POWER OF THE SENATE IN INQUIRES IN AID OF LEGISLATION AS PROVIDED UNDER ARTICLE VI, SECTION 21 OF THE CONSTITUTION Whereas, Article VI, Section 21 of the Constitution provides, in part, '[T]he Senate or the House of Representatives or any of its respective committees may conduct inquiries in aid of legislation in accordance with its duly published rules of procedure'; Whereas, on October 4, 2021, the Executive Secretary issued a memorandum directing all officials and employees of the Executive Department to 'stop attending the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee hearings on the 2020 Commission on Audit Report effective immediately'; Whereas, it is the inherent right and solemn duty of the Senate to preserve, uphold and protect its and its committees' constitutional mandate to conduct inquires in aid of legislation, including the power to issue compulsory processes, and to accordingly seek judicial relief and affirmation of its rights and prerogatives under the Constitution if and when challenged or interfered with by any branch, department agency, or instrumentality of the government or by any individual: Now, therefore be it. Resolved by the Senate of the Philippines, To authorize and direct, as it hereby authorizes and directs the filing of the appropriate petition in the Supreme Court to assert the power of the Senate in inquires in aid of legislation.[16] x x x x Invoking Senate of the Philippines Executive v. Executive Secretary Ermita (Senate v. Ermita)[17] and related case law, the petition seeks to declare the Memorandum as unconstitutional and further to – (i) require the invited Executive Department officials to attend the hearings of the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee and its other committees; (ii) restrain the enforcement of the Memorandum and all other issuances that would prevent invited Executive Department officials from attending hearings of the various committees of the Senate; (iii) restrain the Executive Department from issuing directives preventing invited Executive Department officials from attending hearings of the various committees of the Senate; (iv) restrain the Executive Department from issuing directives to law enforcement agencies to obstruct Senate proceedings or withhold assistance in the enforcement of the Senate's compulsory processes; and (v) restrain Executive Department officials, especially the Secretary of Health, from complying with the Memorandum. The petition does not mention that the Senate or any of its Committee had ruled on the jurisdictional challenge raised in the Memorandum. We therefore infer that this jurisdictional challenge has prudently remained unresolved. Finally, petitioner repleads the aforesaid allegations in support of their application for a writ of preliminary injunction.","In sum, the resolution of the petition does not hinge ultimately on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the Memorandum. The Constitutional challenge may be resolved on some other ground – here, by referencing the aforementioned power of the Senate under its own Rules of Procedure Governing Inquiries in Aid of Legislation. The petition is easily differentiated from Senate v. Ermita. The present case presents a direct jurisdictional challenge to the subject inquiry and its characterization. The President asserts – the inquiry falls within the jurisdiction of the Joint Congressional Oversight Committee created under the Bayanihan Acts, hence, beyond the power of legislative inquiry of the Senate and its Committees. The Senate has yet to resolve this claim and the arising challenge in the manner set forth in the Rules of Procedure Governing Inquiries in Aid of Legislation. On the other hand, Ermita involved a challenge on the ground of executive privilege and a blanket prohibition that did not reject any subject inquiry as one in aid of legislation. All told, the Court is constrained to dismiss the petition for having been prematurely filed. The Court deems it no longer necessary to resolve the other issues raised by the parties.","The Blue Ribbon Committee of the Senate is required by its own Rules of Procedure Governing Inquiries in Aid of Legislation to first resolve the jurisdictional challenge before proceeding with its legislative inquiry. It is basic that Rule 65 may be availed of only when there is no appeal or any other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. Thus, where this remedy actually exists but the same is peremptorily omitted, a Rule 65 petition will not prosper. ... Notably, the forum to address such jurisdictional claim is the Senate and its committees themselves. This recognition is meant to accord the highest respect for the Senate's own Rules of Procedure Governing Inquiries in Aid of Legislation, viz.: SECTION 3. Jurisdictional Challenge. If the jurisdiction of the Committee is challenged on any ground, the said issue must first be resolved by the Committee before proceeding with the inquiry. ... Undeniably, therefore, the Blue Ribbon Committee of the Senate has a remedy within its office to resolve the jurisdictional challenge raised by the President. To be sure, the Court cannot exercise the power on behalf of the Blue Ribbon Committee of the Senate lest the sacred principle of separation of powers where mutual respect by and between the three departments of the government be unduly violated.[33] We consequently defer to the remedy found within the Senate's own lofty jurisdiction. The availability of this remedy under Section 3 of the Senate Rules of Procedure Governing Inquiries in Aid of Legislation effectively proscribes a premature resort to the present special civil action for certiorari. In the same breadth, we cannot rule that there exists an actual case or controversy that is ripe for judicial adjudication. There is no immediate or threatened injury to the power of the Senate because it has yet to exercise the same. Hence, we still cannot tell whether this power, despite its proper exercise, has been disobeyed by the President as a result of his Memorandum. Unless and until the Senate has resolved with finality the jurisdictional challenge of the President, there can be no actual case or controversy to speak of yet.","ACCORDINGLY, the petition is DISMISSED, and the application for preliminary injunction, DENIED. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 206042, July 04, 2022","AMALGAMATED MOTORS PHILIPPINES, INC., PETITIONER, VS. SECRETARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNICATIONS [HON. MANUEL A. ROXAS, II AND HON. JOSEPH EMILIO AGUINALDO ABAYA], VIRGINIA P. TORRES, AND ILDEFONSO T. PATDU, JR., RESPONDENTS.","On May 24, 2010, the Land Transportation Office ( LTO ) published an Invitation to Bid for the Supply and Delivery of Philippine Driver's License Cards through its Bids and Awards Committee ( BAC ). [6] Realtime Data Management Services, Inc. ( RDMSI ) and petitioner Amalgamated Motors Philippines, Inc. ( AMPI ) purchased bidding documents and the Terms of Reference ( TOR ) for the project for P84,000.00. [7] Certain issues hounded the project. Thus, to answer the participants' queries and clarify their issues, the LTO-BAC deferred the opening of bid documents. [8] Department of Transportation and Communications ( DOTC ) Secretary Jose P. de Jesus ( Secretary De Jesus ) required a comprehensive review of the TOR, which led to its modification. Two (2) DOTC officials were also added as members of the LTO-BAC. [9] Eventually, the LTO-BAC suspended the opening of bid documents and Secretary De Jesus issued Department Order ( D.O. ) No. 2010-36, which created a Special Bids and Awards Committee ( SBAC ) for the Supply, Production, and Delivery of Driver's License Cards Project. [10] On December 24, 2010, the DOTC-SBAC posted a new Invitation to Bid for the project. [11] It noted that previous participants who purchased the original bid documents, like RDMSI and AMPI, would be issued new sets of bid documents upon presentation of their receipt for the previous bid documents. [12] However, RDMSI filed a Petition for Declaratory Relief with Prayer for Temporary Restraining Order/Preliminary Injunction before the RTC. [13] It alleged that it had a capacity to file such petition as a bidder under the May 24, 2010 Invitation to Bid. In an Order [14] dated February 16, 2011, the RTC granted RDMSI's application for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction. [15] Secretary De Jesus then issued Special Order ( S.O. ) No. 2011-181 [16] entitled ""Strengthening of the Bids and Awards Committee and its Secretariat,"" which created the DOTC Primary and Secondary BACs for all procurement of goods, infrastructure projects, and consultancy services of the DOTC, whether locally or foreign-funded. [17] On April 17, 2012, the DOTC posted a new Invitation to Bid on its website for the DOTC-Road Transportation Information Technology Infrastructure Project ( RTITIP ). [18] Thus, AMPI filed an Urgent Motion for Leave to File Petition-in­Intervention, questioning the validity of D.O. No. 2010-36 and S.O. No. 2011-181. [19] In a Resolution [20] dated April 30, 2012, the RTC granted AMPI's motion. [21] In another Order [22] dated June 1, 2012, the RTC also granted AMPI's application for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction. [23] Aggrieved, Manuel A. Roxas II, as then incumbent DOTC Secretary, Virginia P. Torres, as the DOTC's Assistant Secretary, and Ildefonso T. Patdu, as Chairperson of the DOTC-SBAC (collectively, Secretary Roxas, et al. ), filed a Petition for Certiorari with the CA, assailing the RTC's writs of preliminary injunction as having been issued with grave abuse of discretion. [24] In a Decision [25] dated September 28, 2012, the CA reversed and set aside the RTC Orders dated February 16, 2011 and June 1, 2012 and dissolved the writs of preliminary injunction issued pursuant to said orders. [26] The CA ruled that RDMSI and AMPI are not entitled to the writs of injunction because they do not have a clear and unmistakable right that must be protected. [27] While there is no dispute that RDMSI and AMPI have purchased bidding documents and TORs, they participated in the pre-bid conference with other bidders, and the scheduled opening of bids was suspended, they are still not considered bidders yet. Accordingly, they are merely potential or future bidders because there is no bid or signed offer or proposal submitted by them in response to the bidding documents. The CA pronounced that RDMSI and AMPI's claimed right is still indefinite until the same is properly threshed out in a trial. There is, therefore, no need for the protection of an injunctive writ. [28] Undaunted, AMPI moved for partial reconsideration, which the CA denied in a Resolution [29] dated March 6, 2013. Hence, this petition.","The Court denies the instant petition. Respondents timely filed the petition for certiorari with the CA. Petitioner has not complied with the requisites for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction. Petitioner failed to establish its right in esse. Without necessarily preempting the RTC's ruling in the main case, this Court finds that petitioner's right, for purposes of the preliminary injunction, is not clear and unmistakable. It is not a right in esse. At best, petitioner's right was merely speculative. Moreover, there is no urgent need for the writ to prevent irreparable injury.","In sum, 'an application for injunctive relief is construed strictly against the pleader.' As a writ of preliminary injunction has far-reaching consequences, the RTC should have been more circumspect in issuing it. The discretion to accept or reject any bid, or even recall the award thereof, is of such wide latitude that the courts will not generally interfere with the exercise thereof by the executive department, unless it is apparent that such exercise of discretion is used to shield unfairness or injustice. This Court finds that there are no substantial reasons to warrant a review of the assailed Decision and Resolution.","ACCORDINGLY, the instant petition is DENIED. The Decision dated September 28, 2012 and the Resolution dated March 6, 2013 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 125203 are AFFIRMED. The Orders dated February 16, 2011 and June 1, 2012 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 96, Quezon City in Civil Case No. Q-10-68555 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The Writs of Preliminary Injunction issued pursuant to said Orders are DISSOLVED. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 249815, July 04, 2022","GLORIA A. CHICO, PETITIONER, VS. ELSIE CIUDADANO, RESPONDENT.","On April 10, 2012, Chico filed a Petition for Issuance of a New Title alleging that in the July 8, 2010 Tax Delinquency Sale, she was the highest bidder of a parcel of land covered by TCT No. 57394 (PR-11986) registered in the name of Rosalita G. Bengzon (Bengzon). With the lapse of the one-year redemption period, Chico prayed for the cancellation of said TCT and the issuance of a new TCT in her name. The RTC granted the petition in its December 10, 2012 Decision (later amended June 27, 2013), directing the cancellation of TCT No. 57394 (PR-11986) and the issuance of a new TCT (TCT No. 004-2016005243) in Chico's name. On January 16, 2017, respondent Elsie Ciudadano (Ciudadano) filed a Petition for Annulment of Judgment before the CA, alleging that she and her husband purchased the subject property from Bengzon in 1989 (1989 Deed), which was annotated on TCT No. 57394 (PR-11986) as a 'PROV. REGISTRATION,' and that she had been residing there since 1992. Ciudadano alleged extrinsic fraud and lack of jurisdiction, arguing that Chico failed to include her as a party despite knowing she was the buyer and occupant. The CA, in its April 5, 2019 Decision, granted Ciudadano's petition, annulling the RTC decisions and reinstating the original TCT. Chico filed the instant Appeal by Certiorari seeking to reverse the CA rulings.","The Court of Appeals, in its April 5, 2019 Decision, granted Ciudadano's Petition for Annulment of Judgment and reversed and set aside the December 10, 2012 Decision and June 27, 2013 Amended Decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 83, Quezon City in LRC Case No. Q-33350(12) on the ground of extrinsic fraud and lack of jurisdiction. Consequently, TCT No. 004-2016005243 in the name of Gloria A. Chico was declared void and TCT No. 57394 (PR-11986) in the name of Rosalita G. Bengzon was reinstated for all legal intents and purposes.","The Supreme Court ruled that the petition for annulment of judgment was meritorious because the RTC decisions suffered from extrinsic fraud and lack of jurisdiction. Chico committed extrinsic fraud by deliberately failing to implead Ciudadano—a real party in interest who had a registered claim of ownership (1989 Deed annotated on the TCT) and actual possession of the property. This failure constituted extrinsic fraud because it prevented Ciudadano from exhibiting fully her case. Furthermore, the deliberate exclusion of Ciudadano, an indispensable party, meant the RTC failed to acquire jurisdiction over her person, rendering its judgments null and void. A void judgment cannot attain real finality, and the certificate of title issued pursuant thereto (TCT No. 004-2016005243) is likewise void.","The petition is DENIED. The April 5, 2019 Decision and October 8, 2019 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 149127 are hereby AFFIRMED in toto."
"G.R. No. 243811, July 04, 2022","CARLO VILLAMOR Y GEMINA, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","An Information [6] for Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs was filed against petitioner, the accusatory portion of which reads: That on or about June 12, 2012 at around 6:00 o'clock in the morning at Sitio Tramo, Brgy. Balagtas, Batangas City, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, not being authorized by law, did then and there knowingly, willfully[,] and criminally possess or have under his custody and control three (3) heat sealed transparent plastic sachets containing 0.16 gram of Methamphetamine Hydrochloride, more commonly known as 'Shabu', a dangerous drug and one (1) tape-sealed transparent plastic sachet containing traces of the same substance, which is a clear violation of the above-cited law. CONTRARY TO LAW. [7] When arraigned, petitioner pleaded ""NOT GUILTY"" to the offense charged. [8] Version of the Prosecution On the strength of the intelligence gathered through careful surveillance of the subject, SPO1 Ernesto Cabrera (SPO1 Cabrera) applied with the Executive Judge of the RTC Batangas City, the Hon. Ruben A. Galvez for the issuance of a search warrant against petitioner. [9] ... Upon arrival at the area, the designated person coordinated with the barangay official and Barangay Councilor Mario Ginhawa [13] (Councilor Ginhawa) who accompanied them to the place. Media representative Lito Rendora (Rendora) and Department of Justice (DOJ) representative Prosecutor Evelyn Jovellanos (Prosecutor Jovellanos) eventually joined them. ... PO1 Jeffrey Falcutila (PO1 Falcutila), PO1 Earl Malibiran (PO1 Malibiran), Rendora, Prosecutor Jovellanos and Councilor Ginhawa all entered the house. While these witnesses were observing him, PO1 Falcutila conducted the initial search of the only bedroom in the house, but he did not find illegal drugs, paraphernalia and equipment there. PO1 Falcutila continued searching in the living room. There, on top of the refrigerator and beneath a mantle, he discovered three (3) plastic sachets containing white crystalline substance suspected to be shabu, one (1) transparent plastic sachet with suspected shabu residue and one (1) small aluminum foil. Upon this discovery, petitioner suddenly fled, but as the area had been secured, the police caught him just outside the house. They brought him back inside the house and in the presence of the witnesses — Rendora, Prosecutor Jovellanos and Councilor Ginhawa — PO1 Falcutila immediately placed identification markings on the three (3) plastic sachets containing the white crystalline substance, the transparent plastic sachet with suspected shabu residue, and the single aluminum foil. ... Version of the Defense Petitioner vehemently denied the charge against him. He narrated that on June 12, 2012 at 5:00 o'clock in the morning, he was sleeping at home with his wife, when they heard police officers knocking at the door and window calling his name. Without opening the door yet, his wife asked them why they were looking for her husband. All of a sudden, the police officers kicked their door. As they successfully entered their house, the police officers brought petitioner, his wife, and their children outside their house. While they were being guarded by two (2) other police officers, the other police officers started searching their house, and they heard that their things were being thrown. At that time, the police officers were coming in and out of their house. After one and a half (1 1/2) hours, Prosecutor Jovellanos, Councilor Ginhawa, and a media man arrived. Upon their arrival, the police officers searched again their house, but petitioner and his family were still outside their house. He alleged that the said seized items were not found inside his house and they were planted by the police officers. He asked help from Councilor Ginhawa and Prosecutor Jovellanos, but to no avail. [22] Further, petitioner recalled that the police officers were only doing this because sometime in February 2012, he had a heated argument with a police officer Eje in a cockfight, where he worked as a ""tagapusta."" [23]","In a Decision dated August 31, 2018, the CA affirmed in toto the conviction of petitioner for violation of Section 11, Article II of R.A. 9165, to wit: WHEREFORE, the instant appeal is DENIED. The Decision dated February 23, 2016 of the Regional Trial Court of Batangas City, Branch 7, in Criminal Case No. 17480, finding Carlo Villamor y Gemina guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Section 11, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165, is AFFIRMED in toto.","The Petition lacks merit. At the outset, the Court notes that the issues raised in the Petition are factual and evidentiary in nature, which are outside the Court's scope of review in Rule 45 petitions. ... Be that as it may, the Court finds no reversible error committed by the CA in affirming petitioner's guilt for violation of Section 11, Article II of R.A. 9165. Thus, the Court affirms petitioner's conviction for violation of Section 11, Article II of R.A. 9165. ... The search made by the police officers was lawful. ... [T]he records clearly reveal otherwise. [48] PO1 Falcutila, one of the police officers who made the actual search that led to the discovery of the illegal drugs, testified that the same was made in petitioner's presence, thus: ... Based on the foregoing, it is without doubt that petitioner was present during the search conducted at the sala by the police officers. Thus, the search made by the police officers was lawful. The police officers were able to strictly comply with the requirements of Section 21. ... The implementation of the search warrant and the conduct of the inventory and photographing in the house of petitioner were witnessed by the barangay councilor, media representative, and DOJ representative who were already with the search team even before they entered the house of petitioner. ... Thus, at no point in time was there a significant gap in the chain of custody of the said piece of evidence so as to cast reasonable doubt that the evidence seized from the accused might not be the same evidence submitted to the Court. Moreover, all the witnesses required to be present during the marking, taking of photographs, and inventory of the evidence were present. ... This case therefore belies any claim that the requirements of R.A. 9165 are difficult to comply with.","WHEREFORE, premises considered, the petition is DENIED for lack of merit. The Court hereby ADOPTS the findings of fact and conclusions of law in the Decision dated August 31, 2018 and Resolution dated December 18, 2018 of the Court of Appeals, Special Sixteenth Division and Former Special Sixteenth Division, respectively, in CA-G.R. CR No. 39787.

"A.C. No. 11369, July 04, 2022","JEANNE MARCELO-SALUD, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. ROGELIO J. BOLIVAR, RESPONDENT.","On April 29, 2016, the Office of the Bar Confidant received a Complaint-Affidavit[2] filed by complainant against respondent. According to the complainant, the instant case stemmed from two (2) separate complaints for unlawful detainer filed by complainant against Dionaldo and Spouses Tolentino before the MTC and RTC, respectively, for their failure to vacate the property allegedly owned by complainant. In the said unlawful detainer complaints, respondent, who also acted as the chief legal counsel and assistant administrator of La Compania Agricola de Ultramar, Inc. (La Compania), represented both Dionaldo and Spouses Tolentino.[3] According to complainant, respondent committed deceit and misrepresentation when he induced Dionaldo and Spouses Tolentino to refuse to vacate the prope1iy by representing to them that the real owner of the leased properties is La Compania. Moreover, respondent unduly delayed the court proceedings in the case against Spouses Tolentino by failing to appear in court despite due notice. To support this, complainant cited respondent's motion for the resetting of the scheduled judicial dispute resolution in the case against Spouses Tolentino due to his medical condition.[4] In his Comment,[5] respondent admitted that he has been the chief counsel and co-administrator of La Compania since 2008. Nonetheless, he denied complainant's allegations, arguing that: (a) he did not induce Dionaldo and Spouses Tolentino into refusing to vacate the leased properties considering that they already ended their respective lease agreements with complainant even before he accepted them as clients; and (b) he did not cause the delay in the resolution of the cases since his motions for postponement were granted by the respective courts. Moreover, he argued that the allegations in the complaint were not supported by evidence. Hence, the complaint should be dismissed.[6] In a Notice of Resolution[7] dated July 5, 2017, the Court referred the case to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) for its investigation, report, and recommendation.","The Court affirms the findings and recommendations of the IBP with certain modifications, as will be explained hereunder. It is a settled rule that the quantum of proof required to hold lawyers liable in administrative cases is through substantial evidence – which is more than a mere scintilla but is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. [11] In Reyes v. Nieva, [12] the Court had the opportunity to discuss the rationale as to why substantial evidence as the quantum of proof in administrative cases is more in keeping with the policy considerations in the discipline of lawyers, viz.: Besides, the evidentiary threshold of substantial evidence – as opposed to preponderance of evidence - is more in keeping with the primordial purpose of and essential considerations attending this type of cases. As case law elucidates, ""[d]isciplinarv proceedings against lawyers are sui generis. Neither purely civil nor purely criminal, they do not involve a trial of an action or a suit, but is rather an investigation by the Court into the conduct of one of its officers. Not being intended to inflict punishment; it is in no sense a criminal prosecution. Accordingly, there is neither a plaintiff nor a prosecutor therein. It may be initiated by the Court motu proprio. Public interest is its primary objective, and the real question for determination is whether or not the attorney is still a fit person to be allowed the privileges as such. Hence, in the exercise of its disciplinary powers, the Court merely calls upon a member of the Bar to account for his actuations as an officer of the Court with the end in view of preserving the purity of the legal profession and the proper and honest administration of justice by purging the profession of members who by their misconduct have proved themselves no longer worthy to be entrusted with the duties and responsibilities pertaining to the office of an attorney. In such posture, there can thus be no occasion to speak of a complainant or a prosecutor.""[13] (emphasis and underscoring supplied) Verily, the burden to prove the misconduct of a lawyer rests on the complainant to establish the allegations in their complaint.[14] This is in accordance with' an attorney enjoying the legal presumption that they are innocent of the charges against them until the contrary is proved, and that as an officer of the Court, they are presumed to have performed their duties in accordance with their oath.[15] Reliance on mere allegations, conjectures, and supposition of an attorney's alleged acts cannot be given credence absent any proof by substantial evidence.[16] Thus, the complainant's failure to discharge their burden of proof requires no other conclusion than that which stays the hand of the Court from meting out a disbarment or suspension order, as in this case. As correctly observed by the IBP, complainant was unable to prove the alleged acts of misconduct committed by respondent through substantial evidence. A review of the records shows that complainant failed to adduce any form of evidence to prove that respondent induced Dionaldo or Spouses Tolentino from refusing to vacate the subject property in the separate complaints for unlawful detainer. In particular, it observed that complainant did not present any evidence to show that respondent provided Dionaldo or Spouses Tolentino the information that the subject property in the unlawful detainer cases is owned by La Compania. Similarly, there was no evidence to show that respondent unduly delayed the proceedings in the case against Spouses Tolentino. As noted by the IC, a singular instance of postponement could not be considered as an act of unduly delaying the proceedings with malice. Considering the foregoing, complainant's accusations against respondent regarding .this matter should be dismissed for lack of merit. Nonetheless, the Court holds that respondent should be held accountable for violating the rule against representing conflicting interests. Rule 15.03 of the Code of Professional Responsibility provides: Rule 15.03. – A lawyer shall not represent conflicting interests except by written consent of all concerned given after a full disclosure of the facts. In Hornilla v. Salunat, [17] the Court explained the concept of conflict of interest in this wise: There is conflict of interest when a lawyer represents inconsistent interests of two or more opposing parties. The test is ""whether or not in behalf of one client, it is the lawyer's duty to fight for an issue or claim, but it is his duty to oppose it for the other client. In brief, if he argues for one client, this argument will be opposed by him when he argues for the other client."" This rule covers not only cases in which confidential communications have been confided, but also those in which no confidence has been bestowed or will be used. Also, there is conflict of interests if the acceptance of the new retainer will require the attorney to perform an act which will injuriously affect his first client in any matter in which he represents him and also whether he will be called upon in his new relation to use against his first client any knowledge acquired through their connection. Another test of the inconsistency of interests is whether the acceptance of a new relation will prevent an attorney from the full discharge of his duty of undivided fidelity and loyalty to his client or invite suspicion of unfaithfulness or double dealing in the performance thereof. [18] (emphasis and underscoring supplied) As held in Quiambao v. Bamba, [19] the prohibition of representing conflicting interests is founded on the ""principles of public policy and good taste.""[20] Contrary to the observations of the IC and applying the tests elucidated above, the Court finds respondent guilty of actual conflict of interest in the handling of the unlawful detainer cases of Dionaldo and Spouses Tolentino while serving as counsel to La Compania. His relationships as counsel with his clients are evidenced by: (1) respondent's own admission in his responsive pleadings that he has been the counsel of La Compania since 2008, prior to handling the cases of Dionaldo and Spouses Tolentino;[21] and (2) the special powers of attorney separately entered by Dionaldo and Spouses Tolentino with respondent in representing them in the unlawful detainer cases as documented in his own responsive pleadings.[22] By accepting Dionaldo and Spouses Tolentino as clients, respondent invites suspicion of unfaithfulness or double dealing in the performance of his duties as the lawyer for Dionaldo and Spouses Tolention, as well as La Compania, if ever litigation occurs between and among them considering that, as admitted by respondent, La Compania and complainant are in an ongoing litigation over the ownership of the subject property.[23] Upon the determination of the ownership of the property, respondent will be forced to choose between La Compania and Dionaldo and Spouses Tolentino, thus preventing him from fully discharging his duties as a lawyer to one of his clients. Anent the proper penalty to be imposed on respondent, case law instructs, as a general rule, that lawyers who represent conflicting interests should be meted with the penalty of suspension from the practice of law. In Mabini Colleges, Inc. v. Pajarillo, [24] the Court suspended respondent therein for a period of one (1) year. In Villamor v. Jumao-as, [25] the Court suspended the erring lawyer for a period of two (2) years. In Paces Industrial Corporation v. Salandanan, [26] the Court suspended the erring lawyer for a period of three (3) years. However, as an exception to the foregoing, in Heirs of Lydio Jerry Falame v. Baguio (Baguio), [27] the Court meted out the penalty of reprimand against Atty. Baguio considering that (1) it was his first offense and (2) the resulting conflict of interest was due to his lack of anticipation of the possible conflict of interest in undertaking to accept his new clients, [28] as in this case. Here, a circumspect review of the prevailing circumstances would readily show that respondent's violation is similar to what was committed by the erring lawyer in Baguio. As such, the Court deems it appropriate to impose on respondent the penalty of reprimand, with a stem warning that a repetition of the same or similar infraction would be dealt with more severely.","ACCORDINGLY, the Court finds and declares respondent Atty. Rogelio J. Bolivar GUILTY of violating Rule 15.03, Canon 15 of the Code of Professional Responsibility and is hereby REPRIMANDED and STERNLY WARNED that any similar infraction in the future will be dealt with more severely. Let copies of this Decision be furnished to the Office of the Bar Confidant, to be appended to respondent's personal record as an attorney and to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines for their information and guidance. SO ORDERED.",REPRIMANDED and STERNLY WARNED that any similar infraction in the future will be dealt with more severely.
"G.R. No. 243163, July 04, 2022","INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE BANK (NOW UNIONBANK OF THE PHILIPPINES), PETITIONER, VS. JOSE CO LEE AND ANGELA T. LEE, RESPONDENTS.","On November 20, 2003, iBank filed a complaint[6] for sum of money and damages against Christina T. Lee (Christina), Jeffrey R. Esquivel (Jeffrey), Violeta T. Lee (Violeta), Karin Tse Go (Karin), Jose Co Lee (Jose), and Angela T. Lee (Angela). It alleged that Christina, Jeffrey, Violeta, Karin, Jose, and Angela fraudulently took P8,800,000.00 and P8,244,645.27 from the Forward Foreign Exchange Placement Accounts of iBank's clients, Liu Siu Lang Sy (Sy) and Ernesto and Olivia Co (Spouses Co), respectively, and transferred the money to their own bank accounts.[7] The bank alleged that Christina, as the treasury products sales associate in its Tektite Branch, was tasked to coordinate instructions from clients regarding their money market transactions. In line with her function, she informed the Branch Distribution Sector for Treasury that Sy and Spouses Co intended to terminate their Forward Foreign Exchange Placement Accounts in the amounts of P8,800,000.00 and P8,244,645.27, respectively.[8] Consequently, the Bank's Treasury Department credited the amounts of P8,800,000.00 and P8,244,645.27 to Settlement Account No. 006100040891. These amounts were to be credited to the investment accounts of Sy and Spouses Co. However, Christina allegedly tricked her superior into believing that the money in Settlement Account No. 006100040891 belonged to her partner and boyfriend, Jeffrey. Thus the amounts were credited to Jeffrey's account.[9] Later, it was alleged that the proceeds of the fraud were transferred from Jeffrey's account to that of Karin, Jose, and Angela, and that the amounts had been withdrawn. Consequently, when iBank learned of Christina's deceit, it was forced to reinstate the withdrawn P8,800,000.00 and P8,244,645.27 into Sy and Spouses Co's respective accounts.[10] In their Answer with Counterclaim, Christina's parents, Jose and Violeta, and her sister, Angela, denied their involvement in the fraud. They alleged that iBank only impleaded them as leverage against Christina.[11] On May 10, 2016, after iBank presented its evidence in chief, Jose and Angela[12] filed a Demurrer to Evidence[13] which the Regional Trial Court granted in its March 1, 2017 Resolution.[14] The Regional Trial Court held that iBank's evidence showed that it was Christina who made alleged false remarks in the Log Card to make it appear that Sy and Spouses Co wanted to terminate their Forward Foreign Exchange Placement Accounts. It was also Christina who processed the debit memo to transfer Sy and Spouses Co's funds to Jeffrey's account.[15] The dispositive portion of the Regional Trial Court Resolution reads: WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court Resolved to GRANT the Demurrer to Evidence with Motion to Dismiss filed by defendants Jose Co Lee and Angela Lee for being meritorious. Accordingly, the complaint against defendants Jose Co Lee and Angela Lee is hereby DISMISSED for insufficiency of evidence. SO ORDERED.[18] UnionBank, formerly iBank, filed a Motion for Partial Reconsideration[19] of the Regional Trial Court's March 1, 2017 Resolution. However, it was denied in a May 22, 2017 Order.[20] UnionBank received the denial of its motion on May 30, 2017 and on June 2, 2017 filed its Notice of Appeal.[21] On July 28, 2017, UnionBank withdrew[26] its Notice of Appeal since the Regional Trial Court still had not acted on its Motion for Leave and it needed to preserve its available legal remedies.[27] On July 31, 2017, UnionBank filed a Petition for Certiorari[28] with the Court of Appeals to assail the Regional Trial Court's Resolution and Order. On August 17, 2018, the Court of Appeals dismissed UnionBank's Petition for Certiorari.[30] The Court of Appeals held that instead of a petition for certiorari, UnionBank should have appealed the Regional Trial Court's Resolution granting the demurrer since it was a judgment on the merits. It called attention to UnionBank's withdrawal of its Notice of Appeal with the Regional Trial Court in ruling that certiorari was improper since it cannot be said that no plain, adequate, and speedy remedy was available.[31] UnionBank moved for a reconsideration of the Court of Appeals' August 17, 2018 Decision, but its motion was denied in a November 13, 2018 Resolution.[33] Aggrieved, UnionBank, filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari before this Court on January 4, 2019.","WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Petition for Review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court dated January 3, 2019 is PARTIALLY GRANTED. The August 17, 2018 Decision and November 13, 2018 Resolution of the Court of Appeals, Manila in CA-G.R. SP No. 151834 affirming the March 1, 2017 Resolution and May 22, 2017 Order of the Regional Trial Court of Makati City, Branch 58 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE AS TO RESPONDENT JOSE CO LEE. Respondent Jose Co Lee is hereby ORDERED to return the amounts fraudulently transferred into his account.","We first rule on the procedural matter of whether the Court of Appeals erred in dismissing the petition for certiorari for being the improper remedy. [...] In this case, the Regional Trial Court's Order granting the demurrer to evidence of respondent was indeed a final order. However, considering that the dismissal was only as to respondents in this case and the complaint for recovery of damages remained pending with the other defendants—Christina, Jeffrey, and Karin—it falls within the provided exception.[57] Thus, the petition for certiorari under Rule 65 was proper. Even if respondents insist that the proper remedy of petitioner was an appeal under Rule 41, the facts of the case, particularly the Regional Trial Court's inordinate delay in acting on petitioner's Motion for Leave to file its Notice of Appeal, would still leave petitioner with no recourse but to file a petition for certiorari under Rule 65. [...] This Court is now tasked to rule upon the grant of respondents' demurrer to evidence. [...] Contrary to the Court of Appeals' conclusion, a review of the records shows that Jose cannot be entirely absolved of liability. [...] We are of the view that the evidence presented by petitioner is sufficient to maintain a claim against respondent Jose. The facts of the case would have been better weighed and decided based on a full-blown trial to allow the parties opportunity to defend their case and to fully thresh out the circumstances surrounding the case. Hence, the demurrer to evidence should not have been granted, at least with respect to respondent Jose. [...] The same, however, cannot be said for Angela. There is no such similar evidence presented against Angela and her use of the funds credited to her account. Moreover, there is no showing that she was aware of Christina's scheme. Accordingly, the grant of the demurrer of evidence as to Angela is affirmed. [...] The last part of Rule 33, Section 1 of the Rules of Court provides that '[i]f the motion [to dismiss] is granted but on appeal the order of dismissal is reversed [the movant] shall be deemed to have waived the right to present evidence.' Thus, in keeping with the spirit behind Rule 31, Section 1, and to avoid further congestion in the lower courts, this Court shall resolve the question of whether petitioner UnionBank is entitled to the relief it seeks from respondent Jose without remanding the issue to the trial court. Petitioner is entitled to relief. Respondent Jose cannot be absolved of liability. While he feigns ignorance of his daughter's schemes, the evidence suggests otherwise. As stated above, upon Jeffrey's transfer of P1,200,000.00 to respondent Jose's account, the latter immediately issued a check for the same amount in favor of one Triangle Ace Corporation. [...] All told, respondent Jose must return the money that was fraudulently transferred into his account. Conversely, respondent Angela is absolved of any liability.","The Petition for Review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court dated January 3, 2019 is PARTIALLY GRANTED. The judgment dismissing the complaint against respondent Jose Co Lee is REVERSED, and he is ORDERED to return the amounts fraudulently transferred into his account. Respondent Angela T. Lee is absolved of any liability."
"G.R. No. 255157, July 04, 2022","ONESIMO AGAPITO, PETITIONER, VS. MARILYN F. AGAPITO, RESPONDENT.","The present case stemmed from a Complaint[6] for Unlawful Detainer filed by respondent Marilyn F. Agapito (Marilyn) against Onesimo, Marilyn's brother, before the Municipal Trial Court of Bocaue, Bulacan (MTC) on September 18, 2015. Marilyn alleged that she is the absolute and registered owner of a parcel of land located at 191 Centro 1st, Bunlo, Bocaue, Bulacan (property), covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-100482 (M),[7] and that for more than ten (10) years, Onesimo has occupied the property by her mere tolerance and without paying any rent. Without Marilyn's knowledge or consent, however, Onesimo constructed thereon a house with a market value of P21,600.00.[9] Despite demands, Onesimo refused to surrender possession. For his part, Onesimo filed an Answer with Compulsory Counterclaim,[13] asserting that he has been in possession of the property since the 1980s and built the house in 2000 in good faith and with Marilyn's full knowledge and acquiescence. He claimed he is willing to surrender the possession of the property, but subject to his right to reimbursement for the value of the house and improvements he introduced therein in good faith. The MTC, in a Partial Decision[20] dated July 20, 2017, ruled in Marilyn's favor, ordering Onesimo to vacate and pay rent, but denied Onesimo’s claim for reimbursement for the value of the house, ruling he was not a builder in good faith. Onesimo appealed before the RTC. The RTC, in a Decision[25] dated July 16, 2018, affirmed the MTC's Partial Decision with modification, declaring that Onesimo is not entitled to reimbursement of both necessary and useful improvements, as well as to the right of retention. Onesimo filed a Petition for Review[27] before the CA. The CA, in a Decision[28] dated December 28, 2020, reinstated the MTC's Partial Decision, but only with respect to the reimbursement of the necessary expenses incurred by Onesimo for the property's preservation, and affirmed the finding that petitioner has no right to retain the property, and likewise affirmed the orders to vacate and pay a monthly rental fee of P2,000.00.","WHEREFORE, the foregoing considered, the present Petition for Review is DENIED. The Decision dated 16 July 2018 of the Regional Trial Court, Third Judicial Region, Branch 81, Malolos City, Bulacan in Civil Case No. 445-M-2017 is MODIFIED insofar as it declared that petitioner is not entitled to any reimbursement. Accordingly, this Court REINSTATES the Partial Decision dated 20 July 2017 of the Municipal Trial Court of Bocaue, Bulacan in Civil Case No. 2015-029 insofar as the reimbursement for necessary expenses for the preservation of land is concerned. This Court AFFIRMS the finding that petitioner has no right to retain the property and likewise AFFIRMS the fol lowing Orders: 1. VACATE and DELIVER the peaceful possession of the subject property to respondent; and 2. PAY the rental tee in the amount of Php2,000.00 from time of demand until petitioner fully and actually vacates the same. SO ORDERED.","The Court's Ruling: The petition is meritorious. . . On this score, it bears reiterating that a petition for review on certiorari 'shall raise only questions of law which must be distinctly set forth.' . . . While the lower courts' findings are generally binding on the Court, especially when affirmed by the CA, a review of the facts and evidence is proper when, as earlier stated, the CA 'manifestly overlooked certain relevant facts not disputed by the parties which, if properly considered, would justify a different conclusion.' . . . Article 448 in relation to Article 546 of the Civil Code grants the builder, planter, or sower the right to reimbursement of the value of the useful and necessary improvements made on the land, with the additional right to retention of the premises until such reimbursement have been made. . . This notwithstanding, the law recognizes an instance where Article 448 of the Civil Code may be applied notwithstanding the bad faith of the builder, planter, or sower - that is, when the landowner is also in bad faith. In this regard, Article 453 of the Civil Code reads: Article 453. If there was bad faith, not only on the part of the person who built, planted or sowed on the land of another, but also on the part of the owner of such land, the rights of one and the other shall be the same as though both had acted in good faith. It is understood that there is bad faith on the part of the landowner whenever the act was done with his knowledge and without opposition on his part. . . Here, Marilyn judicially admitted in her complaint before the lower court that she is a 'resident of 269 Centro 1st, Bocaue, Bulacan' and that Onesimo 'is [her] brother x x x who has been in possession of the [property] for more than ten years by mere tolerance' 'out of brotherly love.' While she denied having knowledge of and consenting to the construction of the house, it remains undisputed that she never raised any objection, for over 14 years, to its construction and Onesimo's occupation thereof. . . Lastly, it bears noting that the evidence which Marilyn submitted to prove the value of the house shows that it was in fact declared for taxation purposes in 2014, as well as in 2006, under the name of 'AGAPITO ARMANDO MTO MARILYN A. GAPITO.' Verily, had she not been aware of its construction as early as 2006 nor had she not given her permission, she would not have declared the house under her name for taxation purposes. All told, the Court is convinced that the improvements on the property could not have been unknown to nor introduced without Marilyn's consent. Based on the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that Onesimo, as a builder, and Marilyn, as a landowner, are both in bad faith. Following the ruling in Spouses Belvis, Articles 448 and 453 in relation to Articles 546 and 548 of the Civil Code apply. In this regard, case law instructs that whenever both the landowner and the builder/planter/sower are in good faith (or in bad faith, pursuant to Article 453 of the Civil Code), the landowner is given two (2) options under Article 448 of the Civil Code, namely: (a) he/she may appropriate the improvements for himself/herself after reimbursing the buyer (the builder in good faith) the necessary and useful expenses under Articles 546 and 548 of the Civil Code; or (b) he/she may sell the land to the buyer, unless its value is considerably more than that of the improvements, in which case, the buyer shall pay reasonable rent.","WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED. The December 28, 2020 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 157507 is REVERSED. The instant case is REMANDED to the court of origin for a determination of the facts essential to the proper application of Articles 448, 546 and 548 of the Civil Code pursuant to prevailing jurisprudence as delineated in this Decision."
"G.R. No. 252898, August 31, 2022","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. WILLIAM DISIPULO Y SURIBEN, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","The accusatory portion of the two consolidated Information against Disipulo respectively state: Criminal Case No. 13-299318 That on or about August 15, 2013, in the x x x xx x x xxxx , the said accused, by means of fraudulent machination, force, threats and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously commit acts of sexual abuse upon the person of AAA252898, by then and there bringing her to the HALINA Hotel under the pretext of doing a VTR, kissing her, forcing her to suck his penis, kissing her breasts toward her neck, forcing her to hold his penis, kissing her on her breasts, masturbating while kissing her breasts, ejaculating and releasing his sperm upon her face, forcibly taking photographs of her, again kissing her on her breasts and inserting his finger into her vagina, forcing her to suck his penis while taking photographs of her, again forcing her to hold his penis and thereafter releasing his sperm upon her breasts, all against the will and without the consent of said AAA252898. CONTRARY TO LAW. Criminal Case No. 13-299319 That on or about August 15, 2013, in the x x x xx x x xxxx the said accused, by means of fraudulent machination, force, threats and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously had carnal knowledge of AAA252898 by then and there bringing her to the HALINA Hotel under the pretext of doing a VTR, kissing her, inserting his penis into her vagina, kissing her breasts toward her neck, forcing her to hold his penis, suddenly pulling her to his top, and again inserting his penis into her vagina, against the will and without the consent of said AAA252898. CONTRARY TO LAW. The evidence for the prosecution established that Disipulo befriended AAA252898's family, claiming to be a gay talent manager (""Struck""). He gained their trust, offering to help AAA252898 become a model. On August 15, 2013, he took her to Halina Hotel for a supposed VTR. Once inside, he forcibly kissed her, threatened to hurt her if she resisted, pulled off her clothes, and inserted his penis into her vagina (sexual intercourse). He then committed several acts of sexual assault, including inserting his fingers into her vagina and forcing her to perform fellatio, all while taking videos and threatening to release them if she told anyone. The victim reported the incident the next day, leading to Disipulo's arrest. Dr. Florida Taladtad confirmed the disclosure of sexual abuse. Disipulo denied the charges, claiming the sexual encounter was consensual and that he was gay. On June 3, 2017, the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 25 of Manila found Disipulo GUILTY of two (2) counts of the crime of Rape as charged (one count of rape by sexual assault and one count of rape by sexual intercourse). The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction with modification.","The appeal is bereft of merit. ACCORDINGLY, the instant appeal is DENIED. The Decision dated August 23, 2019 and Resolution dated November 19, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR HC No. 09551 are hereby MODIFIED.","The appeal is bereft of merit. All the enumerated elements of the offenses charged against accused-appellant were proven beyond reasonable doubt. The Court rejected accused-appellant's claim of consensual sex and his argument that force/threat and fraudulent machination are mutually exclusive modes of committing rape. AAA252898's initial willingness to go to the hotel under the pretext of a VTR did not equate to consent for the subsequent sexual acts which were coerced by force, threat, and intimidation. Regarding the penalties, the Court noted that accused-appellant failed to object to the duplicity of offenses charged in Criminal Case No. 13-299318 (Rape by Sexual Assault). The Court found that the various distinct acts of sexual assault successively performed (insertion of finger into the vagina, and forced fellatio) did not arise from a single criminal impulse but from distinct and separate motivations, warranting two separate offenses of rape by sexual assault. Thus, Criminal Case No. 13-299318 resulted in two (2) counts of rape by sexual assault. In Criminal Case No. 13-299319 (Rape by Sexual Intercourse), only one act of penile penetration was duly proven, affirming one count of rape by sexual intercourse.","ACCORDINGLY, the instant appeal is DENIED. The Decision dated August 23, 2019 and Resolution dated November 19, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR HC No. 09551 are hereby MODIFIED.

"G.R. No. 249681, August 31, 2022","ESTATE OF MURRAY PHILIP WILLIAMS, AS REPRESENTED BY DENIS MICHAEL STANLEY, PETITIONER, VS. WILLIAM VICTOR PERCY, RESPONDENT.","Following the death of Murray Philip Williams (Williams), Letters of Administration were issued by Branch 72 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Olongapo City in favor of Stanley on July 22, 2014 in Special Proceeding Case No. 65-0-12. On August 12, 2015, Stanley filed, on behalf of the Estate of Williams, a Complaint-Affidavit for carnapping and estafa against Percy before the Office of the Provincial Prosecutor of Olongapo City, Zambales. Stanley alleged that prior to his death, Williams entrusted two of his cars to Percy for safekeeping, specifically: a red 2007 Mercedes Benz ML500 with Plate No. ZGE-201 and a white platinum metallic 2011 Ford Expedition 4x4 AT Eddie Bauer EL with Engine No. AEB52740 and Chassis No. 1FMJK1J5XAEB52740. When Stanley demanded the return of the said vehicles, Percy failed to do so. In his Counter-Affidavit, Percy denied that the two vehicles were entrusted to him by Williams. On June 30, 2016, the Office of the City Prosecutor, Olongapo City issued a Resolution finding probable cause to file a criminal case for two counts of carnapping against Percy. The cases were consolidated and raffled to Branch 72 of the RTC of Olongapo City. Thereafter, Percy filed a Motion for Leave of Court to File Demurrer to Evidence, followed by the corresponding Demurrer to Evidence. On October 16, 2018, the RTC issued an Order granting the demurrer to evidence, reasoning that the prosecution failed to adduce the quantum of evidence required to convict Percy of two counts of carnapping. Stanley filed with the CA a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, without securing the conformity of the People through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), asserting that the RTC committed grave abuse of discretion. On April 14, 2019, the CA issued the first assailed Resolution dismissing the petition for failure on the part of Stanley to serve the same to Percy's current and complete address. Stanley filed a Motion for Reconsideration arguing that Percy's filing of a Comment to Petition meant voluntary submission to jurisdiction. The CA denied Stanley's motion in the second assailed Resolution dated September 26, 2019.","The Court is tasked to determine whether the CA erred in dismissing outright the petition filed by Stanley in his capacity as administrator of the Estate of Williams. All told, We find that the CA erred in concluding that it was not able to acquire jurisdiction over the person of Percy. Nonetheless, because it is the mandate of the Court to put primacy on constitutional safeguards of human life and liberty, this Court cannot remand the case to the CA for further proceedings because Stanley had no authority to file the said petition in the first place; and, more importantly, because doing so would violate Percy's right against double jeopardy. WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED.","Even if the Court were to remand the instant case to the CA, the eventual outcome will be the same. It will be dismissed because (1) it was filed without the conformity or authority of the OSG; and (2) it violates Percy's right against double jeopardy. In the appeal of criminal cases before the CA or the Supreme Court, the authority to represent the People is vested solely in the Solicitor General. A reading of Stanley's Petition for Certiorari with the CA readily shows that not a single sentence in the said pleading discusses the civil aspect of the criminal cases filed against Percy. It is crystal clear that Stanley was seeking to appeal an acquittal in a criminal case despite knowing all along that he had neither the right nor the authority to do so. Settled is the principle that an order granting a demurrer to evidence is a judgment on the merits and is tantamount to an acquittal. We adhere to the finality-of-acquittal doctrine which edifies the principle that a judgment of acquittal is final and unappealable. Any attempt to overturn an acquittal runs afoul of an accused's right against double jeopardy as provided in Section 21, Article III of the Constitution. The case law exception (grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction) does not apply here because records show that the prosecution completed the presentation of all its documentary and testimonial evidence during the trial without a hitch. Directing the CA to give due course to Stanley's petition for certiorari would be tantamount to placing Percy twice in jeopardy for criminal offenses that he had already been acquitted from.","WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED. SO ORDERED."

Likewise, he submitted the following documents requested by the CSC in its letter dated December 16, 1997: (1) Inspection Report; (2) Contractor Statement of Work Accomplished; (3) Progress Chart (S-Curve); (4) Statement of Time Elapsed and Percentage of Work Accomplished; (5) Certificate of Acceptance; and (6) Certificate of Project Completion. [20] On January 15, 1998, the CSC sent a letter to Estomo advising him to make the necessary rectification or completion of deficiencies as reflected in the Report of the Technical Committee of the City Engineering Office (CEO). ... On January 24, 1998, Estomo sent a final demand letter for the total amount of P604,278.60, representing the balance from the Contract for Works and the extra works.[22] Estomo remained unpaid. Thus, he filed before the RTC a Complaint[23] for Specific Performance, Sum of Money plus Damages against the CSC. In its Answer,[24] the CSC admitted the extra works, but denied their completion... The CSC maintained that it is willing to pay Estomo the total amount of P82,000.00 upon completion of the deficiencies and compliance by Estomo of the necessary documents... On March 5, 2001, the CSC filed a Motion to Tender Payment in Court. ... Evidenced by Official Receipt No. 1084353 dated March 7, 2001, the CSC tendered payment in Court by way of escrow deposit in the amount of P217,174.46... The RTC denied the Motion to Dismiss, and ruled that the CSC is estopped from raising the issue of lack of jurisdiction... In the same Order, the RTC found that the full amount of P217,174.46 shall be released in favor of Estomo based on equity and fair play, and the principle of quantum meruit since the project was 95% completed.","The CA reversed the Decision[4] dated August 8, 2013 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Cagayan De Oro City, Branch 20, in Civil Case No. 98-123. In reversing the RTC Decision, the CA declared that the obligation of respondent Civil Service Commission (CSC) Regional Office No. X (CSC Region X), as represented by the Regional Director, CSC Region X, is deemed extinguished. ... The RTC disposed as follows: WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiff [Estomo] and against the herein defendant [CSC]. Accordingly, defendant CSC is ordered to pay the plaintiff the following: 1. P387,104.14 representing the remaining outstanding obligation with legal interest... 2. P20,000.00 by way of reasonable attorney's fees, and 3. The cost of the suit. ... The decretal portion of the CA decision reads: WHEREFORE, the appeal is hereby PARTLY GRANTED. The Decision dated August 8, 2013 and the Order dated November 4, 2014 of the Regional Trial Court, 10th Judicial Region, Branch 20, Cagayan de Oro City in Civil Case No. 98-123 for ""Specific Performance, Sum of Money plus Damages"" is REVERSED. Defendant–appellant Civil Service Commission's obligation to plaintiff-appellee Domingo Estomo is deemed EXTINGUISHED in as much as the money in the amount of P217,174.46 paid by the former through escrow deposit was already released and paid to the latter.","The Court upheld the position of the CSC as regards the balance for the extra works in the amount of P144,735.98. Estomo's claim in the amount of P261,963.82 has no legal basis since the principle of quantum meruit does not apply. The deduction for recoupment was correctly made. A total of P221,368.35 cash advance was given to Estomo. The remaining amount of P31,766.36 from the P221,368.35 cash advance was properly deducted from the escrow deposit made by the CSC on March 7, 2001. The deduction of P25,998.79, equivalent to 7% of the gross amount of P371,431.20 (representing 6% VAT and 1% creditable withholding tax) was correctly made and in accordance with the law. The retention fee of P14,471.60 from the escrow deposit must be disallowed, as the interest of the government is sufficiently protected with the deduction of deficiencies computed at P82,000.00. However, the retention money previously withheld from the three progress payments (P36,329.63 and P40,522.05) is due for release, subject to the correction of VAT underpayment previously made by the CSC.","WHEREFORE, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is PARTIALLY GRANTED. The Decision dated August 31, 2018 and the Resolution dated July 19, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 04284-MIN are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. The Court hereby DECLARES the following: 1. The total contract price for the Contract for Works, including the extra works and change order, executed by respondent Civil Service Commission Regional Office No. X and petitioner Domingo F. Estomo, is One Million Six Hundred Twenty Thousand Five Hundred Twenty-Five and Five Centavos (P1,620,525.05); and 2. The following deductions are valid: a) Withholding taxes in the amount of P25,998.79; b) Recoupment in the amount of P55,342.09 from the progress payment dated July 14, 1997; c) Recoupment in the amount of P55,342.09 from the progress payment dated August 5, 1997; d) Recoupment in the amount of P78,917.81 from the progress payment dated September 26, 1997; e) Recoupment in the amount of P31,766.00 from the escrow deposit made on March 7, 2001; and f) Deficiencies in the amount of P82,000.00 from the escrow deposit made on March 7, 2001. Respondent Civil Service Commission Regional Office No. X is ORDERED to release in favor of petitioner Domingo F. Estomo the following: 1. Retention money in the amount of P34,348.01 from the progress payment dated July 14, 1997; 2. Retention money in the amount of P38,090.72 from the progress payment dated August 26, 1997; and 3. Retention money in the amount of P14,472.00 from the escrow deposit made on March 7, 2001. The total monetary award shall be subject to interest rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum from the time of judicial demand on February 4, 1998 until June 30, 2013, and six percent (6%) per annum from July 1, 2013 until full satisfaction. The case is REMANDED to the Regional Trial Court of Misamis Oriental, Cagayan de Oro City, Branch 20, for the proper computation of the total monetary award due to petitioner Domingo F. Estomo in accordance with this Decision. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 240124, August 31, 2022","JOAN V. ALARILLA, PETITIONER, VS. ROLANDO L. LORENZO, RESPONDENT.","Eduardo Alarilla (Eduardo) was the former Mayor of Meycauayan, Bulacan from 1992 to 1995. He was re-elected in 1998, and served three consecutive terms that ended in 2007. Eduardo is the petitioner's husband. Thereafter, the petitioner was elected as the Mayor of Meycauayan in the May 2007 elections. Then, she was re-elected for the same position during the May 2010 and May 2013 elections. During the petitioner's term, Eduardo served as the General Consultant of the Meycauayan City government. From July to August 2007, the petitioner approved the disbursement of 41 checks, all drawn from the account of the Municipality of Meycauayan. Said checks were issued as payment to LC San Pascual Construction Supply (LC San Pascual) and VSP Trading and General Merchandise (VSP Trading) for the goods and services they delivered. Meanwhile, on January 18, 2008, Rolando L. Lorenzo (respondent) filed a complaint against the petitioner and Eduardo for grave misconduct and dishonesty, and malversation through falsification of public documents, docketed as OMB-L-A-08-0022-A and OMB-L-C-08-0025, respectively. He narrated that from July 2007 to August 2007, the petitioner, in concert with her husband and with abuse of authority, misappropriated and converted to her own use public funds amounting to P5,130,329.14, by issuing checks as payment for goods and/or services purportedly delivered by LC San Pascual and VSP Trading, when no such goods and services were actually delivered. He accused the petitioner of receiving the proceeds of the said checks. On May 7, 2008, the OMB issued an Order requiring the petitioner and Eduardo to file their Counter-Affidavits and other controverting evidence. In compliance, on July 9, 2008, the petitioner and Eduardo filed their Joint Counter-Affidavit, vehemently denying the allegations hurled against them. Subsequently, on July 10, 2008, the OMB directed the parties to file their respective position papers. Eduardo passed away on March 4, 2009.","In a Decision dated January 30, 2018, the CA affirmed the OMB ruling. The CA agreed that the petitioner is guilty of grave misconduct and serious dishonesty. Moreover, it rejected the petitioner's claim that her right to the speedy disposition of her case was violated, absent proof that the alleged delay was vexatious and capricious. The dispositive portion of the CA ruling states: WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the instant petition is hereby DISMISSED. The Decision dated November 2, 2016 of the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon which was approved by the Office of the Ombudsman (OMB) through a Decision dated December 16, 2016 and Order dated March 1, 2017, in the case docketed as OMB-L-A-08-0022-A are AFFIRMED.","Based on the aforementioned standards, this Court finds that the OMB violated the petitioner's right to the speedy disposition of her case. . . . Obviously, seven years and 10 months fall outside the normal period for resolving administrative cases. . . . Indeed, both the administrative and criminal cases stemmed from the same complaint, involved the same facts, and were resolved within the same lengthy period. Consequently, the finding that the petitioner's right to speedy disposition was violated because of the inordinate delay in the resolution finding probable cause, equally holds true with respect to the delayed resolution of the administrative case. . . . Considering that the administrative complaint against the petitioner is dismissible due to the violation of her right to the speedy disposition of her case, this Court shall no longer belabor on the other issues raised.","WHEREFORE, premises considered, the January 30, 2018 Decision and June 6, 2018 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 151397, which affirmed the November 2, 2016 Decision and March 1, 2017 Order of the Office of the Ombudsman in OMB-L-A-08-0022-A, are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Accordingly, the administrative complaint for grave misconduct and serious dishonesty against petitioner Joan V. Alarilla is hereby DISMISSED for violation of her Constitutional right to speedy disposition of cases."

CONTRARY TO LAW. Upon his arraignment on May 23, 2005, Caballes entered a plea of ""not guilty."" After pre-trial was terminated on August 14, 2006, the consolidated trial of the cases subsequently ensued. Version of the Prosecution Sometime in 1991, Commission on Audit (COA) State Auditor Noemi P. Wong (Wong) conducted a comprehensive audit on the financial accounts and operations of the Department of Health, Region XI (DOH XI), Davao City, as well as an evaluation of its internal control safety and cash examinations on its accountable officers. The audit revealed that DOH XI's procurement of drugs, medicines, and medical supplies amounting to P2,409,089.84 during the year 1990 were irregular, uneconomical, and in violation of DOH Administrative Order No. 28 (AO 28), which provided the guidelines, procedures, and processes in the bulk procurement of drugs and medicines, medical supplies, and laboratory reagents in the different regions, as well as RA 3019. An examination of the Disbursement Vouchers (DV) and its supporting documents showed that the purchases made by DOH XI were (a) overpriced; (b) lacked the necessary product or drug registration; and (c) did not go through public bidding, among others. Consequently, COA Region XI, through Wong, filed an affidavit complaint against Caballes, together with the following public officers: Sulpicio P. Legaspi (Legaspi), Moses R. Peralta (Peralta), Oscar P. Mata (Mata), Bernadita S. Bendejo (Bendejo), Maria D. Camanay (Camanay), Rebecca Gomez (Gomez), Roselma G. Cantos (Cantos), Jorge Montilla (Montilla), Marissa L. Duran (Duran), Lourdes Plaza (Plaza), Marietta Fuentes (Fuentes), Ofelia S. Poliquit (Poliquit), Brenda Regner (Regner), Rhodora B. Lacson (Lacson), Salvador O. Estrera (Estrera), and all of DOH XI, and the following private individuals: Miguel S. Alipio (Alipio), as general manager of Ethnol Generics, Oscar Gerona (Gerona), as proprietor of Thenard Medical Systems, and Pelagio V. Sorongon, Jr. (Sorongon), as proprietor of J.V. Sorongon Enterprises. After the conduct of preliminary investigation, the complaint against Mata, Bendejo, Camanay, and Esterera were dismissed for insufficiency of evidence. Meanwhile, the Office of the Ombudsman (OMB) found probable cause to charge Caballes, as DOH XI Supply Officer, to have conspired with the other abovenamed persons for six counts of violating Section 3(e) of RA 3019. On March 5, 1998, the Informations charging Caballes, et al. were filed before the Sandiganbayan and docketed as Criminal Case Nos. 24480, 24482, 24483, 24484, 24486, and 24488. In the course of Wong's testimony, she identified numerous documents in relation to these cases, which was summarized by the OMB– Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP) in its Plaintiff-Appellee's Brief, as follows: 21. In connection with Criminal Case No. 24480, Wong identified DV No. CSP-90-12-3322 and its supporting documents; for Criminal Case No. 24482, she identified DV No. Aie-91-04-029 and its supporting documents. Both DVs contained the signatures of Legaspi, Peralta and appellant Caballes. 22. The DVs in Criminal Case Nos. 24480 and 24482 pertain to the purchase of 2,000 bottles of multivitamins with lysine with the brand name Ethnomin syrup. The examined documents revealed that the procurement was done without the benefit of public bidding. In addition, the multivitamins purchased was not among the items bidded out as shown in the Abstract of Bids of Drugs and Medicines for the period April to June 1990. Wong also identified the Price Schedule for Drugs and Medicines dated 27 March 1990 (Exhibit ""N""). Moreover, she testified that Ethnol Generics was not among the suppliers that participated in the bidding conducted for the purchase of drugs and medicines for the period of April to June 1990. 23. She concluded that the purchases violated various rules and regulations on the procurement of drugs and medicines. She confirmed that the items purchased had an expired drug registration, as shown in the Certificate of Drug Registration dated 18 March 1988 (Exh. ""S"") and Memorandum of Extension dated 21 November 1989 (Exh. ""T""). She stressed that current policy dictated that no payment should be made unless there is a valid Certificate of Drug Registration in order to guarantee the efficacy and safety of drugs for public consumption/use. 24. The purchase was in contravention of the Price Schedule for Drugs and Medicine dated 27 March 1990 (Exh. N-6). The Price Schedule included only the item identified as multivitamin (without lysine) with the lowest price of PhP6.40 per bottle while the items purchased were multivitamins with lysine for the price of P30.00 per bottle. 25. In Criminal Case No. 24484, Wong identified the following: DV No. Aie-90-11-2619 (Exh. OO) and its supporting documents. She also identified the signatures of Legaspi, Peralta, and of one Teresita Custodio (Custodio) found on the DV. The items purchased were 2,880 bottles of multivitamin with lysine with brand name Ethnomin Syrup and 2,000 bottles of Benzyl Benzoate. The multivitamin with lysine was purchased at PhP 30.00 per bottle. 26. She found several irregularities in the purchase of the said items under DV No. Aie-90-11-2619, viz: the purchase did not undergo public bidding; multivitamins with lysine and benzyl benzoate were directly purchased; and the items purchased were not included in the Abstract of Bids for Drugs and Medicines for the period of April to June 1990 and the Price Schedule for Drugs and Medicines dated 27 March 1990. Again, only ""multivitamin"" (without lysine) is included in the said Price Schedule and multivitamin merely costs PhP6.40 per bottle. 27. In Criminal Case No. 24483, Wong identified DV No. Aie-90-10-2294 (Exh. ""KK"") and its supporting documents. She also identified the signatures of Caballes, Peralta, and Legaspi on the said DV. The DV pertains to the purchase of three (3) items: (a) 700 packs of cotton pledget buds at P70.00 per pack; (b) 600 tubes of amalgam filling at PhP 13.00 per piece; and (c) 500 15-gram tubes of sulfur ointment at PhP59.00 per piece. 28. Several irregularities were found: (1) J.V. Sorongan Enterprises, to whom the Purchase Order (PO) was awarded was not the lowest bidder; (2) items purchased were overpriced; and (3) items did not have the required product registration, among others. 29. In Criminal Case No. 24486, Wong identified DV No. Aie-90-11-2864 (Exh. ""QQ"") and its supporting documents. She also identified the signatures of Caballes, Peralta, and Legaspi on the said DV. Other documents identified were the (1) Certificate of Acceptance signed by Caballes; (2) Abstract of Bids for the period of April to June 1990; and (3) Price Schedules for Medical Supplies as of 27 March 1990. 30. She found several irregularities in the procurement of sodium fluoride powder under DV No. Aie-90-11-2864, namely: the absence of public bidding; the item's price was based on the price schedule for Region 12, and not 11; item was overpriced by PhP2,245.00 per kilo; and the item lacked the necessary product registration. 31. She stressed that procurement was highly suspect since direct purchase was resorted to despite the fact that its two (2) essential conditions were not met. Further, she testified that the overpricing was established when her audit team conducted a re-canvass of the prevailing market price of sodium floruride powder. 32. In Criminal Case No. 24488, Wong identified DV No. Aie-90-12-3246 (Exh. ""SS"") and its supporting documents. She also identified the signatures of Caballes, Peralta, and Legaspi on the said DV. 33. She found several irregularities in the procurement of 600 tubes of amalgam filling, namely: the supplier J.V. Sorongan was not the lowest bidder; supplier did not post the required performance bond; item was overpriced; unit description of amalgam filling as appearing in the Abstract of Bids and Price Schedules was vague; description of amalgam filling was altered; and the item lacked the required product registration. Version of the Defense After the prosecution rested its case, the defense proceeded with the presentation of its evidence. Alipio, Gomez, Duran, Cantos, Poliquit, Sorongon, and Caballes each testified on their own behalf. Meanwhile, the parties stipulated on the testimony of Lacson. For his part, Caballes denied the allegations against him. In his Judicial Affidavit, which served as his direct testimony, he testified that as Supply Officer III, he acted as custodian and was primarily accountable for the safekeeping of supplies, materials and equipment, and conducting periodical inventories thereof. He also maintained a record of all accountable properties and direct work of storekeeping. In addition, he was responsible for the issuance of memorandum receipts of equipment and of clearance certificates to employees separated from service. He also prepared the annual procurement program and the monthly consumption report of office supplies, medicines, and medical supplies. Moreover, Caballes averred that he had no participation in the process for procurement of equipment, supplies, medicines, and medical supplies. His only participation was to receive the items delivered to the Supply Office and to prepare the request for inspection. Caballes explained that the document needed to facilitate the procurement is the Requisition and Issue Voucher (RIV), which is signed by the Program Managers and approved by the Regional Director. The RIV, together with the approved bidding documents or any supporting documents of the prices, will be sent to the Supply Section with a note from the Regional Director stating, ""Please Issue Purchase Order."" After preparing the Purchase Order (PO), the Supply Officer signs the recommendation portion and sends the PO to the Administrative Office for further processing. When the PO is approved by the Regional Director, it will be sent back to the Supply Office, already funded, price checked, and it will then be served to the Supplier. Thereafter, the DV will be prepared after inspection of the delivered items. Caballes claimed that it was MacArthur Clapano (Clapano) who prepared the POs, as the buyer of DOH XI, and that Caballes signed the recommending approval portion of the POs only upon the receipt of the approved bidding result, and upon the order of the Regional Director. Additionally, the DVs were also prepared by Clapano, and Caballes' only participation was to sign the receipt portion thereof, and send the same to the Administrative Office. He also averred that he had no participation in the preparation of the RIVs. Caballes also opined that his only participation as Supply Officer III during the whole process that transpired in 1990 was to receive the deliveries of the items and to store them before its release to end-users. Moreover, as summarized by the Sandiganbayan in its Decision, Caballes specifically testified for each case that: In connection with Criminal Case No. 24480 involving the purchase of multi-vitamins with lysine, the mode of procurement decided by the Regional Director was repeat order. He received the items delivered. He signed the PO. He signed the PO based on the approved RIV (Exhibit ""HH-4"") with the price schedule forwarded to his office. The requisitioning officer indicated in the RIV was accused Peralta as Administrative Officer V. It was approved by accused Legaspi as Regional Director. In Criminal Case No. 24482, also involving the purchase of multi-vitamins with lysine, the mode of procurement decided by the Regional Director was repeat order. He signed the PO based on the approved RIV (Exhibit ""JJ-4""). The requisitioning officer was accused Peralta and the approval was by accused Legaspi as Regional Director. In Criminal Case No. 24483, where the word ""set"" was substituted with ""tube,"" the mode of procurement was public bidding. He signed the PO prepared by Mr. MacArthur Clapano based on the approved RIV. He has no participation in the preparation of the Abstract of Bids and the price schedule. There is no difference in the unit of measure of the item purchased described as ""set"" to ""tube."" That should not be considered irregular and anomalous. He changed the word ""set"" to ""tube"" in the PO to make it conform with the RIV approved by the Regional Director. He did not gain anything when he did that and there was no prejudice to the government. There is no difference from ""set"" to ""tube"" because the contents are the same. In Criminal Case No. 24484, the mode of procurement was exclusive distributor decided by the Regional Director. He signed the PO based on the approved RIV (Exhibit ""OO-4"") together with the price schedule forwarded to his office. The requisitioning officer was accused Peralta and the approval was by accused Legaspi as Regional Director. In Criminal Case No. 24486, he cannot remember the mode of the purchase. He does not know who prepared the PO which was signed by Dr. Montilla. In Criminal Case No. 24481, where the word ""set"" was again changed to ""tube,"" he signed the PO based on the RIV (Exhibit ""SS-4"") together with the price schedule. The requisitioning officer was accused Peralta as Administrative Officer V and the approval was by accused Legaspi as Regional Director. In Criminal Case No. 24488, where the word ""set"" was also changed to ""tube,"" there is no difference between ""set"" and ""tube"". He signed the PO. He did not gain anything from the transaction.","In a Decision dated June 7, 2019, the Sandiganbayan found Caballes, together with his co-accused, guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Section 3(e) of RA 3019.

Finally, as regards accused Lourdes Plaza who was found suffering from a mental disease, let the Resolution dated June 14, 2015 suspending the proceedings remain until further orders from this Court. SO ORDERED.","Our Ruling The appeal is partly meritorious. At the outset, it must be recalled that Caballes was charged only in the Informations pertaining to Criminal Case Nos. 24480, 24482, 24483, 24484, 24486, and 24488. After trial, the Sandiganbayan acquitted him in Criminal Case Nos. 24483 and 24488. However, the anti-graft court convicted Caballes in Criminal Case Nos. 24481, 24487, and 24489. At this juncture, it must be stressed that Caballes was not charged in the Informations for Criminal Case Nos. 24481, 24487, and 24489, a fact which was also acknowledged by the OMB-OSP in its Brief. Interestingly, however, the Sandiganbayan included Caballes in its disposition in Criminal Case Nos. 24481, 24487, and 24489, and worse, convicted him thereat. It is a well-settled rule in this jurisdiction that: An accused cannot be convicted of an offense, unless it is clearly charged in the complaint or information. Constitutionally, he has a right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him. To convict him of an offense other than that charged in the complaint or information would be violative of this constitutional right. Indeed, the accused cannot be convicted of a crime, even if duly proven, unless it is alleged or necessarily included in the information filed against him. It would be the height of injustice to punish Caballes for such cases in which no Informations were ever filed against him. He cannot be properly convicted therein without trampling on his constitutionally-protected rights. Consequently, Caballes must necessarily be acquitted in Criminal Case Nos. 24481, 24487, and 24489. Consequently, what is left to be resolved by this Court is Caballes' culpability in Criminal Case Nos. 24480, 24482, 24484, and 24486. In these cases, the Sandiganbayan found Caballes to have been involved in DOH XI's irregular and anomalous purchases from Ethnol Generics (Crim. Case Nos. 24480, 24482, 24484) and J.V. Sorongon Enterprises (Crim. Case No. 24486) of the following items: [List of items]. After a careful scrutiny of the evidence on record, the Court finds that the Sandiganbayan did not err in convicting Caballes for the violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019 in these cases. In the case at bar, all such elements are present. Regarding the first element, there is no dispute that Caballes was a public officer given that he was the Supply Officer III of DOH XI at the time of the commission of the alleged offenses. Moreover, the acts complained of, i.e., recommending the approval of the purchases and signing the pertinent documents, were done in the discharge of his official functions. Moving on to the second element, Caballes insists that he was merely performing his ministerial duty of receiving the items delivered to their office, without regard as to how these supplies were procured. He claims that he had no participation whatsoever in the procurement process, that he did not belong to any committee relating to procurement, and that his signatures cannot automatically be considered to be tainted with malice or fraudulent intent. This Court is not convinced. A perusal of the records would show that Caballes acted with gross inexcusable negligence when he recommended the approval of the purchases and signed the DVs, POs, and RIVs pertaining to the transactions involved in Criminal Case Nos. 24480, 24482, 24484, and 24486, notwithstanding the presence of several irregularities therein. [Details of irregularities in Crim. Case Nos. 24480, 24482, 24484, and 24486]. Verily, these anomalies in Criminal Case Nos. 24480, 24482, 24484, and 24486 should have prompted Caballes to be more circumspect and to inquire into the purchases further before signing the POs, RIVs, and DVs. His failure to flag the transactions as potentially unscrupulous when he had the opportunity to do so, and simply signing the said documents and recommending the approval of the purchase orders despite the obvious irregularities demonstrate that Caballes was grossly negligent in the performance of his duties. Indubitably, the second element of the crime was established in this case. Anent the third element, which refers to the two ways in which a violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019 can be committed – namely, (a) causing undue injury to any party, including the Government, or (b) giving unwarranted benefit, advantage, or preference to any private party, the Court finds that the same was adequately established in this case. Here, Caballes, together with his co-accused Legaspi, as the Regional Director, and Peralta, as Administrative Officer V, approved and signed the pertinent documents relating to the purchases in Criminal Case Nos. 24480, 24482, 24484, and 24486 despite the irregularities, which caused undue injury to the government. There is no question that his certifications and signatures were indispensable in the purchases of the items, which effectively facilitated the illegal and irregular disbursement of public funds in favor of Ethnol Generics and J.V. Sorongon Enterprises. Moreover, it bears noting at this juncture that, contrary to the assertions of Caballes, the evidence on record supports the finding that he conspired with Legaspi and Peralta as they all approved, or recommended the approval, of the anomalous purchases and signed the pertinent documents to facilitate the same, in blatant disregard of the requirements on public bidding, and with gross negligence in failing to ascertain the proper prices of the items. In the present case, the implied conspiracy among Caballes, Legaspi, and Peralta caused undue injury to the government in the total amount of P350,948.00, which represents the combined overpriced amount of the purchases made in Criminal Case Nos. 24480, 24482, 24484, and 24486. The damage or injury to the government could have been avoided, had these public officers exercised prudence and diligence in procuring or purchasing the medicines or medical supplies, and in examining the supporting documents before approving and signing the POs, RIVs, and/or DVs. Hence, aside from causing damage or injury to the government, Caballes, together with Legaspi and Peralta, also gave unwarranted benefit, advantage or preference to the said entities. Thus, considering the presence of all the elements of the offense, the Court sustains the conviction of Caballes for the crime of violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019 in Criminal Case Nos. 24480, 24482, 24484, and 24486. Moreover, the Court also emphasizes that Caballes' reliance in Arias v. Sandiganbayan (Arias) as an attempt to exculpate himself from any criminal liability is very much misplaced. Here, Caballes failed to prove that the Arias case is applicable to him. Unlike in Arias, there exists in the instant case several circumstances which should have alerted Caballes to be on guard and examine the several supporting documents sent to his office with some degree of circumspection before signing the RIVs, POs, and/or DVs. Therefore, the Court cannot extend the protection afforded by the Arias doctrine to Caballes. As to the penalty imposed, Section 9(a) of RA 3019, as amended, provides that a violation of Section 3 of the same law shall be punished with ""imprisonment for not less than six years and one month nor more than fifteen years"" and ""perpetual disqualification from public office."" Thus, as applied in this case, the penalty imposed by the Sandiganbayan which is an imprisonment term ""ranging from six (6) years and one (1) month, as minimum, to eight (8) years, as maximum,"" for each count of the offense, is in accordance with law. However, the aforementioned perpetual disqualification from public office should also be included. Additionally, the amount ordered by the Sandiganbayan to be solidarily paid by Caballes, Legaspi, and Peralta in favor of the government should also be modified to P350,948.00, which represents the combined overpriced amount of the purchases made in Criminal Case Nos. 24480, 24482, 24484, and 24486, as discussed above. However, considering the general rule that the effects of an appeal can only bind the accused who appealed his or her conviction, Legaspi and Peralta's liability shall only be limited to their portion based on the Sandiganbayan's ruling, which was pegged in the amount of P162,568.00. Hence, while Legaspi and Peralta's civil liability shall remain at P54,189.33 each, Caballes' civil liability shall be increased to P242,569.34. All told, the Court is convinced that the Caballes' guilt was proven beyond reasonable doubt, and that the Sandiganbayan did not err in its findings and conclusion in Criminal Case Nos. 24480, 24482, 24484, and 24486. The totality of the facts and circumstances demonstrates that Caballes committed the crime of violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019 by causing undue injury to the government and giving unwarranted benefits to Ethnol Generics and J.V. Sorongon Enterprises through gross inexcusable negligence.","WHEREFORE, the appeal is PARTLY GRANTED. The June 7, 2019 Decision and the August 20, 2019 Resolution of the Sandiganbayan in Criminal Case Nos. 24479-24489 are hereby MODIFIED in that accused-appellant Samson Z. Caballes is ACQUITTED in Criminal Case Nos. 24481, 24487, and 24489. However, his conviction in Criminal Case Nos. 24480, 24482, 24484, and 24486 for the violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION in that, aside from an imprisonment term ranging from six (6) years and one (1) month, as minimum, to eight (8) years, as maximum, he is also PERPETUALLY DISQUALIFIED from public office. Finally, Caballes and his co-accused, Sulpicio P. Legaspi, Moises R. Peralta, are held solidarily liable to pay the government the total amount of P350,948.00, of which Caballes is ORDERED to PAY P242,569.34.

IN RE: PETITION FOR CANCELLATION OF CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION NO. NCR-UR-12-4075*-2004 ISSUED TO ASIAN INSTITUTE OF MANAGEMENT FACULTY ASSOCIATION. ASIAN INSTITUTE OF MANAGEMENT, PETITIONER, VS. ASIAN INSTITUTE OF MANAGEMENT FACULTY ASSOCIATION, RESPONDENT.","Since 1968, AIM has been an unorganized establishment. On October 14, 2004, the faculty members of AIM 'formed and formally organized AFA to serve as the collective body which would act for and on behalf of its members in all matters involving and/or affecting their rights and interest.' On December 20, 2004, the Department of Labor and Employment issued AFA a Certificate of Registration, recognizing it as a legitimate labor organization. AIM opposed AFA's registration, saying that its faculty members were managerial employees. On May 16, 2007, AFA filed a Petition for Certification Election before the Department of Labor and Employment-National Capital Region, praying that a certification election be conducted to determine the exclusive bargaining agent of AIM's faculty members. Meanwhile, on July 11, 2007, AIM filed a Petition for Cancellation of the Certificate of Registration issued to AFA. The Mediator-Arbiter denied the Petition for Certification Election, finding all AFA's members managerial employees (August 30, 2007), but the Secretary of Labor later reversed this finding (February 20, 2009) and allowed the election. In the cancellation case, the DOLE-NCR granted cancellation (February 16, 2009), but the Bureau of Labor Relations later reversed this (December 29, 2009) sustaining AFA’s registration. In the certification election case, the Court of Appeals later granted AIM’s Petition for Certiorari (October 22, 2010), denying AFA's Petition for Certification Election, holding that the faculty members were managerial employees. In the cancellation case, the Court of Appeals affirmed the BLR’s ruling sustaining AFA’s registration (January 8, 2013). These two opposing CA decisions led to the consolidated petitions G.R. No. 197089 (AFA petition on certification election denial) and G.R. No. 207971 (AIM petition on cancellation denial) before the Supreme Court.","Faculty members are not managerial employees who are disqualified from forming or joining a labor organization. Moreover, the legitimacy of labor organizations cannot be collaterally attacked in a petition for certification election. Meanwhile, the grounds to cancel the registration of a labor organization are exclusive. If none of these grounds are proven to exist, its registration shall be sustained, owing to the State policy according primacy to the right to self-organization.","AIM's faculty members are not managerial employees. Their policymaking authority is merely recommendatory and subject to final approval by AIM’s Board of Trustees, and primarily relates to academic matters, not proprietary concerns. Furthermore, the prescribed work hours for faculty members go against a finding that they are managerial employees, consistent with jurisprudence that a strict imposition of work hours is uncharacteristic of a managerial employee. Second, the legitimacy of a labor organization may not be attacked in a petition for certification election (collateral attack rule/bystander rule). AIM, as the employer, is merely a bystander and has no legal personality to oppose the certification election. The pendency of a petition for cancellation of registration does not bar the conduct of certification elections. Third, the grounds for the cancellation of a legitimate labor organization's certificate of registration are exclusive under Article 247 of the Labor Code, and AIM failed to substantiate its allegations of misrepresentation or fraud.","the Petition for Review on Certiorari in G.R. No. 197089 is GRANTED. The Court of Appeals October 22, 2010 Decision and May 27, 2011 Resolution in CA-G.R. SP No. 109487 are REVERSED AND SET ASIDE.

"[ G.R. No. 208183, August 31, 2022 ]","REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, PETITIONER, VS. LT. COL. GEORGE ABONITO RABUSA, SG-25, MA. DEBBIE AREVALO RABUSA, AND FELIX AREVALO, RESPONDENTS.","The present action stems from a Petition for Forfeiture of Unlawfully Acquired Properties under R.A. No. 1379, as amended, with verified urgent ex parte application for the issuance of a writ of preliminary attachment filed by the Republic against Rabusa, et al. on December 6, 2004. The petition alleged that Rabusa was in continuous active service as an officer of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) since March 15, 1981. Rabusa’s sworn declarations in his Statements of Assets, Liabilities and Net Worth (SALN) reveal that his total government salary and income from other sources earned from the years 1990-2003 amounted to P13,579,433.60. Rabusa also disclosed that his spouse, respondent Ma. Debbie received her partial inheritance and some other donations amounting to P4,120,000.00. Meanwhile, Rabusa's total personal and family expenses totaled P21,025,854.60. The Republic asserts that Rabusa was spending more than what can be legitimately sustained, noting numerous undeclared assets: Subscribed and paid-up capital shares amounting to P1,000,000.00 (ARTI); vehicles (1997 Toyota Corolla P350,000.00, 2002 Isuzu Trooper Wagon P1,200,000.00); AFPSLAI capital contributions and savings amounting to P10,542,730.44; bank accounts in Security Bank, Land Bank, and BPI amounting to around P10,000,000.00; total premiums amounting to US$132,485.00 for insurance of two daughters; and a house and lot (P1,600,000.00) registered under Felix Arevalo. Rabusa, et al. allegedly accumulated funds and properties in the aggregate amount of P43,096,081.99. For his part, Rabusa contended, inter alia, that their lifestyle and assets are acceptable and amply substantiated, augmented by Ma. Debbie's partial inheritance and accumulated donations (P4,120,000.00) and salary from her employment (P15,000.00 and P45,000.00 per month). He explained he secured a P1,500,000.00 loan and sold property. He admitted AFPSLAI accounts but claimed the contents were not solely his but also close relatives and friends leveraging the high 20% interest rate offered to AFP members. Felix justified his expenses due to his P950,000.00 retirement pay and a P5,000,000.00 personal loan. The RTC rendered a Decision on December 14, 2009, dismissing the petition for failure of the petitioner to prove liability by preponderance of evidence. The CA affirmed the RTC ruling in its Decision dated November 26, 2012, holding that Rabusa, et al.’s bank accounts were protected under R.A. No. 1405 and found no irregularity regarding AFPSLAI investments and premium payments. The Republic filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari.",This Court resolves to partially grant the petition.,"The CA erred in ruling that the bank deposits (local currency accounts) do not fall under any of the exceptions of R.A. No. 1405. Cases of unexplained wealth are similar to cases of bribery or dereliction of duty, and the money deposited or invested is the subject matter of the litigation. Thus, the court orders (subpoenas duces tecum and ad testificandum) authorizing examination were proper, and the evidence procured should have been duly considered by the lower courts. However, the respondents' foreign currency deposit accounts are protected under R.A. No. 6426 (Foreign Currency Deposit Act of the Philippines), which prohibits disclosure except upon the written permission of the depositor, which was lacking in this case. The CA did not err in concurring with the RTC that (a) deposits in the AFPSLAI accounts do not solely belong to respondents (due to credible affidavits and testimony regarding leveraging the high interest rate); and (b) premium payments for the Philam Insurance Policies were sourced from monetary gifts, as the Republic failed to controvert these factual findings by preponderance of evidence. Since the RTC disregarded admissible evidence regarding the respondents' local bank accounts, a remand is necessary for a just and complete disposition of the case based on the quantum of evidence required, which is preponderance of evidence.","ACCORDINGLY, premises considered, the instant petition is PARTIALLY GRANTED. The Decision dated November 26, 2012 and the Resolution dated June 25, 2013 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 95545 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION.

"G.R. No. 236659, August 31, 2022","BERNARD B. BENASA, PETITIONER, VS. PRESENTACION R. MAHOR, RESPONDENT.","The instant controversy stemmed from a Petition for Accounting, Inventory and Reconveyance of Real Properties with Damages filed by Benasa against respondent Presentacion R. Mahor before the RTC. Benasa averred that he and Mahor engaged in an adulterous relationship starting sometime in 1974, while Mahor's marriage still subsisted, even as he spent most of his time overseas due to his work as a seafarer. Benasa asserted that using the salaries and benefits that he regularly remitted to Mahor in monthly allotments (aggregating US$585,755.89 and P200,927.00), Mahor was able to purchase several real properties in the Philippines, including lots situated in Quezon City, Tagaytay City, and Baliuag, Bulacan covered by TCT Nos. N-223267, T-17493, and T-306188, respectively, which were registered only in Mahor's name. Upon Benasa's retirement in 1999, he requested Mahor to make an inventory and accounting, but she did not comply, leading to the filing of the petition anchored on the supposed existence of a co-ownership under Article 147 or 148 of the Family Code. Mahor failed to file an Answer and was declared in default. The RTC rendered a Decision dated September 8, 2016, denying Benasa's petition for lack of merit, finding that their relationship was a simple love affair, not the marital cohabitation contemplated under Articles 147 and 148 of the Family Code. The RTC propounded that the real properties in question were bought during Mahor's marriage to Pablo and presumably belonged to them. Benasa appealed to the CA. The CA, in its Decision dated July 19, 2017, affirmed the RTC, agreeing that Article 148 was inapplicable because there was no proof of actual cohabitation, given that Benasa was a seafarer and was out of the Philippines most of the time, and upheld the presumption that the properties were conjugal in nature.","ACCORDINGLY, the petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated July 19, 2017 and the Resolution dated January 8, 2018 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 108032, upholding the Decision dated September 8, 2016 and the Resolution dated November 14, 2016 of the Regional Trial Court are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE.","The Court ruled that Article 148 of the Family Code governs the property regime of the parties, as it applies to adulterous relationships, noting its retroactive application. Rejecting the findings of the lower courts, the Court held that Benasa and Mahor were cohabiting as husband and wife under Article 148, finding that Benasa's intention to continue cohabiting, despite working as a seafarer abroad, was evinced by his continuous communication, shared property, and substantial remittances (totaling US$585,755.89 and P200,927.00) to Mahor during their 25-year cohabitation. Thus, the properties acquired by them during their cohabitation shall be owned by them in common in proportion to their respective actual contributions, as co-owners. The Court found that Benasa successfully substantiated his claim that he made substantial contributions in the acquisition of the contested real properties (TCT Nos. N-223267, T-17493, and T-306188). However, the Court could not sustain Benasa's claim on the personal properties located in the Quezon City property, finding the inventory and photos presented to be self-serving and inadequate to establish ownership. As the amount of Benasa's share needs proper determination based on the accounting, the case must be remanded to the RTC for reception of evidence and evaluation thereof.","1) The instant case is REMANDED to Branch 78, Regional Trial Court, Quezon City. Respondent, Presentacion R. Mahor, is hereby ORDERED to make and submit a complete and proper accounting report and/or inventory of all the money properties entrusted to her by petitioner, Bernard B. Benasa, from 1974 to 1999; and 2) Further, Presentacion R. Mahor is ORDERED to pay Bernard B. Benasa PHP 100,000.00 as and by way of Moral and Exemplary damages; and PHP 10,000.00 as attorney's fees."
"G.R. No. 218056, August 31, 2022","REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, REPRESENTED BY THE PRIVATIZATION AND MANAGEMENT OFFICE, PETITIONER, VS. CITY OF SURIGAO, AS REPRESENTED BY CITY MAYOR ERNESTO T. MATUGAS AND CITY TREASURER SARAH P. YAMIT, RESPONDENTS.","Asset Privatization Trust (APT) was created under Proclamation No. 50, series of 1986,[3] to take, for the benefit of the National Government, title to and possession of, conserve, provisionally manage, and dispose of assets that have been identified for privatization. On December 28, 1999, Republic Act (RA) No. 8758[4] was enacted, extending APT's term from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2000.[5] On February 27, 1987, the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) transferred its non-performing assets to APT, including, among others, the account of Nonoc Mining and Industrial Corporation (NMIC). Subsequently, on May 10, 1996, petitioner, through APT, entered into an Amended Restated Definitive Agreement (ARDA) with NMIC and Philnico Mining and Industrial Corporation (PMIC) for the sale to PMIC of the 22,500,000 shares of common stock of NMIC and certain receivables (Tranche B Receivables) of APT from NMIC.[6] On September 27, 1999, petitioner, PMIC [now known as Philnico Industrial Corporation (PIC)], and NMIC [now known as Philnico Processing Corporation (PPC)] executed an Amendment Agreement[7] to revise the ARDA due to a change in the process technology of PPC's nickel refinery from ammonia leach process to acid leach process, and the effects of the economic problems affecting the Asia-Pacific Region on the financing, rehabilitation and operation of the nickel refinery. As a result, some existing facilities of the refinery were rendered redundant. Therefore, instead of negotiating for the corresponding reduction in the acquisition price of PPC's common stock and the receivables, including restructuring the payment terms of its obligation under the ARDA, PTC opted to return the redundant assets to APT with an estimated value of PHP 85,051,200.00.[8] Upon the expiration of APT's term on December 31, 2000 and under RA No. 8758 mandating the transfer of assets held by APT to a trust department of an appropriate government financial institution, former President Joseph Ejercito Estrada issued Executive Order (EO) No. 323[9] dated December 6, 2000, creating the Privatization and Management Office (PMO) under the Department of Finance, which took over the functions of the defunct APT.[10] On June 6, 2006, the redundant assets were declared for real property taxation by the city assessor of Surigao City in accordance with Section 204[11] of the Local Government Code and classified the same as exempt from tax. On May 2, 2011, PMO received a letter[12] from Mayor Ernesto T. Matugas of respondent City Government of Surigao City requesting the payment of alleged outstanding Real Property Tax (RPT) on the redundant assets amounting to PHP 200,739,598.76, inclusive of penalties, as of December 31, 2010 within fifteen (15) days from receipt.[13] The subject redundant assets were then levied under a Notice of Levy issued by the City Treasurer as annotated on the Tax Declaration Nos. I-1500033 to I-1500041 and I-1500045.[14] PMO, through a letter dated June 22, 2011, protested the collection of RPT from the redundant assets as these were exempt, being properties of the government.[15] In turn, City Treasurer Sarah P. Yamit, in a letter[16] dated August 2, 2011, furnished PMO with a copy of the Advertisement of Sale at Public Auction of Delinquent Real Property[17] regarding the scheduled auction sale of the redundant assets at the Office of the City Treasurer on September 19, 2011 from 2:00 to 5:00 p.m.[18] This prompted the petitioner to file a Petition for Prohibition with application for a Temporary Restraining Order and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction[19] before the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 29 of Surigao City. Petitioner insisted that the collection of RPT is without basis because the redundant assets are owned by the Government and, thus, exempt from RPT. On September 15, 2011, the RTC directed the Local Government of Surigao City not to conduct any public bidding until the application for Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) filed by petitioner has been resolved.[20] On June 15, 2012, the RTC issued its Resolution[21] denying petitioner's application for writ of preliminary injunction. The decretal portion reads: WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, petitioner's application for the Writ of Preliminary Injunction is hereby DENIED for lack of legal and factual bases. Respondent City may proceed with the auction sale of the redundant assets subject to the observance of the proper procedures under Section 258 of the Local Government Code. SO ORDERED.[22] On July 5, 2012, petitioner moved to reconsider RTC's adverse ruling.[23] On July 9, 2012, petitioner was able to secure once again a copy of the advertisement for sale, setting the auction sale of the redundant assets on July 16, 2012. Thus, petitioner was constrained to file a petition for certiorari[24] under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court with the CA and withdrew its motion for reconsideration lodged with the RTC, in conformity with the rule against forum shopping.[25] In its Resolution dated July 13, 2012, the CA granted petitioner's prayer for the issuance of a TRO enjoining respondent City ""from further proceeding with, and conducting, the scheduled auction sale of the subject real properties on July 16, 2012."" On November 17, 2014, the CA rendered the assailed Decision[26] denying the Petition for Certiorari solely on technical grounds, i.e., (1) that a motion for reconsideration is a condition sine qua non for the filing of a certiorari petition, which petitioner did not pursue, and (2) that petitioner failed to exhaust administrative remedies in questioning the tax collection on the subject properties by immediately filing the petition for prohibition before the RTC.[27] Petitioner sought to reconsider the assailed Decision, but the CA denied its motion in its Resolution dated April 27, 2015.[28] Hence, the present petition for review on certiorari, with urgent application for an ex-parte temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction.[29] On July 6, 2015, the Court, without necessarily giving due course to the petition, issued a Temporary Restraining Order[30] (TRO) enjoining the City of Surigao, as represented by City Mayor Ernesto Matugas, and the City Treasurer Sarah Yamit, from proceeding with the auction sale of the subject properties covered by the Advertisement and Sale at Public Action of Delinquent Real Property dated June 22, 2012, effective immediately and continuing until further orders from the Court.",We deny the petition. The petition for certiorari questioning the RTC's denial of the application for a writ of injunction was filed in the wrong court.,"Under Section 7(a)(3) of RA No. 1125, as amended by RA No. 9282,[31] the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) has the exclusive appellate jurisdiction over local tax cases, including cases involving real property taxes,[32] decided by the RTC.[33] The CTA's jurisdiction includes the power to issue writs of certiorari over interlocutory orders issued by the RTC in a local tax case.[34] In City of Manila v. Grecia-Cuerdo,[35] the Court ruled that while there is no express grant of power to the CTA to issue writs of certiorari under RA No. 1125, as amended, the Constitution provides, nonetheless, that ""'judicial power shall be vested in one Supreme Court and in such lower courts as may be established by law[;] judicial power includes the duty of the courts of justice to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable, and to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government."" ... Similarly, the instant case primarily involves a tax issue. Petitioner was questioning the denial of its application for a writ of injunction to enjoin the respondents from selling the redundant assets in consequence of its alleged unpaid RPT. In particular, petitioner claimed in its Petition for Prohibition with application for a Temporary Restraining Order and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction[46] that the properties sought to be auctioned are owned by the Government and thus, exempt from the payment of RPT. Being in the nature of a local tax case, the petitioner should have filed the petition with the CTA and not with the CA. The appellate jurisdiction of the CTA is to the exclusion of all other courts.[47] The CA should have dismissed the petitioner's certiorari petition for lack of jurisdiction. Therefore, the CA's decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 04987-MIN is void.","ACCORDINGLY, the petition is DENIED. The Decision dated November 17, 2014 and the Resolution dated April 27, 2015 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 04987-MIN are SET ASIDE. The Petition for Certiorari filed by petitioner with the Court of Appeals assailing the Resolution dated June 15, 2012 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 29 of Surigao City in Special Civil Action No. 7450 is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction. The Temporary Restraining Order dated July 6, 2015 is LIFTED. SO ORDERED."
"A.M. No. RTJ-16-2463 [Formerly A.M. No. 16-05- 110-RTC], August 30, 2022","OFFICE OF THE COURT ADMINISTRATOR, COMPLAINANT, V.S. JUDGE CANDELARIO V. GONZALES,* REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, BRANCH 45, BAIS CITY, RESPONDENT","The administrative complaint stemmed from the Memorandum dated February 20, 2015 of the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) wherein the judicial audit team reported that as of audit date, Branch 45 had a total caseload of 962 active cases, consisting of 649 criminal cases and 313 civil cases. The OCA directed Judge Gonzales to: (a) explain in writing why he should not be administratively charged for gross dereliction of duty, gross inefficiency, gross incompetence, and gross dishonesty; (b) explain why his salaries and allowances should not be withheld for his failure to decide 211 cases submitted for decision, to resolve 71 cases with pending incidents or motions, and to indicate these cases in his Certificates of Service for 2013 and 2014; (c) refrain from acting on manifestations signed by parties without the assistance of counsel; (d) physically conduct the actual inventory of active cases with the Branch Clerk of Court; and (e) submit compliance with the other directives within 30 days from receipt thereof. On March 9, 2015, the OCA further ordered Judge Gonzales to: (1) show cause why he should not be disciplinarily dealt with for issuing orders of inhibition in several cases which were all submitted for decision; and (2) immediately refrain from issuing orders of inhibition involving cases already submitted for decision.","In the assailed Decision dated July 27, 2021, the Court found Judge Gonzales guilty of Gross Misconduct for which he was meted out the penalty of dismissal from the service with forfeiture of all benefits due him, except accrued leave benefits, if any. Further, the Court ordered him to pay a fine in the amount of P35,000.00 for each of the less serious offenses of ( 1 ) Delay in Rendering Decisions and ( 2 ) Making Untruthful Statements in his Certificates of Service and Docket Inventory.","The Court partially grants the plea of Judge Gonzales to reconsider the Decision dated July 27, 2021. The Court notes that Judge Gonzales had served in the government service for almost 40 years and 17 years of which were devoted to the Judiciary. Since 2013, Judge Gonzales had suffered multiple lingering illnesses which constrained him to apply for early retirement in 2019. His demonstration of remorse, along with his medical condition, compels the Court to mitigate Judge Gonzales' penalty. Considering that Judge Gonzales had already retired from the service, the only alternative left for the Court is to impose the penalty of Fine. The Court deems the penalty of Fine in the amount of P400,000.00 to be proper to answer for the following infractions: (1) gross misconduct for his submission of a false monthly report and docket inventory; (2) undue delay in rendering decisions; and (3) making untruthful statements in his certificates of service.","WHEREFORE, the Court resolves to PARTIALLY GRANT the Motion for Reconsideration of Judge Candelario V. Gonzales. Respondent Judge Candelario V. Gonzales is meted out the penalty of Fine in the amount of P400,000.00. The Court ORDERS the Financial Management Office to compute and release his retirement benefits less the amount of P400,000.00. Further, his disqualification from reemployment in any branch, agency, or instrumentality of the government, including government-owned or controlled corporations is LIFTED. SO ORDERED."

ALZONA, IN HER CAPACITY AS OFFICER-IN-CHARGE, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF PSALM, AND THE CONCERNED OFFICERS OF PSALM, PETITIONERS, VS. COMMISSION ON AUDIT, RESPONDENT.","On June 8, 2001, Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9136 (EPIRA Law) was signed into law. [6] It provided a framework for the restructuring of the electric power industry... To further these objectives, PSALM was created under the said law... Pursuant to its mandate, PSALM, through its then President and Chief Executive Officer Jose C. Ibazeta (Ibazeta), entered into contracts with Atty. Michael B. Tantoco (Atty. Tantoco), Atty. Angelita C. Imperio (Atty. Imperio), Atty. Jay Angelo N. Anastacio (Atty. Anastacio), Atty. Maria Belen M. Nera (Atty. Nera) and John T.K. Yeap (Yeap) for consultancy services... for a period of six months... As a consequence of the change in the appointing authority of PSALM [due to Ibazeta's appointment as DOE Secretary], it considered the aforestated contracts for consultancy services terminated on even date [10]... Thus, on April 5, 2010, PSALM, under the authority of Maria Luz L. Caminero, its Officer-in-Charge (OIC), renewed the contracts [13] of Attys. Tantoco, Imperio, Anastacio Nera and Yeap for another six months. [14] In the meantime, on March 15, 2010, the Legal Services Sector, Office of the General Counsel of the COA rendered Opinion No. 2010-020 [15] which stated that PSALM's engagement of foreign and local private lawyers as consultants for the period July 2007 to April 2010 was covered by Memorandum Circular No. 9 (M.C. No. 9) dated August 27, 1998 of the Office of the President and COA Circular No. 95-011 dated December 4, 1995. Thus, before the engagement of the consultants' services, the prior written conformity of the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) or the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel (OGCC), and the concurrence of COA must first be obtained... On April 22, 2010, in compliance with the directive of ATL Molina, PSALM forwarded the contract renewals... to the OGCC for its review and conformity. [18] On May 6, 2010, the OGCC issued Contract Review No. 135, Series of 2010 [19] expressing its conformity to the subject contract renewals... On August 5, 2010, PSALM sought the concurrence of COA to the said contract renewals... On January 12, 2011, COA General Counsel issued LRR No. 2011-004 [23] denying the request of PSALM for concurrence... In a letter dated March 17, 2011, PSALM asked the COA General Counsel to reconsider the denial of its request for concurrence... On July 18, 2014, COA issued Decision No. 2014-136 [26] affirming LRR No. 2011-004; and thereby denying concurrence to PSALM's renewal of consultancy contracts and disallowing in audit the payments... On April 6, 2015, COA issued Decision No. 2015-159 [30] denying PSALM's motion for reconsideration for lack of merit... Additionally, it relieved the legal advisors of PSALM from refunding the compensations they received for actual legal services rendered, but it held liable the persons responsible for the expenditures pursuant to Section 104 of Presidential Decree No. 1445 (P.D.), or the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines. [32] Hence, the present Petition.","WHEREFORE, premised considered, the motion for reconsideration of Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation, through counsels, Makati City, is hereby DENIED for lack of merit. Accordingly, Commission on Audit Decision No. 2014-136 dated July 18, 2014, which sustained Legal Retainer Review No. 2011-004 dated January 12, 2011, denying concurrence on the renewal contracts of PSALM's legal advisors for the year 2010, is AFFIRMED WITH FINALITY. Further, the Audit Team Leader is hereby directed to issue a Notice of Disallowance on the payments of services of the legal advisors.","In the case at hand, records undoubtedly show that despite the necessity of obtaining COA's prior concurrence to the contract renewal of the subject legal advisors, PSALM bypassed such requirement... However, in denying concurrence to the said contract renewals and disallowing the resultant disbursement pursuant to the subject consultancy contracts, COA failed to provide for a detailed explanation along with substantial justifications why the subject renewal of legal consultancy contracts were ""unreasonable"" or ""extravagant"" within the context of the Constitution... any violation of the required pre-audit process cannot be in itself a proper justification to withhold concurrence to the hiring of legal advisors or the renewal of their contracts. It is the expenditure itself, whether proposed or consummated — not the process of securing the necessary approval of key government agencies — that is the proper subject of COA's audit jurisdiction to safeguard against ""irregular, unnecessary, excessive, extravagant, or unconscionable expenditures or uses of government funds and properties."" [95] ... Having failed to do so, COA gravely abused its discretion when it withheld giving its concurrence to the contract renewals of the subject legal advisors despite the inadequacy of the quantum of proof tending to establish such unreasonableness, excessiveness or extravagance, and disallowing in audit disbursements made by reason of the said contracts. In the absence of such findings, the renewal for the contract of PSALM's legal advisors and/or consultants must be deemed as concurred in by the COA.","WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing premises, the Court GRANTS the Petition for Certiorari and SETS ASIDE the July 18, 2014 Decision in Decision No. 2014-136 and April 6, 2015 Resolution in Decision No. 2015-159 of the Commission on Audit.

Imperio, Atty. Jay Angelo N. Anastacio, Atty. Maria Belen M. Nera, and Mr. John T.K. Yeap is deemed concurred in by the Commission on Audit. Accordingly, payments for the services actually rendered by the above-named legal advisors and/or consultants under the service contracts that were renewed and subject of this case shall be allowed in audit.

"G.R. No. 226680, August 30, 2022","ACES PHILIPPINES CELLULAR SATELLITE CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. THE COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, RESPONDENT","In 1995, the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT) entered into a Gateway Agreement with PT Asia Cellular Satellite (Aces Indonesia), a company organized under the laws of Indonesia, ""for the supply of certain equipment, software, data and documentation [to allow PLDT] to construct, own and operate a [g]ateway or [g]ateways in the Philippines."" In the same year, Aces Philippines was incorporated as PLDT's subsidiary to operate telecommunication gateways and equipment involving the processing, storage, monitoring, and retrieval of data, image, voice, audio, and tone. Subsequently, on March 12, 1997, PLDT entered into another agreement with Aces Indonesia. The contract, denominated as the Founder NSP Air Time Purchase Agreement (Air Time Purchase Agreement)... A year later, or in 1998, the original parties to the Air Time Purchase Agreement transferred their rights and obligations under the contract to third parties, viz.: (a) Aces Indonesia transferred in favor of Aces International Limited, a company incorporated in Bermuda (Aces Bermuda), and (b) PLDT transferred to its subsidiary, herein petitioner Aces Philippines. After the transfer, effectively, Aces Philippines had the authority to operate telecommunications gateways and related equipment within the Aces System, as well as the exclusive authority to provide Aces Services to its Philippine subscribers. In 2007, the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) commenced its audit of Aces Philippines' books of account and other accounting records in relation to all internal revenue taxes for taxable year 2006. The tax authorities found that Aces Philippines paid Aces Bermuda satellite air time fees amounting to Pl99,312,169.00 in 2006 but did not withhold the proper amount of tax. According to the BIR, these satellite airtime fees are income payments to a non-resident foreign corporation (NRFC) that are subject to 35% FWT. Aces Philippines protested the findings at the administrative level. However, the CIR issued the FDDA against Aces Philippines relative to the deficiency FWT for taxable year 2006 amounting to P170,935,184.92, inclusive of surcharge, interest, and compromise penalty.","In sum, the satellite air time fee payments to Aces Bermuda constitute income from sources within the Philippines. Thus, the CIR correctly assessed Aces Philippines for deficiency FWT for its failure to withhold the proper amount of tax from its income payments to Aces Bermuda. That Aces Philippines was liable for said deficiency also gave rise to its liability for the additions to tax (e.g., surcharge, deficiency interest, and delinquency interest) under the 1997 Tax Code. Consequently, the CTA En Banc did not commit any error in upholding the assessment, only that the computation of interests shall be modified in accordance with the amendments introduced by the TRAIN Law, as implemented by Revenue Regulations No. 21-2018.","The Decision dated June 8, 2016 and the Resolution dated August 16, 2016 of the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc in CTA EB Case No. 1242 (CTA Case No. 8567) are AFFIRMED WITH MODIFICATION relative to interest computation, in that Petitioner Aces Philippines is ORDERED TO PAY the following: (a) deficiency interest at the rate of 20% per annum on the basic deficiency final withholding tax of P69,759,259.15 computed from January 10, 2007 until December 31, 2017 pursuant to Section 249(B) of the 1997 Tax Code; (b) delinquency interest at the rate of 20% per annum on the total amount of P87,199,073.94 and on the 20% deficiency interest which have accrued as aforestated in paragraph (a), computed from October 3, 2012 until December 31, 2017 pursuant to Section 249(C) of the 1997 Tax Code; and (c) delinquency interest at the rate of 12% per annum on the unpaid amount (i.e., basic tax plus surcharge and interests computed in paragraphs (a) and (b)) computed from January 1, 2018 until full payment thereof, pursuant to Section 249(C)(3) of the 1997 Tax Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 1 0963.","WHEREFORE, the instant petition is DISMISSED.

PEREZ, SHERIFF IV, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT OF OLONGAPO CITY, BRANCH 74, RESPONDENTS.","Three administrative cases were filed against respondent, docketed as A.M. Nos. RTJ-07-2063, RTJ-07-2064, and RTC-07-2066, which the Court consolidated. x x x A.M. No. RTJ-07-2063 pertained to the administrative complaint filed by the Republic of the Philippines (Republic), through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), alleging that respondent committed gross ignorance of the law, manifest partiality, and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service. The complaint stemmed from respondent's issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction, which enjoined the implementation of Section 6 of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9334 that subjected the applicants in Civil Case No. 102-0-05, an action for declaratory relief entitled 'Indigo Distribution Corp., Inc. v. The Hon. Secretary of Finance,' to the payment of sin taxes and excise taxes on tobacco and alcohol products. In A.M. No. RTJ-07-2064, the Commissioner of Customs charged respondent with gross ignorance of the law, manifest partiality, and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service. The complaint stemmed from respondent's issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction, which enjoined the implementation of a customs personnel order (CPO) issued by the Commissioner of Customs and approved by the Secretary of Finance. In the subject CPO, the applicant, Andres Salvacion, then the District Collector of the Port of Subic, was reassigned to the port of Cagayan de Oro and another customs officer was designated as Acting District Collector of Subic. Finally, in A.M. No. RTC-07-2066, complainant Charles T. Burns, Jr. (Charles) charged respondent with grave misconduct for the latter's issuance of a writ of execution in favor of the adverse party in Civil Case No. 77-0-97, entitled 'Mary Agnes Burns v. Spouses Juan C. Beltran,' for recovery of ownership and possession over several parcels of land, placing the adverse party in possession of the said properties. In its June 26, 2009 Decision, the Court found respondent guilty in all the above administrative cases. x x x Before this Court is a Petition for Judicial Clemency filed by former Judge Ramon S. Caguioa (respondent), praying that he be reinstated as a Regional Trial Court (RTC) Judge; that the whole period of his dismissal be considered and treated as suspension without pay; and that his retirement and other relevant benefits as a Judge be fully restored.",The Court finds the petition partially meritorious.,"Applying the foregoing, the Court finds that the petition for judicial clemency of respondent is partly meritorious. In its March 16, 2021 Resolution, the Court referred the petition for judicial clemency to the Commission. After performing its necessary mandate, the Commission issued its February 10, 2022 Report and Recommendation, which contained its evaluation of the petition. The dispositive portion of the said report states that the petition for judicial clemency should be granted. The Court partially agrees and adopts the findings of fact of the Commission. x x x The Court finds that the lifting of his disqualification from reemployment in any branch, agency, or instrumentality of the government, including government-owned or controlled corporations is in order because respondent proved that he was remorseful, reformed, and had made reconciliation through his public apology. Further, considering respondent's mental aptitude and acquired skills, it cannot be doubted that he could still be of service to the government in some other capacity. x x x However, the Court cannot restore the forfeited retirement benefits of respondent. For one, respondent has not yet reached the mandatory age of retirement for the Judiciary. x x x Likewise, respondent's petition is utterly lacking of any allegation of any exigent circumstances, such as whether respondent is undergoing any economic difficulties, that may necessitate the Court's act of mercy in the granting him financial aid in the form of releasing his retirement benefits in whole or in part. Accordingly, the Court does not presently find sufficient justification to restore respondent's forfeited retirement benefits.","WHEREFORE, the Petition for Judicial Clemency is PARTIALLY GRANTED. Respondent Ramon S. Caguioa's disqualification from reemployment in any branch, agency, or instrumentality of the government, including government-owned or controlled corporations is LIFTED. Respondent's prayers that he be reinstated as a Regional Trial Court Judge, that the whole period of his dismissal be considered and treated as suspension without pay, and that his retirement benefits as a Judge be fully restored are DENIED. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 252791, August 23, 2022","DR. ULYSSES TROCIO Y MENDOZA, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","Petitioner was charged with Child Abuse through Lascivious Conduct defined and penalized under Section 5(6), Article III of RA 7610 under the following Information: 'That on or about 12th day of June, 2015, in xxxxxxxxxxx, Philippines, the above-named accused, with intent to abuse, degrade or arouse or gratify his sexual desire did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously, by means of inducement, enticement, force or coercion, commit sexual abuse and lascivious conduct against one AAA, a minor, 15 years of age (born March 16, 2001), by then and there fondling her breasts, touching her private parts, and kissing her on her neck, thereby subjecting her to child abuse which debases, degrades or demands her intrinsic worth and dignity as a human being, to the damage and prejudice of the said AAA. Contrary to law.' Upon arraignment, petitioner pleaded 'not guilty.' The prosecution presented AAA, who testified that on June 12, 2015, while consulting petitioner for ear pain, he instructed her friend to wait downstairs. Upstairs, petitioner asked her to lie down, applied 'agua' which caused numbness, then held her face with his right hand and used his left hand to fondle her breast and touch her genitals. As she left, he kissed her neck, gave her P200.00, and told her not to report it. She later reported the incident in 2016. Petitioner admitted AAA was a patient and was in his clinic on June 12, 2015, but claimed he only reminded her of an unpaid balance from a previous consultation (May 2015) and denied taking advantage of her. His wife, Dr. Greta Trocio, corroborated that he was in the clinic and saw AAA briefly go upstairs.","The RTC convicted petitioner of violation of Section 5(b), Article III of RA 7610, sentencing him to eight years (8) years and one (1) day of prision mayor as minimum to seventeen (17) years and 4 months and one (1) day of reclusion temporal as maximum, plus damages. The CA affirmed the conviction but modified the monetary awards, sentencing him to the indeterminate penalty of imprisonment of eight (8) years and one (1) day of prision mayor, as minimum, to seventeen (17) years, four (4) months and one (1) day of reclusion temporal as maximum, and ordered him to pay PhP20,000.00 as civil indemnity, PhP15,000.00 as moral damages, PhP15,000.00 as exemplary damages, and PhP15,000.00 as fine.","The Court affirms petitioner's conviction with modification as to the penalty and damages. Settled is the rule that the trial court's factual findings on the credibility of witnesses are accorded the highest weight and respect by this Court. All the elements of Lascivious Conduct under Section 5(b), Article III of RA 7610 are present. Petitioner's act of fondling and kissing AAA's breasts could not have signified any other intention but one having lewd or indecent design. The Court found that petitioner employed force and intimidation upon AAA by inducing, enticing, forcing or coercing AAA, who was expecting a medical treatment, as she was lying helplessly in a medical chair upon the latter's order. Petitioner forced his hands into AAA's private parts while she was under medication and was experiencing numbness on her face. Petitioner's bare denial of the allegations against him must fail considering the detailed, consistent, and categorical testimony of the witnesses.","WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED. The Decision dated December 2, 2019 and Resolution dated June 25, 2020 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 41352 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. Petitioner Dr. Ulysses M. Trocio is found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Lascivious Conduct under Section 5(6), Article III of Republic Act No. 7610. He is sentenced to suffer the indeterminate penalty of imprisonment of ten (10) years and one (1) day of prision mayor, as minimum, to seventeen (17) years, four (4) months, and one (1) day of reclusion temporal, as maximum. He is also ORDERED to pay AAA the amounts of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity, P50,000.00 as moral damages, and P50,000.00 as exemplary damages, and a fine of P15,000.00. The monetary awards shall earn legal interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the date of finality of this Decision until fully paid. SO ORDERED."

Calisay engaged the services of respondent Atty. Toradio R. Esplana for an Unlawful Detainer case. Respondent Esplana filed the Answer eight (8) days late, leading the MTC to expunge the Answer and rule against Calisay. On appeal, Calisay engaged respondent Atty. Mary Grace A. Checa-Hinojosa. After losing in the RTC and CA, the CA denied reconsideration on August 29, 2013. Complainant alleged that respondent Checa-Hinojosa received the resolution on September 12, 2013, but informed him only on November 12, 2013, resulting in the lapse of the period to appeal before the Supreme Court. Respondent Esplana claimed the delay in filing the Answer was because complainant was in Bicol and failed to sign the pleading on time. Respondent Checa-Hinojosa claimed her clerk/mother received the resolution while she was at a seminar and failed to inform her because the mother left for Hong Kong.","The IBP Commissioner found respondent Esplana guilty of negligence under Rule 18.03 of the CPR, and respondent Checa-Hinojosa guilty of violating Rule 18.04 of the CPR, recommending six (6) months suspension for both. The IBP Board of Governors later partially granted reconsideration, recommending that the respondents be reprimanded, considering it was their first offense and they appeared to be in good faith. The Supreme Court adopted the findings of the IBP except as to its recommendation of penalty for respondent Checa-Hinojosa, finding her excuse insufficient to justify the lesser penalty of reprimand.","The Court ruled that the relationship between a lawyer and his client is fiduciary, requiring the lawyer to serve with competence and diligence and keep the client informed of case status (Rules 18.03 and 18.04 of the CPR).

RACOMA, PRESIDING JUDGE, BRANCH 39, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, DAET, CAMARINES NORTE, RESPONDENT.","In July 2015, an administrative charge against Punong Barangay Leslie B. Esturas (Punong Barangay Esturas) and Barangay Kagawad Moises Delos Santos, Jr. (Barangay Kagawad Delos Santos) was filed before the Sangguniang Bayan of Capalong, Camarines Norte (Sangguniang Bayan). [2] On 30 July 2015, Municipal Mayor Senandro M. Jalgalado (Mayor Jalgalado) issued Memorandum Order No. 2015-02, [3] which approved the recommendation of the Sangguniang Bayan placing Punong Barangay Esturas and Barangay Kagawad Delos Santos under a 60-day preventive suspension from office. [4] Eventually, Punong Barangay Esturas and Barangay Kagawad Delos Santos appealed Memorandum Order No. 2015-02 of the Sangguniang Bayan to the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Camarines Norte ( Sangguniang Panlalawigan ). [5] Attached to the appeal was a complaint [6] against the Sangguniang Bayan and Mayor Jalgalado. [7] On 28 July 2016, the Sangguniang Panlalawigan granted the appeal filed by Punong Barangay Esturas and Barangay Kagawad Delos Santos and ordered their reinstatement. [8] Mayor Jalgalado did not implement the decision of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan reasoning that the same is void considering that the Governor of Camarines Norte, Governor Edgardo A. Tallado ( Governor Tallado ), was under preventive suspension at that time and had no authority to approve and enforce the decision of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan. [9] On 18 December 2018, the Sangguniang Panlalawigan issued Resolution No. 627-2018, [10] recommending to Governor Tallado the preventive suspension of Mayor Jalgalado for sixty (60) days because of Mayor Jalgalado' s defiance of the decision of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan to reinstate Punong Barangay Esturas and Barangay Kagawad Delos Santos [11] On 19 December 2018, Governor Tallado issued a Notice of Preventive Suspension [12] against Mayor Jalgalado. [13] Aggrieved, Mayor Jalgalado filed a Petition for Certiorari , Prohibition, and Mandamus with a Prayer for the Issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order and a Writ of Preliminary Injunction, [14] which was docketed as Special Civil Case No. 8374 of Branch 41, Regional Trial Court, Daet, Camarines Norte ( Branch 41 ), presided by Judge Arniel A. Dating ( Judge Dating ). [15] On 9 January 2019, Branch 41 issued an Order [16] granting the application of Mayor Jalgalado for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction, and ordered the Sangguniang Panlalawigan and Governor Tallado to cease from implementing Resolution No. 627-2018, which ordered the preventive suspension of Mayor Jalgalado. [17] On 24 January 2019, Branch 41 issued another Order [18] making permanent the writ of preliminary injunction that it issued on 9 January 2019. [19] In the same Order, Branch 41 lifted the prohibition against further proceedings in Administrative Case No. 01-2015. [20] On 11 February 2019, Mayor Jalgalado filed a motion [21] with the Sangguniang Panlalawigan for the suspension of the investigation in Administrative Case No. 01-2015, citing Section 62-C of the Local Government Code, which prohibits the investigation of an elective official in an administrative complaint within 90 days prior to a local election, and providing that a preventive suspension imposed, prior to the 90-day period immediately preceding local elections, shall be deemed automatically lifted upon the start of the aforesaid period. [22] The motion was, however, denied by the Sangguniang Panlalawigan which resolved to proceed with the administrative investigation of the complaint. [23] On 15 March 2019, the Sangguniang Panlalawigan issued a Decision [24] in the Complaint filed by Punong Barangay Esturas and Barangay Kagawad Delos Santos, Administrative Case No. 01-2015, finding Mayor Jalgalado guilty of Grave Abuse of Authority and imposing upon him the penalty of suspension from office for a period of six (6) months. [25] To implement the Decision of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan, Governor Tallado filed an Application for Request for Exemption from the Ban on Suspension [26] under Section 62 (c) of the Election Code, with the Commission on Elections ( COMELEC ), which granted the application of Governor Tallado for exemption for the preventive suspension of Mayor Jalgalado. [27] On 4 April 2019, Governor Tallado issued a Notice of Suspension as Penalty [28] against Mayor Jalgalado, implementing the Decision of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan to suspend the latter. [29] Aggrieved, Mayor Jalgalado filed a Petition for Certiorari , Prohibition, and Mandmus with a Prayer for Issuance of a Writ of Preliminary Injunction and an Urgent Prayer for an Ex Parte 72-hour Temporary Restraining Order, [30] assailing the 15 March 2019 Decision of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan and the Notice of Suspension as Penalty issued by Governor Tallado. [31] Impleaded in the Petition were Governor Tallado and the Presiding Officer and the Members of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan. [32] The case was docketed as Civil Case No. 8403 and was raffled to Branch 41, presided by Judge Dating, but it was re-raffled to Branch 39, Regional Trial Court, Daet, Camarines Norte ( Branch 39 ), presided by respondent Judge Winston S. Racoma ( Judge Racoma ), after Judge Dating inhibited from the case. [33] Governor Tallado and the Sangguniang Panlalawigan filed a Manifestation with Motion for Inhibition and Comment on the Petition, [34] praying for the dismissal of the Petition on the ground that, among others, it is the Court of Appeals, and not the Regional Trial Court, that has jurisdiction over the case. [35] During the hearing on 23 April 2019, the parties opted to no longer present any evidence and merely adopted their Comment and other pleadings, and submitted the Petition for the resolution of the court. [36] On 25 April 2019, Judge Racoma issued an Order, [37] granting the prayer for a writ of preliminary injunction of Mayor Jalgalado. The dispositive portion of the Order reads: WHEREFORE, finding that the petitioner is bound to suffer grave and irreparable injury if the penalty of six-month (sic) suspension, as ordered in the March 15, 2019 Decision of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan in Administrative Case No. 01-2015, will be enforced, the Court hereby grants the application for a preliminary injunction. Let a Writ of Preliminary Injuction issue. The petitioner is hereby ordered to file an Injunction Bond in the amount of One Hundred Thousand (PhP100,000.00) Pesos. SO ORDERED. [38] In granting the prayer for issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction, Judge Racoma underscored that the gravest consideration under the circumstances is the well-being of the constituents of Mayor Jalgalado. [39] He found that the penalty of suspension for the period of six (6) months imposed by the Sangguniang Panlalawigan on Mayor Jalgalado will strip Mayor Jalgalado of his rights and obligations to carry out the duty of his office and to serve his constituents. [40] Note that the suspension order against Mayor Jalgalado fell within the 90-day period before the 2019 Local Elections. On 26 April 2019, Judge Racoma issued an Order [41] granting the Motion for Inhibition [42] filed by Governor Tallado and the Sangguniang Panlalawigan. In recusing himself from further participating in the case, Judge Racoma held that while the motion fell short of demonstrating that he manifested arbitrariness or prejudice as to cloud his partiality in issuing the writ of preliminary injunction, he was voluntarily inhibiting from further trying and deciding the case. [43] Instead of filing a motion for reconsideration of the 25 April 2019 Order of Judge Racoma and notwithstanding his inhibition from the case, Governor Tallado and the Sangguniang Panlalawigan filed this administrative case for Gross Ignorance of the Law and Procedure and Gross Misconduct against Judge Racoma. [44] Essentially, Camarines Norte Governor Edgardo A. Tallado, Vice Governor Jonah Pedro P. Pimentel, and Board Members Rodolfo V. Gache, Stanley B. Alegre, Renee F. Herrera, Gerardo G. Quinones, Reynor V. Quibral, Erwin L. Lausin, Artemio B. Serdon, Jr., Jay G. Pimentel, and Ramon R. Baning (collectively, the Complainants ), in their Verified Complaint, alleged that Judge Racoma committed gross ignorance of the law and procedure when he took cognizance of the Petition for Certiorari filed by Mayor Jalgalado, docketed as Civil Case No. 8403. [45] The Complainants argued that it is the Court of Appeals which has jurisdiction over the Petition and not the Regional Trial Court. [46] The Complainants further averred that granting arguendo that the RTC has jurisdiction over the Petition for Certiorari filed by Mayor Jalgalado, it was gross ignorance of the law and procedure for Judge Racoma to act on the same considering that no motion for reconsideration of the Decision of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan was filed by Mayor Jalgalado. [47]","The Court rejects the recommendation of the JIB, and dismisses the charge of gross ignorance of the law against Judge Racoma.","The Complainants failed to avail of the appropriate judicial remedies under applicable rules An administrative complaint is not the appropriate remedy for every act of a judge deemed aberrant or irregular where a judicial remedy is available. [59] The acts of a judge in his judicial capacity are not subject to disciplinary action. [60] A judge cannot be civilly, criminally, or administratively liable for his official acts, no matter how erroneous, provided he acts in good faith. [61] The Complainants wrongly filed the present administrative case against Judge Racoma, as it is settled that an administrative complaint is not an appropriate remedy where judicial recourse is still available, such as a motion for reconsideration, an appeal, or a petition for certiorari . [62] The inquiry into the correctness of Judge Racoma's act of taking cognizance of the Petition for Certiorari filed by Mayor Jalgalado, docketed as Civil Case No. 8403, is undeniably judicial in nature and which is best settled through the available appropriate judicial remedies under the Rules of Court, and not by way of an administrative complaint. Errors committed by a judge in the exercise of his or her adjudicative functions cannot be corrected through administrative proceedings, but should instead be assailed through available judicial remedies. [63] It is well-settled that disciplinary proceedings and criminal actions against judges are not complementary or suppletory to, nor a substitute for, these judicial remedies, whether ordinary or extraordinary. [64] For, obviously, if subsequent developments prove the judge's challenged act to be correct, there would be no occasion to proceed against him at all. [65] Besides, to hold a judge administratively accountable for every erroneous ruling or decision he renders, assuming he has erred, would be nothing short of harassment and would make his position doubly unbearable. [66] To hold otherwise would be to render judicial office untenable, for no one called upon to try the facts or interpret the law in the process of administering justice can be infallible in his judgment. [67] It is only where the error is tainted with bad faith, fraud, malice, or dishonesty that administrative sanctions may be imposed against the erring judge. [68] In the oft-cited case of Flores v. Abesamis, [69] the Court explained: As everyone knows, the law provides ample judicial remedies against errors or irregularities being committed by a Trial Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction. The ordinary remedies against errors or irregularities which may be regarded as normal in nature (i.e., error in appreciation or admission of evidence, or in construction or application of procedural or substantive law or legal principle) include a motion for reconsideration (or after rendition of a judgment or final order, a motion for new trial), and appeal. The extraordinary remedies against error or irregularities which may be deemed extraordinary in character (i.e., whimsical, capricious, despotic exercise of power or neglect of duty, etc.) are inter alia the special civil actions of certiorari, prohibition or mandamus, or a motion for inhibition, a petition for change of venue, as the case may be. Now the established doctrine and policy is that disciplinary proceedings and criminal actions against Judges are not complementary or suppletory of, nor a substitute for, these judicial remedies, whether ordinary or extraordinary. Resort to and exhaustion of these judicial remedies, as well as the entry of judgment in the corresponding action or proceeding, are pre-requisites for the taking of other measures against the persons of the judges concerned, whether of civil, administrative, or criminal nature. It is only after the available judicial remedies have been exhausted and the appellate tribunals have spoken with finality, that the door to an inquiry into his criminal, civil or administrative liability may be said to have opened, or closed. Flores resorted to administrative prosecution (or institution of criminal actions) as a substitute for or supplement to the specific modes of appeal or review provided by law from court judgments or orders, on the theory that the Judges' orders had caused him 'undue injury.' This is impermissible, as this Court had already more than once ruled. Law and logic decree that 'administrative or criminal remedies are neither alternative nor cumulative to judicial review where such review is available, and must wait on the result thereof' xxx Indeed, since judges must be free to judge, without pressure or influence from external forces or factors, they should not be subject to intimidation, the fear of civil, criminal or administrative sanctions for acts they may do and dispositions they may make in the performance of their duties and functions; and it is sound rule, which must be recognized independently of statute, that judges are not generally liable for acts done within the scope of their jurisdiction and in good faith; and that exceptionally, prosecution of a judge can be had only if 'there be a final declaration by a competent court in some appropriate proceeding of the manifestly unjust character of the challenged judgment or order, and... also evidence of malice or bad faith, ignorance of inexcusable negligence, on the part of the judge in rendering said judgment or order ' or under the stringent circumstances set out in Article 32 of the Civil Code. (underscoring supplied, citations omitted) Considering that the administrative complaint filed by the Complainants pertains to the exercise of Judge Racoma's adjudicative functions, the Complainants should have first exhausted judicial remedies instead of immediately resorting to administrative proceedings. In any case, whether Judge Racoma gravely abused his discretion or otherwise erred in taking cognizance of the Petition for Certiorari filed by Mayor Jalgalado, docketed as Civil Case No. 8403, does not necessarily translate to an administrative violation unless there is a clear showing of bad faith on his part. [70] Basic is the rule that mere allegation is not equivalent to proof, and charges based on mere suspicion, speculation or conclusion cannot be given credence. [71] In administrative disciplinary proceedings, the Court must consider the entire context of the case Our judges do not perform their judicial duties in a vacuum. They, like us, assume their role in society and, as such, necessarily interact and relate with other members of their communities. The Court takes judicial notice that Judge Racoma is up against powerful individuals whom we can assume wield great power and influence in his place of work. This is not the first case filed against Judge Racoma by the Complainants as there are other administrative cases that have been filed against him by the same or related individuals: Complainant Docket Number Docket Date Charges Status 1.) Hon. Josefina B. Tallado 21-086- RTJ 18 November 2021 Gross Ignorance of the Law or Procedure Pending 2.) Vice Governor Joseph Christopher Pantones, et al. 20-5083- RTJ 23 October 2020 Ignorance of the Law and Procedure, and Gross Misconduct Pending 3.) Governor Edgardo A. Tallado RTJ-18- 2536 (15- 4396- RTJ) 7May 2015 and 2 October 2018 Gross Ignorance of the Law and Procedure, Violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct Fined P 11,000.00 with Stern Warning The Court likewise takes note that Judge Racoma is not the only judge who has been sued by the politicians in his province. The Executive Judge, Judge Arniel A. Dating, the Presiding Judge of Branch 41 of the RTC of Daet, Camarines Norte, has also been named a respondent in several cases filed by Complainants Tallado, et al . [72] Judge Dating was the first judge who acted in the case subject matter of this Petition until he inhibited and the case was re­ raffled to Judge Racoma, and Tallado, et al. filed the present administrative charge against him as a result. There are only three (3) RTC Judges in Daet, Camarines Norte, and one (1) Family Court Judge. It should concern the Court that the Complainants, for this one case, had already 'eliminated' and sued two (2) of the judges in the station, leaving only one more to act on it. This kind of situation is to be decried, though not uncommon. The influence of both elective and appointive officials on our judges is a fact we must not close our eyes to. We have our Code of Judicial Conduct to guide us in navigating the tenuous balance in our relations with the officials from the two other branches of government. However, not even the Code can protect our judicial frontliners from the hardships occasioned by discordant and moreso openly adversarial relations with the said officials. Unfortunately, the filing of administrative charges against our judges has been unscrupulously resorted to. Whereas, the members of this Court are no less vulnerable, we must acknowledge that our judges have to literally face and live in the midst of this unhealthy environment, day in and day out. Certainly, in discharging the Court's duty of supervision, we must take these matters into account, specially so in deciding administrative cases which may have been actuated by obviously long-standing strained relations, if not outright animosity. The JIB failed to consider the badges of harassment attendant in this case The Court must be ever vigilant in protecting judges and justices against administrative cases filed against them that are meant solely to harass, embarrass, or vex them. Recently, the Court promulgated issuances intended to protect judges and justices against harassment suits. Rule X, Sections I and 2 of the Internal Rules of the JIB, [73] provide: RULE X SPECIAL PROVISIONS ON DISCIPLINARY CASES Section 1. Action Filed Before Compulsory Retirement. - If a disciplinary action is filed with the JIB within six (6) months before the compulsory retirement of the respondent for an alleged cause of action that occurred at least one (1) year prior to the filing of the complaint, and shown prima facie that it is intended to harass and embarrass the respondent, the JIB shall recommend to the Supreme Court that the complaint be dismissed and that the complainant be cited for indirect contempt. xxx Section 2. Complaint Filed by a Lawyer. - If the complainant is a lawyer and it is shown that the disciplinary action is intended to harass and embarrass the respondent, the JIB shall dismiss the complaint and require the complainant to show case why he or she should not be administratively sanctioned as a member of the Philippine Bar and as an officer of the Court and recommend the referral of the matter to the Office of the Bar Confidant and the Integrated Bar of the Philippines for proceedings under Rule 139-B of the Rules of Court, as amended. Corrolarily, Section 3(2) of Rule 140, as further amended, [74] provides: SECTION 3. Initial Action. -- xxx (2) Proceedings Initiated By Complaint. - xxx If the verified or anonymous complaint is not sufficient in form and substance, it shall be dismissed. Moreover, if the complaint prima facie appears to be baseless and was filed only to harass or embarrass the respondent, or to unduly delay the release of retirement benefits in case of his or her impending compulsory retirement, the complainant shall be required to show cause why he or she should not be cited in contempt. Furthermore, if the complainant is a lawyer, he or she shall also be required to show cause why he or she should not be administratively sanctioned as a member of the Philippine Bar and as an officer of the Court. Despite these issuances, however, the JIB itself failed to take notice of and to consider the badges that indicate that the Complaint filed against Judge Racoma was intended to harass and vex the latter. The Court thus deems it proper to remind the JIB that in evaluating administrative complaints before it, it is not just the allegations in a complaint that must be evaluated. It is incumbent upon the JIB to appreciate such allegations in the context surrounding the complaint and the parties involved. Here, Judge Racoma himself unerringly alleged that the complaint was a 'threat or harassment suit.' [75] He also categorically called attention to the fact that he has been a victim of suits 'tainted with political color.' [76] Thus, to safeguard against the abuse of the administrative disciplinary mechanism against justices, judges, and court personnel, the JIB must be guided by the following rules in evaluating administrative disciplinary cases: (1) If a judicial remedy is still available to the complainant, the administrative complaint shall be dismissed outright, without prejudice to re-filing should the complainant succeed in a judicial action in proving that the public respondent's assailed act or omission was indeed wrong and ill motivated. (2) If the administrative case is meant to harass, threaten or merely vex the public respondent. the same shall be dismissed. In determining this, the following factors may be considered: (a) the existence of other cases filed against the public respondent by the same complainant or related complainants; (b) the position and influence of the complainant, particularly in the locality where the public respondent is stationed; (c) the number of times that the public respondent has been charged administratively and the corresponding dispositions in these cases; (d) any decisions or judicial actions previously rendered by the public respondent for or against the complainant; (e) the propensity of the complainant for filing administrative cases against members and personnel of the Judiciary; and (f) any other factor indicative of improper pressure or influence. The JIB is reminded to treat with the same careful consideration as any accusation of wrongdoing against anyone under its jurisdiction, allegations of harassment and filing of malicious and baseless charges. The Complainants are directed to show cause why they should not he cited for indirect contempt Indeed, unfounded criticisms against members of the Judiciary degrade the judicial office and greatly interfere with the due performance of their functions in the Judiciary. [77] They not only needlessly drain the resources of the Court in resolving them, they sow the seeds of distrust of the public against members of the Judiciary. [78] Hence, the Court deems it proper to direct the Complainants to explain their act of filing a premature complaint against Judge Racoma intended to harass or vex the latter. In Re: Verified Complaint of Fernando Castillo Against Associate Justice Mariflor Punzalan-Castillo, Court of Appeals, Manila, [79] the Court directed the complainant therein to show cause why he should not be cited for indirect contempt because he 'miserably failed to sufficiently substantiate his grave accusations' against a member of the Court of Appeals, which he charged of committing acts of misfeasance or malfeasance, and which he sought to be disbarred and removed from her position. In Re: Verified Complaint for Disbarment of AMA Land, Inc. (Represented by Joseph B. Usita) Against Court of Appeals Associate Justices Hon. Danton Q. Bueser, Hon. Sesinando E. Villon and Hon. Ricardo R. Rosario, [80] the Court directed the complainants therein to show cause why they should not be held in indirect contempt 'for bringing the unfounded and baseless charges against [members of the Court of Appeals] not only once but twice.' The complainants in this case resorted to an administrative disciplinary action against the respondents prior to the final resolution of the judicial issue involved in a case pending before the Court of Appeals. The Court therefore directs the Complainants to show cause why they should not be cited for indirect contempt. In Bank of Commerce v. Borromeo, [81] the Court reiterated that contempt of court is willful disregard of public authority that tends to, among others, impair the respect due such body: Contempt of court has been defined as a willful disregard or disobedience of a public authority. In its broad sense, contempt is a disregard of, or disobedience to, the rules or orders of a legislative or judicial body or an interruption of, its proceedings by disorderly behavior or insolent language in its presence or so near thereto as to disturb its proceedings or to impair the respect due such a body. In its restricted and more usual sense, contempt comprehends a despising of the authority, justice, or dignity of a court. The phrase contempt of court is generic, embracing within its legal signification a variety of different acts. The power to punish for contempt is inherent in all courts, and need not be specifically granted by statute. [82] It lies at the core of the administration of a judicial system. [83] Indeed, there ought to be no question that courts have the power by virtue of their very creation to impose silence, respect, and decorum in their presence, submission to their lawful mandates, and to preserve themselves and their officers from the approach and insults of pollution. [84] The power to punish for contempt essentially exists for the preservation of order in judicial proceedings and for the enforcement of judgments, orders, and mandates of the courts, and, consequently, for the due administration of justice. [85] The reason behind the power to punish for contempt is that respect of the courts guarantees the stability of their institution; without such guarantee, the institution of the courts would be resting on a very shaky foundation. [86] A final word The Court is cognizant of the sacrifices of our judges, who risk their very lives and even those of their loved ones, in order to keep our courts open and render the services our people need. None of them is perfect. Just as none of us are. When they commit errors, it is our duty to correct them. But when their circumstances call out for consideration, we must not tum a blind eye. Judge Racoma has not been previously convicted of the charge against him, that is, Gross Ignorance of the Law and Procedure. Judge Racoma, more notably, has never been found guilty of committing any corrupt act in all his past cases. That should merit great weight. Concededly, Judge Racoma was convicted twice for insubordination for failing to file his comment in two of the cited administrative cases. It is disturbing to think and would be truly tragic if Judge Racoma's reason for not submitting a comment in those cases (where he was acquitted of the charges and cited for insubordination instead for such non-filing of a comment) is his loss of hope, his despair over the pressures of his work and the seeming lack of recognition of such plight. A judge who discharges his or her duties despite being beset with external pressures, and who manages to fend off corrupt influences and remain true to his or her oath, save only for an occasional error in judgment, should be extended consideration and commiseration, not condemnation.","WHEREFORE, the administrative Complaint against respondent Judge Winston S. Racoma, Presiding Judge, Branch 39, Regional Trial Court, Daet, Camarines Norte is DISMISSED. The Complainants, Governor Edgardo A. Tallado, Vice Governor Jonah Pedro P. Pimentel, Board Member Rodolfo V. Gache, Board Member Stanley G. Alegre, Board Member Renee F. Herrera, Board Member Gerardo G. Quinones, Board Member Reynor V. Quibral, Board Member Erwin L. Lausin, Board Member Artemio B. Serdon, Jr., Board Member Jay G. Pimentel, and Board Member Ramon R. Baning are ORDERED to SHOW CAUSE within ten (10) days from notice why they should not be held for indirect contempt of court for filing a premature complaint against Judge Winston S. Racoma intended to harass or vex the latter. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 230711, August 22, 2022","CAROLYN T. MUTYA-SUMILHIG, PETITIONER, VS. JOSELITO T. SUMILHIG AND REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENTS.","Carolyn met respondent Joselito T. Sumilhig (Joselito) in February 1984 on her first day of work as a waitress at Daungan Restaurant. Joselito also worked there as an assistant cook. They became good friends and eventually lovers. During their relationship, Carolyn noticed Joselito's gambling and drinking habits. He would pass the time playing tong-its and mahjong with bystanders while waiting for her. When Carolyn worked at Syvel's Department Store, there were instances when Joselito was already drunk when he would fetch her.[7] In 1987, Carolyn got pregnant with their first child, Jay Charles M. Sumilhig (Jay). Blinded by his promise to reform, Carolyn married Joselito on October 20, 1987. Carolyn gave birth to Jay on April 6, 1988. Joselito did not visit his wife and baby at the hospital. When Carolyn was discharged from the hospital two days after giving birth, Carolyn saw that Joselito was playing basketball with his friends. Thereafter, Jay had to be hospitalized for two months because he was defacating through the umbilical cord. However, when Jay got sick, Joselito was easily irrititated because of the baby's cries and he neither showed love nor bothered to take care of Jay. To make matters worse, Joselito stopped working and busied himself with mahjong, drinking, and gambling in the neighborhood.[8] On May 24, 1989, Carolyn gave birth to their second child, Jennalyn M. Sumilhig (Jennalyn). Jennalyn was born premature because Carolyn was stressed during her pregnancy due to her frequent quarrels with Joselito. Despite his growing family, Joselito did not change his ways and remained jobless. He still drank and his gambling habits became worse. There were times when he would not come home because he was playing mahjong. He would also steal Carolyn's savings or borrow money from loan sharks to fund his gambling addiction. Joselito then started physically and verbally abusing Carolyn and their son, Jay. Because of Joselito's behavior, Carolyn developed trauma and would hide in their room whenever Joselito came home drunk.[9] Sometime in September 1990, Carolyn left their home because she could no longer bear Joselito's vices and beatings. She came back for their children a day after leaving, but Joselito only gave Jay. A month after that, Carolyn visited Jennalyn and found out that Joselito was not taking care of her. Jennalyn was coughing incessantly and had a bum on her thigh because Joselito poured hot coffee on her. This prompted Carolyn to take Jennnalyn with her. Since then, she and Joselito have been separated and never reconciled. Eventually, Joselito lived with another woman, Daisy Menor, and has three children with her.[10] On October 18, 2010, Carolyn filed a Petition for Declaration of Nullity of Marriage[11] based on psychological incapacity. To support her allegations, Carolyn submitted her Judicial Aftidavit[12] and the Judicial Affidavits of Joselito's father, Mamerto M. Sumilhig[13] (Mamerto), Dr. Felicitas I. Ariaga­Soriano[14] (Dr. Soriano), and Dr. Ma. Brenda Grace Gabiazon-Benitez[15] (Dr. Benitez). She also presented Dr. Soriano's Psychiatric Evaluation Report[16] and Dr. Benitez's Psychological Test Results and Evaluation.[17] Joselito did not file his Answer.[18] At the trial, Dr. Soriano testified that Joselito had poor upbringing and was spoiled by his grandparents when he was growing up. According to her, Joselito lacks the proper life skills which makes him overly dependent on others. He is also immature and could not comply with his obligations and responsibilities as a husband and a father. Joselito has a defective superego, thus, he sees other people as objects over which to exert control and he feels the need to see Carolyn powerless. Joselito exhibited gross disregard for his wife's feelings and persistent attitude of irresponsibility in marital life.[19] Based on Carolyn's and Mamerto's narration, Dr. Soriano concluded that Joselito suffers from Antisocial-Dependent Personality Disorder, comorbid with alcohol dependence and pathological gambling. Such disorder is not curable because it is developmental in origin. Treatment is only palliative.[20] In addition, Dr. Benitez found Joselito to be a chronic alcohol drinker and gambler. Further, she observed that there is no possibility of reconciliation because of Joselito's psychic condition and since Carolyn is firm in filing the Petition in court.[21] Mamerto corroborated Carolyn's testimony regarding Joselito's drinking and gambling vices that caused their frequent fights. He mentioned that there were times when Joselito would physically hurt Carolyn. He also confirmed that Joselito lived with another woman when the couple separated and exhibited the same attitude towards his second family. Although Joselito earns income now as a tricycle driver, he is still irresponsible and has a severe drinking problem.[22]","After trial, the RTC rendered a Decision[23] dated March 17, 2015 denying the Petition. The RTC found insufficient evidence to prove the gravity, incurability, and juridical antecedence of Joselito's alleged psychological incapacity. It ruled that Joselito's drinking and gambling habits, physical abuse, failure to contribute to household expenses, and failure to take care of their children are insufficient proofs of a psychological disorder. Other than Dr. Soriano's findings, there was no other evidence that Joselito was unaware of his basic marital obligations at the time of the celebration of the marriage. Joselito's behavior only shows his outright refusal, difficulty, or neglect in the performance of his marital obligations, which are not badges of psychological incapacity. In any case, the psychiatric evaluation has little or no probative value since the information on which it was based was derived solely from Carolyn.[24] Carolyn moved for reconsideration,[25] but was denied by the RTC in a Resolution[26] dated May 25, 2015. Aggrieved, Carolyn elevated the case to the [sic] CA. In its assailed Decision[27] dated November 14, 2016, the CA affirmed the RTC's ruling that the totality of the evidence presented is insufficient to prove Joselito's psychological incapacity. The CA noted that the expert finding of psychological incapacity was based only on the facts supplied by Carolyn and Mamerto. Further, Dr. Soriano's conclusion that Joselito's disorder was formed because of his poor ubringing is inadequate to conclude that he is psychologically incapacitated. The CA added that Joselito's refusal to work could be attributed to laziness which is not a manifestation of psychological incapacity.[28] The dispositive portion of the CA's Decision reads: WHEREFORE, in the light of the foregoing, the instant appeal is DENIED. The assailed Decision dated March 17, 2015 and the Resolution dated May 25, 2015 by the Quezon City RTC, Branch 107 in Civil Case No. Q-10-68145, are hereby AFFIRMED. SO ORDERED.[29] Carolyn filed a Motion for Reconsideration[30] which was denied by the CA in a Resolution[31] dated March 9, 2017. Hence, this Petition raising the sole issue of whether the CA gravely erred in ruling that the totality of evidence does not support Joselito's psychological incapacity to fulfill his essential marital obligations.[32]","The Court's Ruling Carolyn asks this Court to declare her marriage void ab initio due to Joselito's psychological incapacity grounded upon Article 36 of the Family Code, which states: Article 36. A marriage contracted by any party who, at the time of the celebration, was psychologically incapacitated to comply with the essential marital obligations of marriage, shall likewise be void even if such incapacity becomes manifest only after its solemnization. The differing guidelines in determining the existence of psychological incapacity were settled by the Court in the recent case of Tan-Andal v. Andal (Tan-Andal).[36] First, a party's psychological incapacity must have juridical antecedence as required in Republic v. CA.[37] Article 36 explicitly requires the psychological incapacity to be existing at the time of the celebration of the marriage, even if such incapacity becomes manifest only after its solemnization. As contemplated under the law, psychological incapacity depicts an enduring aspect of a spouse's personality structure, existing at the time of the celebration of marriage, that renders them incapable of understanding and complying with their essential marital obligations, manifested through clear acts of dysfunctionality that undermines the family.[38] Proof of this aspect of personality may be given by ordinary witnesses who have been present in the life of the supposed incapacitated spouse before the latter contracted marriage. These witnesses may testify on behaviors that they have consistently observed. The judge will then decide if these behaviors are indicative of a true and serious incapacity to assume the essential marital obligations.[39] Thus: Difficult to prove as it may be, a party to a nullity case is still required to prove juridical antecedence because it is an explicit requirement of the law. Article 36 is clear that the psychological incapacity must be 'existing at the time of the celebration' of the marriage, 'even if such incapacity becomes manifest only after its solemnization.' This distinguishes psychological incapacity from divorce. Divorce severs a marital tie even for causes, psychological or otherwise, that may have developed after the marriage celebration. According to Dean Estrada-Claudio, 'it is an accepted principle of all major and recognized theoretical schools within psychology that a person's behavior is determined by the interaction of certain genetic predispositions and by his or her environment, working in iterative loops of influence.' From this, proof of juridically antecedent psychological incapacity may consist of testimonies describing the environment where the supposedly incapacitated spouse lived that may have led to a particular behavior. For instance, violence against one's spouse and children is a manifestation of juridically antecedent psychological incapacity when it is shown that the violent spouse grew up with domestic violence or had a history of abusive romantic relationships before the marriage.[40] (Emphasis supplied) Here, Carolyn testified on how Joselito failed to observe mutual love, respect, and fidelity, and refused to render mutual help and support to her. She averred that Joselito physically abused her and their children, and he spent time gambling and drinking instead of providing for the needs of the family. Mamerto corroborated Carolyn's statements and offered an explanation on why his son has such 'negative behavior.' Mamerto stated that when Joselito was 7 years old, he left the latter in the custody of his wife's parents because of financial hardship. Joselito stayed with his grandparents until he was 14 years old. After he graduated in elementary at 14 years of age, Joselito was brought to Mamerto's house in Manila because his grandparents could not discipline him and he became a 'headache' for them. Mamerto enrolled his son in high school and the school would always call his attention because Joselito was frequently absent. Joselito stopped schooling when he reached fourth year high school without informing his parents. According to Mamerto, Joselito did not care about the feelings of other people and did not respect him and his wife. There were also times when he would hurt his siblings because for Joselito, '[s]iyang masunod.'[41] The CA dismissed these circumstances as emotional immaturity, irresponsibility, and laziness which can be considered as disorder but not manifestations of psychological incapacity. Significantly, the appellate court concluded that what transpired between Carolyn and Joselito are mere irreconcilable differences and conflicting personalities.[42] Contrary to the CA's ruling, Dr. Soriano concluded that Joselito's gross neglect of his responsibilities, immaturity, disregard of his partner's needs and feelings, and abusive behavior are symptoms of a disorder called Antisocial-Dependent Personality Disorder which existed prior to his marriage with Carolyn. Those with this disorder have 'many areas of disordered life functioning.'[43] They do not tell the truth and cannot be trusted to carry out any task or adhere to any conventional standard of morality. Dr. Soriano also elucidated that Joselito has a defective superego so he had to denigrate and abuse Carolyn to raise his self-esteem.[44] He even showed that 'he's capable of rage, when his ego was put to test, putting his wife and children in danger – by physically and emotionally abusing them.'[45] Dr. Benitez, a clinical psychologist, also stated that Joselito exhibited remarkable irresponsibility and inflicted emotional and physical pain upon Carolyn.[46] Joselito's defective superego and Antisocial-Dependent Personality Disorder, which existed prior to his marriage, are parts of his personality structure manifesting through clear acts of dysfunctionality. Joselito was also found to have alcohol dependence and pathological gambling. These factors make it impossible for him to understand and comply with his essential marital obligations. The clear and understandable causation between Joselito's condition pre-existing before his marriage and its incapacitating nature regarding the performance of the essential marital covenants clearly proved the juridical antecedence requirement. Second, the psychological incapacity contemplated in Article 36 of the Family Code is incurable, not in the medical, but in the legal sense. This simply means that the incapacity is so enduring and persistent with respect to a specific partner, and contemplates a situation where the couple's respective personality structures are so incompatible and antagonistic that the only result of the union would be the inevitable and irreparable breakdown of the marriage. There must be an undeniable pattern of such persisting failure to be a present, loving, faithful, respectful, and supportive spouse, and the pattern must be established so as to demonstrate that there is indeed a psychological anomaly or incongruity in the spouse relative to the other.[47] There are no medications that may be taken or intervention that may be done as treatment for Joselito's psychological incapacity to enable him to fulfill his obigations as husband to Carolyn because what is involved here is Joselito's personality structure.[48] Dr. Soriano's assessment of Joselito's condition was based on the information she gathered from Carolyn herself and Joselito's father. Dr. Soriano articulated, viz.: The marital case study indicated that both [Joselito] and [Carolyn], showed impairment in their relationship functioning. [Joselito's] personality pattern strongly suggested that he has an Antisocial-Dependent Personality Disorder (otherwise known known as Mixed Personality Disorder or Personality Disorder not otherwise specified or Atypical Personality Disorder). People with personality disorders commonly experience conflict and instability in many aspects of their lives, and most believe others are responsible for their problems. The diagnosis is comorbid with Alcohol Dependence and Pathological Gambling. The personality disorder speaks of antecedence as it has an early onset, with an enduring pattern and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of the individual's culture. Due to poor parental and family molding (the rejections, the spoling and setting no limitations), [Joselito] did not grow up mature enough to cope with [his] obligations and responsibilities as husband and father. x x x x It also speaks of incurability as people having a personality disorder refuse psychiatric help and deny their problems as they usually have impaired insight. They would not acknowledge the pain they caused on the people around them. They are unmotivated to seek treatment and impervious to recovery. There are no medications to be taken as treatment for Personality Disorders. There is no cure for this disorder being genetic and/or developmental in origin and treatment is only palliative. There are no pills for personality disorder. The medications given are just to ameloriate the anxieties and violent behavior if present.[49] (Emphasis and underscoring in the original; italics supplied) Third, as to gravity, psychological incapacity must be caused by a genuinely serious psychic cause and excludes 'mild characterological peculiarities, mood changes, occasional emotional outbursts[.]'[50] The psychological incapacity cannot be a mere 'refusal, neglect or difficulty, much less ill will.'[51] Joselito's psychological incapacity exemplifies gravity since he was not able to carry out the normal and ordinary duties of marriage performed by any married person under ordinary circumstances. He did not exert any effort at all to keep his marriage and support his family. He did not work, he chose to drink and gamble, and he physically and verbally abused Carolyn.[52] There was neither understanding nor willingness to perform the obligations of marriage. Surely, these circumstances exhibit more than indolence, peculiarities, difficulty, or ill will. The question now is whether the totality of evidence presented in this case — the testimonies of Carolyn, Mamerto, Dr. Soriano, and Dr. Benitez — are sufficient to sustain a finding that Joselito is psychologically incapacitated. Guided by the requisites mentioned and after a careful perusal of the records of this case, this Court rules that the totality of the evidence presented has clearly and convincingly established Joselito's psychological incapacity. To be sure, the rule of totality of evidence does not add a new dimension in the analysis of an Article 36 petition. The narratives in an Article 36 petition are often solely those of petitioner and their witnesses, and frequently, all the trial court has by way of respondent's version is the clinical narration of the factual basis of the expert report, which, in turn, typically arises from the examination of petitioner and other resource persons. It is in this context that courts are directed to apply the totality of evidence rule.[53] The CA's ruling that the findings of Dr. Soriano and Dr. Benitez are unreliable or have little or no probative value because Joselito was not interviewed is without basis. There is no legal and jurisprudential requirement that the person to be declared psychologically incapacitated be personally examined by a physician. Joselito was diagnosed without his personal appearance because he refused to be interviewed. The experts may, however, rely on their methods and procedures. To assess psychological incapacity to perform essential marital obligations, they may focus on the different behaviors manifested by Joselito prior to the marriage and during the marriage. To gather information about these behaviors, the most reliable person to be interviewed is Carolyn because she is the one who experienced the psychologically incapacitating behaviors of Joselito. In a long line of cases, it has been established that the absence of respondent's personal examination is not fatal. We recall that in Marcos v. Marcos,[54] the Court emphasized that there is no requirement that a person be examined by a physician before they can be declared to be psychologically incapacitated. What matters is that the totality of evidence presented establishes the party's psychological condition.[55] Likewise, in Tani-De La Fuente v. De La Fuente,[56] the Court ruled that the psychologist's testimony, as corroborated by petitioner, sufficiently proved that respondent suffered from psychological incapacity.[57] In Camacho-Reyes v. Reyes-Reyes,[58] the Court reiterated that the non-examination of one of the parties will not automatically render as hearsay or invalidate the findings of the examining psychologist since marriage, by its very definition, necessarily involves only two persons. The totality of the behavior of one spouse during the cohabitation and marriage is generally and genuinely witnessed mainly by the other.[59] Too, in Santos-Gantan v. Gantan[60] the Court clarified that while the clinical psychologist was not able to personally examine respondent, it does not nullify the finding of psychological incapacity, especially when such omission was attributable to respondent's own failure or refusal to appear for interview.[61] In an Opinion[62] in Tan-Andal, we explained: The spouse of the person alleged to be psychologically incapacitated may be interviewed by the psychologist since he or she is in the best position to describe his or her spouse's inability to comply with marital obligations. The period of marital cohabitation and matters involving the spouses' affective communication with each other, the time they devoted to each other, the spouses' dissatisfaction on matters involving family income and expenses, manner of resolving major concerns, issues and problems in the family, style of rearing their child, interpersonal dealings with each other's family members and other significant events can only be discussed by the spouse. Other indicia of psychological incapacity that can only be witnessed by the spouse include paraphilia, aberrant sexual behavior, sexual promiscuity and inhibitions. Based on the spouse's observations, the psychologist can identify and explain whether the respondent is psychologically incapacitated. A clinical psychologist, once qualified as an expert witness, interprets the facts of the case and gives his or her opinion, unlike an ordinary witness who is required to have personally seen or heard something. Expert opinion is crucial to enable courts to properly assess the issue and arrive at a judicious determination of each case. As emphasized in Hernandez v. Court of Appeals[377 Phil. 919 (1999)], expert testimony is important to establish the precise cause of a party's psychological incapacity. x x x x In other words, diagnosis by an expert should not be dismissed as 'unscientific' just because the expert has not interviewed the person alleged to be psychologically incapacitated. Not even a personal interview of the respondent can elicit accurate information because it is highly doubtful that a respondent would admit that he or she is psychologically incapacitated. This is a characteristic of one who has a personality disorder; he or she will not admit that something is wrong with him or her. Besides, while examination of the respondent is desirable, it may not be realistic in all cases given the oftentimes estranged relations between the parties. How can a person be examined when he or she persistently refuses to be interviewed? It would be absurd for the psychologically incapacitated party's refusal or defensiveness to be taken against the petitioner.[63] (Emphasis supplied) The presentation of expert testimony in cases for declaration of nullity of marriage based on psychological incapacity presupposes a thorough and an in-depth assessment of the parties by the psychiatrist, psychologist, or expert for a conclusive identification of a grave and severe presence of psychological incapacity. The probative force of the testimony of an expert lies in the assistance that the expert can render to the courts in showing the facts that serve as basis for the criterion and the reasons upon which the logic of his conclusion is founded.[64] For courts to arrive at a legal conclusion of psychological incapacity, the aggrieved party must prove certain facts. A psychologist or psychiatrist may help prove those facts by assessing and evaluating the psychological condition of the parties. Although expert opinion is not mandatory as ruled in Tan-Andal, due regard must be given to expert opinion on the psychological disposition of the respondent when it is presented in Article 36 cases.[65] Indeed, the totality of evidence has sufficiently established that Joselito is psychologically incapacitated at the time he got married to Carolyn. He is not cognizant of the basic marital covenants which is enough to declare the nullity of his marriage with Carolyn.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is GRANTED.

"G.R. No. 233181, August 22, 2022","ROSARIO M. APACIBLE, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES AND SAN MIGUEL CORPORATION, REPRESENTED BY ATTORNEY-IN-FACT LEON B. LIZA, JR., RESPONDENTS.","Sometime in 1999, Apacible and SMC entered into a dealership agreement, where SMC authorized Apacible to deliver San Miguel products in Nasugbu, Batangas and other outlying municipalities. [6] Eventually, the management decided to terminate Apacible's contract because she became delinquent in paying her obligations. [7] Thus, Apacible executed an Undertaking dated December 16, 1999, acknowledging her indebtedness to SMC in the amount of P3,957,173.60, representing the unpaid balance of returned checks. [8] As payment of her outstanding obligation, Apacible issued eight Bank of the Philippine Islands ( BPI ) post-dated checks, four of which are the subject of the present Informations: [9] Date Check No. Amount Dec. 31, 1999 0000004535 P500,000.00 Jan. 31, 2000 0000004538 P500,000.00 Feb. 29, 2000 0000004537 P500,000.00 Mar. 31, 2000 0000004539 P500,000.00 When management deposited the foregoing checks upon maturity, they were dishonored due to insufficiency of funds and account closed. [10] Notwithstanding several demand letters dated January 24, 2000, [11] May 5, 2000, [12] and November 15, 2000 [13] – notifying Apacible that her checks were dishonored and demanding her to make good the amount of the checks – Apacible failed to satisfy her outstanding obligations. [14] SMC filed a complaint-affidavit with the Prosecutor's Office against Apacible. [15] In four Informations filed on July 31, 2003 with the MTCC, the prosecutor charged Apacible with four counts of violation of B.P. 22 in connection with the above-mentioned checks. [16] Apacible filed a Demurrer to Evidence [17] on November 4, 2011, which the MTCC granted in an Order [18] dated February 21, 2012. The MTCC acquitted Apacible criminally due to insufficiency of the prosecution's evidence to prove her guilt beyond reasonable doubt, but ruled that the case must continue to determine her civil liability. Apacible filed a Partial Motion for Reconsideration [19] arguing that the P2,000,000.00 being claimed by SMC is beyond the jurisdictional amount cognizable by the MTCC. [20] The MTCC denied the motion. Instead of presenting evidence, Apacible filed numerous dilatory pleadings repeatedly questioning jurisdiction. On April 8, 2014, the MTCC rendered its Decision, [33] which found Apacible civilly liable to SMC. Apacible appealed to the RTC, and in a Supplemental Appeal Memorandum [38] filed on December 9, 2014, she raised – for the first time – that the MTCC failed to acquire jurisdiction over the case for SMC's failure to pay the docket fees over the face value of the four checks subject of the Informations. In a Decision [39] dated June 9, 2015, the RTC affirmed the MTCC's ruling but agreed that the payment of the docket fees shall constitute a first lien on the judgment. [41] The CA, in its Decision dated November 23, 2016, affirmed the RTC Decision but modified the interest rate imposed by the lower court from 12% to 6%.","The Decision [2] of the Court of Appeals ( CA ) dated November 23, 2016 and its Resolution [3] dated July 6, 2017 in CA-G.R.

Apacible ( Apacible ) and affirmed with modifications the Decision [4] dated June 9, 2015 rendered by the Regional Trial Court ( RTC ) of Calamba City, Laguna, Branch 36, which affirmed the Decision [5] dated April 8, 2014 rendered by the Municipal Trial Court in Cities ( MTCC ), City of Calamba, Laguna. The CA AFFIRMED WITH MODIFICATION, ordering petitioner Apacible to pay the private complainant SMC the following: 1. In Criminal Case No. 40657-03, the amount of P500,000.00 with 6% interest per annum from July 31, 2003 until fully satisfied; 2.

Apacible is barred by laches from raising the issue of lack of jurisdiction of the Municipal Trial Court in Cities (MTCC) for non-payment of docket fees, having actively participated in the proceedings and raising the issue only 11 years after the Informations were filed. This Court finds that the MTCC's jurisdiction over the civil aspect of the case cannot be questioned belatedly, especially since Apacible benefited from the MTCC's exercise of jurisdiction (acquittal on the criminal aspect). The doctrine of estoppel by laches applies because Apacible failed to raise the issue seasonably despite having every opportunity. Furthermore, payment of docket fees, while mandatory, does not automatically result in dismissal of a case, and the RTC correctly exercised its discretion by allowing the docket fees to be a lien on the judgment, especially since SMC did not receive the clerk of court's assessment.","ACCORDINGLY, the instant petition is DENIED.

(GPII), Arlene Bernardo (Bernardo), Heirs of Leonardo Serios (Heirs of Leonardo), and Register of Deeds of Bataan, for nullification of the 2014 Extrajudicial Settlement of Estate with Sale and the 2015 Deed of Sale; affirmation of the 2006 Deed of Sale; cancellation of GPTT's Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 038-2016000719 and Bernardo's TCT No. 038-2015000040; reinstatement of Original Certificate of Title No. 16 (OCT No. 16); and attorney's fees.[3] MCPHC and Yap alleged that the disputed property is a 369,463 - square meter parcel of land situated in Limay, Bataan, known as Lot No. 638. It was originally registered in the name of Leonardo Serios (Leonardo) under OCT No. 16. Following Leonardo's death, his surviving heirs, namely, his wife Leonarda, and children, Solita, Rosemarie, Maximo, Luzviminda, Danilo, and Herlina sold the property to MCPHC for P35,000,000.00. Consequently, the owner's duplicate copy of OCT No. 16 was turned over to Yap after the contract-signing.[4] Thereafter, they (respondents) learned that the Heirs of Leonardo executed an Affidavit of Loss, declaring that the owner's copy of OCT No. 16 was missing. The heirs did so, albeit they knew full well that the owner's copy was actually in their (respondents') possession.[5] They also discovered that the Heirs of Leonardo executed an Extrajudicial Settlement of Estate with Sale dated July 29, 2014 in favor of Bernardo for P5,000,000.00. Consequently, TCT No. 038-2015000040 was issued in her name, in lieu of OCT No. 16 which got cancelled. Bernardo then sold the property to GPII for P110,982,900.00 under a Deed of Absolute Sale dated September 24, 2015. As a result, Bernardo's title was cancelled, and TCT No. 038-2016000719, was issued in the name of GPII.[6] The Heirs of Leonardo riposted that their real transaction with respondents was a contract to sell, not a contract of sale. They received the initial payment of P2,000,000.00 in the office of Yap, for which, they were made to sign blank documents. They were instructed to surrender their owner's duplicate copy of OCT No. 16 and sign a deed of absolute sale on Yap's representation that the same would facilitate respondents' intended sale of the property to the Philippine National Oil Company (PNOC).[9] They claimed Yap had since never made any further payment despite their repeated demands.[10] They were constrained to rescind the contract and look for a prospective buyer.[11] Leonarda filed a petition for issuance of a second owner's copy of OCT No. 16 under CAD Case No. 1-2545-14, which was granted.[15] Bernardo asserted that she was a buyer in good faith. She verified the status of this property with the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), the Register of Deeds, and the Office of the Provincial and Municipal Assessor of Bataan, and records did not bear any notice of the 2006 Deed of Sale.[18] GPII also claimed to be an innocent purchaser in good faith and for value, asserting Bernardo's TCT was clean.[19] During the pre-trial, the parties stipulated on the existence of the 2006 Deed of Sale, the authenticity of the signatures (with the qualification that these were signed in blank), and that the Heirs of Leonardo turned over or delivered the original copy of OCT No. 16 to Yap.[22] MCPHC and Yap filed an Omnibus Motion to Render Summary Judgment, arguing that based on the stipulations, there was no more genuine issue left to be resolved.[26] The trial court granted the Omnibus Motion and rendered summary judgment per its Decision dated November 23, 2018, declaring the 2014 and 2015 Sales NULL and VOID, declaring the 2006 Deed of Absolute Sale VALID, and directing the cancellation of TCT No. 038-2015000040 and TCT No. 038-2016000719.[31] On GPII's appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed under Decision[33] dated September 25, 2020.","The Decision dated September 25, 2020 and Resolution dated May 28, 2021 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 112409 are REVERSED.","The Supreme Court ruled that the Court of Appeals committed reversible error when it affirmed the summary judgment rendered by the trial court because genuine issues of material fact subsist. The stipulations on the existence of the 2006 Deed of Sale and the turnover of OCT No. 16 to Yap did not resolve or eliminate core issues, including the real nature of the transaction (contract of sale or contract to sell), the payment of the full purchase price, and whether GPII and Bernardo were innocent purchasers for value. The presence or absence of good faith is a factual issue which requires evidence and cannot be objectively drawn from the cold case records alone. GPII's claim as an innocent purchaser for value cannot be prejudiced by the supposed admissions of the Heirs of Leonardo and Bernardo and must be resolved in a full-blown proceeding before the trial court.","The petition is GRANTED. Civil Case No. 1141-ML is REMANDED to the Regional Trial Court-Branch 94, Mariveles, Bataan for the resumption of proceedings. The trial court is directed to promptly set the case for a full-blown hearing for the presentation of evidence, and thereafter, render a new judgment. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 252720, August 22, 2022","RICO PALIC CONJUSTA, PETITIONER, VS. PPI HOLDINGS, INC. (FORMERLY PHILIPPINE PIZZA, INC.), JORGE L. ARANETA (OWNER), ATALIAN GLOBAL SERVICES (FORMERLY CONSOLIDATED BUILDING MAINTENANCE, INC./CBMI), AND JUAN MANOLO ORTAÑEZ (OWNER), RESPONDENTS.","On October 2, 2002, PPI Holdings, Inc. (PPI), the sole franchisee of Pizza Hut in the Philippines, hired petitioner Rico Palic Conjusta (Conjusta) as a messenger for its human resources department, and later on, for its accounting department. Eventually, however, Conjusta's employment was transferred to a manpower agency, a certain Human Resources, Inc., and subsequently, to Consolidated Buildings Maintenance, Inc. (CBMI), now Atalian Global Services. Despite such transfer, nothing changed with Conjusta's employment — he continued to be PPI's messenger in its accounting department until CBMI sent him, along with other coworkers, a Letter dated August 1, 2016 terminating his services with PPI. Conjusta then filed an illegal dismissal case with money claims against PPI, CBMI, and their owners, arguing that he was PPI's regular employee for having worked with it for 14 years, and that there was no just cause for his dismissal. PPI denied having an employer-employee relationship with Conjusta, claiming CBMI was a legitimate job contractor. CBMI acknowledged Conjusta as its employee but alleged he was merely placed on floating status when it terminated its latest service contract with PPI effective September 1, 2016. The Labor Arbiter (LA) found CBMI to be a legitimate contractor but ruled Conjusta was PPI's regular employee for 14 years and was illegally dismissed, ordering PPI to pay monetary awards, and dismissing the complaint against CBMI. The National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) modified the LA's decision, declaring CBMI a labor-only contractor, and holding PPI and CBMI jointly and severally liable, and ordering Conjusta's reinstatement. On certiorari, the Court of Appeals (CA) reverted to the LA's ruling that CBMI is a legitimate job contractor, based solely on the doctrine of stare decisis (citing Asprec and Cayetano), and concluded that Conjusta was CBMI's direct employer, while sustaining the finding of illegal dismissal. Conjusta filed this Petition, questioning the CA's finding that CBMI was a legitimate job contractor.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is GRANTED.","The Court ruled that previous declarations that a company is an independent job contractor cannot validly be the basis in concluding its status as such in another case involving a different employee, as the totality of the facts and surrounding circumstances must be assessed in every case. The CA gravely erred in determining CBMI's character as a legitimate job contractor solely on the basis of stare decisis, specifically Asprec and Cayetano. Applying the criteria for legitimate job contracting, the Court upheld the NLRC's finding that CBMI was a labor-only contractor because: (1) there was want of evidence that CBMI carried on an independent business or exercised control over Conjusta; (2) the service contracts showed CBMI merely undertook to supply manpower; and (3) Conjusta's job as a messenger was necessary and vital to PPI's business, evidenced by his 14 years of uninterrupted service. Since CBMI was a labor-only contractor, it is considered a mere agent of PPI, and PPI is deemed Conjusta's employer. Consequently, PPI and CBMI are solidarity liable for Conjusta's illegal dismissal and monetary claims.","The Decision dated October 30, 2019 and the Resolution dated March 6, 2020 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 158667 are MODIFIED. Consolidated Building Maintenance, Inc. is declared as a labor-only contractor, and PPI Holdings, Inc. is Rico Palic Conjusta's employer.

"G.R. No. 191039, August 22, 2022","ARLENE HOMOL Y ROMOROSA, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","Dr. Jelpha Robillos y Jimenez (Dr. Robillos) hired Arlene Homol y Romorosa (Arlene) as a clinic secretary. Also, Dr. Robillos tasked Arlene to collect and remit installment payments from customers who purchased jewelry. On March 2 and 8, 2002, Arlene received a total of P1,000.00 from Elena Quilangtang (Elena) for the gold bracelet that she bought. However, Arlene did not give the money to Dr. Robillos. On March 14, 2002, Arlene resigned from work. The following day, Dr. Robillos reminded Elena of her unpaid installments. Elena replied that she already paid to Arlene. Aggrieved, Dr. Robillos filed a criminal complaint against Arlene. Finding probable cause, the public prosecutor charged Arlene with qualified theft before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) docketed as Criminal Case No. 11513, [4] to wit: The undersigned, City Prosecutor I, City of Tagbilaran, Philippines, hereby accuses ARLENE R. HOMOL of the crime of Qualified Theft, committed as follows: That, on or about March 2, to March 8, 2002, in the City of Tagbilaran, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, who is a secretary/collector of Dra. Jelpha Robillos, with intent of gain and with grave abuse of confidence which facilitated the commission of the offense and without the consent of said Dr. Jelpha Robillos, the owner thereof and also her employer, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously take, steal and carry away ONE THOUSAND PESOS ([P]1,000.00), Philippine Currency, as partial payment from a customer which she ought to remit to the said owner/employer being a collector, to the damage and prejudice of said Dra. Jelpha Robillos, in the amount to be proved during the trial of the case. Acts committed contrary to the provisions of Article[s] 308 and 310 of the Revised Penal Code. [5] (Emphases supplied) Arlene pleaded not guilty. At the trial, Arlene did not deny receipt of P1,000.00 but insisted that she remitted it to Dr. Robillos.","On July 26, 2004, the RTC convicted Arlene of estafa involving unfaithfulness or abuse of confidence under Article 315 paragraph 1(b) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC). The RTC held that Arlene misappropriated the payment and violated the trust of Dr. Robillos and Elena, [7] thus: WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court finds accused Arlene Homol y Romorosa guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Estafa under subdivision No. 1, paragraph (b) of Article 315 of the [RPC] and penalized under the 3rd paragraph of the same article and, applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the Court hereby sentences the said accused to suffer the penalty of imprisonment ranging from Three (3) Months and Eleven (11) Days, as the minimum, to One (1) Year and (1) Day, as the maximum, and to indemnify [Dr.] Jelpha J. Robillos the sum of P1,000.00, the amount misappropriated by the accused. SO ORDERED. [8] (Emphases supplied) Arlene elevated the case to the CA docketed as CA-G.R. CEB CR No. 00080. Arlene argued that the RTC erroneously convicted her of estafa when the charge was for qualified theft. Moreover, the Information is fatally defective for failure to allege juridical possession which is an element of estafa. [9] On June 26, 2008, the CA affirmed the RTC's findings that all the elements of estafa involving unfaithfulness or abuse of confidence were alleged and proven.","The Petition is partly meritorious. . . The prosecution failed to recite in the Information facts constitutive of estafa. . . The Information is silent whether Arlene received the money in a fiduciary capacity, or under an obligation to return the same. [28] The phrase in the Information that Arlene ""ought to remit"" [29] the money is insufficient absent the allegation that this duty is rooted in transactions where she acquired juridical possession of the thing. In contrast, the Information alleged that Arlene received the money as a mere collector. [30] As such, the money merely passes into Arlene's hands and her custody is only until the amount is remitted to Dr. Robillos. Arlene acquires only physical or material possession over the unremitted funds. Verily, an employee who receives money or property in behalf of the employer is not vested with juridical possession but only physical or material possession. . . The Court finds that the allegations sufficiently charged Arlene with qualified theft. However, the prosecution proved only simple theft absent evidence that the abuse of confidence is grave. . . Thus, Arlene is guilty only of simple theft. At most, the abuse of confidence shall be considered as a generic aggravating circumstance since the gravity of exploitation of trust was not proven.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DENIED. The Court of Appeals' Decision dated June 26, 2008 and Resolution dated December 16, 2009 in CA-G.R. CEB CR No. 00080 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATIONS in that Arlene Homol y Romorosa is found guilty of simple theft and is sentenced to suffer the penalty of imprisonment of four (4) months and one (1) day. The award of actual damages to private complainant Dr. Jelpha Robillos y Jimenez in the amount of P1,000.00 shall earn interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of the Regional Trial Court's Decision dated July 26, 2004 until full payment.

"G.R. No. 203992, August 22, 2022","ANTONIO S. QUIOGUE, JR., PETITIONER, VS. MARIA BEL B. QUIOGUE AND THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENTS.","Petitioner Antonio S. Quiogue, Jr. (Antonio) and respondent Maria Bel B. Quiogue (Maribel) were married on October 16, 1980, and separated in fact since 1998 after Maribel allegedly drove him out of the conjugal home. Antonio filed a Petition for Declaration of Nullity of Marriage (Civil Case No. Q-02-46137) claiming both spouses were psychologically incapacitated to comply with basic marital obligations. Maribel denied driving him out, alleging he voluntarily left due to womanizing and perennial nocturnal gambling, and was often drunk, violent, and verbally abusive. Antonio testified that Maribel was ill-tempered, tactless, and disrespected him by divulging demeaning matters to his staff regarding his 'flings.' Maribel detailed Antonio's multiple affairs, including cohabiting with a certain Ynes Gamila. Dr. Valentina Del Fonso Garcia, a psychiatrist, conducted an assessment, finding Antonio suffered from a narcissistic and histrionic personality disorder, manifested by chronic infidelity, sense of entitlement, and lack of empathy, which was deeply rooted in his dysfunctional childhood. The Regional Trial Court (RTC) found sufficient grounds and declared the marriage void on the ground of psychological incapacity of both spouses.","The Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the RTC's ruling. The CA held that Antonio's infidelity and irreconcilable differences do not constitute psychological incapacity under Article 36 of the Family Code, and that the psychiatric report merely confirmed marital problems but was not conclusive proof of psychological incapacity. The CA dismissed the petition for declaration of nullity of marriage.","The Supreme Court found the Petition meritorious. Citing *Tan-Andal v. Andal*, the Court ruled that Antonio's chronic infidelity was a manifestation of a narcissistic and histrionic personality disorder that met the requirements of gravity, juridical antecedence, and legal incurability/persistence. Antonio's inability to maintain a monogamous relationship was traced to his dysfunctional childhood, mirroring his philandering father and lacking proper attention from his mother. His failure to show sincere remorse and his tendency to blame Maribel for the marriage's demise demonstrated his psychological incapacity. However, the Court found no sufficient evidence of psychological incapacity on Maribel's part, concluding her retaliatory acts (anger, vulgar messages) were mere reactions to Antonio’s philandering. The totality of evidence established Antonio's psychological incapacity as the cause to nullify the marriage.","The Petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated May 22, 2012 and Resolution dated October 3, 2012 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 93554 is REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The marriage between Antonio S. Quiogue, Jr., and Maria Bel B. Quiogue is declared VOID on ground of Antonio's psychological incapacity. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 241986, August 22, 2022","FELICIANO PALAD LEGASPI, SR., PETITIONER VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","Legaspi was the duly elected Municipal Mayor of Norzagaray, Bulacan from 2007 to 2013. He reassigned Yolanda C. Ervas (Ervas), Municipal Budget Officer, to the Norzagaray Public Market.[5] Unsatisfied, Ervas filed an administrative complaint for oppression or grave abuse of authority against Legaspi docketed as OMB-L-A-11-0338-F. Ervas claimed that Legaspi's act of reassigning her is an act of oppression and grave abuse of authority as her new position does not match her qualifications and involves diminution of rank and salary. On August 31, 2012, the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon rendered a Decision[6] against Legaspi, the dispositive portion of which reads: WHEREFORE, premises considered, finding substantial evidence against respondent FELICIANO P. LEGASPI[,] [SR.] for Le charge of Oppression or Grave Abuse of Authority, it is respectfully recommended that a penalty of suspension of six (6) months and one (1) day be imposed against him pursuant to Section 10, Rule III of Administrative Order No. 7, as amended. The Honorable Secretary of the Department of Interior and Local Government is hereby directed to implement this DECISION immediately upon receipt thereof pursuant to Section 7, Rule III of Administrative Order No. 7, as amended, in relation to OMB Memorandum Circular No. 1, Series of 2006, dated 11 April 2006, and to promptly inform this Office of the action taken hereon. SO DECIDED.[7] (Emphasis in the original, underscoring supplied) Thereafter, Florida M. Dijan (Dijan), Regional Director of the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Region III, received a Memorandum dated December 3, 2012 from DILG Undersecretary Austere A. Panadero instructing her to cause the immediate implementation of the OMB Decision dated August 31, 2012 suspending Legaspi.[8] With this, Dijan issued an Order[9] dated December 12, 2012 directing the implementation of Legaspi's suspension.[10] Darwin David (David), Officer-in-Charge (OIC) of the Bulacan Office, DILG Region III, and Atty. Myron C. Cunanan (Cunanan), Legal Officer, DILG Region III, were tasked to serve a copy of the order of suspension to Legaspi and cause the immediate implementation thereof.[11] As such, David and Cunanan proceeded to the Municipal Hall of Norzagaray to implement the suspension order. However, they did not find Legaspi therein. Silangan Rivas (Rivas), the Municipal Human Resource Management Officer accommodated David and Cunanan.[12] Thereat, Rivas called Legaspi and handed the phone to Cunanan. Initially, Legaspi refused to receive the suspension order but Cunanan cautioned him that a valid substituted service may be done. After the phone was returned to Rivas, she then informed Cunanan and David that she would receive the suspension order based on Legaspi's instruction. Thus, at 3:00 p.m. on December 12, 2012, Rivas received the suspension order on behalf of Legaspi and this was witnessed by Dr. Jimmy Corpus, a consultant of the municipal government.[13] The following day, Rivas wrote a letter[14] to the DILG Region III, seeking to return the suspension order of Legaspi due to the following reasons: That as the Municipal Human Resource Management Officer, I am not duly authorized to receive such document on behalf of the Municipal Mayor; That since the nature of the document is an order from your office, the undersigned believes that the same should be directly received by Mayor Feliciano P. Legaspi, M.D.[15] The DILG Region III, through Dijan, responded to the letter of Rivas and explained that her authority was categorically acknowledged by the counsel of Legaspi in a pleading entitled ""Appearance, Urgent Manifestation and Motion to Recall Undated 1st Indorsement""[16] wherein it was stated that: .... (c) On 12 December 2012 respondent Mayor Legaspi received the Memorandum (ANNEX ""D"") of even date from DILG Regional Director Dijan directing him to cease and desist from exercising the powers and performing his duties and responsibilities as Municipal Mayor of Norzagaray, Bulacan, for the period of six (6) months and one (1) day pursuant to the Decision, and that the elected Vice-Mayor shall temporarily assume the function as Acting Mayor while the suspension is in effect unless the Court orders otherwise.[17] (Emphasis in the original) For the DILG Region III, the clear import of the quoted statement was that Rivas' receipt was honored by Legaspi as if he personally received it.[18] In the meantime, Vice Mayor Rogelio P. Santos, Jr. (Santos, Jr.) was furnished a copy of the suspension order and was sworn in as acting mayor of Norzagaray. While under preventive suspension from December 12, 20I2 to June 13, 2013, Legaspi solemnized 37 marriages and issued a mayor's permit in favor of Wacuman Incorporated (Wacuman). Thus, the OMB, through the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP), filed 38 Informations against Legaspi for usurpation of official functions punishable under Article 177 of the Revised Penal Code. ... On the other hand, the defense presented its lone witness, Legaspi, who denied all the allegations against him. He maintained that he does not remember signing the marriage certificates and the mayor's permit during his purported suspension as he had signed many documents.[33] The defense questioned the genuineness of the marriage documents as they were merely colored photocopies and did not have a dry seal.[34] Legaspi argued that he could not have signed the marriage certificates as he was serving the penalty of suspension from office.[35]","On May 11, 2018, the Sandiganbayan rendered its Decision,[36] the dispositive portion of which states: WHEREFORE, in Criminal Case Nos.

At the outset, it must be stressed that issues dealing with the sufficiency of evidence and the relative weight accorded to it by the lower court cannot be raised in a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules as it is limited only to questions of law. ... Nevertheless, even after taking a second hard look on the case, this Court is still convinced that Legaspi's guilt had been proven beyond reasonable doubt. ... Based on the Informations, petitioner is accused of 38 counts under the second mode of Usurpation of Official Functions of Article 177. Thus, the prosecution has the burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt the following elements: 1. The offender may be a private person or public officer. 2. The offender performs any act pertaining to any person in authority or public officer of the Philippine government, any of its agencies, or of a foreign government. 3. The offender performs the act under pretense of official function. 4. The offender performs the act without being legally entitled to do so. As correctly determined by the Sandiganbayan, the guilt of petitioner was established beyond reasonable doubt. ... Anent the third and fourth elements, it is worthy to highlight the fact that petitioner solemnized marriages, issued marriage certificates, and granted a mayor's permit, all while he was suspended. These acts were performed under the pretense of official functions, giving the appearance that he had authority to do such acts when he was actually precluded by his suspension from office. ... The service of the copy of the OMB Decision was proper. ... The service made to Rivas, even if she attempted to return the suspension order the following day, constitutes a valid service under Section 6, Rule 13 of the Rules. ...

In 2002, CAP entered into a trust agreement[5] with PVB, among others. In 2005, CAP filed a petition for corporate rehabilitation which was raffled to the RTC acting as a Rehabilitation Court. In 2008, CAP's other trustee banks – Allied Bank and Bank of Commerce – transferred the assets they held in trust to PVB. Through two (2) memoranda[6] dated October 22, 2013 (2013 memoranda), CAP and PVB agreed for the trust fees to be charged upon the assets transferred from Allied Bank and Bank of Commerce. In a letter[7] dated January 19, 2017, the court-appointed Rehabilitation Receiver for CAP, Mamerto A. Marcelo, Jr. expressed his reservations on the trust fees being charged by PVB against CAP. In a series of correspondence that followed, PVB and CAP expressed their separate views on the correct trust fees while the RTC was merely furnished copies thereof.[8] On April 21, 2017, the RTC issued a motu proprio Order[9] directing PVB to refund the excess trust fees it collected from the trust fund amounting to P50,639,642.94 and to adjust the fees it has been collecting in accordance with the 2013 memoranda. On May 29, 2017, PVB filed a Motion for Clarification[10] of the April 21, 2017 Order wherein it reiterated that it correctly charged the trust fees and asked for clarification as to the inconsistencies in the correspondences between PVB and CAP.[11] In an Order[12] dated January 10, 2018, the RTC clarified that the April 21, 2017 Order directed PVB to give an update on the adjustments on the amounts due from the trust fund in accordance with the trust fees stipulated in the trust agreement dated September 22, 2013.[13] In a manifestation and motion[14] dated March 6, 2018, PVB pointed out an alleged clerical error in the dispositive portion of the January 10, 2018 Order and praying for the same to be corrected to reflect the ""true"" date of the applicable trust agreement, which is September 27, 2002 instead of September 22, 2013.[15] CAP filed its comment[16] on the motion and argued that the RTC meant that the trust fees stipulated in the October 22, 2013 memoranda should prevail given that the dispositive portion of the January 10, 2018 Order used the year 2013.[17] Thus, in an Order[18] dated August 9, 2018, the RTC, inter alia, affirmed its April 21, 2017 Order directing PVB to refund CAP the amount of P50,639,642.94 and declaring the applicable trust rates for the assets held in trust pursuant to the 2013 memoranda. The RTC also clarified that the date of agreement (September 22, 2013) mentioned in the dispositive portion of the January 10, 2018 Order refers to the 2013 memoranda.

The said RTC Order required PVB, among others, to refund private respondent College Assurance Plan Philippines, Inc., (CAP) the amount of P50,639,642.94 representing the excess trust fee PVB collected from CAP.","The petition should be dismissed for being moot and academic. ""A case or issue is considered moot and academic when it ceases to present a justiciable controversy by virtue of supervening events, so that an adjudication of the case or a declaration on the issue would be of no practical value or use. In such instance, there is no actual substantial relief which a petitioner would be entitled to, and which would be negated by the dismissal of the petition. Courts generally decline jurisdiction over such case or dismiss it on the ground of mootness. This is because the judgment will not serve any useful purpose or have any practical legal effect because, in the nature of things, it cannot be enforced.""[25] Applying the foregoing, the Court finds that the CA's supervening promulgation of its Decision dated May 21, 2021 in CA-G.R. SP No. 157608 – which dismissed PVB's petition before it on the merits – rendered the present case moot and academic. This is because, as already discussed, the main issue in the instant petition is the propriety of the CA's denial of PVB's prayer for TRO/WPI, which is but an incident of CA-G.R. SP No. 157608. Since this issue is but an incident of the main case before the CA which had already been resolved, ruling on the present issue would be merely an academic exercise carrying no practical effect.[26] Accordingly, the Court is constrained to dismiss the instant petition. In this relation, it is relevant to point out that it would be premature for the Court to tackle the merits of the CA's recent Decision for the reason that it is not the matter herein appealed.","WHEREFORE, the petition is DISMISSED for being moot and academic. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 241168, August 22, 2022","BASES CONVERSION AND DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY (BCDA), PETITIONER, VS. PEDRO S. CALLANGAN, JR., ELIZABETH BARBA-AZARES, JOINED BY HER HUSBAND ORLANDO AZARES, REPRESENTED BY THEIR ATTORNEY-IN-FACT, HENRY T. VILLEGAS, RESPONDENTS.","On June 12, 1957, President Carlos P. Garcia reserved several parcels of land in Taguig for military purposes, excluding the Diplomatic and Consular Area (DCA) within Fort Wm McKinley. [3] On February 10, 2009, then President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo declared the DCA as alienable and disposable and placed it under the administrative jurisdiction, supervision, and control of BCDA: . . . Sometime in July 2017, Callangan et al. filed a complaint, which they later amended, for the recovery of possession, cancellation, and issuance of tax declarations and damages against BCDA and City Assessor Villaluz. They contend that they are the owners of the properties covered by TCT Nos. (39596) 164-2015001705 and (39597) 164-2015001704, having purchased these properties from Jacobina B. Vizcarra and Felisa B. Vizcarra (Vizcarra Spouses) on September 30, 1976. [5] They claimed that the availed of the LRA Voluntary Title Standardization Program on September 2015 since the titles they had were old. [6] Callangan et al. alleged that they had been in prior open and possession of these lands from 1976 until in 2009 when BCDA invoked Proclamation No. 1725. They alleged that Lot 2-A of the DCA with an area of 17,123 square meters overlapped with their titles. . . . Callangan et al. claimed the Bureau of Internal Revenue already gave them a Certificate Authorizing Registration for transfer of the property. However, as buyers of the property, they could not process the transfer of its ownership because City Assessor Villaluz was hesitant to process their application for a tax declaration. Thus, Callangan et al. prayed for City Assessor Villaluz to cancel BCDA's tax declaration which infringed on their property and to issue a new one under the names of its previous owners, the Vizcarra Spouses. [10] On August 3, 2017, BCDA filed its Answer, raising that the complaint is founded on a spurious claim of ownership. Allegedly, Original Certificate of Title No. 208, the origin title of TCT Nos. 39596 and 39597, was a 174-square meter property located in Pateros. [11] BCDA contended that the parcels of land being declared for tax declaration are within the DCA. . . . BCDA also invoked the regalian doctrine, saying that there being no showing that the subject property was reclassified or released as an alienable agricultural land or alienated to a private person, the property remained part of the inalienable public domain. . . . On December 6, 2017, Callangan et al. filed their motion for partial summary judgment. They argued that there was no genuine issue on the issuance of a tax declaration in favor of their predecessors-in-interest. They contend that upon the submission of the required documents, the City Assessor's duty to issue the tax declaration becomes ministerial. [17] . . . On June 5, 2018, the trial court issued the assailed Order granting the motion for partial summary judgment. It ruled that City Assessor Villaluz's Answer did not tender a genuine issue because he admits the nature of his functions as ministerial. [23] In ruling that Callangan et al.'s application for tax declaration must be given due course, the trial court appreciated the Bureau of Local Government Finance's indorsement. [24] BCDA and City Assessor Villaluz's respective motions for reconsideration were denied in a July 27, 2018 Order. [26] Hence, BCDA filed a Petition for Review directly before this Court on September 7, 2018.","We grant the Petition. . . . As will be discussed below, the trial court rendered the summary judgment in clear grave abuse of discretion amounting to a denial of petitioner's right to the plenary trial of their case. Its gross and reckless disregard of the basic Rules on Summary Judgment warrant the reversal of the assailed partial summary judgment. . . . Upon examination of the records and relevant pleadings, we agree with petitioner that a genuine issue exists in this case. . . . Thus, it was grave abuse of discretion for the trial court to not consider the issue of ownership because respondents' second cause of action for the issuance of a tax declaration is founded on their supposed ownership of the subject properties. . . . Here, the trial court gravely abused its discretion in rendering the partial summary judgment directing the City Tax Assessor to issue the tax declaration in favor of respondents, especially since there exists a genuine issue on their ownership over the properties and that they do not appear, as a matter of law, entitled to the summary relief they prayed for.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is GRANTED. The June 5, 2018 and July 27, 2018 Orders of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 70 of Taguig City in Civil Case No. 231 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE.",SO ORDERED.
"G.R. Nos. 243029-30, August 22, 2022","TITO S. SARION, PETITIONER, V.S. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","This resolves the Motion for Reconsideration [1] of the Court's March 18, 2021 Decision [2] which denied the petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court of petitioner Tito S. Sarion (petitioner), thereby affirming the Decision [3] dated September 29, 2017, and Resolution [4] dated November 8, 2018, of the Sandiganbayan in SB-11-CRM-0256 to 0257, convicting the petitioner of the crime of Malversation of Public Funds under Article 217 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) and of violating Section 3(e) of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 3019. In the assailed Decision, the Court ruled that the issues raised by the petitioner are factual in nature, and as such beyond the province of a petition for review on certiorari. Just the same, the Court deliver into the merits of the charges and found that the Sandiganbayan correctly convicted the petitioner of the charges. Addressing the petitioner's defense in the crime of Malversation, the Court opined that the petitioner, by the nature of his functions as then Mayor, is an accountable officer of the public funds of the Municipality of Daet. In the case of the petitioner, the Court found that Malversation was committed through gross inexcusable negligence when the petitioner permitted Markbilt Construction (Markbilt) to receive payment of the price escalation despite not being entitled thereto. The Court explained that by approving the disbursement voucher and signing the Landbank check, despite the absence of appropriation and failure to comply with the requirements of Section 61 of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9184 or the Government Procurement Reform Act, the petitioner facilitated the illegal release of public funds to Markbilt. Aggrieved, the petitioner filed the instant Motion for Reconsideration. In his motion, the petitioner argued that he is not guilty of gross inexcusable negligence. In further support of his motion, the petitioner cited the legal opinion of Legal Officer Edmundo R. Deveza II (Legal Officer Deveza II), stating that the Municipal Engineering Office had been consulted and found no irregularity in the computation of the price escalation. And that the petitioner, in signing the disbursement voucher 'relied in good faith on the diligent exercise of functions of the municipal officers who were primarily tasked with accounting, budgeting, and addressing legal matters.' Hence, there is no 'patent irregularity' which should have prompted him to inquire further.",The Court denies the motion.,"The petitioner in entreating that this Court review the factual findings of the Sandiganbayan under the instant petition for review on certiorari must demonstrate and prove that the case clearly falls under the exceptions to the rule. In this case, the petitioner failed to discharge this burden. Even then, the Court sees no reason to reverse the judgment of conviction. There is no violation of the petitioner's constitutional right to information. There is indeed, as alleged in the Information, an absence of appropriation, not with respect to the entire project, but specifically for the payment of price escalation. To authorize payment, there must initially be a statement of source of funding for the price escalation in accordance with the requirement of Section 86 of P.D. No. 1445; there is none in this case. The clause is void and of no effect. The petitioner may still be convicted of the crime of Malversation and for violation of Section 3(e) of the R.A. No. 3019 on account of his approval of the disbursement voucher without first referring the matter to the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) for the determination of the of the existence of extraordinary circumstances and securing the approval of the Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB). The petitioner cannot rely on the doctrine in Arias v. Sandiganbayan to exculpate himself from liability. In this case, the Court finds the existence of such circumstances which could have alerted the petitioner to inquire further prior to his approval of the disbursement voucher, beyond the certifications and documents issued by municipal officials. Petitioner, as head of office, should have taken this precaution in order to safeguard the government funds for which he is responsible and protect the interests of the municipality. The petitioner's failure to observe sufficient diligence under the circumstances coupled by and resulting to violation of the law and rules relating to disbursement of public funds amount to gross inexcusable negligence.","WHEREFORE, premises considered, petitioner Tito S. Sarion,'s Motion for Reconsideration is hereby DENIED. Consequently, the Court's Decision dated March 18, 2021 is AFFIRMED."
"G.R. No. 241074, August 22, 2022","PETER Q. MARISTELA, PETITIONER, VS. JOSE MARIA M. MIRASOL, RESPONDENT.","On February 3, 2014, Jose Maria M. Mirasol (Mirasol) filed a complaint with the Ombudsman against Maristela, the then City Councilor of Puerto Princesa, Palawan: for violation of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 3019, otherwise known as the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, and R.A. No. 6713, or the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees. Mirasol accused Maristela of bribing Rene Godoy (Godoy), the barangay captain of Sta. Monica, with P25,000.00 and other favors (e.g. the uninterrupted approval of his projects) in exchange for his vote for a certain Punong Barangay Gabuco in the Association of Barangay Councils (ABC) election. Mirasol claimed that Maristela gave Godoy P20,000.00 on December 11, 2013 at the Game Fowl Farm of Reynario Batongbakal (Batongbakal), who acted as middleman and helped Maristela and Godoy meet. Five days later, Maristela handed an additional P5,000.00 at Centro Hotel in Barangay San Pedro, Puerto Princesa. John Inocencio (Inocencio), Godoy's driver, witnessed both meetings, which Inocencio took videos of. Maristela denied the allegations, arguing the supporting evidence was obtained in violation of his right to privacy of communication. The Ombudsman found Maristela guilty of the administrative offense of Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service and meted him the penalty of nine months and one day of suspension from office without pay. The Court of Appeals affirmed the Ombudsman's decision.","The Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED. The Decision dated February 27, 2018 and the Resolution dated July 16, 2018 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 148858 are hereby AFFIRMED.","The sole issue before this Court is whether the CA correctly held petitioner administratively liable for conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service. We deny the Petition. It is well-settled that in administrative proceedings, only substantial evidence is required to support a finding of guilt. Here, both the Ombudsman and the CA found that petitioner tried to influence Godoy to vote for Punong Barangay Gabuco in the ABC elections by handing Godoy P25,000.00 for his vote. The offense that petitioner is being held liable for is Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service, which consists of any act that would tarnish the image and integrity of his public office. As a City Councilor, petitioner should have known better. Whether the act of giving the money was for vote-buying or otherwise, the fact that he did offer money was already sufficient to tarnish the image and integrity of his public office.","Petitioner Peter Q. Maristela is guilty of Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service and is meted the penalty of suspension from office without pay for nine (9) months and one (1) day. Should the penalty of suspension no longer be enforced due to petitioner's separation from service, the penalty shall be converted into a fine in an amount equivalent to petitioner's salary for six (6) months, payable to the Office of the Ombudsman, and may be deductible from his retirement benefits, accrued leave credits, or any receivable from his office."
"G.R. No. 204075, August 17, 2022","CORNWORLD BREEDING SYSTEMS CORPORATION AND/OR LAUREANO C. DOMINGO, PETITIONERS, VS. HON. COURT OF APPEALS AND LUCENA M. ALVARO-LADIA, RESPONDENTS.","Sometime in August 1982, Lucena was hired as a field labor employee by Cornworld. She rose from the ranks and was eventually designated as Vice President for Research and Development in the company. When Cornworld's then President, Benito M. Domingo, suffered a stroke on January 16, 2009, petitioner Laureano C. Domingo (Laureano) took over the management of the company. On January 24, 2009, Laureano called for a special meeting of some of the company's employees including Lucena. The latter claimed that before the meeting started, several employees witnessed Laureano berating her as to why she was not able to attend some of the meetings of the company and failed to answer his phone calls and letters. She then recalled the following verbal exchange that transpired during the said meeting: Lucena: Sorry sir umiiwas lang po ako sa gulo. Laureano: What gulo? Lucena: Kasi everytime na nagmi meeting tayo nauuwi sa gulo at ang issues ay pabalikbalik at nasasagot naman at dinedelegate ko sa mga research assistant ko para malaman ko ang capacity nila. Laureano: It is your responsibility as a head of this department to attend all the meetings (at the same time pointing a finger at Lucena) Lucena: Yes sir. Sorry sir kung ano man ang nagawa kong kasalanan, patawarin nyo ako sir, at kung gusto niyo sir luluhod ako sa harapan niyo para mapatawad niyo lang ako. And if you want, I will attend all the meetings, Sir. Laureano: (answering in a high-pitched voice) No! It is not what I want! It is your obligation to attend all the meetings (at the same time pointing an accusing finger at Lucena). Lucena: Yes sir! But please treat me as a person sir. (at which point she started crying) Laureano: I don't want any drama here, you get out (motioning his hand for Lucena to leave the premises of the building) Lucena: Yes sir, Yes sir, but please treat me as a person. Laureano: I don't want crying ladies here, you get out. Get out! Ilabas niyo dito yan. Lucena alleged that as a result of the foregoing incident, she was confined at the Cabanatuan Family Hospital due to hypertension. In view of her ailment, she applied for sick leave on January 26, 2009 for a period of seven days. On February 17, 2009, she wrote Laureano for the payment of her salary and sales incentive pay. However, on the same day, the Officer-in-Charge of Cornworld, Ms. Rizalina C. Domingo, issued a memorandum addressed to all employees informing them of the appointment of Mr. Alan Canama (Canama) as Overseer of all offices under the Research and Development pursuant to a Board Resolution issued on January 22, 2009. Lucena asserted that with the appointment of Canama, her employment with Cornworld was left on a floating status as she had no more personality to attend meetings and head the Research and Development Department. She also claimed that threats against her person and life were made in connection with her employment with Cornworld, and that by reason thereof, she could no longer report for work. Consequently, on May 15, 2009, she was again treated for hypertension. Furthermore, on May 25, 2009, she attended the Meeting of the Private Seeds Company in Laguna, in representation of Cornworld, but two other employees were sent by Laureano to represent the company. Thus, on June 23, 2009, Lucena instituted a complaint for constructive dismissal against Cornworld and Laureano. On the other hand, petitioners argued that the company had lost its trust and confidence reposed upon respondent. Lucena was neither actually nor constructively dismissed from service. On the contrary, it was Lucena who refused to cooperate with the new management under Laureano despite occupying a very important and sensitive position in the company, to the extent that she absented herself from management meetings and sending her assistants in her stead. Lucena apparently resented the January 24, 2009 incident, and that since then she absented herself from the company and refused to report back to work, which culminated in the filing of her complaint. Before the complaint, Lucena filed three separate applications for sick leave covering the period of January 24, 2009 until March 16, 2009, but subsequently did not communicate with the company even after the expiration of her approved leave period. Petitioners exerted efforts to reach Lucena through numerous phone calls to her mobile phone which turned out futile since her phone was always turned off. She also did not provide any notice or information to the company regarding her plans with her job. Petitioners claimed that since there was no other person appointed to fill Lucena's position as Vice President for Research and Development, she could not complain that she was dismissed. The appointment of Canama on February 17, 2009 was done only to ensure the smooth and continued operations of the Research and Development Department in the company. Petitioners insisted that it was Lucena who abandoned her job and she was not dismissed, either actually or constructively.","In its February 8, 2012 Decision, the appellate court granted her Petition and held that Lucena was indeed constructively dismissed, and thus, entitled to her monetary claims and damages. The dispositive portion of the appellate court's Decision reads: WHEREFORE, the instant petition is hereby GRANTED and the NLRC Decision dated March 24, 2010 and Resolution dated July 10, 2010 are SET ASIDE. Private respondent Cornworld Breeding System Corporation is ordered to pay petitioner Lucena M. Alvaro-Ladia full backwages, inclusive of allowances and other benefits or their monetary equivalent, computed from the time her compensation was withheld from her up to the finality of Our decision, separation pay equivalent to (1) month salary for every year of service computed from the date of her dismissal until finality of Our Decision, and attorney's fees equivalent to ten (10%) percent of the total monetary award. Let the records of this case be REMANDED to the National Labor Relations Commission for determination of the backwages and other benefits, separation pay, and attorney's fees.","Even if this Court will review the merits of the instant case, We find that petitioner utterly failed to prove that the appellate court gravely abused its discretion when it issued its assailed Decision and Resolution. Thus, even assuming arguendo that this Court relaxes the procedural rules in Cornworld's favor, the petition would still be denied for lack of merit. Upon a careful review, We find that Cornworld constructively dismissed Lucena. ... We find that Cornworld failed to adduce evidence of Lucena's alleged abandonment. There was no showing by the company that she committed overt acts that clearly and unequivocally showed her intention to abandon her job. On the contrary, sufficient proof was presented by Lucena which indicated that she had no intention to sever her employment with Cornworld. These consisted of her filing of three separate applications for sick leave covering the period of January 24, 2009 to March 16, 2009. Also, Lucena lost no time in filing the instant illegal dismissal case against Cornworld on June 23, 2009... The test for constructive dismissal is whether a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to give up his position under the circumstances. In this case, this Court finds that the following instances support Lucena's claim that she was constructively dismissed: (i) the January 22, 2009 Board Resolution appointing Canama as Overseer of all offices under Research and Development clearly implied that it was meant to take Lucena's position which made her employment under floating status. This was so even before the confrontation that occurred during the January 24, 2009 meeting which prompted Lucena to avail of a sick leave; (ii) Cornworld withheld Lucena's salaries and benefits as early as February 2009 while she was still on leave but still employed with the company and thus entitled to her pay; and (iii) public ridicule and humiliation during meetings which caused a toll on her medical condition. The foregoing circumstances, among others, truly made Lucena's employment impossible and unbearable on her part as to effectively force her to forego her continued employment. ... Cornworld's assertion that Lucena's employment was severed due to loss of trust and confidence is just as unacceptable. ... We find that the company failed to show that the act of Lucena was willful, intentional, knowingly and purposely done without justifiable excuse that would have justified the company's loss of trust and confidence in her. Consequently, in view of Lucena's illegal dismissal, she is entitled to two reliefs, namely, backwages and reinstatement. However, where reinstatement is no longer feasible, such as in the instant case, separation pay shall be granted in lieu of reinstatement, as appropriately held by the appellate court.","WHEREFORE, the instant Petition is hereby DISMISSED. The assailed February 8, 2012 Decision and the July 24, 2012 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 116391 are AFFIRMED. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 247297, August 17, 2022","REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, PETITIONER, VS. HELEN BAYOG-SAITO, THE LOCAL CIVIL REGISTRY OF PASAY CITY AND THE NATIONAL STATISTICS OFFICE,* RESPONDENTS.","Helen, a Filipino citizen, and Toru, a Japanese national, were married on August 30, 1999 in Pasay City, Metro Manila. They did not have any children nor did they have conjugal properties. Due to differences in culture and nationality, their marriage did not last. After years of living separately, Toru asked Helen to sign the divorce notification papers; Helen acquiesced. Toru submitted the divorce documents to Takashi Yamaguchi (Mayor Takashi), Mayor of Minami-ku, Yokohama City. The Notice of Divorce was accepted as shown by the authenticated Japanese-language ""Certificate of Acceptance of Divorce Notification"" and its English translation duly authenticated by the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA). Thereafter, based on the two (2) documents, Kengo Fukasawa (Vice Consul Kengo), Vice Consul of the Japanese Embassy in the Philippines, issued a Divorce Certificate which was then authenticated by the DFA. On June 30, 2014, Helen filed a Petition for judicial recognition of foreign divorce decree with the RTC, docketed as Spec. Proc. No. 5105. She also sought the declaration of severance of the marital bond between her and Toru to give her the legal capacity to remarry in accordance with the right granted to her under Article 26 of the Family Code of the Philippines (Family Code).","Based on the evidence presented, the RTC in its Decision, judicially recognized the divorce decree issued to the parties in Japan and the legal capacity of Helen to remarry in accordance with the provisions of Article 26, second paragraph of the Family Code. Petitioner, through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), filed a Motion for Reconsideration from the aforementioned Decision asserting that respondent failed to satisfy the requirements under Article 26 of the Family Code, which the RTC denied. Petitioner, through the OSG, interposed an appeal to the CA asserting that absolute divorce is against public policy and cannot be recognized in the Philippines because the divorce decree was obtained jointly by respondent and her foreign spouse, thus not falling within the contemplation of paragraph 2, Article 26 of the Family Code. In its Decision, the CA denied the appeal and affirmed the ruling of the RTC, noting that the divorce decree was initiated by Toru and Helen's participation in obtaining the divorce decree was merely to accept the divorce notification by affixing her signature on the documents presented to her.","The Court denies the petition. A foreign decree of divorce may be recognized in the Philippines although the divorce decree was jointly obtained by the spouses abroad. While Philippine law does not allow absolute divorce, a divorce obtained abroad by a foreign spouse may nevertheless be recognized in our jurisdiction, provided such decree is valid according to the national law of the foreigner, pursuant to Article 26 of the Family Code. In the landmark case of Republic of the Philippines v. Manalo, the Court en banc clarified the scope of paragraph 2, Article 26 of the Family Code to even cover instances where the divorce decree is obtained solely by the Filipino spouse. Significantly, in the recent case of Galapon v. Republic, the Court clarified that pursuant to the majority ruling in Manalo, paragraph 2, Article 26 of the Family Code applies to mixed marriages where the divorce decree is: (1) obtained by the foreign spouse; (2) obtained jointly by the Filipino and foreign spouse; and (3) obtained solely by the Filipino spouse. Here, the divorce was initiated by Toru who asked Helen to sign the divorce notification papers; she agreed by affixing her signature on the documents. In effect, the parties are considered to have obtained divorce by agreement when they mutually agreed to the divorce, which is allowed in Japan. The fact of the divorce of Helen and Toru, as well as the Japanese law on divorce, had been sufficiently and satisfactorily proven by Helen.","WHEREFORE, the instant petition is DENIED. The Decision dated February 28, 2018 and Resolution dated April 30, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 108057 are hereby AFFIRMED. The foreign divorce decree between Helen Bayog and Toru Saito is hereby judicially recognized pursuant to paragraph 2, Article 26 of the Family Code, and Helen Bayog is hereby declared capacitated to remarry. The Office of the Civil Registrar of Pasay City is hereby ordered to annotate the Divorce Certificate dated October 16, 2012 on the record of marriage of Toru Saito and Helen Bayog."

PHP186,063.42[5] On August 24, 2010, NGCP filed an Urgent Ex-Parte Motion for Issuance  of Writ of Possession (with Manifestation of Compliance),[6] attaching thereto a Certification[7] issued by the Landbank of the Philippines, stating that NGCP has paid the total amount of P186,063.42, which is equivalent to 100% of the zonal value of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), in compliance with Section 2, Rule 67 of the Rules of Court. Accordingly, NGCP alleged that it is now entitled to possession of the subject property as a matter of right. Thereafter, on July 8, 2011, the RTC issued a Writ of Possession[8] placing NGCP in actual possession of the subject property.[9] Sometime in September 2012, the RTC issued an order for the appointment of commissioners who shall recommend the fair market value of the subject property for determining just compensation. Accordingly, the Board of Commissioners – composed of: (1) Engr. Gil R. Balondo, the City Development Planning Officer of Iligan City; (2) Ma. Rodora Elena A. Gimena, the City Assessor of Iligan City; and (3) Atty. Raymundo C. Capistrano (Atty. Capistrano), a Licensed Real Estate Broker residing in Iligan City – submitted and signed a Joint Commissioner's Report,[10] recommending a P60.00 per square meter (sqm.) fair market value of the subject property.[11] Based on the joint commissioner's report, the following factors were used to determine the P60.00 per sqm. fair market value recommended by the Board of Commissioners: 1. Committee on Appraisal Resolution No. 6 series of 2005 Hrs. of Rustico Quidlat Sadernas involving a 12.2275 hectares agricultural lot located at Bonbonon, appraised and valued at P 47.23 per square meter (site for Material Recovery Facility); 2.

Deed of Absolute sale between Ramon Morente and City Government of Iligan dated February 25, 2009 involving Two Thousand Sixteen square @ P 47.30 per square meter located at Bonbonon, Iligan City (access road to MRF); 4. 2005 BIR Zonal valuation of agricultural land at Bonbonon @ P 70,000.00 per hectare; 5. Deed of Absolute Sale of a portion of a parcel of residential land executed between Remedilla Pilones and Bernalda Romo involving 300 square meters @ P 133.33 per square meter dated August 31, 2010;[12] Notably, on March 17, 2014, one of the commissioners, Atty. Capistrano, submitted a separate commissioner's report,[13] recommending the amount of P300.00 per sqm. as the fair market value of the subject property, to wit: WHEREFORE, the undersigned Commissioner hereby recommend that the just compensation for the subject properties shall be as follows: 1. Lot No. 336[6]-A, d. 292 – Getulia Gaite: 6,246.26 sq.m. @ Php300.00 per square meters P1,873,878.00 2. Lot No. 5261-A, Cad. 292 – Trinidad Gaite 1,726.766 square meters @ Php300.00 per sq. meters P518,032.80 Total P2,391,910.80 The recommended price of Php300.00 per square meter includes the market value of the improvements on the subject lots.[14] In his separate commissioner's report, Atty. Capistrano justified his recommended price for just compensation by stating, among others, that pursuant to City Ordinance No. 3097, Resolution No. 900, and Resolution No. 00-1423, the land where the subject property is situated has been reclassified from open zone to ""agri-industrial.""[15] However, in the same commissioner's report, Atty. Capistrano also mentioned that according to the chairman of the City Development Office of Iligan City, the ordinance authorizing there classification of the said land has not been approved by the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board, and thus, such ordinance has not yet been implemented.[16] Moreover, in his commissioner's report, Atty. Capistrano stated that in 2009, the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) acquired a parcel of land near the subject property from a certain Macapaar Panandigan, for P250.00 per sqm.[17] On August 5, 2014, the RTC rendered its Decision,[18] adopting fully the recommendation of Atty. Capistrano in his separate commissioner's report, thus: WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered, ordering that: 1. Plaintiff is now the owner of the portions of parcels of land owned by defendants described in the Commissioners' report which were traversed by plaintiffs transmission lines, free from all liens and encumbrances; 2. Plaintiff to pay defendants the following: Lot No. 336[6]-A, d.292 – Getulia Gaite: 6,246.26 sq.m. @ Php300.00 per sq.m. P1,873,878.00 - Lot No. 5261-A, Cad. 292 - Trinidad Gaite: 1,726.766 sq.m. @ Php300.00 per sq.m. P518,032.80 - ____________ Total P2,391,910.80 ____________ (less P186,063.42 which was already received by defendants). 3. Plaintiff to pay defendants legal interest of 6% per annum on the just compensation counted from the actual taking on May 16, 2011 until fully paid. 4. Plaintiff pays each commissioner the sum of P5,000.00 as and for Honorarium. SO ORDERED.[19] (Emphases in the original) NGCP then filed its Motion for Reconsideration[20] dated September 15, 2014, but the same was denied by the RTC in its Order[21] dated June 17, 2015. Aggrieved, NGCP filed a Notice of Appeal[22] dated September 21, 2015, assailing the RTC order fixing the amount of P300.00 per sqm. as just compensation. However, on October 27, 2016, the CA issued its Resolution,[23] dismissing the appeal because of NGCP's failure to file an Appellant's Brief, thus: Considering that no Appellant's Brief has been filed as of October 19, 2016 per CMIS Verification,the instant appeal is hereby DISMISSED. This, the instant case is considered CLOSED AND TERMINATED and ORDERED stricken off from the docket of active cases of this Court. SO ORDERED.[24] On November 29, 2016, NGCP filed a Motion for Reconsideration[25] with attached Appellant's Brief,[26] but the CA denied the same for lack of merit.","The Court's Ruling The petition is meritorious. The dismissal of the case is discretionary on the part of the CA. At the outset, it bears emphasis that, as pointed out by the CA, the failure to file an appellant's brief within the prescribed period is a ground for the dismissal of an appeal. However, such dismissal is not mandatory, but merely discretionary on the part of the CA. . . In this case, and as will be further discussed below, the Court finds that there is sufficient reason to relax procedural rules in the interest of substantial justice. The determination of just compensation is a judicial function; it must be based on reliable and actual data. . . However, upon review of the records, the Court finds that the RTC erred when it adopted fully the separate commissioner's report of Atty. Capistrano. . . In this case, the Court agrees with NGCP that the separate commissioner's report of Atty. Capistrano has no factual or legal basis, and that the same is not based on actual or reliable data. To recount, the main contention of Atty. Capistrano in increasing the price of just compensation from P60.00 to P300.00 per sqm. is that the subject property is agri-industrial. However, apart from the city ordinances and sanggunian resolutions he cited – which, as admitted by Atty. Capistrano himself, have not yet been approved or implemented – Atty. Capistrano failed to adduce any evidence to support his claim that the subject property has been reclassified as agri-industrial. . . In stark contrast, NGCP was able to present evidence in the form of several tax declarations,[41] and a certification[42] from the BIR clearly showing that the subject property is agricultural land. Furthermore, it bears emphasis that upon perusal of the vicinity map/location map attached to Atty. Capistrano's commissioner's report, the land covered by the deed of sale between DPWH and Macapaar Panandigan, indicating a purchase price of P250.00 per sqm. and cited by Atty. Capistrano, is nowhere near the subject property. On the other hand,the deeds of sale, which were reviewed, analyzed, and taken into account in determining the amount of P60.00 per sqm. in the joint commissioner's report clearly indicate that the lots covered thereby are located near the subject properties and are similarly situated. To the Court's mind, it is manifestly clear that the separate commissioner's report of Atty. Capistrano, which the RTC relied upon, lacks any factual or legal basis. In turn, the Court finds that the joint commissioner's report submitted and signed by all three commissioners is more credible as it is based on actual data, and not on simple conjectures or speculations. . . Thus, in order to avoid further delay in the proceedings, and upon review of all available records, the Court deems it prudent to adopt the recommendation stated in the joint commissioner's report, setting the amount of just compensation at P60.00 per sqm. Payment of Interest As correctly adjudged by the RTC, NGCP is liable for the payment of interest on just compensation. However, with respect to the applicable interest rate, the same must be modified to twelve percent (12%) per annum from the date of taking on May 16, 2011 until June 30, 2013, and the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from July 1, 2013 until the same is fully paid. . . All things considered, NGCP is liable to pay respondents just compensation in the amount of P60.00 per sqm., or the total amount of P478,381.56, less the initial deposit of P186,063.42, with interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum from May 16, 2011 until June 30, 2013, and the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from July 1, 2013 until the same is fully satisfied.","WHEREFORE, the Petition for Review on Certiorari dated August 22, 2017 filed by National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP) is GRANTED. The Resolutions dated October 27, 2016 and May 11, 2017 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 04264-MIN are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Further, the Decision dated August 5, 2014 of the Regional Trial Court of Iligan City, Branch 3 in Civil Case No. 7365 is MODIFIED as follows: 1. NGCP is now the owner of the subject property, free from all liens and encumbrances; 2. NGCP is DIRECTED to pay respondents the following: Lot No. 3366-A, d. 292 – Getulia Gaite: 6,246.26 square meters at P60.00 per sqm. P374,775.60.

All sums due shall earn legal interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the finality of this Decision, until full payment. 4.

"G.R. No. 260912, August 17, 2022","THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, RESPONDENT.","The dispute can be traced to the Bureau of Internal Revenue's (BIR) issuance of a Preliminary Assessment Notice (PAN) for deficiency excise taxes amounting to P18,378,759,473.44, to petitioner Department of Energy (DOE) on 7 December 2018. The DOE was given fifteen (15) days to pay the assessed deficiency truces.[1] The BIR then issued a Formal Letter of Demand (FLD/FAN) for the assessed amount, received by the DOE on 17 December 2018, ten (10) days after the issuance of the PAN.[2] On 21 December 2018, the DOE responded to the BIR and asserted that it is not liable for the assessed amounts as DOE is not among those liable to pay excise truces under Section 130(A)(1) of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC). The DOE maintained that it is not the ""owner, lessee, concessionaire or operator of the mining claim,""[3] and that the agency merely grants mining rights or service contracts on behalf of the State. The DOE further contended that the subject transactions involve condensates, which are classified as liquified natural gas, that are exempt from excise taxes under Item 3.2 of BIR Revenue Regulations No. 1-2018 dated 5 January 2018.[4] On 17 July 2019, the DOE was notified by the BIR that the assessment has become final, executory, and demandable. According to the BIR, the DOE failed to file a formal protest on the FLO/FAN within the thirty (30)-day period prescribed under existing revenue rules and regulations. The BIR likewise informed DOE that the Department of Science and Technology confirmed the BIR's position that condensates are separate and distinct from natural gas, which is exempt from excise tax.[5] On 31 July 2019, the DOE replied that it has not yet received the FLD/FAN and that based on its records, the only document it received from the BIR in December 2018 was the PAN, and no further notice or communication was received from the BIR until 17 July 2019.[6] The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) issued the two assailed warrants on 19 September 2019.[7] This prompted the DOE to write the BIR. In its letter received by the BIR on 8 October 2019, the DOE recounted the exchanges between the two agencies and reiterated that it has yet to receive the FLD/FAN, from which the period for protest should be reckoned. The DOE claimed that the premature actions of the BIR deprived it of due process. Additionally, the DOE maintained that as natural gas is exempt from excise taxes, condensates which refer to a liquified form of natural gas, must similarly be exempt. Assuming arguendo that condensates are not so exempt, the DOE is not the entity liable for excise taxes as it is not the owner, lessee, concessionaire, operator, or service contractor of the mining claim.[8] Finding no other recourse from the Warrants issued by the CIR, on October 18, 2019, the DOE filed a Petition for Review (with Urgent Motion for Suspension of Collection of Taxes), with the CTA assailing the said warrants. The CTA Second Division dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction. The CTA recognized that the matter was governed by this Court's ruling in Power Sector Assets and liabilities Management Corporation v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue (PSALM v. CIR),[9] and that as such the CTA is not the proper forum to resolve what it characterized as a purely intra-governmental dispute. The DOE filed its Motion for Reconsideration which was likewise denied for lack of merit on 30 January 2020. Following the dismissal, on 21 February 2020, the BIR filed a Money Claim for the assessed deficiency excise tax amounting to P18,378,759,473.44 with the Commission on Audit (COA), citing the finality of its assessment against the DOE.[12] In the pleadings filed before the COA, which the DOE included in its submissions, it was finally clarified that the FLO/FAN was indeed served on the DOE, albeit not through the DOE's Records Management Division, which is its centralized receiving and releasing unit for all communications. The FLO/FAN was served through one of the DOE's employees, who according to it was not authorized to receive the same. As a result, the document was not routed properly and remained unknown to the concerned offices of the agency until the BIR alluded to the same in subsequent communications.[13] On 28 February 2020, the DOE filed a Petition for Review before the CTA En Banc. In its Decision dated 4 November 2021, the CTA En Banc affirmed its Division's earlier Resolutions.[14] Following the denial, the DOE filed a Motion for Reconsideration on 3 December 2021. The CTA En Banc, through the Resolution dated 24 May 2022, denied the DOE's prayer to set aside the 4 November 2021 Decision for lack of merit.[15] On June 9, 2022, petitioner DOE filed the present Petition for Review under Rule 45 before the Court.[16]","Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assailing the Decision, dated 4 November 2021, and the Resolution, dated 24 May 2022, of the Court of Tax Appeals en banc, in CTA EB No. 2241 (CTA Case No. 10198). The assailed Decision and Resolution dismissed the Petition for Review filed by the petitioner Department of Energy, against the Warrants of Distraint and/or Levy and Garnishment issued by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, for lack of jurisdiction over the dispute involving two national government agencies – the Department of Energy and the Bureau of Internal Revenue. Upon consideration of these points, the Court finds no reversible error on the part of the public respondent CTA. Hence, the Petition must be denied.","The Court holds that all disputes, claims, and controversies, solely between or among executive agencies, including disputes on tax assessments, must perforce be submitted to administrative settlement by the Secretary of Justice or the Solicitor General, as the case may be. The CTA correctly steered clear of the case as it lacked jurisdiction over this dispute between the DOE and the BIR. It also correctly gave precedence to the provisions of P.D. No. 242,[21] now embodied in the Revised Administrative Code, which especially deals with the resolution of disputes, claims, and controversies between departments, bureaus, offices, agencies, and instrumentalities of the government, and carves out such disputes from the jurisdiction of the CTA, as provided in the NIRC and R.A. No. 1125. This case falls squarely within the purview of PSALM v. CIR,[22] and the assailed Resolution of the CTA is consistent with our pronouncement therein. As will be hereafter discussed, the ratiocinations and conclusions of this Court, reflected therein, to this day remain valid and indisputable. Hence, PSALM remains good law and need not be revisited by this Court. Special Laws prevail over General Laws P.D. No. 242, as incorporated in the Revised Administrative Code in Chapter 14, Book IV, should prevail as against laws defining the general jurisdiction of the CTA, i.e., R.A. No. 1125,[23] as amended, and the NIRC. This is consistent with the fundamental rule that special laws prevail over general laws. P.D. No. 242 deals specifically with the resolution of disputes, claims, and controversies where the parties involved are the various departments, bureaus, offices, agencies, and instrumentalities of the government.","WHEREFORE, the Petition is DENIED. The Decision, dated 4 November 2021, and the Resolution, dated 24 May 2022, of the Court of Tax Appeals en banc in CTA EB No. 2241 (CTA Case No. 10198) are AFFIRMED."
"G.R. No. 223743, August 17, 2022","JOSE ROMEO C. ESCANDOR, PETITIONER, V.S. HON. CONCHITA CARPIO MORALES, SEC. EMMANUEL F. ESGUERRA AND CINDY SHEILA C. GAMALLO,","Private respondent Cindy Sheila Gamallo (Gamallo), a contractual employee at the National Economic and Development Authority, Regional Office No. 7 (NEDA 7), filed a complaint for violation of Republic Act No. 7877 (Anti-Sexual Harassment Act of 1995) on 23 September 2004 before the Office of the Ombudsman-Visayas (OMB-Visayas) against petitioner Jose Romeo C. Escandor, the Regional Director of NEDA 7. Gamallo alleged that starting around July 1999, petitioner committed a series of sexual harassment acts, including grabbing her hand, hugging and kissing her, expressing his love and desire for her, touching her thigh, trying to kiss her on the lips at a Christmas party, asking her out on dates, and sending persistent inappropriate text and Winpop messages (e.g., 'I miss you', 'I love you more everyday'). Gamallo's co-employees corroborated her account. As a result of the pressure, Gamallo resigned in November 2003, especially after petitioner filed administrative cases against her husband. Petitioner denied the allegations, claiming the complaint was retaliatory, invented, and that the alleged acts had prescribed. The OMB-Visayas found substantial evidence that petitioner was guilty of grave misconduct and dismissed him from government service in a Decision dated 21 March 2007. Petitioner appealed this decision to the Court of Appeals (CA), raising issues regarding jurisdiction and due process. The CA affirmed the OMB-Visayas Decision on 23 December 2014 and denied reconsideration on 22 February 2016.","The Court of Appeals rendered the impugned 23 December 2014 Decision, dismissing the petition for want of merit and affirming the Decision and Order dated 21 March 2007 and 17 September 2007, respectively, of the Office of the Ombudsman-Visayas.","The Supreme Court denied the Petition for Review on Certiorari. First, the Court ruled that the Office of the Ombudsman has jurisdiction over the administrative aspect of the sexual harassment complaint under the 1987 Constitution and RA 6770, covering all forms of malfeasance committed by public officers, and CSC Resolution No. 01-0940 does not divest the Ombudsman of this authority. The Court also found that petitioner waived any objection to jurisdiction by actively participating in the OMB proceedings and raising the issue only in a supplemental motion for reconsideration. Second, the Court found that the finding of grave misconduct was established by substantial evidence, noting the rule that factual findings of the OMB are generally accorded great weight. Furthermore, the Court relied on the findings in the related criminal case, *Escandor v. People*, where petitioner was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Republic Act No. 7877 based on the same facts and evidence. By parity of reasoning, if the higher standard of proof (beyond reasonable doubt) was met in the criminal case, the lower standard (substantial evidence) required for the administrative case was certainly satisfied. Petitioner willfully violated RA 7877 and flagrantly disregarded established rules, making him guilty of grave misconduct, punishable by dismissal from service.","WHEREFORE, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is hereby DENIED. The Decision dated 23 December 2014 and the Resolution dated 22 February 2016 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CEB-SP. No. 03304 are AFFIRMED."

before the then-Bureau of Patents, Trademarks and Technology Transfer, seeking the cancellation of the following trademark certificates of registration issued to Cymar:

1. Trademark Certificate of Registration No. 48144 issued on May 4, 1990 covering the trademark FARLIN

(image different from text), for baby products such as feeding bottles, nipples (rubber and silicon), funnel, nasal aspirator, breast reliever, ice bag and training bottles;

5. Trademark Certificate of Registration No. 8328 issued on July 18, 1990 covering the trademark FARLIN LABEL, for cotton buds, with colors blue, green, pink, yellow and gray.

[7]

In the five petitions, Farling alleged that: 1) the FARLIN (image different from text) trademark is a coined word based on its corporate name;

[8]

2) it is the rightful owner of the FARLIN (image different from text) trademark, which has been registered in the Republic of China since October 1, 1978; 3) Cymar fraudulently obtained the assailed Certificates of Trademark Registration with full knowledge that Farling is the true owner of the FARLIN (image different from text) trademark;

[9]

and 4) the issuance of the assailed Certificates of Trademark Registration violates the Paris Convention for the Protection of Intellectual Property (Paris Convention), of which the Philippines is a signatory.

Cymar answered that: 1) having used the FARLIN (image different from text) trademark since January 5, 1983, it is the actual first user thereof in the Philippines;...

with the IPO, for cotton buds, cotton balls, absorbent cotton/cotton roll under class 5, feeding bottles, feeding nipples, pacifiers, teethers, training cup, multistage training cup, spill proof cup, silicone spoon, fork and spoon set, diaper clip, feeding bottle cap, ring, feeding bottle hood under class 10, sterilizer set under class 11, disposable diapers under class 16 and toothbrush, milk powder container, powder case with puff, rack and tongs set, tongs under class 21.

[49]

On December 19, 2006, Farling filed a Verified Notice of Opposition, citing the 2003 DG-IPO Decision as affirmation of its previous claims about the ownership and prior registration of the FARLIN (image different from text) trademark, as well as the agreements it entered into with Cymar.

[50]

The case was docketed as IPC No. 14-2006-00188. ... 2007 Opposition Case (G.R. No. 219072) On April 23, 2003, while the 1994 Cancellation and 2006 Opposition Cases were still pending with the DG-IPO, Cymar filed an application for registration of the composite mark ""FARLIN DISPOSABLE BABY DIAPERS (With Mother & Child Icon)""

with the IPO, for disposable baby diapers under Class 16 of the International Classification of goods.

... 2008 Opposition Case (G.R. No. 228802) On August 22, 2007, still during the pendency of the 1994 Cancellation Case and the 2006 and 2007 Opposition Cases, Cymar filed an application for registration of the mark ""FARLIN BLUE BUNNY AND BUNNY DEVICE"" with the IPO, thus:

Cymar's application covered the following goods: sterilizer sets (Class 11); feeding bottles, feeding nipples, pacifiers, teethers, training cup, multi-stage training cup, spill proof cup, silicone spoon, fork and spoon set[,] diaper clip, feeding bottle cap ring, feeding bottle hood (Class 10); cotton buds, cotton balls, absorbent cotton/cotton roll (Class 5); disposable diapers (Class 16); and toothbrush, milk powder container, powder case with puff, rack and tongs set, and tongs (Class 21).

[86]

On August 26, 2008, Farling filed a Verified Notice of Opposition, still reiterating the arguments it raised in the 1994 Cancellation Case, which were sustained in the 2005 CA Decision.

[87]","In fine, Cymar not only failed to adduce substantial evidence of inequitable conduct by Farling, but was itself guilty of inequitable, nay, fraudulent conduct.","In view of this distributorship relation, the DG-IPO and the CA correctly ruled that Cymar cannot claim prior use of the FARLIN (image different from text) mark in the Philippines. As early as 1974, the Supreme Court has already held that an ""exclusive distributor does not acquire any proprietary interest in [its] principal's trademark.""[212] ... The facts in Superior are essentially the same as in the case at bar, with two slight differences: 1) no infringement case was filed here; and 2) Farling had no pending Philippine application for registration of the FARLIN (image different from text) mark which it could have assigned to Cymar; rather, Cymar represented to Farling that it would register said mark in the Philippines in the latter's name. ... Given the timing and circumstances of Cymar's applications, it is obvious that they were filed with full knowledge of Farling's history of use of the FARLIN (image different from text) mark, and therefore, in bad faith. Moreover, by representing itself as the prior user of the FARLIN (image different from text) mark, even with full knowledge of its distributorship relation with the actual prior user, Cymar deliberately made a false claim in its trademark applications, which amounts to fraud. ... the Authorization cannot serve as basis for any claim of trademark rights in favor of Cymar, because it did not give Cymar any right to use FARLIN (image different from text) as a visible sign to distinguish the goods it sells or produces. ... Farling's oppositions fall under all three situations contemplated by Section 134, in that it claims damage through: 1) Cymar's incorporation of the FARLIN (image different from text) mark in the opposed marks; 2) prejudice to the goodwill generated in the FARLIN (image different from text) mark by the eleven-year distribution of Farling's products in the Philippines by Cymar; and 3) registration of the opposed marks in bad faith, with full knowledge of Farling's use of the FARLIN (image different from text) mark.","WHEREFORE, the present petitions are hereby DENIED.

Lot No. 23315 was owned in common by Nemesio Segundo (Nemesio), Francisca Segundo, heirs of Donata Segundo, and heirs of Luciano Segundo, one of whom is Felipa.[8] Delfino possessed the subject property until INEC placed sand, gravel, and other building materials to convert it into residential and/or commercial land.[9] For her part, Concepcion insisted that Delfino never became the owner of the subject property.[10] She narrated that her husband, Nemesio, owns an undivided one-half portion of Lot No. 23315. Meanwhile, the other half belongs to two (2) other persons.[11] After Nemesio's death, she became the sole owner of her husband's share. Then, she sold the 8,000 sq.m. portion of her share[12] to INEC on May 27, 1991.[13] INEC confirmed Concepcion's allegations and maintained that it purchased the subject property from Concepcion in good faith. INEC added that its land differs from the land described in Delfino's complaint.[14] A Board of Commissioners (Board) was created to determine the metes and bounds of the lands claimed by the parties. The Board engaged the services of Geodetic Engineer Florencio C. Gamiao (Engineer Gamiao) to survey the lot.[15] On April 23, 1994, Engineer Gamiao and the parties went to the subject property (first ocular inspection). Engineer Gamiao noted discrepancies in the boundary descriptions. On November 15, 1993, Engineer Gamiao conducted another ocular inspection to ascertain where is the land in suit (second ocular inspection). The parties identified the same portions of Lot No. 23315, so Engineer Gamiao concluded that they were claiming the same parcel of land.[17] On March 7, 1994, Delfino died, and he was substituted by his son, Neil Benjamin Andres (Neil).[18] Claiming to be Delfino's sole heir, Neil entered into a compromise agreement with INEC on December 21, 1998, pending his motion for substitution.[19] 1999 RTC Br. 15 Order On January 26, 1999, Neil and INEC filed a joint motion to admit the compromise agreement.[20] RTC Branch 15 approved the motion and issued an order based on the compromise agreement (1999 RTC Br. 15 Order) on January 28, 1999. Annulment of 1999 RTC Br. 15 Order Two years later, or on February 15, 2001, respondents Cynthia Gertrudes Andres-Ranjo and Elma Andres Marañon (Andres sisters) filed a petition[22] seeking the annulment of the 1999 RTC Br. 15 Order with the CA. As the legally adopted children of Delfino, the Andres sisters vehemently protested that the compromise agreement would deprive them of their share in the property.[23] On November 20, 2001, the CA granted the petition and annulled the 1999 RTC Br. 15 Order, thus: WHEREFORE, premises considered, the present petition is hereby GIVEN DUE COURSE and accordingly GRANTED. The Order dated January 28, 1909 approving the Compromise Agreement in Civil Case No. 10140-15 is hereby ANNULED and SET ASIDE. Respondent Judge is hereby ORDERED to try and hear with utmost dispatch the said Civil Case No. 10140-15 as if a timely motion for new trial by the petitioners had been granted therein. No pronouncement as to costs. SO ORDERED.[24] The CA's decision became final and executory on February 26, 2002.[25] Remand of Civil Case No. 10140-15 to RTC Br. 15 On February 24, 2003, Andres sisters filed a complaint-in-intervention[26] in Civil Case No. 10140-15 with the RTC Branch 15, praying for the award of two-thirds (2/3) of the subject property, among others.[27] Meanwhile, Neil and INEC failed to file their respective answers. Andres sisters presented their evidence ex parte.[29] 2008 RTC BR. 15 ORDER On March 28, 2008, RTC Branch 15 rendered a decision[30] in favor of Andres sisters. The dispositive portion of the RTC's decision provides: WHEREFORE, premises considered, the plaintiffs intervenors CYNTHIA GERTRUDES ANDRES RANJ[O] and ELMA ANDRES MARANON are hereby declared lawful owners by succession to two thirds (2/3) of the SOUTHF,R[N] PORTION CONSISTING OF 10,000 SQUARE METERS OF LOT NO. 23315 OF THE LAOAG CADASTRE fine property in suit]. Defendants are likewise ordered to pay plaintiffs-intervenors the sum of [P20,000.00] as attorney's fee and the costs of suit. SO ORDERED.[31] COURT OF APPEALS RULING On appeal with the CA, INEC argued that the RTC had no factual and legal reasons to support its findings that Andres sisters own two-thirds (2/3) of the subject property.[32] In a July 21, 2011 Decision, the CA modified the RTC's ruling to specify that the subject property is located at the southeastern portion of Lot No. 23315.[37] The CA also deleted the grant of attorney's fees and ruled in this wise: WHEREFORE [,] in view of the foregoing, the instant APPEAL is PARTIALLY [sic] GRANTED . The Decision ""dated March 28, 2008 rendered by the Regional Trial Court of Laoag City, Branch 15, First Judicial Region, in Civil Case No. 10140-15 is hereby MODIFIED in that the portion awarded to the appellees is the southeastern portion of Lot No. 23315 and the award of attorney's fees is hereby DELETED. SO ORDERED.[38] Dissatisfied, INEC moved for reconsideration on August 11, 2011. For the first time, it submitted a certified copy of a separate decision[39] issued by RTC Branch 14 on November 11, 2003, in Cadastral Case No. 47-14 involving Lot No. 23315 (2003 RTC Br. 14 Decision) as the basis of its ownership, notwithstanding its availability before RTC Br. 15 issued a decision in 2008. Thereupon, RTC Branch 14 confirmed INEC's title over the 8,700 sq.m. southeastern portion of Lot No. 23315.[40] INEC argued that since the Andres sisters failed to question the 2003 RFC Br. 14 Decision within one (1) year, following Section 32 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1529, its title had become incontrovertible. In a February 3, 2012 Resolution,[43] the CA denied INEC's motions for reconsideration and mediation. Hence, this recourse.","In their petition for certiorari under Rule 45, Ilocos Norte Electric Cooperative (INEC) assails the Court of Appeals (CA) July 21, 2011 Decision[1] and February 3, 2012 Resolution,[2] which upheld the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Laoag City, Branch 15's March 28, 2008 Decision[3] declaring respondents Cynthia Gertrudes Andres-Ranjo and Elma Andres Marañon to be the owners of two-thirds (2/3) of the southeastern portion of Lot No. 23315.","We deny the petition. This Court has emphasized that it is not a trier of facts. It will only entertain questions of law in petitions filed under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. Absent any showing that the lower courts' findings are baseless or erroneous as to constitute palpable error or grave abuse of discretion, the Court will refrain from analyzing and weighing the evidence all over again. Here, INEC raises questions of fact that are beyond the ambit of this Court's jurisdiction in a petition for review on certiorari. At any rate, we find no reason to disturb the CA and RTC's findings that Andres sisters are entitled to two-thirds (2/3) of the subject property. The parties claim the same portion of Lot No. 23315. INEC's contention that the parcels of land claimed by the parties are different has no merit. Records show the parties agreed during the second ocular inspection that they are claiming the same property. The records likewise reveal that the properties claimed by the parties are both on the southeastern portion of Lot No. 23315. There is no doubt, therefore, the parcels of land claimed by the parties are the same. Delfino and his heirs are the rightful owners of the subject property. Basic considerations of justice, fair play, and due process dictate that issues or questions of fact may not be raised for the first time on appeal. Here, INEC argued that it is the registered owner of the subject property based on the 2003 RTC Br. 14 Decision confirming its ownership over the 8,700 sq. m. southeastern portion of Lot No. 23315. INEC only raised the issue of registration for the first time in its Motion for Reconsideration[69] with the C A, and the CA no longer resolved the issue. Similarly, the Court may not pass upon INEC's registration claim without violating Andres sisters' right to due process. Even if the Court considers the 2003 RTC Br. 14 Decision, INEC's arguments must still fail. Apart from the copy of the decision, no evidence was presented to prove that a decree of registration was issued in INEC's favor. The one-year period under Section 32 of PD No. 1529 refers to the decree of registration issued by the Commissioner of Land Registration[73] — not the cadastral court's decision. Therefore, it is premature for INEC to claim that it is the registered owner of the subject property absent any decree of registration. This brings the Court to conclude that INEC has no better right over the subject property on the strength of the 2003 RTC Br. 14 Decision. In the circumstances, the Court upholds the CA's application of primus tempore, potior jure (first in time, stronger in right). Inarguably, the sale of the subject property to Delfino was made as early as 1957, and the sale to INEC was made on a much later date, or on May 27, 1991. Indeed, Delfino has a better right over the subject property under the principle of primus tempore, portior jure. Delfino's ownership of the subject property is further bolstered by the tax declarations for the years 1956, 1970, 1974, 1980, 1985, 1994, and 2002.[77] For these reasons, the Court upholds the CA's findings that Delfino is the rightful owner of the subject property. Upon Delfino's death, his rights over the subject property are transmitted to his legal heirs.[79] Considering that Neil, Cynthia, and Elma are Delfino's children, they inherited the subject property in equal shares.[80] Necessarily, they became co-owners of the subject property.[81] INEC's right over the subject property is limited to Neil's share. The compromise agreement is contrary to law because it deprived Andres sisters of their lawful share in the subject property. Neil also executed the Compromise Agreement in bad faith when he alleged that, he is Delfino's only survivor. Anent Neil's disposition of his rights and interests over the subject property, the law on co-ownership only allows him to alienate his share in the thing owned in common. In other words, he can only transfer his 1/3 portion of the subject property to INEC. Therefore, INEC is only entitled to 1/3 of the subject property. Regarding the remaining 2/3 portion of the property, Andres sisters retain their ownership over the 2/3 portion of the subject property since they did not consent to the disposition of the property in INEC's favor. Since the subject of the compromise agreement is Delfino's unregistered land, INEC's claim of good faith is immaterial. All things considered, the Court upholds Andres sisters' right over the 2/3 portion of the subject property. Meanwhile, INEC is only entitled to 1/3 of the property.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED. The Court of Appeals' Decision dated July 21, 2011 and Resolution dated February 3, 2012 in CA-G.R. CV No. 94338 are affirmed. SO ORDERED."
"A.C. No. 6281, August 16, 2022","VALENTIN C. MIRANDA (DECEASED), COMPLAINANT, V.S. ATTY. MACARIO D. CARPIO, RESPONDENT.","On September 26, 2011, the Court issued a Decision[1] suspending respondent Atty. Macario D. Carpio (Respondent) from the practice of law for a period of six (6) months, and ordering him to return to complainant Valentin C. Miranda (Complainant) the owner's duplicate copy of Original Certificate of Title No. 0-94 (Owner's Duplicate Copy). The Court found Respondent guilty of unjustly holding on to the Owner's Duplicate Copy despite repeated demands from Complainant. Respondent's objective, according to the Court, was to force Complainant to agree to an exorbitant attorney's fee. On November 28, 2013, the Court received a letter[2] from Complainant manifesting that Respondent has still failed and refused to obey the Decision of the Court ordering him to return the Owner's Duplicate Copy. Adopting the Report and recommendation[5] of the Office of the Bar Confidant (OBC), the Court issued a Resolution[6] dated January 15, 2020, further suspending Respondent for an additional period of six (6) months, and again directing him to return the Owner's Duplicate Copy to Complainant. Meanwhile, on January 7, 2020, the OBC received a letter[9] dated December 12, 2019 from the widow of Complainant, Blecilda D. Miranda[10] (Blecilda), apprising the Court of Respondent's continued defiance and failure to return the Owner's Duplicate Copy.[11] Respondent filed a Comment to Notice with the Attached Unsigned Letter of Mrs. Blesilda Miranda[13] wherein he manifested that on July 23, 2018, Respondent went to the address of Complainant at 689 San Francisco Street, Brgy. Daniel Fajardo, Las Piñas City, but was not able to locate him. Respondent claimed that since he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and underwent surgery on July 28, 2018, he has been bedridden and unable to walk unassisted or to travel, rendering him completely unable to personally deliver the Owner's Duplicate Copy to Complainant in Las Piñas City. According to Respondent, to show his good faith to comply, he is surrendering the Owner's Duplicate Copy to the Court, for safekeeping, until the authorized recipient of the document is identified considering the untimely death of Complainant. The Court notes, however, that Respondent did not attach the Owner's Duplicate Copy to his most recent submission.","After a careful review of the ratiocinations forwarded by Respondent, the Court again finds Respondent guilty of willful disobedience of lawful court orders. [...] All told, after failing to comply with the orders of the Court for several years, the Court deems it proper to impose the harsher penalty of indefinite suspension. The Court finds no justifiable excuse for Respondent's patent and brazen disregard and disrespect of lawful court orders, in violation of Section 27, Rule 138 of the Rules of Court and Canon 11 of the CPR.","WHEREFORE, premises considered, ATTY. MACARIO D. CARPIO is SUSPENDED INDEFINITELY for Willful Disobedience of Lawful Orders of the Court in violation of Section 27, Rule 138 of the Rules of Court and Canon 11 of the Code of Professional Responsibility. Further, ATTY. MACARIO D. CARPIO is ORDERED, under pain of contempt, to surrender the owner's duplicate copy of Original Certificate of Title No. 0-94 to the Court within ten (10) days from receipt of this Resolution. ATTY. CHRISTINE P. CARPIO-ALDEGUER, an officer of the Court, is also ORDERED, under pain of contempt, to ensure that her client/father, ATTY. MACARIO D. CARPIO, promptly complies with the Court's directive. Finally, let copies of this Resolution be furnished to: the Office of the Bar Confidant to be appended to ATTY. MACARIO D. CARPIO's personal record as an attorney; the Integrated Bar of the Philippines for its information and guidance; and the Office of the Court Administrator for circulation to all courts in the country. SO ORDERED.","ATTY. MACARIO D. CARPIO is SUSPENDED INDEFINITELY for Willful Disobedience of Lawful Orders of the Court in violation of Section 27, Rule 138 of the Rules of Court and Canon 11 of the Code of Professional Responsibility."
"A.M. No. RTJ-20-2582 (Formerly A.M. No. 20-06-74-RTC), August 16, 2022","OFFICE OF THE COURT ADMINISTRATOR, COMPLAINANT, VS. PRESIDING JUDGE HERMES B. MONTERO, BRANCH CLERK OF COURT ATTY. MA. GAY A. ERNI- PUENTENEGRA; AND PROCESS SERVER ANNABELLE U. RODRIGUEZ, ALL OF THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, TOLEDO CITY, CEBU, BRANCH 59, RESPONDENTS.","This administrative matter arose from the findings of two (2) judicial audits conducted by the complainant Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) on the Regional Trial Court, Toledo City, Cebu, Branch 59 (RTC Toledo Br. 59), where Presiding Judge Hermes B. Montero (Judge Montero), Branch Clerk of Court Atty. Ma. Gay A. Erni-Puentenegra (Atty. Erni-Puentenegra),
[1]
and Process Server Annabelle U. Rodriguez (Rodriguez; collectively referred to as respondents) are stationed. The first judicial audit was conducted on July 9-11, 13, 2018 pursuant to Travel Order No. 88-2018 dated June 27, 2018; while the second judicial audit was held on May 23 to June 1, 2019 pursuant to Travel Order No. 75-2019 dated May 17, 2019.
[2]
Due to the unconfirmed reports from Cebu City that RTC Toledo Br. 59 is regarded as ""friendly"" to the patties of annulment of marriage/declaration of void marriage cases, the first judicial audit was conducted therein.
[3]
As a result thereof, various irregularities were discovered, leading the OCA to direct the respondents to show cause as to why no disciplinary action should be taken against them, as follows:
(a) As against Judge Montero, for his procedural infractions in cases involving annulment of marriages and/or declaration of nullity of marriages, namely: (1) failure of trial court to acquire jurisdiction over the person of the respective respondent in those cases; (2) absence of returns on summonses; (3) grant of motions to take the depositions of the plaintiff prior to the receipt of the notice of appearance of the Office of the Solicitor General; (4) absence of an order directing the public prosecutor to investigate whether there was collusion between the parties; and (5) the absence of the collusion report. In addition, Judge Montero was directed to take appropriate action in thirty- seven (37) criminal cases and one (1) civil case where no action was taken since they were raffled to RTC Toledo Br. 59; twelve (12) criminal cases without further action for a considerable length of time; twenty-nine (29) pending motions in criminal cases and seven (7) in civil cases; and eighteen (18) civil cases already submitted for decision.
[4]
(b) As against Atty. Erni-Puentenegra, for her procedural infractions in the aforementioned cases involving annulment of marriages and/or declaration of nullity of marriages. She was likewise directed to: (l) promptly apprise Judge Montero of the cases that require immediate action, including those with pending motions or incidents, and the cases submitted for decision; and (2) to take appropriate action on the mismanagement of various case records, including, among others, the stitching of all records/folders.
[5]
(c) As against Rodriguez, for immediately availing of substituted service of summons, and merely making general statements in her returns without indicating the various circumstances justifying a resort to substituted service. She was likewise directed to show proof of her travel to serve the summonses in seven (7) other cases.
[6]
Complying with the aforementioned directive, Judge Montero wrote letters dated February 28, 2019
[7]
and March 18, 2019
[8]
where he admitted having committed procedural lapses. However, he reasoned that due to his heavy caseload, he merely relied on the returns of the summonses and failed to monitor its validity. Further, he was not aware of any procedural lapses because the judicial audit team did not call his attention thereto. He stated that he immediately complied with all the directives of the OCA after receipt of the Memorandum, and cured the procedural defects raised therein.
[9]
For her part, Atty. Erni-Puentenegra wrote a letter
[10]
dated February 18, 2019 explaining that: (a) summonses were personally served by the sheriff, and the service through publication was availed of only when personal service was unsuccessful; (b) annulment of marriage cases were only set for pre-trial once all of the documents were on hand, and the delays in the belated attachment of the registry receipts to the records were due to lack of manpower; and (c) she complied with the requests of the OCA, including the transmittal of summons and copy of the petition when the address of the respondents is beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the court.
[11]
Finally, Rodriguez sent a letter
[12]
dated September 10, 2019, explaining that she had been with the RTC Toledo Br. 59 since July 21, 1994 as a Utility Worker. While she was officially promoted to the position of Process Server only on March 1, 2020, she had already performing functions related to such position as early as November 2, 2016, after Sheriff Melvin Destura (Sheriff Destura) retired from service, and that it was Sheriff Destura who served the summons by publication in the questioned case, and she merely continued that practice.
[13]
As regards the proof of travel, Ms. Rodriguez complied by attaching the copy of her flight tickets. Notably, either no boarding pass was attached or if a copy was attached, no details as to the name of the guest, place of departure, flight number, date and time of the boarding, were included.
[14]
Meanwhile, the OCA conducted the second judicial audit, which uncovered further irregularities in Judge Montero's performance of his duties, particularly: (a) his failure to require the accused in at least 141 decided drug cases to undergo the required drug dependency examination under A.M. 18- 03-16-SC
[15]
before the rendition of decisions therein; and (b) his continued failure to act on cases pending before his sala. Thus, the OCA again directed him to show cause as to why no disciplinary action should be taken against him.
[16]
In his defense, Judge Montero explained in his letter
[17]
dated September 2, 2019 that there is only one accredited drug rehabilitation center in Cebu City, and the delay in the release of the drug dependency examination results as reported by the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology personnel would have made the accused to serve their sentence. As such, only when the accused is charged with a violation of Section 5, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165 would he require the accused to undergo drug testing. On the other hand, for those who are not subject of probation, he would issue warrants of arrest for the service of their sentence.
[18]
Further, in a Joint Affidavit
[19]
of Judge Montero, along with the public prosecutors assigned to RTC Toledo City Br. 59, the public prosecutors manifested that they were aware of the absence of the drug dependency examination requirement under the plea bargaining framework of drugs cases, however, such omission was not fatal since the convicted prisoners who applied for probation were required to undergo drug testing by the Parole and Probation Office. The affidavit submitted by the public attorneys assigned to the subject court substantially echoed the same statement.
[20]
The OCA Report and Recommendation In a Memorandum
[21]
dated February 20, 2020, the OCA recommended that respondents be found administratively' liable, and consequently, penalized as follows: (a) as for Judge Montero, that he be found guilty of gross ignorance of the law, due to his willful disregard of the law and his undue delay in rendering decisions and resolving motions. While he should be dismissed from service, the OCA noted that since Judge Montero opted to retire from service effective November 1, 2019, such penalty of dismissal could no longer be imposed on him; and hence, he is instead meted with the accessory penalties of forfeiture of his retirement benefits, except accrued leave credits, and perpetual disqualification from re-employment in any public agency, including government-owned or controlled corporation; (b) as for Atty. Erni-Puentenegra, that she be found guilty of simple neglect of duty and be fined in the amount of P262,671.00 to be paid within thirty (30) days from finality of the resolution of her administrative case; and (c) as for Rodriguez, that she be found guilty of neglect of duty and be suspended from office for a period of six (6) months, without salary and allowances, and sternly warned that a repetition of the same or similar acts shall warrant a more severe penalty.
[22]","The Court adopts the findings of the OCA with certain modifications, as will be explained below.
I.
At the outset, it is important to note that on February 22, 2022, the Court En Banc unanimously approved A.M. No. 21-08-09-SC, entitled ""Further Amendments to Rule 140 of the Rules of Court."" On April 3, 2022, the publication requirement thereof had already been complied with;
[27]
hence, Rule 140, as further amended is already effective.
In this relation, Section 24 of Rule 140, as further amended explicitly provides that it will apply to all pending and future administrative disciplina1y cases involving Members, officials, employees, and personnel of the Judiciary, to wit:
SECTION 24.
Retroactive Effect.
-
All the foregoing provisions shall be applied to all pending and future administrative cases involving the discipline of Members, officials, employees, and personnel of the Judiciary,
without prejudice to the internal rules of the Committee on Ethics and Ethical Standards of the Supreme Court insofar as complaints against Members of the Supreme Court are concerned. (emphasis and underscoring supplied)
In view of the foregoing, the Court shall resolve this case under the framework of Rule 140, as further amended.
II-A.
At this juncture, it bears pointing out that during the pendency of this case, Judge Montero applied for and was granted optional retirement effective November 1, 2019.
[28]
This, however, will not preclude the Court from determining his administrative liability, pursuant to Section 2 (2) of Rule 140, as further amended, which provides that ""once disciplinary proceedings have already been instituted, the respondent's supervening retirement or separation from service shall not preclude or affect the continuation of the same xxx.""
As such, the Court shall now proceed with the determination of Judge Montero's administrative liability.
As the OCA aptly found, Judge Montero exhibited a blatant and repeated disregard of even the most elementary rules of procedure in annulment and declaration of nullity of marriages cases, as well as drugs cases. Particularly, insofar as annulment and declaration of nullity of marriages cases are concerned, Judge Montero proceeded with the hearings thereof despite the presence of glaring,. if not fatal, irregularities, such as failing to acquire jurisdiction over the person of therein respondents due to improper service of summonses, not having the required collusion report, and not waiting for the Notice of Appearance of the OSG. In this regard, the OCA is correct in giving scant consideration to Judge Montero's defense that he merely relied on the report of his staff regarding the validity of the service of summonses, considering that as a magistrate, he is expected to have a strong grasp and understanding of the law and rules of procedure, and he cannot pass the determination of the validity of summonses to rank-and-file personnel who are not legal experts.
[33]
On the other hand, insofar as drugs cases are concerned, records show that Judge Montero would resolve such cases even without making therein accused undergo the required drug dependency examination. Verily, Judge Montero's repeated breaches of the express provisions of A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC and A.M. No. 18-03-16-SC are so glaring, egregious, and thoughtless, and hence, are already tantamount to bad faith and/or grave abuse of authority. As such, it is only proper that he be found administratively liable for gross ignorance of the law or procedure under Section 14 (j) of Rule 140, as further amended.
In addition to the foregoing, the OCA further noted that Judge Montero should be found administratively liable for Undue Delay in Rendering an Order, pointing out that: (a) in SPCA-T-06, the motion for the issuance of writ of possession, which was received by the RTC Toledo Br. 59 on July 16, 2014, remains unresolved despite the Order dated May 4, 2015 setting the case for possible settlement; and (b) Civil Case No. T-2553, an appealed case for ejectment is still unresolved despite the filing of the memorandum for the defendant-appellant therein on April 16, 2019.
[34]
Given the foregoing jurisprudential definitions of the types of neglect of duty, and further considering that: (a) the aforementioned incident and case has already been pending for years; and (b) Section 15 (1), Article VIII
[36]
of the 1987 Constitution only gives him three (3) months to resolve the same, the Court finds Judge Montero also liable for gross neglect of duty in the performance or non-performance of official functions under Section 14 (d) of the Rules.
11-B.
As correctly recommended by the OCA, Atty. Erni-Puentenegra and Rodriguez should be found liable for ""simple neglect of duty in the performance or non-performance of official functions"" under Section 15 (b) of Rule 140, as fu1iher amended for their failure to comply with the existing rules on service of summons and the proper performance of their court functions as Branch Clerk of Court and Process Server, respectively.
Clearly, Atty. Erni-Puentenegra failed to give proper attention to a task expected of her and was remiss in her duties as a Branch Clerk of Court, i.e., failure to monitor returns of summonses, her oversight in the indorsement of summonses to proper office of the clerk of court having territorial jurisdiction over the respondents, and not flagging Judge Montero about the defective summonses, and absence of collusion reports and notice of appearance of the OSG. Nevertheless, her act did not exhibit the want of slightest care or willfulness that would make her liable for gross neglect. Rather, it was the result of her carelessness. At this point, it must be stressed that the fact of Atty. Erni-Puentenegra's supervening separation from the Judiciary due to her appointment as City Prosecutor of Toledo City, Cebu on August 29, 2019
[40]
will not operate to moot the instant administrative disciplinary proceedings against her, in accordance with Section 2 (2) of Rule 140, as further amended as already discussed above.
Finally, as to Rodriguez, case law instructs that a process server ""serves court processes such as subpoena, subpoena duces tecum, summons, court order and notices; prepares and submits returns of service of court process; monitors messages and/or delivers court mail matters received and dispatched by him; and performs such other duties as may be assigned to him.""
[41]
Thus, case law instructs that a process server who is unable to serve mail matters should be found guilty of simple neglect of duty for failing ""to give proper attention to a required task.""
[42]
— such as what Rodriguez did here. Verily, Rodriguez' defense that she only followed the practice of former Sheriff Destura cannot be given any credence as the violation or non-observance of laws and rules shall not be excused by disuse, custom, or practice to the contrary.
[43]","Since the respective administrative liabilities of respondents had already been established by substantial evidence — or ""that amount of relevant evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion""
[44]
— the Court now goes to the proper imposable penalties on them.
As to Judge Montero, he is found liable for the administrative offenses of ""gross ignorance of the law or procedure"" and ""gross neglect of duty in the performance or non-performance of official functions,"" both are serious charges under the Rules
[45]
punishable by any of the following sanctions: (a) dismissal from service, forfeiture of all or part of the benefits as the Supreme Court may determine, and disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office, including government-owned or -controlled corporations.
Provided, however,
that the forfeiture of benefits shall in no case include accrued leave credits; (b) suspension from office without salary and other benefits for more than six (6) months but not exceeding one (1) year; or (c) a fine of more than P100,000.00 but not exceeding P200,000.00.
[46]
Furthermore, since Judge Montero is found liable for more than one (1) offense arising from separate acts or omissions in a single administrative proceeding, the Court shall impose on him separate penalties for each offense.
[47]
Finally, Section 18 of Rule 140, as further amended provides that if the respondent is found liable for an offense which merits the imposition of dismissal from the service but the same can no longer be imposed due to the respondent's supervening separation from service except of death, he or she may be meted with the following penalties in lieu of dismissal: (a) forfeiture of all or part of the benefits as the Supreme Court may determine, and disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office, including government-owned or controlled corporations, except for accrued leave credits; and/or (b) a fine in the amount of more than P100,000.00 but not exceeding P200,000.00.
In view of the foregoing, and further considering that the penalty of dismissal from service could no longer be imposed on Judge Montero due to his supervening optional retirement, the Court penalizes him as follows: (a) for ""gross ignorance of the law or procedure,"" he is meted out with the penalties of forfeiture of all the retirement and other benefits due him, except accrued leave credits, and disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office, including government-owned or -controlled corporations, plus a fine in the amount of P200,000.00; and (b) for ""gross neglect of duty in the performance or non-performance of official functions,"" he is meted out with the penalty of a fine, also in the amount of P200,000.00.
As for Atty. Erni-Puentenegra and Rodriguez, they are equally found liable for the administrative offense of ""simple neglect of duty in the performance or non-performance of official functions,"" which is a less serious charge under the Rules
[48]
punishable by either: (a) suspension from office without salary and other benefits for not less than one (1) month nor more than six (6) months; or (b) a fine of more than P35,000.00 but not exceeding P100,000.00.
[49]
Since Atty. Erni-Puentenegra has already separated from the Judiciary and hence, can no longer be suspended, she is meted out with a fine in the amount of P100,000.00. On the other hand, Rodriguez is meted out with a penalty of suspension from office without salary and other benefits for a period of six (6) months, as recommended by the OCA.","WHEREFORE,
the Court rules as follows:
1. 	Respondent Judge Hermes B. Montero, then Presiding Judge of the Regional Trial Court of Toledo City, Cebu, Branch 59, is GUILTY of Gross Ignorance of the Law or Procedure, and accordingly, is meted with the penalties of FORFEITURE of all the retirement and other benefits due him, except accrued leave credits, and DISQUALIFICATION from reinstatement or appointment to any public office, including government-owned or - controlled corporations, plus a FINE in the amount of P200,000.00. He is also found GUILTY of Gross Neglect of Duty in the Performance or Non
Performance of Official Functions, and accordingly, is meted out with the penalty of a FINE in the amount of P200,000.00;
2. 	Respondent Atty. Ma. Gay A. Erni-Puentenegra, then Branch Clerk of Court of the Regional Trial Court of Toledo City, Cebu, Branch 59, is GUILTY of Simple Neglect of Duty in the Performance or Non-Performance of Official Duties, and accordingly, is meted out with the penalty of a FINE in the amount of P100,000.00; and
3. 	Respondent Annabelle U. Rodriguez, Process Server of the Regional Trial Court of Toledo City, Cebu, Branch 59 is GUILTY of Simple Neglect of Duty in the Performance or Non-Performance of Official Duties and accordingly, is meted out with the penalty of SUSPENSION from office without salary and other benefits for a period of six (6) months.

TYRONE DELA CRUZ Y RESURRECION, JEZREEL JIMMY CUEVAS, SANDY VIÑESA AND JOHN DOE, ACCUSED, TYRONE DELA CRUZ Y RESURRECION AND SANDY VIÑESA, ACCUSED-APPELLANTS.","Accused-appellants, co-accused Jezreel Jimmy Cuevas (Cuevas), and a certain John Doe were charged with the crime of Kidnapping for Ransom under Article 267 of the RPC in an Information dated December 16, 2013 which reads:

""That on or about the 9th day of August 2013, at around 11:00 o'clock in the evening, in Barangay Pansol, Calamba, Laguna, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above[-]named accused, being then private individuals, conspiring and confederating together with JOHN DOE, whose true identity and present [whereabouts] are still unknown[,] and mutually helping and aiding one another, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously, for the purpose of extorting ransom in the amount of Thirty Million Pesos (Php30,000,000.00) from the family of SPOUSES JASON EDWARD TAY HUANG and ELISA DELA CRUZ HUANG, kidnap, carry away, detain and deprive said SPOUSES JASON EDWARD TAY HUANG and ELISA DELA CRUZ HUANG, the latter being a female, of their liberty without authority of law, against their will and consent, which ransom payment eventually reduced to Eight Hundred Sixty Seven Thousand Pesos ([Php]867,000.00), given and delivered to the accused.

CONTRARY TO LAW.""

When arraigned, both Dela Cruz and Viñesa entered pleas of not guilty to the charge against them. The case as against co-accused Cuevas was archived, he having remained at large.

Despite private complainants' manifestation about their respective affidavits of desistance, the RTC proceeded to try the case on the merits.

The Prosecution’s Evidence

Police Chief Inspector Jeffrey Fallar (PCI Fallar) of the Philippine National Police Anti-Kidnapping Group (PNP-AKG) testified that on August 9, 2013, he received a report from a certain Jenny Dela Cruz that her sister, Elisa Dela Cruz Huang (Elisa), and brother-in-law, Jason Edward Tay Huang (Jason) (collectively, Spouses Huang), were kidnapped. The Luzon Field Unit of the PNP-AKG then conducted an assessment of the case.

On August 10, 2013, at around 10:30 a.m., the kidnappers released Elisa in Cavite. Following their standard operating procedure, police officers from the PNP-AKG fetched Elisa and brought her to Camp Crame in Quezon City for initial briefing. There, she alleged that she was released by the kidnappers in order to raise the ransom money for Jason's liberty. In the presence of the police authorities, Elisa negotiated a deal with the kidnappers with the ransom money pegged at P867,000.00. Afterwards, the kidnappers instructed her to proceed to the South Luzon Expressway for the payoff.
En route
to the agreed place, the members of the PNP-AKG closely followed Elisa's car.

While in transit, the police authorities noticed a white Honda Civic vehicle bearing Plate No. WKV-152 constantly tailing Elisa's car. After a while, Elisa parked her car at a Shell gasoline station. The driver of the Honda Civic vehicle tailing Elisa's car followed. At the Shell parking area, the driver of the Honda Civic vehicle and one of its passengers alighted; after a while, both again boarded the vehicle but changed seats. Elisa's car started to move again and the Honda Civic followed. When Elisa almost reached the Petron gasoline station along the expressway, she dropped off the ransom money. One passenger of the white Honda Civic vehicle, later identified as Viñesa, retrieved the ransom money from the ground along the bridge near the gasoline station.

Later that evening, the kidnappers released Jason. Thereafter, Elisa, Jason, and their helper, Albert Serrado (Albert), executed their respective affidavits regarding the case.

The police authorities made a search as to the ownership of the white Honda Civic vehicle in order to identify the perpetrators of the crime. Upon investigation, they learned that Dela Cruz had acquired the vehicle from a certain Jun Cacanando (Jun) who was engaged in the business of buying and selling used cars. Police Officer III Maleo David Manzano (PO3 Manzano) testified that Jun was able to confirm the identity of Dela Cruz through photographs obtained by the police authorities from the latter's Facebook account. Moreover, PCI Jonel Guadalupe (PCI Guadalupe), Police Senior Inspector Nestor Acebuche, and Senior Police Officer IV Jaybruce Gadit also confirmed that the person appearing in the photographs was the same person they saw at the Shell gasoline station standing with three other male persons near the Honda Civic vehicle. Ultimately, Jason and Albert positively identified Dela Cruz as one of the kidnappers through the same photographs.

A further investigation led the police authorities to
Barangay
Sibulan, Nagcarlan, Laguna where, through
Barangay
Chairman Ariel Barrios, the police authorities were able to find and positively identify Viñesa as one of the kidnappers.

The Defense’s Evidence

Dela Cruz and Viñesa raised the defense of denial, viz.:

8. On 25 September 2013, Barangay Chairman ARIEL BARRIOS (Chairman Barrios) of Barangay Sibulan where (sic) having a session at the barangay hall when members of the Anti-Kidnapping group arrived and told him that they wanted to talk to accused Sandy Viñesa (Sandy). The operatives kept asking Sandy about his relationship with co-accused Tyrone Dela Cruz (Tyrone), but the former denied their inquiries. As the operatives failed to get the answers they wanted from Sandy, they told the latter that if he would not cooperate, he should just wait for his warrant.","Assailed in this ordinary Appeal[1] is the Decision[2] dated March 20, 2019 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 10251 which affirmed the Decision[3] dated November 17, 2017 of Branch 92, Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Calamba, Laguna that found accused-appellants Tyrone Dela Cruz y Resurrecion (Dela Cruz) and Sandy Viñesa (Viñesa) (collectively, accused-appellant) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Kidnapping for Ransom under Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).

In the Decision[19] dated March 20, 2019, the CA affirmed the RTC Decision in toto. It ruled that:

In the case at bench, the commission of the crime was duly established by the mass of circumstantial evidence adduced by the prosecution. We find highly dubious and illogical the execution by Jason and Elisa in their Affidavits of Desistance declaring that they had merely misappreciated the facts as previously narrated in their respective Sinumpaang Salaysay. True it is that the police officers adduced no witness to the actual abduction of Jason and Elisa, but it is equally true that they were the very members of the PNP-AKG who received the initial report from Elisa's sister regarding the kidnapping incident, and conducted the necessary assessment procedure therefor. The police officers likewise fetched Elisa at the time she was released, witnessed her negotiate with appellants as regards the ransom money, and even accompanied her during the payoff where they perceived appellants' identities using their own senses. (italics in the original)

Thus, the CA concluded that the prosecution was able to establish the guilt of accused-appellants beyond reasonable doubt, notwithstanding the lack of interest of the Spouses Huang to prosecute the case.","The appeal is without merit.

In light of the above-mentioned circumstances, the Court finds no cogent reason to overturn the findings of the RTC, as affirmed by the CA, absent a clear showing that the lower courts had overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied some facts or circumstances of weight or substance that could have altered the outcome of the case. [26] The Court also agrees with the lower courts' conclusion that accused-appellants acted in conspiracy with two other persons to kidnap and detain the Spouses Huang in order to extort ransom money in exchange for their liberty.

Finally, the Court finds the absence of Spouses Huang's testimonies inconsequential to overturn accused-appellants' conviction considering the positive testimonies of the police officers who fetched Elisa when she was released by the kidnappers, personally witnessed her negotiate her husband's release, and accompanied her during the payoff of the ransom money. These testimonies cannot be considered as hearsay evidence, [31] as the defense posits, [32] simply because the prosecution's witnesses testified based on their personal knowledge, derived from their own perceptions of the incidents leading to and during the payoff of the ransom money.

Accused-appellants should be convicted of two counts of Kidnapping for Ransom.

Here, the Court notes that there was only one Information filed against accused-appellants for the kidnapping of Spouses Huang for the purpose of extorting ransom money. There is thus duplicity of the crimes charged in the Information. The records, however, do not show that accused-appellants objected to the duplicity of the Information by filing a motion to quash before their arraignment. Hence, they are deemed to have waived such defect. [40] In this connection, Section 3, Rule 120 of the Rules of Court provides:

SEC. 3. Judgment for two or more offenses. — When two or more offenses are charged in a single complaint or information, and the accused fails to object to it before trial, the court may convict him of as many offenses as are charged and proved, and impose on him the penalty for each offense, setting out separately the findings of fact and law in each offense.

The penalty for the crime of Kidnapping for Ransom under Article 267 of the RPC is death. In view of Republic Act No. (RA) 9346, which prohibited the imposition of the death penalty, the Court hereby imposes against accused-appellants the penalty of reclusion perpetua in lieu of death for each count. The phrase 'without eligibility for parole' is attached to qualify reclusion perpetua where the death penalty is warranted but is not imposed because of RA 9346, as in this case, pursuant to A.M. No. 15-08-02-SC.

As to the award of damages, the Court deems it proper to increase the amounts of civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages to P100,000.00 each for every count of Kidnapping for Ransom, in conformity with prevailing jurisprudence.","WHEREFORE, the appeal is DISMISSED. The Decision dated March 20, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 10251 is hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION in that accused-appellants Tyrone Dela Cruz y Resurrecion and Sandy Viñesa are found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of two counts of Kidnapping for Ransom under Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code, and sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua, without eligibility for parole, for each count. Accused-appellants Tyrone Dela Cruz y Resurrecion and Sandy Viñesa are further ordered to pay, jointly and severally, P867,000.00 as actual damages, and for each count of Kidnapping for Ransom: P100,000.00 as civil indemnity, P100,000.00 as moral damages, and P100,000.00 as exemplary damages. All monetary awards shall earn legal interest rate of 6% per annum from the finality of this Decision until fully paid. SO ORDERED."

PISTON and PNTOA joined as petitioners-in-intervention.","The Petition in G.R. No. 206486 is GRANTED. The Petitions in G.R. Nos. 212604, 212682, and 212800 are DISMISSED.

The power of Congress to delegate the execution of laws has long been recognized by this Court. E.O. No. 125, as amended, expressly vested upon the DOTC the delegated power to establish and prescribe rules and regulations for the enforcement of laws governing land transportation, including the penalties for violations thereof. The laws contain sufficient standards (completeness test and sufficient standard test). There is no invalid exercise of police power; consequently, the fines and penalties found therein cannot be considered as oppressive and arbitrary in nature. The issuance of D.O. No. 2008-39 and JAO No. 2014-01 is a legitimate exercise of delegated police power by the DOTC, aimed at promoting public safety and general welfare by eradicating colorum vehicles. The fees and charges are principally for regulatory and not for revenue purposes (not a tax). D.O. No. 2008-39 and JAO No. 2014-01 are not vague or overbroad, as the challenged provisions pass constitutional muster and may be understood when read in conjunction with other related issuances. D.O. No. 2008-39 and JAO No. 2014-01 are not violative of substantive due process, as the determination of the fines relates to the wisdom and efficiency of the orders, which are matters beyond this Court's power of judicial review, and the right to operate motor vehicles is a privilege, not a property right. D.O. No. 2008-39 and JAO No. 2014-01 are not violative of the equal protection clause, as the classifications (e.g., between PUVs with pending renewals vs. first-time applicants) rest on substantial distinctions and apply equally to all members of the same class.","WHEREFORE, the Petition in G.R.

The prosecution, through PO1 Delbo, alleged that during a buy-bust operation on July 21, 2015, accused-appellant sold him one heat-sealed transparent plastic sachet containing shabu for P500.00. Upon arrest, PO1 Delbo confiscated a plastic container which contained 11 additional sachets of white crystalline substance. The items tested positive for metamphetamine hydrochloride. The defense denied the charges, claiming that she was arrested while buying gas for her scooter and was dragged away by police officers. She asserted she saw the drugs for the first time at the SOG office and believed she was targeted because her estranged husband, Aurelio Casa, Jr., was engaged in selling illegal drugs.","The RTC, in its March 28, 2017 Decision, found accused-appellant GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the offense of illegal sale and delivery of 0.13 gram of shabu in violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 and illegal possession of 10.99 grams of shabu in violation of Section 11, Article II of RA 9165.

The apprehending team failed to justify the transfer of the inventory venue from the place of seizure to the police station (giving only conflicting and general excuses like 'security purposes' and 'a lot of people in the area'). Additionally, the prosecution failed to satisfy the requisites of the saving clause, having failed to establish justifiable grounds for noncompliance, and failing to prove the preservation of the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items due to breaks in the first link (irregular marking) and fourth link (lack of details on handling, storage, and preservation by the forensic chemist).","The appeal is GRANTED.

[G.R. No. 206118]
GAMES AND AMUSEMENTS BOARD (GAB), PETITIONER, VS. MERIDIEN VISTA GAMING CORPORATION, RESPONDENT.","Cagayan Economic Zone Authority (CEZA) granted Meridien Vista Gaming Corporation (Meridien) a license to conduct gaming operations such as jai alai within the Cagayan Special Economic Zone and Freeport (CSEZFP), as well as ""to set up [jai alai] betting stations in any place [or off-­frontons] as may be allowed by law ."" Subsequently, however, the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel (OGCC) apprised CEZA that it has no power to authorize, license, operate, and regulate jai alai in the absence of an express legislative franchise. Consequently, CEZA revoked the license and directed Meridien to stop all its gaming operations. Meridien questioned the revocation before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Aparri, which issued a writ of mandamus directing CEZA ""to allow [Meridien] to continue with its gaming operations in accordance with the license granted ."" This judgment lapsed into finality due to the negligence of CEZA's counsel. CEZA then availed of the remedy of relief from judgment, but was denied by the RTC and the CA. Recourse to the Court was taken through an appeal on certiorari , docketed as G.R. No. 194962 , wherein CEZA argued for the full ventilation of its case instead of merely being adjudged bound by the negligence of its counsel. In a Decision dated January 27, 2016 , the Court found merit on CEZA's petition for relief from judgment, and accordingly, directed the CA to give due course to CEZA's mandamus on appeal. Meanwhile, GAB's Anti-Illegal Gambling Unit initiated an investigation on reported jai alai betting stations in different parts of the country, and discovered 13 off-frontons in Metro Manila and the Rizal Province operating under Meridien without permit from GAB. A show cause order was then issued against the owners, operators, managers, or other responsible officers of these off-frontons to explain why they should not be criminally prosecuted under Republic Act (RA) No. 954, and their establishments be ordered closed. In response, the respondents argued that GAB has no regulatory authority over them as they operate under a CEZA­-given license. After hearing, GAB sustained its authority to supervise and regulate jai alai activities regardless of the CEZA-given license, and accordingly issued a Cease-and-Desist Order (CDO). Meridien filed a Complaint for Injunction with Application for the Issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) or Writ of Preliminary Injunction (WPI) before the RTC of Aparri to enjoin the CDO, mainly arguing that GAB has no regulatory author1ty over Meridien's gaming operations under the CEZA-given authority. A 72-hour TRO was issued, which was later extended for 17 days. The RTC also subsequently issued a WPI. GAB moved for the dismissal of the case on jurisdictional grounds, to wit: (1) the RTC of Aparri has no territorial jurisdiction to enjoin the CDO as it was directed against off-frontons in Metro Manila and some parts of the Rizal province; and (2) the RTC has no jurisdiction to review a final order of a quasi-judicial agency under Rule 43 of the Rules. The Motion to Dismiss was, however, denied. GAB then filed a Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition before the CA, docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 119842 , to set aside the injunction and the Order denying its Motion to Dismiss on jurisdictional grounds. In a Decision dated August 18, 2011, the CA ruled that the RTC patently lacked jurisdiction over the case, and also exhaustively discussed and sustained GAB's regulatory authority over Meridien's jai alai activities within and beyond the CSEZFP. It disposed, thus: WHEREFORE, IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the instant Petition is GRANTED . The assailed [provisional injunctive Orders and the Order dismissing GAB's motion to dismiss] are REVERSED AND SET ASIDE . Accordingly, [Meridien's] Complaint for Injunction filed with the RTC is DISMISSED . SO ORDERED. (Italics and emphases in the original) Meridien filed a Motion for Reconsideration (MR), questioning the CA's affirmance of GAB's authority over its jai alai activities. With a vote of 3-2 in a Division of Five, the CA modified its Decision and partially granted Meridien's MR in a Resolution dated September 11, 2012. The CA maintained that the RTC acted with grave abuse of discretion when it took cognizance of the Complaint for Injunction. It also sustained its ruling on GAB's regulatory authority over Meridien's jai alai activities, but qualified that it has no authority within CSEZFP as it is CEZA that has authority therein: WHEREFORE , in view of the foregoing, the instant Motion is partially GRANTED and the assailed Decision dated 18 August 2011 is accordingly MODIFIED . Thus, the authority of the [GAB] over the Jai­Alai Games of [Meridien] does not extend inside the [CSEZFP]. SO ORDERED. (Emphases supplied) This time, GAB moved for Reconsideration, arguing that the partial grant of Meridien's MR revived the nullified injunctive Orders, effectively restraining the enforcement of the CDO within the CSEZFP. GAB pointed out that the CDO cannot be reviewed as it was already final and executory when Meridien failed to file an appeal in accordance with Rule 43. GAB thus sought reinstatement of the CA Decision dated August 18, 2011, which the CA denied. In a Resolution dated March 5, 2013, by the same vote of 3-2, the CA explained that it did not revive the injunctive Orders, but merely clarified that the CDO itself reflects that it was not meant to be enforced inside the CSEZFP. Despite this clarification, however, the CA reiterated its ruling on GAB's lack of regulatory authority inside the CSEZFP, thus: WHEREFORE , in view of the foregoing, the instant Motion for Reconsideration filed by [GAB] is hereby DENIED for lack of merit. SO ORDERED. (Emphases in the original) The Resolutions dated September 11, 2012 and March 5, 2013 of the CA in CA-G.R. SP No. 119842 are now the subject of the Petition in G.R. No. 206118 . Meantime, in response to the SILG's query regarding the legality of Meridien's gaming operations outside the CSEZFP, the SOJ issued DOJ Opinion No. 24. The SOJ opined that under the CEZA-given license, as upheld by the RTC of Aparri, Meridien was authorized to operate off-frontons ""only if it is allowed by law."" Since RA No. 954 expressly prohibits and criminalizes off-fronton operations, ""Meridien can only set up its jai alai betting/gaming stations within the premises of the place enclosure, or fronton where the basque pelota game is held, i.e. , x x x inside the CSEZFP."" In this light, the DOJ and DILG issued Joint Memorandum Circular No. 001-2011 (Joint Memorandum), which basically directs the concerned public officers to: (1) deny Meridien's applications for business permits for off-fronton operations and cancellation of those already issued; (2) close off-frontons, seize devices used for their operations, and arrest their operators and maintainers; and (3) prosecute violators of RA No. 954 with dispatch. Meridien filed a Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition before the CA docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 120236 to annul the DOJ Opinion No. 24 and the Joint Memorandum. On July 22, 2011, the CA issued a 60-day TRO against the implementation of the Joint Memorandum. Subsequently, in a Rcsolution dated September 20, 2011, Meridien's application for the issuance of a WPI was granted considering the pendency of G.R. No. 194962 wherein a related issue was raised, i.e. , whether Meridien can continue with its jai alai activities, including its off-fronton operations, by virtue of the CEZA-given 1icense, thus: WHEREFORE, considering that the issues involved in the present petition are closely interrelated with the issues raised in G.R. No. 194962 now pending before the Supreme Court , let a Writ of Preliminary Injunction be issued enjoining the Secretary of Justice (DOJ) and the Secretary of the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG), and their agents and/or representatives from implementing the. Joint DOJ-DILG Memorandum To All Public Prosecutors, Law Enforcement Officers and Local Government Executives dated June 27, 2011, upon the filing of a bond in the amount of Five Hundred Thousand Pesos (P500,000.00), for any damage that may be sustained by the [SOJ and SILG], by reason of the injunction, if the Court will finally decide that [Meridien] is not entitled thereto. x x x x SO ORDERED. (Emphasis supplied) The SOJ and SILG's MR was denied in a Resolution dated November 14, 2011. Hence, the Resolution dated September 20, 2011 and Resolution dated November 14, 2011 in CA-G.R. SP No. 120236 are now questioned in G.R. No. 199972 .","This resolves: (1) G.R. No. 199972 — a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court (Rules), wherein Leila M. De Lima (SOJ), in her capacity as then Secretary of the Department of Justice (DOJ), and the late Jesse M. Robredo (SILG) as then Secretary of the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG), question the Resolution dated September 20, 2011 and the Resolution dated November 14, 2011 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 120236; and (2) G.R. No. 206118 — a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules, wherein the Games and Amusement Board (GAB) assails the Resolution dated September 11, 2012 and the Resolution dated March 5, 2013 in CA-G.R. SP No. 119842.","I. In G.R. No. 199972, the Petition is partly meritorious. A. Judicial courtesy is not a ground for the issuance of a WPI. The CA was in error [in issuing a WPI based on judicial courtesy]. Since the issues in these pending cases are not related, the CA's adherence to the principle of judicial courtesy was plainly improper. Judicial courtesy is neither a substitute nor a ground for the issuance of a WPI under the Rules. . . In this case, the CA failed to take into account that Meridien does not have an existing clear legal right or even an ostensible right to continue with its off-fronton operations enjoined by the questioned Joint Memorandum. . . Verily, Meridien has no clear or ostensible legal right to operate jai alai activities outside the CSEZFP to warrant the injunctive relief sought. B. The CA must resolve the substantive issues in the main case. We hold that this question of jurisdiction must be decided in that forum. The present Petition merely involves an interlocutory matter, i.e. , the validity of the CA's issuance of a WPI. Hence, its resolution should be confined to the necessary issue/s without delving into the merits of the main case before the lower court. Accordingly, the CA should now proceed to resolve the issue on whether it has jurisdiction over the subject matter of the case, and in the affirmative, whether the SOJ and SILG committed grave abuse of discretion in issuing the Joint Memorandum. II. A. The CDO was not altered when the CA clarified its coverage. Clearly, it is incorrect and misleading for GAB to claim that the clarification on the CDO's coverage is a review or an alteration of the final and executory CDO. . . Briefly, the CA committed no reversible error in clarifying that the CDO only covers off-frontons. B. The CA had no jurisdiction to rule on GAB's authority. The CA's ruling on GAB's authority, not the clarification of the CDO's coverage, constitutes an improper review of the CDO. Regardless of the CDO's coverage, it was not within the purview of the certiorari and prohibition proceedings to adjudicate the propriety of GAB's exercise of regulatory authority over Meridien's jai alai activities. . . In sum, we cannot affirm the CA's Decision dated August 18, 2011, as well as the assailed Resolutions, in its entirety. While we uphold the clarification of the CDO's coverage, the discourse on GAB's authority must be set aside for lack of jurisdiction.","ACCORDINGLY , the Court resolves as follows: In G.R. No. 199972, the Petition for Certiorari is PARTIALLY GRANTED . The Resolution dated September 20, 2011 and Resolution dated November 14, 2011 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 120236 are NULLIFIED and SET ASIDE . Accordingly, the questioned Writ of Preliminary Injunction is LIFTED , and the Court of Appeals is DIRECTED to proceed with the resolution of the case with reasonable dispatch. In G.R. No. 206118, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED . The Decision dated August 18, 2011, Resolution dated September 11, 2012, and Resolution dated March 5, 2013 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

"G.R. No. 259061, August 15, 2022","SPS. SALVADOR AND LEONIDA M. BANGUG AND SPS. VENERANDY ADOLFO• AND JESUSA ADOLFO, PETITIONERS, VS. GEORGE DELA CRUZ, RESPONDENT.","The instant case originated from a complaint for recovery of possession filed by respondent George dela Cruz [(George)] against [petitioners] before the MTCC. Respondent [George], as plaintiff below alleged that he was the registered owner of a 2,172 square-meter parcel of land covered by Transfer Certificate of Title [(TCT)] No. T-388110, situated in Barrio Manaring, Ilagan City, Isabela. The said property was part of a bigger parcel of land originally owned by his grandmother, Cayetana Guitang [(Cayetana)]. When Cayetana died [sometime in 1935], the land was adjudicated to [respondent George's] father, Severino [d]ela Cruz [(Severino)], by virtue of intestate succession, evidenced by an affidavit of adjudication in 1982. In 1983, Severino executed a deed of reconveyance, which subdivided the parcel of land into five areas, transferring Lot 1-A to respondent [George]. During the lifetime of Severino, petitioner Leonida [Bangug (Leonida)] asked permission to temporarily build a house on a vacant portion of the property; petitioner [Venerandy Adolfo (Venerandy)] asked permission to occupy a portion thereof and build a temporary structure for storing corns. In 2011, respondent [George] demanded that the petitioners vacate, but to no avail. In their answer, petitioners herein, as defendants below averred that Cayetana had other heirs: namely, Luisa, Hermina, Juana, Rufina, and Juliana. Rufina, the mother of petitioner Leonida, and Juliana, the mother of petitioner [Venerandy], both allowed their children to build their houses on the subject property. Petitioners argued that Severino's adjudication of the property solely to himself was invalid, and thus, the deed of reconveyance was invalid, claiming they have the right to possess the subject property as co-owners. After trial, the MTCC granted George's complaint, holding that petitioners' possession was merely upon tolerance and that their allegations regarding Severino's adjudication constituted an indirect or collateral attack on George's title. The RTC affirmed the MTCC's findings. Petitioners appealed to the CA, arguing they had a better right of possession having inherited the property ab intestato from Cayetana. The CA affirmed the RTC Decision, holding that George, as the Torrens title holder, had a preferential right of possession and that the manner of attack against his title was a prohibited collateral one. Petitioners filed an MR which the CA denied in its Resolution dated February 10, 2022. Hence, the present Rule 45 Petition.","WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED. The assailed Decision of the RTC is AFFIRMED. IT IS SO ORDERED.","The Petition is partly meritorious. The Court rules that the issue of ownership may be provisionally passed upon in an accion publiciana to determine who between the party-litigants has a better right to possess the property in dispute, and this provisional resolution does not trigger a collateral attack on the Torrens title (citing Heirs of Alfredo Cullado v. Gutierrez). Since petitioners alleged that Cayetana had seven children (including Severino and petitioners' mothers, Rufina and Juliana), Severino's claim in the Affidavit of Adjudication that he was the sole heir is ineffective, and consequently, the Deed of Reconveyance is defective. The Court provisionally finds that a co-ownership existed among the seven children of Cayetana, and since petitioners derived their rights from their mothers (who were Cayetana’s children), petitioners and respondent George are co-owners of the land left by Cayetana. Petitioners, being recognized provisionally as co-owners, cannot be ejected from the subject property by respondent George, who is himself a co-owner (citing Anzures v. Spouses Ventanilla). Until the land previously owned by Cayetana is correctly partitioned, they cannot be ejected therefrom. The Court reiterates that the findings herein on the issue of ownership are merely PROVISIONAL.","WHEREFORE, the Petition is hereby GRANTED. Accordingly, the Decision dated November 5, 2020 and Resolution dated February 10, 2022 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 164563 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The Complaint filed by respondent George dela Cruz against petitioners Sps. Salvador and Leonida M. Bangug and Sps. Venerandy Adolfo and Jesusa Adolfo in Civil Case No. 1627 before the Municipal Trial Court in Cities, Ilagan City, Isabela is hereby DISMISSED for lack of cause of action. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 243310, August 15, 2022","BITANAGAN FARMERS AGRARIAN REFORM BENEFICIARIES ASSOCIATION, ETC., PETITIONER, VS. HACIENDA BITANAGAN, ETC., RESPONDENT.","On March 20, 1989, Hacienda Bitanagan filed with the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) an Application for Deferment from the coverage of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) of three parcels of land: Lot Nos. 3-A-5, 3-A-4, and F-11-05-008043, covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) Nos. T-206 (T-3047), T-207 (T-3048), and P-13524, respectively. These lands are located in Barangay Dahican, Mati, Davao Oriental, with an aggregate area of 285.5785 hectares. On February 28, 1996, Hacienda Bitanagan, as represented by Pablo Rabat (Rabat), filed an Application for Exclusion. Thereafter, the vehicle containing the records fell off a cliff in Puntalinao, Banaybanay, Davao Oriental due to a vehicular accident. In a June 16, 2003 letter, Municipal Agrarian Reform Officer (MARO) Felipe Gaviola of Mati, Davao Oriental informed Rabat of the incident, along with a request for the reconstruction of the pertinent documents. On December 6, 2007, Hacienda Bitanagan filed its reconstituted Application for Exclusion. On November 15, 2010, Regional Director Datu Yusoph B. Mama (Regional Director Mama) issued an Order approving the application for exclusion. On June 23, 2011, Bitanagan Farmers Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries Association (Bitanagan Farmers Association) filed a Notice of Appeal with the Office of the DAR Secretary. On November 25, 2012, the DAR Secretary issued an Order reversing Regional Director Mama's Order and denying Hacienda Bitanagan's application for exclusion, ruling that the Regional Director lacked jurisdiction (area exceeds 5 ha, governed by AO No. 1, Series 2004) and the land was not exclusively devoted to cattle raising (copra selling was also part of its business). The DAR Secretary denied Hacienda Bitanagan's application for exclusion due to the presence of agricultural activity in the subject landholdings. On February 16, 2015, the Office of the President dismissed Hacienda Bitanagan's appeal, affirming the DAR Secretary's findings. Hacienda Bitanagan filed a Petition for Review before the Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals partially granted the Petition on December 15, 2017, modifying the OP decision by declaring the RD's Order VALID in so far as it granted exclusion over Lot No. 3-A-4, applying DAR Administrative Order No. 09-1993 based on the doctrine of prospectivity. On October 25, 2018, the Court of Appeals amended its Decision and held that Lot No. 3-A-5 and Lot No. F-11-05-008043 are also exempted from CARP coverage, having considered the lots as a whole. Hence, Bitanagan Farmers Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries Association filed a Petition for Review before this Court.",the Petition is GRANTED.,"The Court of Appeals wrongly applied the principle of prospectivity of judicial decisions... Department of Agrarian Reform v. Sutton did not establish a new doctrine. It merely affirmed the pronouncement in Luz Farms v. Secretary of Department of Agrarian Reform that livestock and poultry industry are outside the coverage of the constitutionally-mandated agrarian reform program of the government. Thus, the Court of Appeals should have determined whether there is an operative fact that would have extended the effects of Administrative Order No. 9, Series of 1993 to respondent's application. The operative fact doctrine does not apply in this case. An examination of the records shows that respondent was at fault in the delay of the resolution of its application for exclusion. Its subsequent actions after having been informed of the loss of its application show that it took advantage of such loss... Applying the operative fact doctrine will give respondent undue advantage even after it prevented the Department of Agrarian Reform from resolving its application for exclusion. Since the reconstituted application was filed in 2007 during the effectivity of Administrative Order No. 1, Series of 2004, respondent's application for exclusion should be resolved based on the parameters of that issuance. We agree with the DAR Secretary that respondent's application should have been filed with the DAR Central Office since the landholdings subject of its application have an aggregate area of 285.5785 hectares, which is beyond the jurisdiction of DAR Regional Director. Thus, the Regional Director's grant of respondent's application for exclusion did not attain finality because it is void for lack of jurisdiction. Furthermore, the requirement of actual, direct, and exclusive use for cattle raising under Administrative Order No. 1, Series of 2004 should be understood in its plain and literal meaning... The Court of Appeals ignored the findings of the DAR Secretary of the presence of agricultural business in Hacienda Bitanagan. It gravely erred in disregarding the findings of the DAR Secretary showing that respondent was not exclusively engaged in cattle-raising but also engaged in copra farming from which it consistently received income from 1988 to 1996... Thus, the application for exclusion of Lot No. 3-A-4 should be denied. As regards the other landholdings subject of the Petition, we uphold the findings of the DAR Secretary that there was no evidence of any livestock or infrastructure in Lot No. 3-A-5 and Lot No. P-13535.","The December 15, 2017 Decision and October 25, 2018 Amended Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 07293-MIN granting the application for exclusion of Hacienda Bitanagan for its three parcels of land identified as Lot No. 3-A-4 covered by TCT No. T-207 (T-3048); Lot No. 3-A-5 covered by TCT No. T-206 (T-3047); and Lot No. F-11-05-008043 covered by TCT No. P-13524 are REVERSED. The November 25, 2012 Order of the Secretary of the Department of Agrarian Reform in DARCO Order No. EXC-1211-333 is REINSTATED."
"G.R. No. 209435, August 10, 2022","ERNESTO LORENZO, MANUEL LORENZO, CONCHITA LORENZO-BRUNO,* ADORACION SUELEN,** AVELINA SUELEN,** AND HEIRS OF RODOLFO LORENZO, PETITIONERS, VS. FORTUNATA D. EUSTAQUIO AND CHILDREN, NAMELY: ANGELITO, JOSE, ALEGRIA, LEONIDA, TEOFILO, DELFIN, JR., ALEJANDRO ALL SURNAMED EUSTAQUIO (HEIRS OF DELFIN EUSTAQUIO, SR.), RESPONDENTS.","The spouses Gregorio Eustaquio and Regina Lorenzo owned Lot No. 2161, a 7,275 square meters parcel of land situated in Barangay Bacabac, Camiling, Tarlac, and covered by Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. 27351.[5] They have three children, namely: Delfin, Trinidad, and Fausta.[6] On June 2, 1942, the spouses Gregorio and Regina executed a deed of donation propter nuptias (Inventario Matrimonio)[7] in favor of Delfin and Fortunata, donating a carabao and three parcels of land, among others, in celebration of their marriage. Included in the donated parcels of land is the subject land. Delfin and Fortunata issued a receipt to Gregorio showing their acceptance of the donation. Immediately thereafter, they occupied and took possession of the subject land in the concept of an owner until the unexpected controversy arose after Delfin's demise on July 4, 1994.[8] Petitioners, namely: (a) Ernesto Lorenzo (Ernesto), Manuel Lorenzo, Conchita Lorenzo-Bruno, and heirs of Rodolfo Lorenzo (children of Trinidad); and (b) Adoracion and Avelina Suelen (children of Fausta), presented a Deed of Succession and Adjudication[9] dated December 31, 1993. The said deed stated that the subject land was subdivided into three lots: Lot 2161-A, Lot 2161-B, and Lot 2162-C, as per Psd-036903-053138 which bore a signature ""G Eustaquio"" referring to Gregorio. These lots are to be adjudicated among the heirs of spouses Gregorio and Regina in this wise: a - Lot No. 2161-A – shall belong to DELFIN L. EUSTAQUIO; b - Lot No. 2161-B – shall belong to ERNESTO, MANUEL, RODOLFO & CONCHITA, all [s]urnamed E. LORENZO, in equal share; c - Lot No. 2161-C, shall belong to FAUSTA L. EUSTAQUIO[10] Petitioners, represented by Ernesto, then filed a Petition[11] for issuance of a second owner's duplicate copy of OCT No. 27351. He averred that he is an heir of the spouses Gregorio and Regina, and was in possession of the duplicate copy of the title which he lost. The trial court granted the petition;[12] hence, a duplicate copy of the same was issued to petitioners.[13] The purported false claims of petitioners prompted respondents to file the instant Complaint for Quieting of Title, Declaration of Nullity of Document and Surrender of Title with Prayer for the Issuance of the Writ of Preliminary Injunction and/or Temporary Restraining Order,[14] which was later on amended.[15] Respondents claimed ownership over the subject land by virtue of donation. The Deed of Succession and Adjudication is therefore null and void as it is based on Psd-036903-053138 signed by Gregorio with ""G. Eustaquio."" Such signature is a forgery because Gregorio had already died on October 29, 1950; hence, it is impossible for him to execute the same. Respondents further alleged that the thumbmark of Delfin appearing on the deed was spurious as he never appeared before the notary public to acknowledge the same.[16] Petitioners, on the other hand, claimed that the donation propter nuptias is void for there was no valid acceptance. It is likewise spurious and fake because the signatures therein were forgeries. Moreover, considering that the spouses Gregorio and Regina donated all their properties to Delfin and Fortunata, it violated the rights of other heirs over their legitimes.[17] Anent the Deed of Succession and Adjudication,[18] petitioners maintained that it is valid for being duly executed in a public document and notarized. In fact, Fortunata was with Delfin when he signed the deed. Fortunata did not even raise any objection thereto which would also have supported her claim that the donation of the subject land to them was indeed valid.[19] Respondents, in their Reply,[20] countered that the donation remained valid even if there was no acceptance since Delfin was only 17 years old at the time of his marriage to Fortunata. Further, petitioners only contested the said donation in 1993, or more than 50 years after its execution. Thus, their claim over the subject land or a portion thereof had already been barred by prescription. Lastly, respondents reiterated their stance that the thumbmark of Delfin appearing on the Deed of Succession and Adjudication is fake as he never appeared before a notary public.[21]","The Regional Trial Court (RTC) found the donation *propter nuptias* void for lack of notarization, but declared the heirs of Delfin L. Eustaquio (respondents) as co-owners of Lot No. 2161 by acquisitive prescription due to their continuous possession since 1942. The RTC declared both the donation and the Deed of Succession and Adjudication, as well as the second owner's copy of OCT No. 27351, null and void, and ordered petitioners to pay P10,000.00 as moral damages and P10,000.00 as attorney's fees. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the RTC decision, finding no reversible error, and agreed that respondents were the owners of the subject property by virtue of acquisitive prescription due to open, continuous, adverse, and uninterrupted possession for more than 50 years. The CA also noted that the appeal should have been dismissed due to petitioners' failure to include a Subject Index in their Appellant's Brief.","The Supreme Court agreed with the conclusion that the spouses Delfin and Fortunata are the rightful owners of the subject land, but held that the acquisition was based on **laches**, not acquisitive prescription. The Court maintained that the *Inventario Matrimonio* (donation *propter nuptias*) executed in 1942 was void for not being a public instrument as required by the Old Civil Code. However, acquisitive prescription is inapplicable because the subject land is registered under the Torrens system. Nonetheless, the peaceful, uninterrupted, and adverse possession by the spouses Delfin and Fortunata for 50 years, coupled with the petitioners' and their predecessors-in-interest's failure or neglect for an unreasonable length of time to assert their rights, allowed the doctrine of laches to set in, converting petitioners' right into a stale demand. Consequently, the Deed of Succession and Adjudication is null and void as the subject land no longer formed part of the estate of the spouses Gregorio and Regina when it was executed. The cancellation of the second owner's copy of OCT No. 27351 and the award of moral damages and attorney's fees to respondents were affirmed.","WHEREFORE, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED for lack of merit. The January 31, 2013 Decision and the September 4, 2013 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 93647 are AFFIRMED. Costs against petitioners."

CONTRARY TO LAW. [6] During arraignment, accused-appellant pleaded not guilty to both charges. Upon pre-trial, the parties entered into the following relevant stipulations: Accused-appellant was the Regional Agrarian Reform Adjudicator of the DARAB, Region XII and concurrent Adjudicator for the other provinces in said region: Sultan Kudarat, North and South Cotabato and Maguindanao; In 2007, the DARAB case was assigned to accused­ appellant for adjudication; and A TRO and a WPI were issued in DARAB XII-990-SC- 2007.

Landero), the counsel of complainants in the DARAB case; (3) Herminigilda Garbo (Herminigilda), the wife of private complainant and a co-complainant in the DARAB case; and (4) Dominador Egagamao, a co-complainant in the DARAB case, who testified that he contributed his money to come up with the amounts demanded by accused-appellant in exchange for the issuance of the TRO and WPI in the DARAB case. [8] Eduardito Garbo (private complainant) was unable to testify because he died a few years after the filing of the criminal complaint against accused-appellant. [9] From the collective testimonies of the witnesses, the prosecution evidence tends to establish that a Complaint dated August 1, 2007 was filed by several farmers, including Herminigilda, before the DARAB, docketed as DARAB Case No. XII-990-SC-2007, entitled ""Miguel Egagamao, et al. v. DARBC, et al."" and the case was assigned to accused-appellant. [10] According to Atty. Landero, the farmers appointed private complainant to represent them in the DARAB case although no Special Power of Attorney was executed. [11] Atty. Landero testified that he was the counsel of the farmers in said DARAB case. Upon filing of the complaint, Atty. Landero was advised by the DARAB 's receiving officer to meet with accused-appellant regarding the issuance of provisional remedies prayed for in the complaint. According to Atty. Landero, he and private complainant met with accused-appellant and, after a short briefing of the case, private complainant informed Atty. Landero of his intention to talk privately with accused-appellant. Thus, Atty. Landero went out of accused-appellant's office and waited for his client. Afterwards, private complainant narrated to Atty. Landero that accused-appellant asked for cash amounting to P20,000.00 and that private complainant gave said sum to accused-appellant. [12] Atty. Landero added that on September 13, 2007, private complainant and his wife gave another P20,000.00 to accused-appellant for the immediate issuance of the TRO. On September 24, 2007, Atty. Landero received a call from accused-appellant asking for private complainant to meet him at a certain hotel. Atty. Landero agreed and drove his car to meet private complainant outside the hotel. Atty. Landero, however, stayed in the car while private complainant went inside the hotel. When he came back, private complainant showed to Atty. Landero the draft TRO, informed him that he paid accused-appellant an additional P20,000.00, and that the latter also requested for a tuna fish. [13] Later, Atty. Landero and private complainant went to the former's house to obtain an ice box, and from there, proceeded to General Santos fish port where private complainant bought a tuna fish. Thereafter, Atty. Landero called accused-appellant to ask him where to deliver the fish. They delivered the fish to accused-appellant and the latter's driver assisted them in loading the fish onto their pick-up truck. Subsequently, private complainant informed Atty. Landero that accused-appellant had called to advise him that the TRO could be picked up in Kidapawan City. He also informed Atty. Landero that he gave accused-appellant another P20,000.00. Private complainant obtained the injunction and told Atty. Landero ""Mahal man hid ka injunction oy [P]40,000 man"" which meant ""the price of the injunction is very high, it is worth [P]40,000."" [14] Atty. Landero further testified that every time there would be a meeting between private complainant and accused-appellant, the farmers in the DARAB case would also hold a meeting to contribute money to be brought to accused-appellant. He apprised the Sandiganbayan that private complainant died after two or three years from the filing of the case against accused-appellant. [15] Private complainant's wife, Herminigilda, recalled that she accompanied her husband twice to Kidapawan City to give money to accused-appellant. On one incident, they gave P20,000.00 to accused­ appellant's ""body body"" (assistant) as the latter was not in his office when they arrived. On the second incident, accused-appellant once again asked for money, and Herminigilda took out an envelope containing P20,0000.00 from her brassiere and gave it to her husband who, in tum, handed it to accused­ appellant. Upon inquiry, accused-appellant confirmed that he received the previous P20,000.00 that the spouses handed to his assistant. [16] According to Herminigilda, the giving of money to accused-appellant adversely affected the livelihood of the farmers in the DARAB case because they had to sell their cows, hogs, and sprayers. She even claimed that she could no longer give money to her youngest son who was attending school. While accompanying her husband, Herminigilda saw accused-appellant many times but it was only private complainant who was able to talk to him. [17] Version of the defense On the other hand, the defense presented three witnesses: (1) accused­ appellant; (2) Bebiano Egagamao (Bebiano), one of the complainants in the DARAB case and the brother of prosecution witness Dominador Egagamao; and (3) Atty. Noli Lechonsito (Atty. Lechonsito), the Chief of the Legal Division of the Department of Agrarian Reform in Cotabato City. The defense testimonies were summarized as follows: Accused-appellant denied all the charges against him, stating that private complainant had filed a disbarment case against him before this Court, which was dismissed for being inconclusive and unreliable. Bebiano also testified that it was true that their group held meetings and contributed money, but he claimed that it was given to Atty. Landero, their lawyer in the DARAB case. Lastly, Atty. Lechonsito testified that he assisted private complainant in drafting an affidavit of retraction of his accusations against accused-appellant, which he filed with the Office of the Ombudsman (Ombudsman).","In its Decision dated April 29, 2019, the Sandiganbayan found accused-appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crimes charged, the dispositive portion of which, reads: WHEREFORE, in light of all the foregoing, [judgment] is hereby rendered as follows: (1) In Criminal Case No. SB-15-CRM-0101, the Court finds Henry Magaway Gelacio GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019, and is hereby sentenced to suffer the following penalties: (a) imprisonment for six (6) years and one (1) month, as minimum, to eight (8) years, as maximum; and (b) perpetual disqualification from public office. (2) In Criminal Case No. SB-15-CRM-0102, the Court finds Henry Magaway Gelacio GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 7(d) of R.A. No. 6713 and is hereby sentenced to suffer the following penalties: (a) imprisonment from one (1) year and one (1) day, as minimum, to five (5) years, as maximum; (b) fine of Five Thousand Pesos (PhP5,000.00); and disqualification to hold public office. SO ORDERED. [19] The Sandiganbayan held that all the elements of the crimes charged were satisfactorily established and that accused-appellant's defense of denial was sweeping and self-serving, which cannot prevail over the direct and positive testimonies of the prosecution's witnesses.","The appeal is partly meritorious. Violation of Sec. 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 ... To sustain a conviction under the said provision, the prosecution must sufficiently establish the following elements: (1) the offender is a public officer; (2) the act was done in the discharge of the public officer's official, administrative or judicial functions; (3) the act was done through manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence; and (4) the public officer caused any undue injury to any party, including the Government, or gave any unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference. [31] ... The Court's review of the records of the case shows that accused-appellant committed manifest partiality and evident bad faith, which resulted in causing undue injury to private complainant and the farmers in the DARAB case, by draining their resources to secure the TRO. ... Violation of Sec. 7(d) of R.A. No. 6713 ... However, it must be pointed out that Sec. 11(a) of R.A. No. 6713 provides that if the violation under R.A. No. 6713 is punishable by a heavier penalty under another law, then the offender shall be prosecuted under the said statute. ... Consequently, Sec. 11(a) of R.A. No. 6713 reflects that if the violation under R.A. No. 6713 is punishable by a heavier penalty under another law, the offender shall be prosecuted under the latter statute. ... As Sec. 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 prescribes a heavier penalty, accused-appellant may only be prosecuted under the said law. The criminal charge against accused-appellant for violation of Sec. 7(d) in R.A. No. 6713 should be dismissed. He must be acquitted of that particular charge. ... The Court delves into the issue of alleged hearsay evidence in ascertaining the existence of the elements of the crimes. ... even though the Sandiganbayan completely disregarded private complainant's affidavit, as he was not presented as a witness, there was still sufficient, competent, and convincing evidence to convict accused-appellant of the crimes charged. Finally, accused-appellant's assertion that the prosecution had come to court with unclean hands deserves scant consideration.","WHEREFORE, the appeal is PARTIALLY GRANTED. The April 29, 2019 Decision and the June 26, 2019 Resolution of the Sandiganbayan are hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATIONS as follows: 1. In SB-15-CRM-0101, accused-appellant Henry M. Gelacio is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019, and is hereby SENTENCED to suffer the penalty of imprisonment for six (6) years and one (1) month, as minimum, to eight (8) years, as maximum. He is also perpetually disqualified to hold public office. 2. In SB-15-CRM-0102, accused-appellant Henry M. Gelacio is ACQUITTED of the charge of violation of Section 7(d) of Republic Act No. 6713. SO ORDERED."
"A.C. No. 13332, August 10, 2022","ALOYSIUS R. PAJARILLO, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. ARCHIMEDES O. YANTO, RESPONDENT.","Complainant was one of the plaintiffs in a civil case for recovery of ownership and possession with damages then pending before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Camarines Norte, Branch 41, docketed as Civil Case No. 8028. Respondent, on the other hand, was the legal counsel of therein defendants Ronnie Pimentel (Ronnie), George Pimentel (George), and Roweno Pimentel (Roweno).
In the pre-trial brief submitted by defendants for Civil Case No. 8028, they alluded to a Special Power of Attorney (SPA) notarized by respondent authorizing Roweno to represent his brothers, Ronnie and George, in filing the case. The SPA, however, was not attached to the pre-trial brief. During their formal offer of exhibits, defendants adduced the SPA, which the RTC admitted. Sensing irregularity in the sudden emergence of the SPA, complainant went to the Office of the Clerk of Court to verify whether such a document existed in respondent's notarial registry. Complainant discovered that the SPA was not recorded in the notarial registry of respondent. Instead, a different SPA was registered bearing the same document number, page number; book number, and series. This impelled complainant to file a criminal case against respondent for Falsification of Public Documents before the Office of the Provincial Prosecutor. He also lodged the instant administrative disciplinary case before the IBP docketed as CBD Case No. 18-5757. 
In riposte, respondent refuted the allegation against him. He denied falsifying the subject SPA. Instead, he proffered that on 5 February 2015, defendants, his clients, went to his office bringing several copies of two different SPAs: one intended for the civil case before the RTC of Camarines Norte Branch 41, and the other for a case to be filed with the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR). Both SPAs contained similar provisions authorizing Roweno to represent his brothers, Ronnie and George. As it happened, defendants signed the SPAs and respondent notarized the same. Thereafter, he forwarded the copies of the two SPAs to his office staff. Believing that the documents consisted only of one SPA as they looked identical, his staff assigned only one notarial detail to both SPAs. The copy which was kept by the staff and submitted to the Clerk of Court for reportorial purposes was the SPA intended for the DENR case. Meanwhile, the copy which respondent retained and filed before the RTC of Camarines Norte, Branch 41 was the SPA for the civil case. Respondent stood pat on his stance that he never falsified the two SPAs. The provincial prosecutor found no probable cause to charge respondent with Falsification of Public Documents. The IBP Board of Governors recommended the dismissal of the administrative complaint, finding respondent's mistake honest and isolated.",This Court deviates from the IBP's dismissal of the Complaint. Respondent must be held liable for his violation of the Rules on Notarial Practice and the CPR.,"In synthesis, the Court finds respondent liable for violation of the Rules on Notarial Practice and the CPR. Consequently, his notarial commission is revoked, and he is hereby disqualified from being appointed as notary public for one year. Considering that respondent's negligent recording of the notarized SPAs did not cause harm to the substantive rights of complainant and such was made without malice and devoid of any desire to dupe or defraud the latter, the penalty of suspension from the practice of law for a period of three months against respondent is commensurate.","IN LIGHT OF THE FOREGOING, the Court finds Atty. Archimedes O. Yanto GUILTY of violating the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice and the Code of Professional Responsibility. Accordingly, his notarial commission, if still existing, is hereby REVOKED. He is DISQUALIFIED from reappointment as Notary Public for a period of one year. He is likewise suspended from the practice of law for a period of three months. Further, he is STERNLY WARNED that a repetition of the same or similar acts in the future shall be dealt with more severely. SO ORDERED."
"[ G.R. No. 255496, August 10, 2022 ]","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, V. IRMA MAGLINAS Y QUINDONG, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","In an Information dated September 9, 2015, accused-appellant was charged with Murder, committed as follows: That at around 2:30 in the afternoon on May 15, 2015 at Barangay District 3, Municipality of San Miguel, Province of Catanduanes, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above­ named ac used, with intent to kill, by taking advantage of superior strength, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously inflict physical injuries on the different parts of the body of KRISHNA DIZON, a [ONE-YEAR AND FOUR MONTH-OLD] CHILD, and thereafter drown the aforesaid Krishna Dizon in Bator River, thereby causing the latter's death, to the damage and prejudice of the heirs of the said victim and the general public. During arraignment, accused-appellant pleaded not guilty. The prosecution's witness, Eufresina Teves, testified that on May 15, 2015, at around 9:30 a.m., she heard a crying child (Krishna) and the voice of accused-appellant yelling ""Tigil! Tigil!"" followed by a loud sound of someone being whipped/slapped five times. At around 3:00 p.m., Krishna was found face down and floating in the river by Eboy, approximately 100 meters from accused-appellant's house. Gemma Bernal testified seeing wounds on both eyelids of Krishna and blood continuously coming out from her mouth. Dr. Joson, the Municipal Health Officer, issued a Death Certificate indicating the cause of death as ""Drowning, Freshwater, Accidental,"" based on information relayed by relatives, but noted an abrasion at the corner of the right eye and two blisters on the right hand, recommending an autopsy to rule out foul play due to suspicious circumstances. The defense stated that Krishna's mother, Jenelyn Dizon, left Krishna in accused-appellant's custody on May 13, 2015. Accused-appellant testified that on May 15, 2015, she put Krishna to sleep around 1:30 p.m. At around 2:00 p.m., while Krishna was still asleep, accused-appellant went to the store of Arlene Tatel to buy dinner ingredients. Upon returning at around 2:14 p.m., she noticed the door open and Krishna missing. Eboy subsequently found Krishna in the river. The RTC found accused-appellant guilty of Murder, concluding she intentionally hurt Krishna, rendering her unconscious or lifeless, and then brought her to the river to simulate accidental drowning. The CA affirmed the RTC's judgment with modification on the monetary awards, holding that the killing was attended by treachery.","WHEREFORE, the appeal is GRANTED. The September 8, 2020 Decision of the Court of Appeals, in CA- G.R. CR-HC No. 11476, is REVERSED and SET ASIDE.","The Court found insufficient circumstantial evidence to establish beyond reasonable doubt that accused-appellant was the author of the crime. The prosecution's theory relied heavily on the testimony of Eufresina (hearing slapping sounds), which was a singular circumstance, violating the requirements of Section 4, Rule 133 of the Rules of Court that requires more than one circumstance to sustain a conviction. The medical findings unequivocally negate the prosecution's theory that accused-appellant maltreated Krishna to death before drowning her. Dr. Joson testified that there was no basis to conclude Krishna was maltreated as there were no significant external injuries, hematoma, or fractures that would support the claim that the child was hit hard. The physical evidence (abrasion and blisters) was insufficient to prove physical violence. Furthermore, the prosecution failed to completely rule out the possibility that another person may have committed the crime, considering the river area was publicly accessible. The inference of guilt based merely on accused-appellant giving conflicting statements to the police is unsustainable. Since the evidence admits of two interpretations—one consistent with guilt and the other with innocence—the constitutional presumption of innocence must prevail, leading to acquittal.","Accused-appellant Irma Maglinas y Quindong is hereby ACQUITTED of the crime charged against her for failure of the prosecution to prove her guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The Superintendent of the Correctional Institution for Women, Mandaluyong City is ORDERED to IMMEDIATELY RELEASE accused-appellant from detention, unless she is being lawfully held in custody for any other reason, and to INFORM the Court of the action taken hereon within five (5) days from receipt of this Decision."
"G.R. No. 250306, August 10, 2022","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. RONILO JUMARANG Y MULINGBAYAN, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","On April 27, 2010, an Information was filed against Jumarang, the accusatory portion of which reads:
That on [the] 11th day of April 2010 at about 11:15 o'clock [sic] in the morning at Barangay Santiago, Bato, Camarines Sur, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, without any legal purpose or authority, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and knowingly, PLANT, CULTIVATE OR CULTURE THREE (3) POTS OF FULLY GROWN MARIJUANA PLANTS WITH FRUITING TOPS, CLASSIFIED AS DANGEROUS DRUGS, ON TOP OF THE ROOF OF HIS HOUSE MADE OF CONCRETE SLAB, MIXED WITH OTHER ORNAMENTAL PLANTS, NOW HAVING THE FOLLOWING MARKINGS AND HEIGHTS: EXHB. A JPB 4-11-10=116 CM; EXHB B JPB 4-11-10=189 CM & EXHB C JPB 4-11-10=109 CM regardless of quantity, to the great damage and prejudice of public interest and of that of the Republic of the Philippines.
ACTS CONTRARY TO LAW.
[3]
Jumarang was arraigned and pleaded not guilty to the charge against him.
[4] Thereafter, trial on the merits ensued.
The prosecution witnesses testified
[5] that on April 11, 2010, around 10:30 in the morning, Police Officer (PO) 2 Manuel Tanay
[6] (PO2 Tanay) received a tip that someone ""in the De Lima residence"" located in Santiago, Bato, Camarines Sur was keeping marijuana plants. The information was relayed to the then Chief of Police of Bato, Camarines Sur Police Inspector Salvador Banaria (P/Insp. Banaria), who, in turn, directed PO2 Tanay and PO2 Jeric Buena
[7] (PO2 Buena) to conduct surveillance.
[8] PO2 Tanay and PO2 Buena immediately went to the area and positioned themselves around 10 meters outside a house, which was located inside a compound. From where they were standing, they could see a man, later on identified as Jumarang,
[9] tending to some plants at the roof of the house. Not long after, the man, holding a three-foot tall potted plant with ""five finger leaves,"" started descending the roof.
Suspecting that Jumarang was bringing the plant inside his house, the two police officers called out to him and rushed inside the compound. They instructed Jumarang to put the plant down so they could closely examine it. Jumarang complied while asserting that it was a medicinal plant. They also asked Jumarang if they could go inside the house. Jumarang relented and allowed PO2 Tanay and PO2 Buena inside the house.
[10] When PO2 Tanay and PO2 Buena went up the roof, they found two other pots of what they identified as marijuana plants. They also brought these down. At this point, onlookers were already starting to gather, including the owner of the compound, so PO2 Tanay and PO2 Buena decided to bring Jumarang and the plants to the police station.
[11] Once there, PO2 Tanay looked for a barangay official, a member of the media, and a prosecutor. He was able to secure the attendance of Acting Punong Barangay Adam Billiones, media practitioner Glenda Bearis, and Prosecutor Antonio Ramos, Jr. as witnesses.
[12] PO2 Buena also prepared the inventory receipts, and photographs were taken of the plants which were turned over to PO2 Rico Dancalan. The next day, the plants were brought to Camp Simeon Ola for scientific examination. The tests conducted by Police Senior Inspector Wilfredo I. Pabustan, Jr., a forensic chemist, confirmed that these were marijuana plants.
[13]
For his part, Jumarang vehemently denied the charges against him.
[14] He testified that at the time of the incident, he was visiting his in-laws from Batangas where he resides. He stated that on that day, April 11, 2010, his mother-in-law requested him to clean their rooftop. However, when he saw three pots of marijuana plants among the other plants, he decided to report the matter to the police. However, as he was handling the plants to bring to the police, two of them passed by him. When they saw him with the plant, they approached and told him that he was planting marijuana. They then asked him if they could check the rooftop and he accompanied them, along with his parents-in-law, his wife, and some neighbors. There, they saw two more marijuana plants. As Jumarang was the one caught handling the plant, he was arrested by the police officers.
After trial on the merits, the trial court rendered the Judgment
[15] dated August 30, 2016 finding Jumarang guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 16, Article II of R.A. No. 9165, and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua and to pay a fine of P500,000.00.
Jumarang appealed the Judgment dated August 30, 2016 to the CA. However, the same was denied by the CA in its Decision
[16] dated January 16, 2018, which affirmed with modification the trial court's Judgment. The dispositive portion of the CA Decision reads:
WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing, the appeal of accused-appellant is DENIED and the RTC's Decision dated August 30, 2016 is hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION in that the penalty imposed is life imprisonment with payment of fine of five hundred thousand Pesos ([P]500,000.00).
SO ORDERED.
[17]
Hence, the instant appeal.","After a careful review of the evidence on record, the Court finds that the warrantless arrest was unlawful. Consequently, the search effected on accused-appellant was also unlawful. . . The Court finds that accused-appellant's arrest could not be justified as an in flagrante delicto arrest under Rule 113, Section 5(a) of the Rules of Court. . . Based on the foregoing, in effecting the warrantless arrest, the police officers relied solely on the tip that they received from the confidential informant. It is settled that reliable information alone is insufficient to support a warrantless arrest absent any overt act from the person to be arrested indicating that a crime has just been committed, was being committed, or is about to be committed. . . Applying the principle herein, the police officers, who were at a distance of 10 meters away from accused-appellant, cannot be said to have properly determined the nature of the plant that he was holding was a marijuana plant. . . Neither can this Court consider the search conducted on the rooftop where they discovered two more pots of marijuana plant as a valid consented search. . . Accordingly, there being no valid warrantless search under a search incidental to a lawful arrest and a valid consented search, the marijuana plants seized from accused-appellant are rendered inadmissible in evidence for being the proverbial fruit of the poisonous tree. As the seized marijuana plants are the very corpus delicti of the crime charged, accused-appellant must be acquitted and exonerated from criminal liability.","WHEREFORE, the appeal is GRANTED. The Decision of the Court of Appeals dated January 16, 2018 in CA-G.R. CR HC-No. 08654 is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

"G.R. No. 233918, August 09, 2022","FILIPINO SOCIETY OF COMPOSERS, AUTHORS AND PUBLISHERS, INC., PETITIONER, VS. ANREY, INC., RESPONDENT.","FILSCAP is a non-profit society of composers, authors, and publishers that owns public performance rights over the copyrighted musical works of its members. It also owns the right to license public performances in the Philippines of copyrighted foreign musical works of its members and affiliate performing rights societies abroad. These rights however, are being challenged by respondent Anrey, Inc. (Anrey) when they were assessed by FILSCAP to pay annual license fees for the public performance of the copyrighted works of its members. The assessment came after a representative of FILSCAP, Ms. Ivy Labayne, conducted several days (between the months of July and September 2008) of monitoring over the chain of restaurants owned by Anrey in Baguio City, which were identified to be the following establishments (the establishments): 1) Sizzling Plate, #116 Session Road, Baguio City 2) Sizzling Plate, #134 Abanao Extension, Baguio City 3) Sizzling Plate, SM Baguio, Luneta Hill, Baguio City. FILSCAP wrote several letters to the establishments involved, informing them that an unauthorized public performance of copyrighted music amounts to infringement and urged them to secure licenses from FILSCAP to avoid prosecution. These demands fell on deaf ears, thus, FILSCAP filed a Complaint (later on Amended) for Copyright Infringement against Anrey before the RTC, asking the court to award the following: (a) P18,900.00 as compensatory damages; (b) P300,000 as nominal damages; (c) P100,000 as exemplary damages; and (d) P50,000 as attorney's fees and litigation expenses. In their Answer, Anrey denied playing any copyrighted music within its establishments. It claims that the establishments it operates play whatever is being broadcasted on the radio they are tuned in. Even if the broadcast plays copyrighted music, the radio stations have already paid the corresponding royalties, thus, FILSCAP would be recovering twice: from the station that broadcasted the copyrighted music, and from it, simply because it tuned in on a broadcast intended to be heard by the public. Finally, assuming that the reception is a performance, it was not done publicly since the broadcast was played for the benefit of its staff, and not for its customers.","The Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 6, Baguio City dismissed FILSCAP's amended complaint for lack of merit, citing Sec. 184 (i) of R.A. 8293 in absolving Anrey from copyright infringement. FILSCAP filed a Motion for Reconsideration and a Manifestation/Supplement to the Motion for Reconsideration, but these were denied by the RTC. On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the Decision of the RTC, applying what was known as the homestyle and business exemptions prevailing in the United States of America (US).","The Court finds merit to the petition. We believe that the act of playing radio broadcasts containing copyrighted music through the use of loudspeakers (radio-over-loudspeakers) is in itself, a performance. A radio reception creates a performance separate from the broadcast. This is otherwise known as the doctrine of multiple performances which provides that a radio (or television) transmission or broadcast can create multiple performances at once. The exemption granted under US law cannot be extended to determine whether or not an individual or entity in the Philippines is exempt from obtaining a license or from copyright infringement. The RTC's application of Sec. 184(i) was a misapplication considering that the exemption only applies to institutions for charitable and educational purposes. Neither does the unauthorized transmission of the radio broadcast, which plays copyrighted music, for commercial purposes be treated as fair use. The playing of copyrighted music by means of radio-over-loudspeakers in a commercial setting is not analogous to fair use as to exempt Anrey from copyright infringement.","WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant petition is GRANTED. The assailed Decision dated April 19, 2017 and Resolution dated August 3, 2017 promulgated by the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R.

Accordingly, respondent Anrey, Inc., is hereby ORDERED to pay the Filipino Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers, Inc. P10,000.00 as temperate damages for the unlicensed public performance of the copyrighted songs on FILSCAP's repertoire and P50,000.00 as attorney's fees, plus interest at the rate of 12% per annum from September 8, 2009 until June 30, 2013, and thereafter, 6% per annum from July 1, 2013 until the finality of this judgment.

VEGA AND DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE SECRETARY MENARDO I. GUEVARRA, RESPONDENTS.","On October 20, 2016, the Government of the Republic of the Philippines ( GRP ), represented by the Department of Finance ( DOF ), and the Chinese government-owned Export-Import Bank of China ( EXIM Bank ) entered into a Memorandum of Understanding on Financing Cooperation [5] ( MOU ). As disclosed through Articles 1.1, [6] 2.3, [7] 4.1, [8] and 4.2 [9] thereof, the MOU was intended as a precursor agreement to more binding and detailed loan agreements for GRP-nominated priority infrastructure projects. Invoking the MOU, the Department of Foreign Affairs ( DFA ) transmitted to the Embassy of the People's Republic of China ( PRC Embassy ) Note Verbale No. 17-0330 [10] dated January 20, 2017, proposing the process by which the financing arrangement under the MOA would be activated and availed of. Then followed Note Verbale No. 17-1049 [11] dated March 3, 2017, wherein the DFA confirmed its previous proposals. In response, China's Ministry of Commerce ( MOFCOM ) sent out Reply Note [12] dated March 8, 2017 ( Reply Note ), agreeing to the following procedure: First, the DOF will submit a request for preferential/concessional loan financing for priority projects to the Chinese Government, through the PRC Embassy; second, the Chinese Government would proffer its considerations and provide a list of at least three qualified, legitimate, and reputable Chinese contractors for the project; third, the relevant implementing agency ( IA ) would conduct Limited Competitive Bidding ( LCB ) among the recommended Chinese contractors, and finalize the procurement by signing the relevant commercial contract; fourth, the DOF would submit to EXIM Bank the required documents, prompting the latter to conduct its due diligence; and finally, the DOF, on behalf of the GRP, and EXIM Bank would sign the loan agreement and, if any, guarantee agreement. Aspects of the foregoing procedure were further particularized through a mutually agreed [13] Clarificatory Procedures for the Implementation of the Note Verbale No. 17-1049 [14] ( Clarificatory Procedures ). Particularly, the DOF and Chinese Government agreed that the pertinent IA shall adhere to provisions of Republic Act ( R.A. ) No. 9184, or the Government Procurement Reform Act ( GPRA ); the DOF shall request from the PRC Embassy the financing of priority projects, and a list of at least three qualified, legitimate, and reputable Chinese contractors; upon receipt of such list, the DOF would furnish the same to the IA, which would conduct its own due diligence and vetting, coursing through the DOF to the PRC Embassy whatever concerns it might have with the recommended firms; if found satisfactory, the IA would undertake LCB, incorporating some GPRA procedures; lastly, the IA and winning contractor would sign a contract agreement, stipulating therein that the effectivity thereof is contingent on the effectivity of the loan agreement to finance such project. The CRPIP, with the National Irrigation Authority ( NIA ) as IA, was nominated for such finance assistance. Consequently, the MOFCOM recommended three Chinese contractors, [15] which the DOF relayed to the NIA for due diligence and vetting. [16] The NIA proceeded to conduct a background check by inquiring with various government agencies regarding ongoing transactions with these firms. [17] Then, the NIA's Bids and Awards Committee-A adopted Resolution No. CW-LCB 2018-1, [18] recording the conduct of the requisite LCB, declaring China CAMC Engineering Co., Ltd. as the bidder with the lower calculated and responsive bid, recommending the approval of such award and issuance of a notice to that effect, and urging the execution of a contract agreement between the NIA and China CAMC. Meanwhile, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas' (BSP) Monetary Board ( MB ) adopted Resolution No. 305 [19] dated Februaiy 22, 2018, Approving-in­ Principle the proposed loan of up to $70 Million for the CRPIP, conditioned on certain documentary submissions, deposit arrangements, parameters for subsequent negotiations and approvals, and compliance with applicable laws. Thereafter, the CRPIP Loan Agreement was executed on April 10, 2018, by the EXIM Bank as lender, and the GRP, through the DOF, as borrower, which agreement features provisions covering Conditions and Utilization of the Facility, Disbursement of the Facility, Repayment of Principal and Payment of Interest, Representations and Warranties by the Borrower, Special Covenants, Default, Miscellaneous, Effectiveness. Through Resolution No. 813 [20] dated May 17, 2018, the MB gave its Final Approval to the loan amounting to $62,086,837.82. The NCWS project, to be implemented by the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System ( MWSS ), was also nominated for financing assistance. [21] As the NCWS project was originally conceived as a public-private partnership scheme, the DOF and the National Economic Development Authority ( NEDA ) instructed the MWSS to review and adjust the project's financing strategy, considering the financing cooperation provided by the MOU. The MWSS Board of Trustees endorsed and confirmed the NCWS project's new estimated cost at P10.857 Billion, and tailored the scope and implementation thereof consistent with a financing shift to Official Development Assistance ( ODA ), thereby foregoing the then­ ongoing procurement process pursuant to the Build-Operate-Transfer Law. [22] The NEDA-Investment Coordinating Committee confirmed such shift in project financing. [23] Similar to the CRPIP project, the DOF forwarded to the MWSS the shortlist of MOFCOM-endorsed [24] Chinese contractors, [25] and urged the MWSS to conduct its due diligence in vetting the candidate firms. [26] Thereafter, the MWSS concurred in the shortlist of contractors and proceeded to conduct the LCB, [27] where China Energy Engineering Corporation Limited emerged with the lowest calculated bid. [28] The MWSS then approved the proposed commercial contract, authorizing its administrator to sign the agreement, and submit the same to the DOF for loan processing. [29] For project financing, the DOF endorsed the MWSS's proposed loan to the MB for its Approval-in-Principle and willingness to guarantee, subject to certain conditions. [30] On September 28, 2018, the MB gave its Approval-in-Principle through Resolution No. 1581, imposing conditions necessary for Final Approval. The NCWS Loan Agreement was entered into on November 20, 2018 between the EXIM Bank as lender, and the GRP, through the DOF, as borrower, and features stipulations identical to those of the CRPIP Loan Agreement. Through Resolution No. 854 [31] dated June 6, 2019, the BSP MB gave its Final Approval to the loan amounting to US$211,214,646.54.","I. Procedural considerations. A. The President of the Philippines should be dropped as respondent. [...] B. Except as to the issue concerning the Waiver of Immunity Clauses, the other substantive issues raised by the petitions may be the subject of judicial review. [...] C. Prohibition is a viable remedy under the circumstances. [...] II. The Loan Agreements were executed with the necessary BSP MB concurrence. The Court rules in favor of respondents. III. As Worded, the Assailed Confidentiality Clause Unduly Restricts Public Access to Information on Foreign Loans. [...] such faulty language cannot surmount the Constitutionally-mandated public availability of information on government­ contracted foreign loans. IV. The Loan Agreements violate neither the Constitutional policy to give preference to qualified Filipinos nor the procurement laws. The Court sustains respondents' contentions. V. The Constitutional policy on the pursuit of independent foreign relations cannot be used to nullify the Loan Agreements' arbitration clauses. The Court rules in favor of respondents. In view of the foregoing disquisitions, petitioners have failed to present any compelling issue to warrant the nullification of the CRPIP and NCWS Loan Agreements, or any of its clauses. Save for the apprehensive language of the Confidentiality Clauses-which issue is nevertheless already moot­ the Loan Agreements have sufficiently complied with the applicable procurement laws and conform with the pertinent provisions of the Constitution.","WHEREFORE, the consolidated petitions for prohibition in G.R. Nos. 245981 and 246594 are DENIED.

JACINTO, JR., PRESIDING JUDGE OF BRANCH 45, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT (RTC) OF SAN JOSE, OCCIDENTAL MINDORO","In Anonymous Complaint against Judge Jacinto, this Court found respondent guilty of 17 counts of gross ignorance of the law or procedure, and ordered his dismissal from service with forfeiture of retirement benefits, except leave credits, and prohibited his re-employment in the government. In addition, this Court also found him liable for gross misconduct and ordered him to pay fine in the amount of P30,000.00. Respondent's administrative liability for gross ignorance of the law stemmed from his orders in 17 criminal cases involving illegal drugs where he either granted motions for rehabilitation, or transferred custody of the accused to the Provincial Parole and Probation Office, which violated Sections 54 and 57 of Republic Act (RA) No. 9165. He was also found liable for gross misconduct when he issued an order in Civil Case No. 1792 entitled, Mike Tiu v. Leila Belly, transferring the custody of prisoner Ruben Tiu from the national penitentiary in San Ramon Penal Colony in Zamboanga to the Sablayan Prison and Penal Farm (SPPF) in San Jose, Occidental Mindoro without the approval of the Supreme Court, and for a period of eight months. Respondent now comes before this Court, a year after he was held administratively liable, praying for the restoration of his retirement benefits. He cites his 39 years of service, personal sufferings (vertigo, high blood pressure, wife's illness/death), waiver of rights to his wife's estate, and attached supporting letters from the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) Occidental Mindoro Chapter, and the Municipal Social Welfare and Development Office (MSWDO) of Rizal, Occidental Mindoro attesting to his character.","WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant Manifestation with Motion, praying for judicial clemency dated 10 May 2022, is hereby DENIED.","The instant manifestation having been filed 31 May 2022, the aforesaid guidelines thus, apply. At the outset, this Court notes that the five-year period has not been observed. In this case, respondent filed the instant manifestation with motion on 31 May 2022, or barely a year from this Court's 11 May 2021 Decision. Hence, it is doubtful whether respondent had sufficient time to do some introspection. Respondent has not put forth extraordinary circumstances that would justify the urgent resolution of his petition for clemency. As to respondent's supposed illnesses, vertigo, high blood pressure, high uric acid, and renal cyst, this Court is unconvinced that these medical conditions are compelling enough to merit disregarding the five-year period. Even if this Court ignores the time requirement, respondent's manifestation does not sufficiently establish his reformation. Although he has expressed remorse for his mistakes, it is unclear whether he understood the reasons for his dismissal, and what specific changes did he make, or intend to make, to avoid the same blunders. Verily, even the supporting testimonials respondent attached to his manifestation do not provide factual and verifiable circumstances that would convince this Court that respondent is a changed person. These testimonials merely narrate past experiences with respondent and do not detail events that happened after the promulgation of this Court's 11 May 2021 Decision.","the instant Manifestation with Motion, praying for judicial clemency dated 10 May 2022, is hereby DENIED."
"G.R. No. 257453, August 09, 2022","MARIZ LINDSEY TAN GANA-CARAIT Y VILLEGAS, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, ROMMEL MITRA LIM, AND DOMINIC P. NUÑEZ, RESPONDENTS.","On 17 October 2018, petitioner filed her CoC as Member of Sangguniang Panlungsod of the Lone District of Biñan, Laguna, for the 13 May 2019 National and Local Elections (NLE). On 22 October 2018, respondent Lim filed a petition for disqualification against petitioner before the COMELEC. Respondent Lim claimed that petitioner acquired United States (US) citizenship and sought election to public office without making a personal and sworn renunciation of any and all foreign citizenship before any public officer authorized to administer an oath. Subsequently, on 6 November 2018, respondent Nuñez likewise filed, before the COMELEC, a petition to deny due course to or cancel the certificate of candidacy of petitioner. Respondent Nuñez claimed that petitioner may not be considered a Filipino citizen or, at the very least, she is a dual citizen, because she uses a US passport. On 3 December 2018, petitioner filed her answers to the foregoing petitions, claiming that: (1) she did not commit any material representation in her CoC since there was no deliberate attempt to mislead, misinform, or hide a fact that would otherwise render a candidate ineligible; (2) she is a dual citizen and she is not precluded from seeking an elective position; (3) dual allegiance is unlike dual citizenship, and it is the former that is proscribed by law; (4) since there is no voluntary or positive act on her part in acquiring her US citizenship, she being born in the US, the provisions of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9225, otherwise known as the Citizenship Retention and Re-acquisition Act of 2003 (R.A. 9225), is not applicable to her. The COMELEC First Division issued its Resolution dated 27 February 2019, denying the petition for disqualification, but granting the petition to deny due course to or cancel petitioner's certificate of candidacy. The COMELEC First Division concluded that petitioner is a dual citizen, having been born to a Filipino father, and with the CRBA strongly indicating that she is likewise a US citizen. The COMELEC First Division further ruled that, while the allegation of disqualification must fail, with petitioner being a dual citizen and there being no proof that she took an oath of allegiance to the US, petitioner still committed material misrepresentation in her CoC when she stated therein that she was eligible to run for public office, reasoning that R.A. 9225 applies to her as a dual citizen by naturalization who failed to comply with the twin requirements (oath of allegiance and renunciation). The COMELEC En Banc denied petitioner's Motion for Partial Reconsideration in its 23 September 2021 Resolution, affirming that petitioner's failure to comply with R.A. 9225 rendered her ineligible and thus, she committed material misrepresentations.",the Petition for Certiorari is GRANTED.,"The COMELEC En Banc Resolution has not become final, in light of the timely filing of the petition. The instant case falls under the exception to the mootness doctrine. R.A. 9225 is applicable only to dual citizens by naturalization and not to dual citizens by birth. Petitioner is a dual citizen by birth, and not by naturalization. The COMELEC En Banc's conclusion that petitioner is a dual citizen by naturalization is manifestly erroneous because Philippine courts do not take judicial notice of foreign judgments and laws, the records are bereft of evidence she petitioned for US citizenship, and the CRBA itself states she acquired US citizenship at birth. Petitioner need not perform the twin requirements of Sections 3 and 5(2) of R.A. 9225. Petitioner did not commit false material representation in her CoC; thus, the COMELEC committed grave abuse of discretion in cancelling the same.","The Resolution dated 23 September 2021 of the Commission on Elections En Banc and the Resolution dated 27 February 2019 of the Commission on Elections First Division are ANNULLED and SET ASIDE. The Certificate of Finality dated 13 December 2021, the Entry of Judgment dated 13 December 2021, and the Writ of Execution dated 31 January 2022 issued by the COMELEC En Banc, in relation to the Resolution dated 23 September 2021, are likewise CANCELLED and SET ASIDE. Accordingly, the Petition to Deny Due Course to or Cancel Certificate of Candidacy dated 6 November 2018, filed by private respondent Dominic P.

The Court of Appeals (CA) upheld the rejection.

G.R. Nos. 210224 & 219632: GSMI filed a complaint for unfair competition, infringement, and damages against Tanduay Distillers, Inc. (TDI) for using the mark ""GINEBRA"" in its product ""GINEBRA KAPITAN,"" claiming confusion due to the mark's association exclusively with GSMI. The Regional Trial Court (RTC) dismissed the complaint, ruling ""GINEBRA"" is generic and did not acquire secondary meaning. The CA (in SP No. 127255 and CV No. 100332) reversed the RTC, finding trademark infringement and unfair competition, holding that ""GINEBRA"" had acquired secondary meaning.

G.R. No. 216104: TDI filed an application in 2006 for registration of the mark ""GINEBRA KAPITAN."" GSMI opposed, asserting ownership by prior and continuous use and acquisition of secondary meaning for ""GINEBRA."" The Bureau of Legal Affairs (BLA) and the IPO Director General granted TDI's application, affirming that ""GINEBRA"" is generic. The CA reversed this ruling, finding that ""GINEBRA"" is not a generic word to the Filipino gin-drinking public and had acquired secondary meaning.","The Court finds that ""GINEBRA"" is not a generic mark.","The ultimate factor in determining whether a particular word is generic, is public perception. The standard adopted is the primary significance test, reflected in Sec. 151.1(b) of R.A. No. 8293, which looks at the primary significance of the mark to the relevant public. The doctrine of foreign equivalents is not an absolute rule and does not apply here because the consuming public would not likely ""stop and translate the foreign word into its English equivalent."" Based on overwhelming evidence, including empirical consumer surveys (Projects Bookman and Georgia) which showed 90% consumer association of the term with GSMI, the term ""GINEBRA"" has undergone a semantic shift. It is considered a descriptive mark (referring to ""Genever/Jenever,"" a kind of gin) that has become distinctive, having acquired a secondary meaning under Sec. 123.2 of R.A. No. 8293 due to GSMI’s substantially exclusive and continuous use for over 180 years. TDI committed trademark infringement by using the distinctive and dominant mark ""GINEBRA"" in ""GINEBRA KAPITAN,"" leading to a likelihood of confusion among consumers (Dominancy Test applied). TDI also committed unfair competition, as its use of ""GINEBRA"" and the similar packaging intended to pass off its goods as those of GSMI, riding on its established goodwill. The holistic test has been conclusively abandoned in this jurisdiction.","1. In G.R. No. 196372, the petition is GRANTED.

(Supply Oilfield), represented by its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Louis Paul Heusaff, was impleaded as Vantage Company's resident agent. Amoroso was employed by Vantage Payroll on April 29, 2010. Meanwhile, Constantino was employed by Vantage Management on July 10, 2011. Subsequently, on December 11, 2015, Amoroso and Constantino were allegedly verbally notified that their contracts will be terminated on the ground of redundancy. On January 12, 2016, Amoroso received a Letter stating that his behavior after being informed of his redundancy ""became extremely disruptive and volatile."" Thus, he was summarily dismissed for gross misconduct effective immediately. The Labor Arbiter found that it had no jurisdiction over Amoroso and Constantino's employer, Vantage Payroll, which had no legal personality in the Philippines, and dismissed the complaint. The National Labor Relations Commission dismissed the appeal and affirmed the Labor Arbiter's ruling. The Court of Appeals upheld the Complaint's dismissal and the lower tribunals' ruling that, despite the service of summons upon the resident agent of Vantage Company, the lower tribunals did not acquire jurisdiction over the persons of the other respondents (i.e., Amoroso's and Constantino's employers Vantage Payroll and Vantage Management and their mother company, Vantage International). Petitioners sought reversal, arguing that all respondents acted as one entity and jurisdiction was acquired over them all through service of summons upon Supply Oilfield.","Through a Resolution, the Court of Appeals upheld the Complaint's dismissal and the lower tribunals' ruling that, despite the service of summons upon the resident agent of Vantage Company, the lower tribunals did not acquire jurisdiction over the persons of the other respondents (i.e., Amoroso's and Constantino's employers Vantage Payroll and Vantage Management and their mother company, Vantage International).

The court must first acquire jurisdiction over the corporation or corporations involved before its or their separate personalities are disregarded.

"G.R. No. 228719, August 08, 2022","DOMINGA P. CABUG-OS, DOING BUSINESS UNDER THE NAME, KEM'S STORE, PETITIONER, VS. TERESITA JORTA ESPINA, RESPONDENT.","Cabug-os does business under Kem's Sarisari Store. Espina started working as a tindera at the store on April 10, 2010, with a salary starting at P2,500.00 a month, increasing to P3,500.00 a month in 2012. She tended the store from 5:00 a.m. to 12:00 midnight on Monday to Sunday. Sometime in November 2012, Cabug-os advised Espina to take a leave of absence and wait for a call to resume work. Espina called in December 2012 and January 2013 to inquire but alleged that Cabug-os did not answer her calls. In February 2013, Espina went to the store, found a new tindera, and was allegedly told her services were no longer needed. Espina filed a complaint for illegal dismissal, underpayment of salary, and non-payment of benefits. Cabug-os argued that Espina was not dismissed but was asked to wait until the construction of the stockroom was finished, and that her business was exempt from the payment of minimum wage. The labor arbiter found that Espina was illegally dismissed but awarded only P10,000.00 as separation pay. The National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) partly granted Espina's appeal, ruling she was entitled to backwages, reinstatement (later separation pay), salary differentials, 13th month pay, and attorney's fees, totaling P678,804.69, computed based on minimum wage. Cabug-os appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA), asserting Espina's appeal was defective and maintaining her exemption from minimum wage. The CA denied the Petition, affirming the NLRC, noting that Cabug-os failed to show proof of approved exemption and that her Barangay Micro Business Establishment Certificate of Authority was issued only on June 24, 2013, after Espina's dismissal. Cabug-os then filed this Petition for Review on Certiorari, arguing Espina's appeal verification was defective, that Espina was a kasambahay, and that the monetary award was harsh and confiscatory.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is PARTLY GRANTED. The Court of Appeals' July 28, 2016 Decision and December 9, 2016 Resolution in CA-G.R. SP No. 139331 finding that respondent Teresita Jorta Espina was illegally dismissed are SUSTAINED. Petitioner Dominga P. Cabug-os is ORDERED to pay respondent her salaries from November 18, 2012 to December 19, 2014 at the rate of P3,500.00 per month, and separation pay of one (1) month salary for every year of service. All other money awards are DELETED. This case is hereby REMANDED to the National Labor Relations Commission for the proper computation of the judgment award. SO ORDERED.","The lack of proper verification in respondent's Notice of Partial Appeal to the NLRC does not constitute a fatal defect, as technical rules of procedure are not binding on the Commission. The factual findings by the Labor Arbiter, NLRC, and CA that respondent was a tindera and not a kasambahay, and that she was illegally dismissed, are sustained. However, the computation of the judgment award must be re-examined. Considering that petitioner's store is a barangay micro business enterprise (BMBE), as confirmed by her subsequent registration, and given the informality and minuscule profit-earning capacity of sari-sari stores, the Court ruled that applying the minimum wage rate for the computation of judgment awards would be unfair, unreasonable, and unconscionable, even though the BMBE exemption technically applied after the dismissal. Applying principles of equity, the BMBE exemption from the coverage of the Minimum Wage Law is considered. Thus, respondent's backwages must be computed at the rate of her last salary (P3,500.00/month), and separation pay should be at the rate of one month salary for every year of service. Salary differentials and attorney's fees should be deleted.","The finding of illegal dismissal is sustained. The Petition is partly granted, resulting in the recalculation of monetary awards based on the employee's actual salary (P3,500.00/month) rather than the minimum wage, deletion of salary differentials and attorney's fees, and remand of the case to the National Labor Relations Commission for the proper computation."

The subject of the controversy pertained to the ownership of a parcel of land located in Barrio Maahas, Los Baños, Laguna, denominated as Lot No. 4310 (subject property), claimed to be under the name of Rodolfo Manipol Alvarez (Rodolfo). Rodolfo's parents, Spouses Miguel and Vicenta Alvarez, allegedly distributed their properties by 'toka' (oral giving), giving one half (1/2) of the 2,696 square-meter property to Rodolfo and the other half to his sister, Fidela Alvarez Zarate. Rodolfo built a house on his share in 1975 and his family continues occupying the same. After Rodolfo's death in 2001, Beatriz Alvarez (Rodolfo's widow) discovered that Rodolfo's share had been transferred in the name of the Spouses Zarate by virtue of a Deed of Absolute Sale dated May 30, 1978, which she alleged contained non-genuine signatures of Rodolfo's parents. The entirety of the property was subsequently mortgaged by the Spouses Zarate to TRC as collateral for a loan provided to Princesa Cotton Corporation. TRC argued that the Deed of Absolute Sale was valid and that respondents were barred by laches for waiting 24 years to question the deed.","The Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Calamba City, Branch 92 dismissed the complaint. It held that the donation of the subject property made in favor of the heirs of Rodolfo was void for failure to comply with the formalities provided by law, but declared the Deed of Absolute Sale executed in favor of the spouses Zarate valid. Since the Zarates were found to be the absolute owners, the real estate mortgage executed in favor of TRC was considered valid. The RTC also found respondents barred by laches. The Court of Appeals (CA) reversed and set aside the RTC Decision. The CA upheld the validity of the oral donation/partition ('toka') made in favor of the heirs of Rodolfo, stressing that acts of ownership were exercised over the property. The CA rejected the defense of laches, holding that the opportunity to file the complaint arose only upon discovery of the deed of sale and tax declaration in the name of the spouses Zarate. The CA declared the May 30, 1978 Deed of Absolute Sale, the tax declarations issued pursuant thereto, and the real estate mortgage constituted over Lot. No. 4310 situated in Barrio Maahas, Los Baños, Laguna NULL and VOID insofar as the ½ share of plaintiffs-appellants in the subject property is concerned.","The Supreme Court denied the petition, ruling that the principle of laches is not applicable because the respondents did not have knowledge or notice of the conduct complained of (the execution of the Deed of Absolute Sale and the transfer of the property) until 2001, after Rodolfo's death. The Court affirmed the validity of the oral partition ('toka') based on the equitable doctrine that courts enforce parol partition when it has been completely or partly performed through the taking of possession in severalty and the exercise of ownership. Since Rodolfo built a house on the property in 1975 and his heirs continued occupation, the ownership of the one-half share was established. Because the spouses Zarate were not the absolute owners of the respondents' one-half share, they had no right to mortgage that portion. Citing Article 2085 of the Civil Code, the Court affirmed the CA's finding that the real estate mortgage constituted over Lot No. 4310 is null and void insofar as the one-half share of the respondents in the subject property is concerned.","WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED. The Decision dated April 24, 2014 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 97375 is AFFIRMED. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 238501, August 03, 2022","ST. FRANCIS SQUARE REALTY CORPORATION (FORMERLY KNOWN AS ASB REALTY CORPORATION), PETITIONER, VS. BSA TOWER CONDOMINIUM CORPORATION, RESPONDENT.","Petitioner SFSRC, then known as ASB Realty Corporation, was the developer of BSA Tower, a condominium building in Legaspi Village, Makati City. On April 10, 1995, petitioner SFSRC executed a Master Deed with Declaration of Restrictions stating that, as the developer, it has the sole option to convert, make, or use the residential units or some of them as an apartelle or condotel. Sometime in 2001, petitioner SFSRC agreed to respondent BSATCC's request to allow another entity, Quantum Hotels & Resorts Inc. (Quantum), to operate the condotel at the BSA Tower. Years later, petitioner SFSRC sent a letter dated July 13, 2005 to respondent BSATCC stating the former's desire to operate the condotel starting January 2007. Quantum did not stop its operations. On April 25, 2007, petitioner SFSRC filed a complaint for injunction with damages against Quantum (Civil Case No. MC07-3251). The RTC (injunction court) ruled in favor of petitioner SFSRC (Decision dated July 11, 2011), permanently enjoining Quantum. This decision was affirmed by the CA and eventually by the Supreme Court (G.R. No. 208864). A Writ of Execution was issued on May 19, 2014. The sheriff reported that a new entity, Vander Build RE Holding Corporation (Vanderbuild), was operating the condotel and refused to receive the writ. On June 4, 2014, petitioner SFSRC filed a Petition [To Cite In Contempt] against Quantum, Vander Build RE Holdings Corporation, Juaquin Mercado, and herein respondent BSATCC. Respondent BSATCC filed a Special Appearance with Motion to Dismiss the Petition [To Cite In Contempt] arguing that the RTC had no jurisdiction over its person as it was not impleaded in the injunction case. The RTC denied respondent BSATCC's motion to dismiss.","We SET ASIDE the Order dated 17 December 2014 issued by the Regional Trial Court, Branch 211, Mandaluyong City. Instead, we DISMISS the Petition [To Cite In Contempt], as against the named party defendant[,] the petitioner BSA Tower Condominium Corporation. The CA found that petitioner SFSRC's contempt petition was premised on the alleged refusal of respondent BSATCC to obey the injunction court's Decision dated July 11, 2011 and the Writ of Execution dated May 19, 2014 issued pursuant thereto. However, the injunction case was filed by petitioner SFSRC against Quantum only without impleading respondent BSATCC.","The petition has no merit. Based on the foregoing, it is already settled that respondent BSATCC was not a party in the injunction case and is therefore not bound by the judgment rendered by the injunction court. Therefore, it could not have been guilty of indirect contempt when it refused to obey the injunction court's Decision dated July 11, 2011 and the Writ of Execution issued on May 19, 2014. It is clear that the case is already barred by the law of the case. The issue presented in the instant petition, i.e., whether the CA erred in granting respondent BSATCC's motion to dismiss the contempt petition, is now moot. To stress, the contempt court had already dismissed the contempt petition on the merits against respondent BSATCC, among others, and such decision is already final and executory. 'It is axiomatic in this jurisdiction that where a decision on the merits of a case is rendered and the same has become final and executory, the action on procedural matters or issues is thereby rendered moot and academic. Inarguably, an adjudication of the procedural issue presented for resolution would be a futile exercise.'",DENIED
"G.R. No. 216107, August 03, 2022","JUAN M. GACAD, JR., PETITIONER,VS. HON. ROGELIO P. CORPUZ, IN HIS CAPACITY AS PRESIDING JUDGE OF BRANCH 27, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, BAYOMBONG, NUEVA VIZCAYA, RESPONDENT.","Petitioner Juan M. Gacad, Jr. (Gacad) filed a Petition for the Probate of the Last Will and Testament of the late Ermelinda Gacad with the RTC of Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya, which was raffled to Branch 27. The petition alleged that the testator passed away on May 30, 2013 in Quezon City. Her Certificate of Death indicates Marikina Heights, Marikina City as her residence at the time of her death. In its July 1, 2014 Order, the RTC directed petitioner to show cause on why the petition should not be dismissed for violation of the rule on venue, noting that the decedent's death certificate states Marikina City as her residence, making the RTC of Marikina City the proper court. Gacad filed a Comment to assail the July 1, 2014 Order and contended therein that the trial court cannot motu proprio dismiss the petition for probate on the ground of improper venue, that the location of the decedent's property is in Nueva Vizcaya, and improper venue is not one of the grounds for the dismissal of an action under the Rules of Court. In its September 23, 2014 Order, the trial court dismissed the petition for probate for violation of the rule on venue (Assailed Order). Hence, Gacad filed this Petition for Certiorari challenging the Assailed Order.","The petition is granted. The Supreme Court found that petitioner's failure to file a motion for reconsideration was excused since the questions raised (motu proprio dismissal on venue) had been duly raised and passed upon by the trial court when it treated the Comment as a motion to reconsider. The Court also relaxed the doctrine on hierarchy of courts despite the violation, considering that the fundamental issue raised was a pure question of law on jurisdiction and venue over probate proceedings, and that relaxing the rule would prevent further delay in the settlement of the decedent's estate. The Court concluded that the trial court gravely abused its discretion in ordering, motu proprio, the dismissal of the petition for probate on the ground of improper venue.","The trial court gravely abused its discretion in ordering, motu proprio, the dismissal of the petition for probate on the ground of improper venue. The court a quo confused the concepts of jurisdiction and venue when it asserted that the residence of the decedent is a foundational fact relating to jurisdiction. Rule 73, Section 1 merely relates to the venue of estate proceedings, not jurisdiction over the subject matter. Venue is procedural, not jurisdictional, and is waivable if not timely raised by the parties through a motion to dismiss or in the answer. Citing *Dacoycoy v. Intermediate Appellate Court*, the Court reiterated that the trial court cannot pre-empt the defendant's prerogative to object to the improper laying of the venue by motu proprio dismissing the case. The trial court's premature dismissal manifestly disregarded the basic rules and procedures, amounting to grave abuse of discretion.","WHEREFORE, the instant Petition is GRANTED. The assailed September 23, 2014 Order of the Regional Trial Court, Nueva Vizcaya, Branch 27 is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Accordingly, Special Proceeding No. 2658 is hereby REINSTATED and REMANDED to the Regional Trial Court, Branch 27 for further proceedings. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 237664, August 03, 2022","WILLY FRED U. BEGAY, PETITIONER, VS. OFFICE OF THE SPECIAL INVESTIGATION - BANGKO SENTRAL NG PILIPINAS, RURAL BANK OF SAN LUIS (PAMP), INC., RODOLFO N. REYES, DAVID C. JINGCO, JR., MARGARITO P. GUZMAN, RESTITUTO M. DAVID, FEDERICO S. TOLENTINO, JR., AMELIA T. HAMBRE, MA. MARGARITA M. VICENCIO, AND MARIA RUBINA B. MAGLANGUE,* RESPONDENTS.","Begay is engaged in the real estate business in Benguet and Tarlac. As his business needed financial assistance for the completion of some of his projects, he obtained a loan amounting to P6,000,000.00 from the Rural Bank of San Luis Pampanga, Inc. (the Bank) on January 30, 2009. As security, he mortgaged two properties covered by Transfer Certificates of Title (TCT) Nos. T-70270 and T-70271 located in Ambiong, La Trinidad, Benguet. [5] By November 2009, Begay's loan from the Bank had escalated to P8,000,000.00. Moreover, the mortgaged properties were subdivided into eight lots with TCT Nos. T-72632 to T-72639. [6] Aside from the foregoing loan, Begay allegedly also obtained another loan through one Corazon A. Magallano (Magallano), his attorney-in-fact, in the amount of P1,800,000.00, which was secured by a mortgage over a property in Baguio with TCT No. T-94973. [7] On February 24, 2010, Begay applied for an additional loan amounting to P2,000,000.00 with the same properties in Benguet as collateral. [8] When the loans matured, Begay was unable to fully settle his obligations. To prevent the foreclosure of his mortgages, the Bank allegedly proposed for Begay to present additional collaterals so that it could release to him additional loans to be used as a working capital, and to pay off his maturing obligations to the Bank. However, when Begay presented his property in Baguio as collateral, the Bank allegedly requested him to look for individuals who can represent him for the additional loans that will be extended to him since the Bank could exceed the rule on Single Borrower's Limit. [9] Thereafter, Begay obtained two more loans from the Bank through his purported representatives, Magallano and one Jimmy M. Sy (Sy), amounting to P1,000,000.00 and P2,500,000.00, respectively. [10] In November 2010, Begay was asked to update his loan obligations and settle his maturing loans with the Bank. The Bank then allegedly asked Begay to execute another real estate mortgage in the amount of P2,000,000.00 over his prope1iies in Benguet, which the latter agreed to. During the same month, an additional loan of P500,000.00 was extended to his alleged attorney-in-fact, Magallano. [11] Consequently, Begay's loans with the Bank ballooned to P17,800,000.00. Most of the proceeds were allegedly applied as payment for the renewal of his initial loan and the charges imposed by the Bank. [12] Subsequently, the Bank informed Begay that his mortgage over the Benguet properties will be foreclosed due to his failure to pay the balance of his respective loans. However, around this time, Begay was in dire need of financing for his 30,000 square meter memorial park project in Estacion, Paniqui, Tarlac. To resolve Begay's predicament, the Bank allegedly offered the release of his previously mortgaged properties and an additional loan for the development of the memorial park project if Begay would offer the same project as new collateral. When Begay agreed to mortgage his memorial project, he was granted an additional loan of P12,000,000.00 through another attorney-in-fact in the person of Jocelyn M. Salvado (Salvado). [13] In early 2011, Begay yet again applied for another loan of P7,000,000.00 but the Bank required him to present new representatives with whom it can extend a loan to. Begay then presented one Arthur Bernal (Bernal) and Marilou Miranda (Miranda) as his representatives for the loan. Thus, the Bank purportedly extended P3,000,000.00 and P4,000,000.00, to Bernal and Miranda, respectively. [14] When Begay wanted to obtain another loan, the officers of the Bank purportedly invited him to a meeting in Hacienda Luisita to discuss his new loan application. However, they informed him that the Bank was being subjected to an audit by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) and that the Bank had already exceeded the rule on the Single Borrower's Limit. [15] On April 15, 2011, Begay sent a letter to the Bank proposing that the title of his properties be transferred to the name of his clients and guaranteeing to the Bank that the transfer could be done within 30 days or less. [16] By virtue of his foregoing proposal, Begay allegedly executed a simulated sale of the memorial park project to the following: (1) Alejandro P. Bautista (Bautista); (2) Edmundo P. Gumangan (Gumangan), and (3) Arner I. Novero (Novero). [17] The Deed of Absolute Sale stated that the property was sold for P500,000.00. Consequently, the property was subdivided and new certificates of title were issued in the names of the purported buyers. Furthermore, to facilitate the transfer, the Bank allegedly extended to Begay the advanced releases of his loan despite not being covered by any mortgage contract. [18] On June 16, 2011, the Bank allegedly compelled Bautista, Gumangan, and Novero to sign a real estate mortgage contract for P33,000,000.00 or P11,000,000.00 each. On even date, the real estate mortgages were annotated on the respective titles. Despite this, the purported buyers did not receive the proceeds of the loan. [19] Upon the annotation of the mortgages on the respective land titles, Begay sought the release of the previously mortgaged properties. However, given that the Bank was going through an audit, a Cancellation and Discharge of Mortgage signed by the officers of the Bank, Ramon C. Ricafort Jr. (Ricafort), [20] Chairman of the Board and President, and Rodolfo N. Reyes (Reyes), Director, Vice President, and General Manager, was issued instead. The said document purportedly guaranteed the release of the latter's previously mortgaged properties. [21] However, the Bank allegedly failed to honor its commitment of releasing said properties and extending to Begay the promised additional credit. Moreover, the Bank also supposedly failed to apply as payments for his previous loans the proceeds of the loans granted to the alleged transferees of the memorial project, namely, Bautista, Gumangan, and Novero. [22] On May 31, 2012, upon Begay's request, the Bank purportedly issued a Statement of Account showing that his total obligation already amounted to P57,500,000.00. [23] According to the Bank, the loans in the names of Begay's alleged attorneys-in-fact, Magallano, Sy, Bernal, Miranda, Salvado, Gumangan, Novero, [24] and Bautista were distinct and separate from Begay's loans. The Bank further claimed that the respective promissory notes of the aforementioned borrowers showed that they obtained such loans in their personal capacities; thus, there can be no violation of the rules on the Single Borrower's Limit. It also claimed that some of the subject loans had already been paid, such as the loan of Salvado which had been paid in full. [25] On August 16, 2012, the Bank commenced the filing of several Petitions for Extrajudicial Foreclosure of Real Estate Mortgages before the courts of proper jurisdiction given that Begay failed to settle his loan obligations with the Bank. [26] Sometime thereafter, Begay requested from the Bank a Statement of Account pertaining to the loan secured by the memorial project; however, the Bank refused to issue the same on the basis that only the respective mortgagors had the authority to request for such issuance. [27] On February 11, 2013, Begay filed a Petition for Annulment of Promissory Notes, Mortgages, Public Auction Sale and Damages with Prayer for Preliminary Injunction against the Bank and its officers, namely: Ricafort, Reyes, Directors David C. Jingco, Jr. Margarito P. Guzman, and Restituto M. David, Corporate Secretary Federico S. Tolentino, Jr., Treasurer Amelia T. Hambre, and Compliance Officers Ma. Margarita M. Vicencio and Maria Rubina B. Maglangue. [28] On August 12, 2013, Begay filed an administrative complaint against the Bank and its abovementioned officers before the Office of the Special Investigation (OSI) of the BSP for allegedly conducting business in an unsafe and unsound manner, in violation of: (1) Sections 35, 39, and 56 of Republic Act No. (RA) 8791, [29] otherwise known as the General Banking Law of 2000, in relation to Section 37 of RA 7653, [30] or the New Central Bank Act; (2) RA 3765 [31] or the Truth in Lending Act; (3) RA 8424 [32] or the Tax Reform Act of 1997; (4) Batasang Pambansa (BP) 68 [33] or the Corporation Code of the Philippines; and (5) other charges. [34] Ruling of the Office of the Special Investigation-Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas After the parties presented their respective arguments and evidence in support of their positions, the OSI rendered its Resolution [35] dated May 29, 2014 and ruled in favor of the Bank. The dispositive portion of the Resolution states: IN LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING, complainant failed to establish a prima facie case against respondents for alleged violation of R.A. No. 8791 and R.A. No. 7653 rendering the complaint dated 12 August 2013 as hereby DISMISSED [.] [36] According to the OSI, Begay failed to establish: (1) that the Bank and its officers conducted its business in an unsafe and unsound manner; [37] (2) that Begay was the sole owner of the subject loans; [38] (3) that his loans exceeded 25% of net worth of the Bank; [39] and (4) that herein respondents had any participation in the alleged simulated sale between Begay and Gumangan, Bautista, and Novero. [40] Aggrieved, Begay filed a Motion for Reconsideration. [41] However, the OSI denied the same in a Resolution [42] dated November 15, 2014. The fallo of the said Resolution reads: IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, the instant Motion for Reconsideration filed by complainant Willy Fred U. Begay is hereby DENIED for lack of merit. SO ORDERED. [43] In denying the motion, the OSI held that: (1) Begay failed to establish the alleged violation of Section 35 of RA 8791 on the Single Borrower's Limit; (2) Begay and the Bank have freedom to stipulate in their contracts of loan; (3) Begay failed to establish that Bautista, Gumangan, and Novero were unqualified borrowers in relation to Sec. 40 of RA 8791; (4) Begay failed to establish that respondents violated Sec. 55.1.c of RA 8791 by allegedly collecting commissions for the loans they approved and RA 3765 by allegedly assessing interest rates different from that appearing in his disclosure statements; (5) OSI has no jurisdiction to determine the existence of a simulated sale; and (6) OSI cannot take cognizance of the issues that fall beyond the authority granted by BSP Circular No. 477, otherwise known as the ""Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) Rules of Procedure on Administrative Cases Involving Directors and Officers of Banks, Quasi-Banks and Trust Entities."" [44] Undaunted, Begay filed a Petition for Certiorari [45] under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court before the CA. [46] Ruling of the Court of Appeals In the assailed Decision dated May 26, 2017, the CA dismissed the Petition for Certiorari on the ground that Begay availed of the wrong remedy, and that he failed to perfect his appeal seasonably. According to the appellate court, Begay had 15 days to file his appeal under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court pursuant to Section 1, Rule VII of BSP Circular No. 477. [47] For failing to file the proper mode of appeal within the given period, the CA held that the OSI Resolutions had already lapsed into immutability. [48] The dispositive portion of the CA Decision reads: WHEREFORE, the Petition for Certiorari of petitioner Willy Fred U. Begay is hereby DISMISSED. SO ORDERED. [49] Aggrieved, Begay filed a Motion for Reconsideration. [50] However, the CA denied it through a Resolution dated February 13, 2018 since it found that Begay failed to raise any argument, factual or legal, that would justify a reconsideration of the CA Decision. [51] Hence, the instant Petition.","In the assailed Decision dated May 26, 2017, the CA dismissed the Petition for Certiorari on the ground that Begay availed of the wrong remedy, and that he failed to perfect his appeal seasonably.

[48] The dispositive portion of the CA Decision reads: WHEREFORE, the Petition for Certiorari of petitioner Willy Fred U. Begay is hereby DISMISSED. SO ORDERED.","The Petition lacks merit. As the complaint filed by Begay before the OSI is an administrative complaint against the Bank and its officers, the case falls within the purview of BSP Circular No. 477, Series of 2005, which lays down the Rules of Procedure on Administrative Cases Involving Directors and Officers of Banks, Quasi- Banks and Trust Entities. ... Here, the administrative complaint filed by Begay did not reach the proceedings before the Hearing Panel or Hearing Officer and the consequent resolution of the Monetary Board. To recall, the OSI found that Begay failed to establish a prima facie case against the Bank and thus dismissed the case. [56] On this score, the last sentence of Section 2, Rule III of the BSP Circular finds relevance, which provides that ""in the absence of a prima facie case, the OSI shall dismiss the complaint without prejudice or take appropriate action as may be warranted."" [57] ... Hence, Begay's immediate and adequate remedy was to refile his complaint before the OSI with the sufficient evidence to support his allegations. Correspondingly, Begay availed of the wrong remedy when he filed a Rule 65 Petition before the CA. ... In the instant case, the fact that another remedy, i.e., to file a complaint anew, is ready, available, and at the full disposal of Begay already bars his remedial refuge in certiorari. [60] ... In any case, for the reasons explained above, the Petition for Certiorari filed by Begay before the CA was rightfully dismissed. As for the second issue raised by Begay in the Petition filed before this Court on whether the CA erred when it failed to rule that the OSI committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or in excess of jurisdiction in issuing the assailed Resolutions providing that the petitioner failed to establish a prima facie case against the officers of the Bank, [64] the Court finds no cogent reason to disturb the findings of the OSI. ... A careful perusal of the assailed OSI Resolutions would show that the conclusion of the OSI that there was no prima facie case against herein respondents was founded on substantial evidence. Both Resolutions clearly expressed the grounds upon which the complaint was dismissed. ... Therefore, the dismissal of the Petition is warranted.","WHEREFORE, the Petition is hereby DISMISSED. The Decision dated May 26, 2017 and the Resolution dated February 13, 2018 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 139322 are hereby AFFIRMED. SO ORDERED."

OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU OF LEGAL AFFAIRS OF THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OFFICE OF THE PHILIPPINES AND LE COMITÉ INTERPROFESSIONEL DU VIN DE CHAMPAGNE,* RESPONDENTS.","On March 19, 2013, petitioner Manila Hotel Corporation applied for registration of its trademark ""CHAMPAGNE ROOM"" with the IPO, docketed as Application No. 4-2013-003052. On November 7, 2013, petitioner received a Notice of Opposition from respondent Le Comité Interprofessionel du Vin de Champagne (CIVC), alleging that ""Champagne"" is protected as a controlled appellation of origin, the mark falsely suggests a connection with CIVC, misleads the public as to the geographical origin, and is confusingly similar to CIVC's trade name. On December 22, 2017, the IPO Adjudication Officer rendered a Decision dismissing CIVC's opposition, holding that the use of ""CHAMPAGNE ROOM"" did not suggest a connection to CIVC or mislead the public, and that ""CHAMPAGNE"" had become generic. CIVC received the Decision on February 2, 2018, and filed a Motion for Extension of Time to File Appeal to the IPO-BLA Director, citing the need for more time due to heavy pressure of professional work and coordination with CIVC, which is based outside the Philippines. Petitioner opposed the motion, arguing that the Revised Inter Partes Rules do not allow for extensions of the period to appeal. The IPO-BLA Director granted the motion in an Order dated February 13, 2018, giving CIVC until February 22, 2018, to file the appeal. Subsequently, the IPO-BLA Director issued a second Order dated March 12, 2018, ordering petitioner to comment on the appeal. Petitioner filed before the CA a Petition for certiorari and prohibition assailing the IPO-BLA Director’s Orders, alleging grave abuse of discretion.","The Court of Appeals (CA) dismissed the Petition for certiorari and prohibition filed by Manila Hotel Corporation (petitioner). The CA liberally construed the procedural rules of the IPO and concluded that the IPO-BLA Director did not commit any jurisdictional error in granting respondent CIVC's Motion for Extension of Time to File an Appeal, noting that the rules did not expressly state that the ten (10) day period to file an appeal is inextendible nor prohibit granting an extension of time. The CA denied the application for issuance of temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction in its Resolution dated April 13, 2018, and subsequently denied reconsideration on July 23, 2018.","The Court denies the Petition and sustains the assailed Resolutions issued by the CA. The Court ruled that administrative rules of procedure should be construed liberally. An assiduous reading of Section 2(a), Rule 9 of the Revised Inter Partes Rules shows that while the rules expressly state that the 10-day period for filing a comment to the appeal is non-extendible, there is no similar express prohibition on moving for an extension of time for filing an appeal. Because the rules did not categorically and explicitly prohibit the filing of a motion for extension of time to file an appeal, the grant of such extension is not proscribed by law. The Court reiterated that quasi-judicial and administrative bodies, such as the IPO, are not bound by the strict rules of procedure, and the IPO-BLA Director acted within his authority and discretion. The CA was correct in ruling that the IPO-BLA Director did not act with grave abuse of discretion, as allowing the appeal served the highest interest of justice by providing both parties the opportunity to thresh out the issues based on merit and not on technicalities.","WHEREFORE, the instant Petition is DENIED.

Sometime after Christmas in 2016, Saira Sabir and Raja forced him to read the Quran. According to the Applicant, Raja was handing him the Quran but he refused to accept it and that while he was being forced to accept the Quran, the Quran accidentally dropped. Raja said that the Applicant insulted the Quran and is (sic) that he is now dead. Raja then grabbed a knife from the kitchen. This prompted the Applicant to run away. The Applicant explained that he does not want to return to Pakistan because he will be killed if he does return. The DOJ-RSPPU denied the application, concluding that being a Christian is not sufficient to amount to a risk of persecution and that the risk of blasphemy allegations is generally not enough unless the charge is pursued. The CA affirmed the denial.","WHEREFORE, the petition is hereby PARTLY GRANTED.

COMMISSION ON AUDIT, RESPONDENT.","In 2002, the Council of the Southeast Asian Games Federation awarded to the Philippines the privilege to host the 23rd Edition of the Southeast Asian Games (SEA Games) to be held from November 27, 2005 to December 5, 2005. Select segments of the 23rd SEA Games were staged in Bacolod City and as a result thereof, the BASOC was created. [4] Aware of the need to undertake rehabilitation works in the playing venues in Bacolod City, the Philippine Sports Commission (PSC) granted financial assistance to the BASOC and/or petitioner in the total amount of P50,500,000.00, disbursed in different dates-

P50,500,000.00 [5] Saddled with a tight schedule and certain budget limitations, the BASOC directly negotiated with contractors to hasten the rehabilitation of venues and facilities needed for the Bacolod leg of the 23rd SEA Games. [6] On February 1, 2008, more than two years after the SEA Games, the BASOC submitted liquidation reports regarding the financial assistance it received from the PSC. Consequently, respondent formed a special audit team to evaluate the liquidation reports. After due investigation, the special audit team issued Audit Observation Memorandum (AOM) No. 2010-01, divulging that: [The] BASOC did not liquidate the P50,500,000.00 funds within a reasonable time after the completion of the 23rd SEA Games; and [The] BASOC did not properly transfer to PSC and/or other government agencies the various facilities and/or items approximately totaling P30,844,000.00-which resulted in wastage of government resources. [7] The special audit team found the BASOC's documentation inadequate and unable to buttress the validity and correctness of its various transactions. Accordingly, the special audit team issued Notice of Suspension No. 2010-01 in the amount of P41,631,117.96, putting forth the following deficiencies: Lack of acknowledgment/delivery receipts of the items such that the validity of payments and actual receipt of goods/services were not established; Absence of accomplishment report and/or acceptance by the BASOC officials that proves the scope of work performed; and Failure to submit contract, approved scope of work, plans, specifications, actual bill of materials, and other relevant documents which could serve as basis for determining the reasonableness of payments made or work completed. [8] On January 30, 2014, the special audit team reevaluated the documents submitted by the BASOC and thereafter issued ND No. 2014-10l-GF/NSDF­ (05).

P36,778,105.4 4 [10] Ineluctably, BASOC's Chairperson, herein petitioner, and Loretizo, the Committee's Secretary General, were made liable for the disallowance as they were the signatories to the various infrastructure contracts with the suppliers and contractors. [11] Aggrieved, petitioner appealed [12] before respondent's Office of the Cluster Director - National Government Sector (NGS) Cluster I, praying that ND No. 2014-101-GF/NSDF-(05) be lifted.","On 23 January 2015, the Cluster Director of the NGS affirmed ND No. 2014-101-GF/NSDF-(05), accentuating the failure of the BASOC to submit relevant documents to bolster the validity and propriety of its transactions relative to the conduct of the 23rd SEA Games. [13] The Cluster Director enumerated various COA Circulars, COA Memorandum Orders, pertinent laws, and PCS 'sown policy, which all require the submission of documentary requirements to aid the special audit team in evaluating BASOC's liquidation report. [14] The Cluster Director likewise ratiocinated that resort to direct procurement would not excuse BASOC from submitting documentary requirements to validate the existence of the projects, and to determine the reasonableness of the costs incurred. [15] Unperturbed, petitioner elevated his case to respondent, which likewise affirmed ND No. 2014-001-GF/NSDF-(05) via the impugned Decision. [16] Respondent stressed that BASOC's failure to submit the pertinent documentary requirements proving the validity and propriety of its transactions entailed liability on the part of petitioner as its chairperson and authorized representative. [17] Since petitioner's motion for reconsideration was denied by respondent in the challenged Resolution, [18] he now seeks refuge before this Court through the present Petition, supplicating, in the main, that ND No. 2014-001- GF/NSDF-(05) be invalidated.","After a perlustration of the case and a juxtaposition of pertinent laws and jurisprudence with the arguments raised by the parties, this Court finds no discernible reason to absolve petitioner from liability.

It is primal that factual findings of administrative bodies charged with their specific field of expertise, are afforded great weight by the courts, and in the absence of substantial showing that such findings were made from an erroneous estimation of the evidence presented, they are deemed conclusive and binding upon this Court. In the interest of stability of the governmental structure, they should not be disturbed.

...

Respondent proper(v issued ND No. 2014-101-GFINSDF-(05) devoid of grave abuse of discretion.

As the guardian of public funds, respondent bears the constitutional mandate of ensuring that government resources are accurately spent. On this score, it is guided by certain fundamental principles in the discharge of its duty.

...

Irrefragably, in light of the BASOC's failure to submit post-audit documentary requirements, respondent's issuance of ND No. 2014-101- GF/NSDF-(05) is replete with statutory, procedural, and regulatory underpinnings.

Petitioner is liable for the disallowance.

...

Applying the foregoing legal and jurisprudential precepts, there can be no quibbling that petitioner committed gross negligence. As found by the Cluster Director, he merely submitted cost estimates and labor costs from the contractor for the rehabilitation of the Paglaum Stadium. For the football lighting facilities, he submitted the floodlighting layout plan prepared by the supplier, cost proposal signed by the pai1ies, notice from the contractor that the project had been completed but without complete details and official receipts of the check payments made by BASOC.

The Rules of Return under Madera v. Commission on Audit as amended by Torreta v. Commission on Audit is applicable.

Nonetheless, the Rules of Return first enunciated in Madera v. COA [36] as amended by Torreta v. COA, [37] which apply specifically to cases involving government contracts for procurement of goods and services, may be used to reduce the solidary liability of petitioner and his non-appealing co-respondent based on the principle of quantum meruit-

Accordingly, we hereby adopt the proposed guidelines on return of disallowed amounts in cases involving unlawful/irregular government contracts submitted by herein Justice Perlas-Bernabe, to wit:

1. If a Notice of Disallowance is set aside by the Court, no return shall be required from any of the persons held liable therein.

2. If a Notice of Disallowance is upheld, the rules on return are as follows:

a. Approving and ce1iifying officers who acted in good faith, in the regular performance of official functions, and with the diligence of a good father of the family are not civilly liable to return consistent with Section 38 of the Administrative Code of 1987.

b.   Pursuant to Section 43 of the Administrative Code of 1987, approving and certifying officers who are clearly shown to have acted with bad faith, malice, or gross negligence, are solidarity liable together with the recipients for the return of the disallowed amount.

c. The civil liability for the disallowed amount may be reduced by the amounts due to the recipient based on the application of the principle of quantum meruit on a case to case basis.

d.   These rules are without prejudice to the application of the more specific provisions of law, COA rules and regulations, and accounting principles depending on the nature of the government contract involved. (Emphasis supplied)

...

These doctrinal teachings impel the Court to apply the principle of quantum meruit to reduce petitioner's liability and that of his non-appealing co-respondent. The 23rd SEA Games brought prestige to the Philippines as the host-country and the success of the biennial multi-sport event is no ordinary feat. Moreover, the rehabilitation of the Paglaum Stadium, as well as the repairs and refurbishments of the sports facilities, were undertaken and delivered in time for the conduct of the games. Accordingly, despite the impropriety of the contract with the different contractors and suppliers, they are still entitled to retain the reasonable value of their deliveries and services to the BASOC. However, the determination of such value is factual in nature and beyond the province of the Court to undertake. Ergo, the total amount that the different contractors and suppliers are entitled to retain shall be deducted from the disallowed amount of P36,778,105.44.","WHEREFORE, the Petition for Certiorari with Urgent Prayer for Issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order or Writ of Preliminary Injunction is hereby DISMISSED. The Decision dated November 9, 2016 and the Resolution dated January 31, 2020 of the Commission on Audit, which affirmed Notice of Disallowance No. 2014-101-GF/NSDF-(05), are AFFIRMED WITH MODIFICATION. The case is REMANDED to the Commission on Audit for the determination of the civil liability of petitioner Monico O. Puentevella, as well as Eric T. Loretizo, in accordance with this Decision.

ENONG, JR.*; POLICE SUPERINTENDENT SIMNAR SEMACIO GRAN, POLICE INSPECTOR ARISTONE L. DOGWE, SENIOR POLICE OFFICER 1 ALLEN GLENN CADAG,** POLICE OFFICER 2 MARK RIEL CANILON, AND JOHN DOES CONSISTING OF MEMBERS OF THE ANTIPOLO CPS AIDSOTF AND PROVINCIAL SPECIAL OPERATING UNIT TEAM, PETITIONERS, VS. CHRISTINA MACANDOG GONZALES, RESPONDENT.","The records show that on July 5, 2016, Joselito died of multiple gunshot wounds after an encounter with police officers conducting a buy-bust operation under the direction of P/Insp. Dogwe and Police Senior Inspector Mark Gil Garcia ( PS/Insp. Garcia ). [4] Antecedents As enumerated by the CA, the original petition was directed against the following persons: 1) Rodrigo R. Duterte – President of the Republic of the Philippines; 2) Ismael Sueno – in his capacity as Secretary of the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG); 3) Ronald Dela Rosa – in his capacity as Director General of the Philippine National Police (PNP); 4) Valfrie G. Tabian – in his capacity as Acting Regional Director of the PNP Regional Office IV-A; 5) Adriano T. Enong – in his capacity as Officer-in-Charge (OIC) of Rizal PNP Provincial Office; 6) Simnar Semacio Gran – Police Superintendent and OIC of Antipolo City Station; 7) Aristone L. Dogwe – Police Inspector and member of the Anti-Illegal Drugs Special Operations Task Force (AIDSOTF), Antipolo City Police Station; 8) Allen Glenn Cadag – Senior Police Officer 1 (SPO1) from the Antipolo City Police Station; 9) Mark Riel Canilon – Police Officer 2 (PO2) from the Antipolo City Police Station; and 10) Members of the Antipolo City Police Station AIDSOTF and Provincial Special Operating Unit Team. [5] Sometime in March 2015, Christina and Joselito were arrested for using and selling illegal drugs. The arresting officers at the time were petitioners PO2 Canilon and Marlon Olaco ( Olaco ). Christina and Joselito were eventually released after allegedly paying PO2 Canilon the amount of P50,000.00. [6] Months later or in August 2015, Olaco gave Joselito some batong-bakal to sell. These were drugs reportedly supplied by the police for resale. This transaction took place only once as Joselito and Christina were unable to remit the full amount of the proceeds of the sale. [7] The following year, Joselito met Paulo Austria ( Austria ), who later became the driver of petitioner SPO1 Cadag, a member of the Antipolo police force. Later Austria introduced SPO1 Cadag to Joselito and Christina. Allegedly, SPO1 Cadag said he was looking for people to sell batong-bakal , and he assured the spouses that they would not be caught because he will protect them. Thus, Christina agreed. [8] Sometime in June 2016, Austria and SPO1 Cadag went to Christina and Joselito's house to give her two bags of shabu worth P16,000.00 to sell. She was reminded supposedly by the police officer that they can kill women regardless of age, so she should be careful in selling illegal drugs and remit to them the complete and exact amount of the drug's worth as sales. [9] That same month, police officers visited their house twice. The first time, PO2 Canilon and Olaco searched their house for illegal drugs, but they did not find any. Then, the police officers allegedly asked the spouses for P1,000.00 because they needed gasoline to visit a resort. [10] On the second visit, the police officers arrived at their house to arrest Joselito for selling drugs. Joselito was aware of this plan and so was away at the time. However, he warned Christina who remained at their house. When the police officers arrived, she was met with threats by the police officers that when they find Joselito, they will kill him. [11] On July 4, 2016, Joselito suffered from stomach pain, so he stayed home together with Christina's mother, Basiledes Macandog ( Macandog ). On that day, Christina was out. Before 5:00 p.m. of the same day, Christina wanted to send an SMS [12] message to Joselito to update him that she was on her way home. Upon taking out her mobile phone, she noticed two missed calls from Christian Raye "" Ian "" Cleopas ( Cleopas ), a friend of Christina and Joselito and who was purportedly known in the area as a confidential agent of the police. [13] When Christina arrived home, Joselito was not present. Christina's mother told her that she witnessed Joselito leave with Cleopas, because the latter asked him to help drive and do a lipat bahay (a moving house) job. At the time, Christina's mother noticed that Joselito was only wearing a pair of shorts and a sleeveless undershirt or a sando. Allegedly, she told him to dress properly for the job. However, Joselito replied "" Isu-shoot lang naman din nila ako "" (They will just shoot me anyway.) [14] Christina was nervous when she learned that Joselito accompanied Cleopas because she remembered that he was a police confidential agent. Moreover, Christina remembered the threats of the police officers to arrest her and her husband for selling illegal drugs. [15] On the evening of July 4, 2016, Joselito did not come home. The following day, Cleopas arrived at Christina's house looking for Joselito. Christina said "" Itinumba niyo na kaya hindi na siya nakauwi "" (You already killed him, that's why he did not come home.) Cleopas denied this and replied that he even paid Joselito P2,000.00 for the job he performed yesterday and insinuated that Joselito must have gone gambling with the money. [16] When Cleopas left, Austria called Christina to tell her that a shoot-out occurred near White Cross, Taktak, Antipolo between the police and a civilian. In the aftermath, a dead body was brought to a funeral parlor. After learning of the shoot-out, Christina hurriedly went to the house of her father-in-law, Rogelio Gonzales ( Gonzales ), to ask Barangay ( Brgy .) Chairman Ruco Picar for help. Together, they went to Heaven's Gate Funeraria and identified that the dead man was in fact her husband, Joselito. [17] Joselito's body was brought to the funeral home on July 5, 2016. During his wake, Joselito's father, Gonzales, noticed several unknown and suspicious-looking people asking for the whereabouts of Christina. He also became wary of a car parked outside of the funeral home where two men intently observed the people attending the wake. Similarly, in the funeral convoy, Gonzales reportedly saw a man observing them. One of their relatives even stopped his motorcycle in front of the man and looked directly at him in the face, but the man avoided his gaze and walked away towards the direction of Femar Resort, Taktak Road, Antipolo. [18] Because of the threats she received from PO2 Canilon and SPO1 Cadag, Christina was frightened that she would be killed next, so she went into hiding. She neither saw the body of Joselito, nor attended his funeral. Joselito was subsequently buried on July 14, 2016. [19] Up to the present, Christina alleges that the police officers from the Antipolo police force are looking for her. [20] On the part of the police officers, they alleged that on July 5, 2016, a buy-bust operation in Brgy. Dela Paz, Antipolo City was planned against a certain alias "" Tulis "" who was reportedly involved in the rampant selling of shabu in Sitio Bensonan, Brgy. Dela Paz, Antipolo City. [21] At around 9:30 p.m., the joint elements of Antipolo City Police Station AIDSOTF and the Rizal Provincial Special Operating Unit team led by P/Insp. Dogwe and PS/Insp. Garcia, respectively, conducted the buy-bust operation against Joselito. During the transaction of the illegal drug, it was reported that Joselito sensed that the poseur-buyer was a police officer, resulting in him hurriedly running away and firing towards the police officers. The police alleged that they were forced to return fire, killing Joselito. [22] An After-Scene of the Crime Operations ( SOCO ) Report dated July 6, 2016 was prepared and submitted, along with an Investigation Report dated July 15, 2016 prepared by SPO4 Ian Albert G. Voluntad and noted by petitioner, PS/Supt. Gran. The reports found that there was unlawful aggression on the part of one alias Tulis , later identified and confirmed to be Joselito, and that the police officers only acted in self-defense and in the performance of their duties. [23] On February 21, 2017, this Court issued a Resolution [24] granting Christina's prayer for the issuance of a Temporary Protection Order and a Writ of Amparo which reads: RESOLUTION After reviewing the Petition and its annexes, the Court resolves as follows: (1) ISSUE a TEMPORARY PROTECTION ORDER prohibiting Secretary Ismael Sueno, Dir. Gen. Ronald De La Rosa, PC Supt. Valfrie G. Tabian, PS Supt. Adriano T. Enong, P Supt. Simnar Semacio Gran, P. Insp. Aristone K. Dogwe, Allen Cadag, Mark Riel Canilon and John Does consisting of Members of the Antipolo CPS AIDSOTF and Provincial Special Operating Unit Team and any of their agents from entering within a radius of one (1) kilometer from the residences and work addresses of the petitioner; (2) ISSUE a WRIT OF AMPARO ; (3) REFER the petition to the Court of Appeals (CA) for IMMEDIATE RAFFLE among the CA justices; (4) ORDER the respondents Secretary Ismael Sueno, Dir. Gen. Ronald De La Rosa, PC Supt. Valfrie G. Tabian, PS Supt. Adriano T. Enong, P Supt. Simnar Semacio Gran, P. Insp. Aristone K. Dogwe, Allen Cadag, Mark Riel Canilon and John Does consisting of Members of the Antipolo CPS AIDSOTF and Provincial Special Operating Unit Team to make a verified RETURN of the writ before the CA within five (5) working days from receipt thereof; and (5) DIRECT the CA to IMMEDIATELY CONDUCT the hearing on the petition and the other interim reliefs prayed for, and DECIDE the case within ten (10) days after its submission for decision. [25] On June 27, 2017, the Special Seventeenth Division [26] of the CA issued a Resolution, effectively dropping President Rodrigo R. Duterte ( President Duterte ) as a party-respondent due to the President's immunity from suit. On July 20, 2017, Christina filed an Omnibus Motion [27] before the CA contending that Undersecretary Catalino S. Cuy ( Undersecretary Cuy ) of the Department of Interior and Local Government ( DILG ), Police Chief Superintendent Ma. O.R. Aplasca ( PC/Supt. Aplasca ) as incumbent Regional Director of Philippine National Police ( PNP ) Regional Office IV-A, and Police Senior Superintendent Albert E. Ocon ( PS/Supt. Ocon ) as incumbent Acting Provincial Director of Rizal should be added as respondents in view of the continuing threats against her life, liberty, and security. On December 18, 2017, Christina filed a Second Amended Petition for Writ of Amparo with Application for Temporary Protection Order, Production Order and Witness Protection Order [28] which, among others, omitted President Duterte as respondent and added as respondents Undersecretary Cuy, PC/Supt. Aplasca, and PS/Supt. Ocon. This was later admitted. Subsequently, the police officers against whom the Temporary Protection Order was issued filed their Return of the Writ [29] and Judicial Affidavits outlining their respective positions regarding the amended petition. On March 2, 2018, Christina filed her Preliminary Conference Brief. The police officers filed their Preliminary Conference Brief (with Comment on [Respondent's] Preliminary Conference Brief) on August 31, 2018. [30] The police officers then filed a Motion to Resolve Petition Based on Affidavits to which Christina filed her Comment thereto. On November 12, 2018, Christina submitted her Judicial Affidavit [31] reiterating her allegations in her petition, and that of her mother, Basiledes, detailing when she last saw Joselito. In its Decision [32] dated November 26, 2018, the CA found that Joselito was a victim of extralegal killing, viz .: WHEREFORE , premises considered, the Court hereby renders a Decision: 1.) RECOGNIZING the death of Joselito P. Gonzales as an extralegal killing. 2.) With regard to authorship: DECLARING respondents Aristone L. Dogwe, Mark Riel Canilon, and John Does consisting of members of the Antipolo CPS AIDSOTF and Provincial Special Operating Unit Team who were part of the buy-bust team RESPONSIBLE for the extralegal killing of Joselito P. Gonzales. DECLARING respondents Valfrie G. Tabian, Adriano T. Enong, Simnar Semacio Gran and their successors in office ACCOUNTABLE for the extralegal killing of Joselito P. Gonzales. DECLARING respondents Allen Glenn Cadag and Mark Riel Canilon RESPONSIBLE for the threats of violation of petitioner's rights to life, liberty, and security. 3.) RECOMMENDING the filing of appropriate civil, criminal, and administrative cases against respondents Aristone L. Dogwe, Mark Riel Canilon, and John Does consisting of members of the Antipolo CPS AIDSOTF and Provincial Special Operating Unit Team who were part of the buy-bust team. 4.) ISSUING a PERMANENT PROTECTION ORDER prohibiting respondents Aristone L. Dogwe, Allen Glenn Cadag, Mark Riel Canilon, and John Does consisting of members of the Antipolo CPS AIDSOTF and Provincial Special Operating Unit Team who were part of the buy-bust team, and any of their agents from entering within a radius of one (1) kilometer from the residences and work addresses of petitioner Christina Macandog Gonzales. SO ORDERED. [33] The CA found inconsistencies in the evidence presented surrounding the buy-bust operation that reportedly ensued. Specifically, the testimony of P/Insp. Dogwe of the fact that PS/Insp. Garcia was the team leader, ran contrary to the PRE-OPS/Coordination Report with Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency showing that the designated team leader of the operation was actually one PO3 Andres Ilagan. [34] Further, the Investigation Report dated July 15, 2016 and the Spot Report dated July 5, 2016 contained no information as to who acted as poseur-buyers or backup personnel. [35] In addition, there was no information as to how, or at which point Joselito doubted or sensed the entrapment operation. [36] The police officers notably raised self-defense as a justification for the death of Joselito, but there was no information produced to show as to who among the police operatives were fired upon by Joselito, or who allegedly returned fire. Further, more details as to the location of where the encounter occurred were sparse, and the name of the road was not even indicated. [37] The CA also noted the failure of the police officers to observe the procedure before, during, and after the buy-bust operations indicated in the PNP Criminal Investigation Manual (Revised 2011) in the submission of various reports. [38] Thus, the CA was doubtful that the subject incident was a legitimate police operation, resulting in its findings that P/Insp. Dogwe, PO2 Canilon, and John Doe members of the Antipolo CPD AIDSOTF and Provincial Special Operating Unit Team part of the buy-bust operation are liable for the extralegal killing of Joselito. [39] Anent the questionable circumstances of Joselito's death, the CA upheld the narration of Christina in her testimony that police officers SPO1 Cadag and PO2 Canilon made threats in violation of her rights to life, liberty, and security as compared to the police officers' bare denials. Thus, the CA deemed the issuance of a Permanent Protection Order proper and held them liable for the same. [40] PC/Supt. Tabian, PS/Supt. Enong, and PS/Supt. Gran and their successors in office were likewise held accountable for the death of Joselito. The CA found that as superior officers, they failed to exercise that extreme care and caution in ensuring that the police operation was made in compliance with the applicable procedure, specifically in failing to provide the reports in the PNP Investigation Manual. [41] No liability was attributed to former PNP Director General Ronaldo Dela Rosa ( General Dela Rosa ) for they found that despite the conclusion of the Internal Affairs Office, he actually directed the reopening of the investigation of the incident. He also made a request for an update regarding the investigation in a Memorandum dated February 15, 2018. Admittedly the CA found no further information as to the results of this reinvestigation. [42] In the same vein, the CA did not hold DILG Secretary Ismael Sueno liable since under Section 13 of Republic Act ( R.A .) No. 6975, it is the National Police Commission that exercises administrative control and operational supervision over the PNP and not the DILG. [43] Additionally, the CA no longer found necessary the witness protection order originally prayed for in Christina's petition, as it was stated in Christina's Rejoinder to petitioners' Reply to the Comment on Motion to Resolve the case Based on Affidavits) that she believed she was safe by virtue of the issuance of the Writ of Amparo and the Protection Order. The CA noted that the killing of Joselito was not witnessed by Christina herself. Aggrieved, the police officers through the Office of the Solicitor General, filed a motion for reconsideration. [44] This was met with a Comment [45] filed by Christina. In a Resolution [46] dated April 29, 2019, the CA denied the motion, thus: WHEREFORE , premises considered, the ""Comment/Oppostion (to the Motion for Reconsideration dated 11 December 2018)"" filed by petitioner is NOTED . The Motion for Reconsideration filed by respondents is hereby DENIED for lack of merit. Our Decision dated November 26, 2018 STANDS . SO ORDERED. [47] The CA found that the matters raised in the Motion for Reconsideration were mere reiterations of those judiciously passed upon and duly considered in its Decision dated February 19, 2019. Hence, the petition before this Court. Issue The question for this Court's resolution is whether the CA erred in finding that Joselito was a victim of extralegal killing and in holding the petitioners responsible for his death.","In sum, this Court affirms the finding of the CA that petitioners P/Insp.

"G.R. No. 248521, August 01, 2022","ESTATE OF VALERIANO C. BUENO AND GENOVEVA I. BUENO, REPRESENTED BY VALERIANO I. BUENO, JR. AND SUSAN I. BUENO, PETITIONERS, VS. JUSTICE EDUARDO B. PERALTA, JR., RESPONDENT.","On May 16, 2011, the Estate of Valeriano C. Bueno and Genoveva I. Bueno (Estate of Bueno) filed a complaint for unlawful detainer before the MeTC of Manila seeking to eject Associate Justice Peralta from the subject property located at No. 3450 Magistrado Villamor St., Lourdes Subdivision, Sta. Mesa, Manila, and covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 47603 (RT-192). The Estate of Bueno alleged that during the lifetime of the Spouses Bueno, they allowed Atty. Eduardo M. Peralta, Sr. (Associate Justice Peralta's father) and his family to occupy the property out of kindness, tolerance, and generosity without a contract or rental payment, except that the occupants paid for water, electricity, and real property taxes. After Atty. Peralta, Sr.'s death, his children continued to occupy the property. Before Bueno passed away, he notified the Peralta heirs to vacate, which they refused, filing criminal and civil suits, including a complaint for specific performance to compel Bueno to execute a deed of conveyance over the property. Previous demands (starting May 16, 2001) and an unlawful detainer suit against other Peralta heirs (Edgardo and Edmundo) were dismissed because Associate Justice Peralta was found to be the actual occupant. On February 28, 2011, the Estate of Bueno sent a final demand to Associate Justice Peralta to vacate and pay rentals of P5,000.00 per month beginning July 10, 1990. When this demand was ignored, the instant complaint was instituted. Associate Justice Peralta denied tolerance, asserting that the property was payment or partial consideration for the legal services rendered by his father to the Bueno family and that the Peralta family has exercised exclusive dominion since the early 1960s, constructing substantial improvements and paying utility bills/taxes.","The Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC) dismissed the complaint on January 14, 2014, finding that the action was not properly one for unlawful detainer, as dispossession did not occur within one year of the filing. The Regional Trial Court (RTC) affirmed this dismissal on November 3, 2014, holding that the issue involved possession or ownership which must be resolved in an accion publiciana or accion reivindicatoria. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the RTC Decision on December 18, 2018, sustaining the ruling that the proper remedy was not unlawful detainer, but accion publiciana or accion reivindicatoria, because the allegation of tolerance was not proven and the reglementary period had lapsed.","The Supreme Court denied the petition for lack of merit. Although the complaint sufficiently alleged jurisdictional facts for unlawful detainer based on tolerance, the Estate of Bueno failed to prove the acts of tolerance, especially since the Peralta family's possession and introduction of improvements since 1962 negated the idea of mere tolerance. Furthermore, the Estate of Bueno’s prayer for rental payment from 1990 also contradicted the claim of possession by tolerance. Most significantly, the Court applied the doctrine of res judicata (conclusiveness of judgment), taking judicial notice of its final decision in G.R. No. 205810 (Estate of Bueno v. Estate of Peralta, Sr.), which recognized the Estate of Peralta as the rightful owner of the disputed property, thus stripping petitioner's claim of ownership—the basis for its alleged tolerance—of its legal foundation. Finally, even assuming tolerance, the suit was filed beyond the one-year limitation. A final demand was sent to Associate Justice Peralta as early as August 30, 2002. Since the complaint was filed on February 28, 2011, it was filed beyond the one-year period.","WHEREFORE, premises considered, the present petition is DENIED for lack of merit. The Decision dated December 18, 2018 and Resolution dated July 26, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 141858 are AFFIRMED. The dismissal of the complaint for unlawful detainer against respondent Associate Justice Eduardo B. Peralta, Jr. is SUSTAINED. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 218966, August 01, 2022","SOUTHSTAR CONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. PHILIPPINE ESTATES CORPORATION, RESPONDENT.","Sometime in 2005, Southstar and Philippine Estates Corporation (PHES) entered into three different Construction Agreements, wherein Southstar was engaged to undertake various construction projects in Jaro Estates, Iloilo City. Under the First Construction Agreement dated March 31, 2005, Southstar was tasked to construct three Model Houses located at Coastal Villas for P3,358,000.00. Under the Second Construction Agreement dated March 31, 2005, Southstar was tasked to undertake the Development of the Phase Entry for Coastal Villas for P900,000.00. Under the Third Construction Agreement dated June 29, 2005, Southstar was engaged to undertake the completion/take-over of the four Eunice Units at the Chateaux Geneva for P3,470,931.84. After the execution of the three Construction Agreements, Southstar fulfilled its obligations and turned over the construction projects to PHES sometime in October 2005. On January 13, 2006, PHES issued Certificate of Payment No. 4 (certificate of completion), certifying that the four Eunice Units at Chateaux Geneva have been 100% completed. Partial payments were made, but PHES refused to pay the balance of the contract price totaling P2,452,672.17. Southstar sent several demand letters. PHES, instead of paying, alleged substandard work and delay. Considering PHES' refusal to heed Southstar's demands for payment, Southstar was constrained to file a Complaint on October 2, 2007 before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Imus, Cavite. PHES filed its Answer (With Counterclaims), alleging, among others, that Southstar failed to complete the construction projects, rendered substandard work, and incurred delay. PHES sought liquidated damages in the total amount of P11,188,668.20 for delay in the Iloilo projects and another construction project (Mercedes Unit at Pacific Grand Villas in Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu), plus costs for rectification, moral damages, exemplary damages, and attorney's fees.","The RTC rendered its Decision dated May 2, 2013, ordering PHES to pay Southstar P1,975,836.17, but also awarded liquidated damages in favor of PHES (P980,536.00) due to Southstar's delay regarding the three Model Houses, and dismissed PHES's counterclaim for the Cebu project as permissive. Both parties appealed. On January 22, 2015, the CA rendered its Decision, which ruled in favor of PHES, DENYING Southstar’s appeal and GRANTING PHES’s appeal. The RTC Decision was REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Southstar’s complaint was DISMISSED. The CA GRANTED PHES's counterclaim, ORDERING Southstar to pay PHES the total amount of P11,188,668.20 corresponding to liquidated damages, plus legal interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum.","The Supreme Court found the petition partially meritorious. For the four Eunice Units, the certificate of completion issued by PHES constituted a waiver (Article 1235 of the Civil Code), making PHES liable for the balance of P623,732.95. For the three Model Houses and the Development of the Phase Entry, the CA’s reliance on Articles 4.3, 11.1, and 11.3 to justify non-payment of the entire balance was misplaced; these provisions only entitled PHES to retain the 10% retention money, not the entire balance. The SC affirmed the factual finding of delay on the part of Southstar, noting that demand was not necessary because Article VII of the Construction Agreements expressly stipulated that failure to complete on time results in liability for liquidated damages. The SC recalculated liquidated damages based on delay until October 2005, finding Southstar liable for P295,504.00 (Model Houses) and P149,400.00 (Phase Entry), totaling P444,904.00, but no damages for the Eunice Units due to PHES’s waiver. PHES’s counterclaim regarding the Cebu project was found to be permissive and was properly dismissed by the RTC for lack of payment of docket fees. Other counterclaims by PHES for rectification costs were dismissed for lack of evidence. No attorney's fees were awarded as both parties were found to be at fault.","The Petition for Review on Certiorari dated August 24, 2015 filed by petitioner Southstar Construction and Development Corporation is PARTIALLY GRANTED. The Decision dated January 22, 2015 and the Resolution dated June 16, 2015 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 101973 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The Decision dated May 2, 2013 of the Regional Trial Court of Imus, Cavite, Branch 20 is REINSTATED with the following MODIFICATIONS:

"G.R. No. 245266, August 01, 2022","NATIONAL TRANSMISSION CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. RELIGIOUS OF THE VIRGIN MARY, REPRESENTED BY SIS. MA. TRANQUILINA T. YAMBAO, RESPONDENT.","Religious of the Virgin Mary is the registered owner of a 360,029-square-meter parcel of land located in Barrio Iponan, Cagayan de Oro City, covered by Original Certificate of Title No. 0-452. On October 25, 2006, it filed a Complaint for just compensation and damages before the Regional Trial Court, Cagayan de Oro City. It sought just compensation from TransCo for the construction of transmission lines on a 17,185-square-meter portion of its property without its consent and without instituting expropriation proceedings. In its Answer, TransCo acknowledged that its transmissions lines occupy a portion of the Religious of the Virgin Mary's property. It maintained, however, that the occupied area amounted to less than 17,185 square meters. It added that its transmission lines had long been on the property and that, in the meantime, it had acquired an easement or right of way by prescription. A survey later reported the total affected area to be 8,721 square meters. Commissioners' reports indicated that the transmission line was constructed and commissioned by the National Power Corporation (NAPOCOR) in 1966. The Regional Trial Court (RTC), in a March 31, 2014 Order (modified March 31, 2017), directed TransCo to pay P1,744,200.00 (based on 2006 zonal values) as just compensation, plus interest. Unhappy with the RTC's ruling basing just compensation on 2006 values, TransCo appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA).","In its assailed May 31, 2018 Decision, the Court of Appeals remanded the case to the Regional Trial Court, finding fault in its reliance on 2006 values. Citing Heirs of Pidacan v. Air Transportation Office, it ruled that just compensation should instead be based on 2014 values considering that it was only with the Regional Trial Court's March 31, 2014 Order that TransCo's taking found legal mooring. The dispositive portion of the Court of Appeals' May 31, 2018 Decision reads: WHEREFORE, the Court REMANDS this case to the court of origin to determine the just compensation based on the value of the subject properties as of the year 2014, plus 6% legal rate of interest of the total amount of just compensation. The assailed Order is SET ASIDE.","Petitioner is correct in asserting that just compensation should be reckoned from the date of taking. Contrary to the findings of the Regional Trial Court and the Court of Appeals, there was taking in 1966. The requisites for taking in the context of the State's power of eminent domain have long been spelled out by this Court in Republic v. Vda. de Castellvi. Applying Vda. de Castellvi's requisites, the construction of the transmission line by NAPOCOR in 1966 constituted taking. This Court sees no need to deviate from the rule that just compensation must be reckoned from the date of the taking, in this case, 1966. However, owing to the dearth of evidence concerning 1966 valuations, or alternative bases for just compensation that approximates 1966 valuations, this Court is constrained to remand the case to the Regional Trial Court. To address the delay in payment, the remedy has been the imposition of interest, not the reckoning of just compensation to contemporary valuations.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is PARTLY GRANTED. The assailed May 31, 2018 Decision and February 12, 2019 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 04683-MIN ate REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The case is REMANDED to the Regional Trial Court, Cagayan de Oro City for the proper determination of the amount of just compensation, along with interest, in accordance with this Decision.

EMMA LEE AND THE CIVIL REGISTRAR FOR THE CITY OF CALOOCAN, RESPONDENTS.","On February 3, 1993, Rita et al. filed before the Regional Trial Court of Caloocan a Petition for the Cancellation and Correction of Entries in the Records of Birth under Rule 108 of the Rules of Court (1993 Petition). This Petition prayed for the cancellation and correction of the allegedly false and erroneous entry in Emma's records of birth by deleting Keh Shiok Cheng's (Shiok Cheng) name as her mother and substituting it with Tiu's name, whom Rita et al. claim to be Emma's true mother. Emma's birth certificate listed ""Tek Sheng T. Lee,"" as her father, and ""Shiok Cheng T. Keh,"" as her mother. Rita et al. further contended that, without Shiok Cheng's knowledge, Tek Sheng falsified the entries in the birth records of all his children with Tiu by making it appear that Shiok Cheng was their mother. When Shiok Cheng died on May 9, 1989, Tek Sheng allegedly insisted on including the names of his children with Tiu in newspaper obituaries. This roused the Lee siblings' suspicion, prompting them to seek aid from the National Bureau of Investigation. On July 8, 2003, Rita et al. filed before the Regional Trial Court of Caloocan a Motion for the Use of DNA Analysis to establish Emma's supposed maternal relation with Tiu. Emma filed an Opposition, insisting that the Motion was based on mere suspicion and speculation. In its September 8, 2003 Order, the Regional Trial Court of Caloocan denied Rita et al.'s Motion. It reasoned that the DNA test they sought amounted to a fishing expedition, as there appeared no independent evidence specifically pointing to a filial relationship between Emma and Tiu. On June 10, 2005, Rita et al. filed a Petition for Certiorari before the Court of Appeals assailing the Regional Trial Court of Caloocan's denial of their Motion for DNA testing. In its assailed June 19, 2007 Decision, the Court of Appeals found no grave abuse of discretion on the Regional Trial Court of Caloocan's part in denying Rita et al.'s Motion. With the Court of Appeals' denial of their Motion for Reconsideration, Rita et al. filed the present Rule 45 Petition before this Court.","This Court resolves a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure seeking to reverse and set aside the assailed Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 90078. The assailed Decision sustained an Order of the Regional Trial Court of Caloocan City, Branch 131 which denied a Motion to Conduct a DNA Test to establish the supposed maternal relation between Emma Lee (Emma) and one Tiu Chuan (Tiu). The Court finds a more fundamental error in facilitating the proceedings relating to petitioners' Rule 108 Petition against respondent Emma... it is proper to not only prevent petitioners from proceeding with their prayed for DNA test in the context of a Rule 108 Petition, but to also dismiss their Rule 108 Petition entirely. ... ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DENIED. The assailed June 19, 2007 Decision and December 11, 2007 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP NO. 90078 are AFFIRMED.","""The legitimacy and filiation of children cannot be collaterally attacked in a petition for correction of entries in the certificate of live birth."" A petition for correction whose commanding intent is to impugn a child's filiation with a parent identified in birth records—and not merely to harmonize those records with self-evident facts—will be disallowed for being such a collateral attack. Moreover, a petition for correction cannot proceed to allow the impugning party to gather the evidence denying filiation which that party lacks and hopes to have only by taking advantage of those proceedings. While it is a viable means for ascertaining filiation, DNA testing shall be allowed only when the party seeking it is first able to present prima facie evidence or establish a reasonable possibility of filiation. Following Miller, whose disposition was anchored on the more basic consideration that legitimacy and filiation cannot be collaterally attacked in a Rule 108 Petition, this Court rules that the Rule 108 Petition before the Regional Trial Court of Caloocan must be dismissed. Even granting that their Rule 108 Petition can proceed, the Court of Appeals and the Regional Trial Court of Caloocan correctly found that DNA testing cannot be allowed as petitioners have, as yet, failed to adduce prima facie evidence or establish a reasonable possibility of respondent Emma's filiation with Tiu.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DENIED. The assailed June 19, 2007 Decision and December 11, 2007 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP NO. 90078 are AFFIRMED. The Petition subject of SP. PROC.

"G.R. No. 235725, September 28, 2022","JOEL A. TAPIA, PETITIONER, VS. GA2 PHARMACEUTICAL, INC., RESPONDENT.","In his complaint for illegal dismissal and money claims, Tapia averred that sometime in July 2013, he got employed as a pharmacist at respondent GA2 Pharmaceutical, Inc. (GA2). On June 11, 2015, he asked to be excused from his delivery task for the day because he was not feeling well and the company car was covered by the number coding scheme. But Lancy Vijay Saldanha (Saldanha), General Manager of GA2, scolded him and ordered their Personnel Officer Evelyn Zuniega (Zuniega) to draft his resignation letter. When he refused to sign it, Saldanha allegedly ordered him to go home and never come back. Consequently, on June 15, 2015, Tapia filed a complaint for illegal dismissal. GA2 claimed that Tapia was only hired on March 25, 2015 as pharmacist/driver on probationary status. On June 9, 2015, Tapia refused to deliver pharmaceutical items, left the office after an altercation with Saldanha, and failed to report for work thereafter, leading GA2 to send a notice to explain (NTE) his absences without leave, claiming abandonment. The Labor Arbiter dismissed the complaint. The NLRC reversed the LA and declared Tapia illegally dismissed, ordering GA2 to pay separation pay and backwages. The Court of Appeals, however, partially granted GA2’s petition and ordered Tapia’s reinstatement, sans backwages, finding that Tapia failed to prove that he was dismissed from work, while also rejecting GA2's charge of abandonment. Tapia filed the present petition seeking to set aside the CA dispositions insofar as it ordered his reinstatement without backwages.",GRANTED,"The Court reversed the Court of Appeals. Tapia was able to sufficiently establish the circumstances attendant to his dismissal, recalling in detail that on June 11, 2015, Saldanha shouted and abased him, ordering him to go home and never come back. The verbal command not to report for work uttered by Saldanha, being Tapia’s immediate superior and GA2’s general manager, was authoritative and constituted an overt act of dismissal. Tapia’s immediate action (filing an illegal dismissal complaint) negated the claim of abandonment by GA2. Further, Tapia’s documentary evidence, i.e., July and August 2013 payroll slips and the FDA license, proved his employment began in July 2013, rejecting GA2's belated claim of probationary status starting March 2015. All told, the NLRC correctly ruled that Tapia was illegally dismissed and that he is entitled to backwages, separation pay (in lieu of reinstatement), and attorney's fees.","The Court of Appeals' Decision dated July 12, 2017 and Resolution dated October 27, 2017 in CA-G.R. SP No. 148274 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE, and the Decision dated June 30, 2016 of the National Labor Relations Commission in NLRC LAC No. 04-001073-16 is REINSTATED.

(14) 3991 to (14) 3995. The five complaints for Forcible Entry contained essentially the same material allegations, to wit: (1) each of the respondents owns and possesses a parcel of land located in Barangay (Brgy.) Palestina, San Jose City, viz.: the lot of the Heirs of Flora is covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 14996, Guzman's lot by TCT No. (NT-32358) 4526, Collado's lot by TCT No. 12595, Roldan's lot by TCT No. (NT-32358) 4526, and Cariño's lot by TCT No. 12615; (2) each of respondents' lots formed accretion by the passage of time as shown in the Sketch Plan (Exhibit ""G""); (3) in November 2013, petitioners, by means of force, strategy or stealth, entered the lots, including the accretion, by building a fence on portions thereof, and planted them with onions; (4) hence, respondents went to the Office of the Punong Barangay of Brgy. Palestina, San Jose City, where they filed a complaint with the Tanggapan ng Lupong Tagapamayapa (Lupon); and (5) since the parties failed to reach an amicable settlement, said Lupon issued to respondents Certifications to File Action. In their respective complaints, respondents prayed that petitioners and all persons claiming rights under them be ordered to vacate and surrender the subject lots. Petitioners filed their respective Answers with Counterclaim all dated July 21, 2014 to the five complaints, commonly alleging thus: (1) the property being claimed as an accretion by respondents were already there when the late Liberato Locquiao (Locquiao) acquired a parcel of land...; (8) said lot at the end of Locquiao's and Torres' properties, which has been in possession of Ganado, is the same lot claimed by respondents as accretion (contested property); (9) the contested property was not formed by accretion and does not belong to respondents, since it is owned by Ganado; (10) respondents have never been in possession of the contested property since Ganado has been in possession thereof since 1967; and (11) petitioners prayed for the dismissal of the complaints...","The Decision dated November 29, 2016 and the Resolution dated March 31, 2017 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

Magtuto, as the submission of these affidavits was highly irregular and inconsistent with the Rules on Summary Procedure, and amounted to prohibited piecemeal presentation of evidence. Forcible entry cases are concerned solely with prior physical possession. Upon close analysis, this Court is inclined to believe the findings of the MTCC and the RTC that respondents failed to prove that they had prior physical possession of the contested property, and that petitioners' evidence of their prior physical possession preponderates. Respondents' Judicial Affidavits contained only general statements and conclusions regarding possession of the contested property, failing to narrate how they took actual physical possession. In contrast, petitioners successfully proved by preponderance of evidence that they had prior physical possession of the contested property since the 1970s through Ganado.","WHEREFORE, the Petition is GRANTED."
"G.R. No. 225895, September 28, 2022","CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION, PETITIONER, VS. ROSELLE C. ANNANG, RESPONDENT.","Sometime in 2005, the Cagayan State University (CSU) engaged the services of Dr. Roselle C. Annang (Dr. Annang) as a part-time faculty member through a six-month service contract. The parties stipulated that there would be no employer-employee relationship between them; that Dr. Annang's service will not be credited as government service; that she will not be entitled to the benefits enjoyed by the regular personnel of CSU; and that the contract is not subject to civil service laws, rules, and regulations. The contract was renewed five times, lasting for a total of two years and six months. Thereafter, Dr. Annang was appointed as Assistant Professor III, a permanent position she held until her retirement in 2012. Sometime in 2013, when she was already retired, Dr. Annang filed a request for the accreditation of her two years and six months of service as part­-time faculty member of CSU, in order to reach the 15 years of government service required to avail the benefits under Section 13 of Republic Act No. (RA) 8291, otherwise known as the Revised Government Insurance Act of 1997. Without the said accreditation, Dr. Annang would only have 14 years and four months of government service. The CSC Regional Office No. II in Tuguegarao City referred the request to the CSC Central Office, which it rejected. The CSC Central Office cited a memorandum circular providing that services rendered under contracts of service are not considered government service. Aggrieved, Dr. Annang moved for a reconsideration, which was treated by the CSC as a Petition for Review.","The Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 135765 reversed and set aside petitioner Civil Service Commission (CSC)'s Decision No. 140384 dated May 20, 2014, and denied its Motion for Reconsideration. The CA held that there was an employer-employee relationship under the four-fold test and ordered that the services rendered by Dr. Annang for the period of 14 June 2005 to 16 December 2005 under contracts of service be credited as government service.","The Petition is meritorious. Dr. Annang, having already retired on October 20, 2012, may no longer request for accreditation of service as she filed the request on March 11, 2013, running counter to Section 100, Rule 21 of CSC Resolution No. 1101502 (RRACCS), which explicitly excludes those who have already retired. Moreover, the CA erred in primarily applying the four-fold test, as the relationship between the government and its employees is primarily determined by special and civil service laws, rules, and regulations, not the Labor Code standards (as established in National Transmission Corp. v. Commission on Audit, abandoning Lopez). Civil service rules (CSC MC No. 40-98, CSC Resolution No. 020790, and CSC Resolution No. 021480) expressly provide that services rendered pursuant to contracts of service are not considered government service. The contract itself stipulated that the service would not be accredited, and the hiring was done in the exigency of service, which CSC rules allowed. Therefore, the accreditation request was filed out of time and ran counter to pertinent CSC rules.","WHEREFORE, the Petition is GRANTED. The October 6, 2015 Decision and July 19, 2016 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 135765 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE, and the Civil Service Commission's Decision No. 140384 dated May 20, 2014 is REINSTATED. No costs. SO ORDERED."

Maestrado, along with Jenylin Vitor Alvarez, Stephanie Jean Locker, and Rubelyn Stone, were charged with Attempted Trafficking in Persons for conspiring to simulate the birth, solicit, and acquire custody of a child identified as AAA, a 7-month old victim, for the purpose of selling her. Locker, Stone, and Alvarez went to the Local Civil Registrar (LCR) on September 24, 2014, to register AAA's birth, falsely naming Locker (a Caucasian American) as the mother and Alvarez as the attendant midwife, despite AAA appearing to be of Filipino descent. The birth certificate was issued. In March 2015, police, investigating the spurious certificate (based on information from US NCIS), discovered Locker did not give birth to AAA at the indicated clinic, and that AAA’s biological mother was BBB. Alvarez admitted assisting in the registration. The police located AAA in petitioner Maestrado's custody. Petitioner admitted taking care of AAA for about 5 1/2 months after Locker left the child with her under the guise that documents were being processed. Petitioner admitted knowing AAA was not Locker's child (due to appearance) but failed to report the suspicious custody to government authorities.","The Regional Trial Court (RTC) rendered a Judgment dated 06 October 2017 finding petitioner Lenida T. Maestrado and Jenylin Vitor Alvarez guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Attempted Trafficking in Persons, sentencing them to suffer the penalty of fifteen (15) years imprisonment and to pay a fine of P500,000.00 each. The Court of Appeals (CA), in its Decision dated 30 July 2020, denied the appeals and affirmed the RTC Judgment, holding that all elements for Attempted Trafficking in Persons under RA 9208, as amended by RA 10364, were present, and that petitioner’s denial of her involvement was unpersuasive.","The Court upheld the CA's affirmation of the conviction, noting that the petition raised questions of fact, which the Supreme Court generally does not review, especially where the factual findings of the RTC and CA concur and are supported by evidence. The Court found that all elements of Attempted Child Trafficking in Persons under Section 4-A, paragraphs (d) (simulation of birth for the purpose of selling the child) and (e) (acquiring custody for the purpose of selling the child) of RA 9208, as amended, were established. Petitioner was found guilty of conspiracy, as she maintained custody of AAA—a child she knew was not related to the foreign national, Locker—for 5 1/2 months under highly suspicious circumstances, thereby facilitating the overall plan to illegally bring the child, who was reportedly purchased from her biological mother (BBB), to the United States.","WHEREFORE, the present petition for review on certiorari is DENIED. The Decision dated 30 July 2020 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 01674-MIN is AFFIRMED.

ACCUSED, GIDEON SEÑAROSA, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","In two separate Amended Informations, Señarosa and his co-accused were charged with Murder (Criminal Case No. 4496) for the death of Phil Feliciano and Frustrated Murder (Criminal Case No. 4497) for the injuries suffered by Gualberto Codesta, stemming from an ambush on 03 May 1995 in Barangay Fulgencio, Kalibo, Aklan. Codesta testified that Phil was fatally hit by gunshots, and he (Codesta) was injured while attempting to restart the vehicle. Ex recounted seeing Esperidion and Nadura approach the vehicle after the firing stopped. Melbeth, Phil’s wife, saw two men wearing camouflage uniform approach their vehicle. The following morning, SPO1 Custodio and other police officers set up a checkpoint where they stopped a jeep coming from Barangay Camaligan. Señarosa, a passenger, was observed to be pale and wearing wet pants. SPO1 Custodio asked Señarosa to open his bags, finding a wet military uniform, fatigue and camouflage attires, and one rifle grenade, along with documents belonging to co-accused Esperidion and Relimbo. SPO3 Subong subsequently took Señarosa's extrajudicial confession detailing his participation. Señarosa denied involvement, claiming he was merely traveling and his pants got wet from the rain. The RTC found Señarosa and his co-accused guilty of Murder and Frustrated Murder. The CA affirmed the conviction for Murder but downgraded the conviction for Frustrated Murder to Attempted Murder.","The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed, with modifications, the Judgment dated 26 April 2004 rendered by Branch 9, Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Kalibo, Aklan, in Criminal Case Nos. 4496 and 4497 finding Mario Esperidion (Esperidion), accused­-appellant Gideon Señarosa (Señarosa), and their co-accused Albecio Nadura, Jr. (Nadura) and Percival Relimbo (Relimbo) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Murder for the death of Phil Feliciano (Phil), and Frustrated Murder for the injuries suffered by Gualberto Codesta (Codesta). The CA upheld the conviction for Murder of the remaining accused, Señarosa and Esperidion, but downgraded their conviction for Frustrated Murder to Attempted Murder.","The Court found that Señarosa's right against unreasonable searches and seizure was violated because the police authorities lacked probable cause to conduct an extensive search of his belongings at the checkpoint. The facts that Señarosa was pale and wearing wet pants were not 'overtly physical act[s] that would create strong suspicion,' but rather stemmed from a 'preconceived suspicion' by the police. Consequently, the evidence obtained (rifle grenade, uniforms, and documents) is inadmissible under the exclusionary rule. Furthermore, Señarosa's extrajudicial confession was inadmissible because his constitutional rights during custodial investigation were violated. Considering Señarosa finished only the first grade, the investigation failed to demonstrate an effective and meaningful communication of his rights, rendering the confession involuntary and inadmissible. Because the prosecution’s case rested entirely on these two sets of tainted evidence, and no witness positively identified Señarosa at the scene of the crime, his guilt was not proven beyond reasonable doubt.","The appeal is GRANTED. The Decision dated 09 November 2017 of the Court of Appeals in CA G.R. CEB-CR-HC No. 01271, is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE as to accused-appellant Gideon Señarosa. Accordingly, accused-appellant is ACQUITTED of the crime of Murder and Attempted Murder on the ground of reasonable doubt and is ORDERED IMMEDIATELY RELEASED from detention unless he is being lawfully held for another cause."
"G.R. No. 205597, September 28, 2022","GEORGE S. GALBINEZ, JR., PETITIONER, VS. MC GERRY'S RESTAURANT, HOKIAN AND KIM CO** AND GERRY VELASQUEZ, RESPONDENTS.","George S. Galbinez, Jr. (petitioner) alleged that on January 6, 2006, he was hired by spouses Hokian and Kim Co (respondent spouses) as delivery boy, dishwasher and janitor at Mc Gerry's Restaurant (Mc Gerry's). He was paid at a daily rate of P100.00 for work from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., Mondays to Sundays. He was not paid overtime pay, premium pay for rest days and holidays, and holiday pay. While he was given free food, petitioner claims that they were leftovers of the customers.[4]
Petitioner alleged that Mc Gerry's is an entity engaged in restaurant business and employs around 20 personnel. He claims that the owners of the restaurant, albeit registered under the name of respondent Gerry Velasquez (Velasquez), are respondent spouses who are both Chinese nationals.[5]
Sometime in September 2006, petitioner averred that due to his persistent airing of grievances, his salary was suddenly coursed through Metro's Manpower Agency (MMA). His work time was adjusted to 7:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Mondays to Fridays, still without overtime pay, premium pay for rest days and holidays, and holiday pay. Although he was not given leftover foods anymore, he was being fed instead mostly of galunggong[6] On December 30, 2007, petitioner was barred from entering the premises of the restaurant and was told that respondent spouses no longer wanted his services.[7]
On June 4, 2008, petitioner filed an Amended Complaint[8] before the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) for actual illegal dismissal, underpayment to non-payment of wages and other monetary benefits against Mc Gerry's, respondent spouses, Gerry Velasquez (Velasquez) and Bobby Velasco (Velasco).
For their part, Mc Gerry's alleged that the restaurant is a single proprietorship business registered under the name of respondent Velasquez. Velasquez denied that petitioner is their employee.[9] He averred that their restaurant caters to delivery orders requiring the services of a rider to do the task.[10] Sometime in October 2007, Velasquez engaged the services of a manpower agency, MMA, for that purpose. The agency assigned petitioner to them. However, by the end of 2007, petitioner stopped reporting for work. Velasquez was surprised to receive summons from the NLRC informing him that a complaint for illegal dismissal and other money claims was filed by petitioner against Mc Gerry's together with MMA.[11]
Records show that respondent spouses, despite having been duly served with summons, did not file any position paper. No service of summons was done on MMA and Bobby Velasco (Velasco).[12]
After evaluating the issues raised in the parties' respective pleadings, the Labor Arbiter (LA) in its Decision[13] dated June 2, 2009 found no employer-employee relationship between Mc Gerry's and petitioner. Petitioner admitted that his salaries were being paid by MMA and that it was MMA who did not assign him any work. By petitioner's admission that MMA was the entity that exercises control over his work assignments, the LA deduced that MMA was petitioner's employer. [14] The LA ordered MMA and Bobby Velasco to reinstate petitioner and dismissed the complaint against Mc Gerry's and respondent spouses.
Feeling aggrieved, petitioner filed a Memorandum of Appeal[16] before the NLRC insisting that he was illegally dismissed, Mc Gerry's and respondent spouses, (collectively, respondents) should be held solidarily liable with their labor-only contractor, MMA.[17] On February 25, 2010, the NLRC, Sixth Division, issued a Decision[18] which reversed and set aside the findings of the LA. The Commission found that petitioner is a regular employee of respondents, and not of MMA, and ordered respondents spouses Hokian and Kim Co, Mc Gerry's Restaurant and Gerry Velasquez, jointly and severally, to pay various monetary awards including separation pay and backwages. Respondents moved for reconsideration[20] but was denied by the NLRC via Resolution[21] dated April 28, 2010. Undeterred, respondents filed a Petition for Certiorari[22] before the CA.","In a Decision[23] dated June 28, 2012, the CA partly granted the Petition for Certiorari. The CA sustained the finding of employer-employee relationship between petitioner and the respondents but ruled against the finding of illegal dismissal. The CA decreed:
FOR THESE REASONS, the petition is PARTIALLY GRANTED, thus: The February 25, 2010 Decision of the National Labor Relations Commission declaring [petitioner] George S. Galbinez, Jr. illegally dismissed is NULLIFIED and the awards of separation pay, backwages, overtime pay, unpaid rest day and holiday premium are DELETED; and The finding of employer-employee relationship between private [petitioner] George S. Galbinez, Jr. and [respondents] spouses Hokian and Kim Co, Mc. Gerry's Restaurant and Gerry Velasquez is AFFIRMED, including the awards of underpaid wages, ECOLA, 13th month pay and attorney's fees. The case is REMANDED to the NLRC for a detailed computation of the monetary benefits due [petitioner] George S. Galbinez, Jr. which [respondents] spouses Hokian and Kim Co, Mc. Gerry's Restaurant and Gerry Velasquez should pay jointly and severally without delay. SO ORDERED.","The Court found that petitioner failed to present substantial evidence to substantiate his allegation of illegal dismissal. Bare allegations deserve no legal credit for being self-serving. The Court also found that respondents failed to prove the existence of abandonment, as petitioner's filing of a complaint for illegal dismissal negates any intention on his part to sever his employment relations. Consequently, since neither illegal dismissal nor abandonment was proven, reinstatement of the employee to his former position without backwages is the typical remedy. However, given that a considerable period of time had passed rendering reinstatement impracticable, an award of separation pay equivalent to one-month salary for every year of service computed up to the time he stopped working for respondents in lieu of reinstatement without backwages, is more in accord with equity. The Court further ruled that only Gerry Velasquez, as the registered sole proprietor of Mc Gerry's, is personally liable for all the debts and obligations of the business. Absent any credible proof that respondent spouses acted in bad faith in the alleged illegal dismissal, they cannot be held solidarily liable with Velasquez. The awarded attorney's fees are clarified to be equivalent only to ten percent (10%) of the total award.","WHEREFORE, the petition is PARTLY GRANTED. The June 28, 2012 Decision and the January 21, 2013 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 114946 are AFFIRMED with the following MODIFICATIONS.
In lieu of an order of reinstatement without backwages, respondents are ORDERED to pay petitioner George S. Galbinez, Jr. separation pay computed at one (1) month salary for every year of service until petitioner stopped working for respondents in 2007.
Respondent Gerry Velasquez is ORDERED to pay petitioner attorney's fees equivalent to ten percent (10%) of the total monetary award;
All amounts due shall earn interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from date of finality of this Decision until fully paid. The case is hereby REMANDED to the Labor Arbiter for an immediate re-computation of the monetary benefits due the petitioner George S. Galbinez, Jr. which respondent Gerry Velasquez, should pay without delay.
SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 227728, September 28, 2022","CESAR D. TARUC, PETITIONER, VS. ANGELINA D. MAXIMO, MARICEL BUENAVENTURA, GEORGE JORDAN, AND JENNIFER BURGOS, RESPONDENTS.","Taruc was the respondent in a labor case docketed as National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) Case Nos. RAB-IV-07-00806-09-C and RAB-IV-07-00807-09-C filed by complainants therein and herein respondents, Angelina D. Maximo, Maricel Buenaventura, George Jordan, and Jennifer Burgos (respondents).
On October 21, 2013, Labor Arbiter (LA) Enrico Angelo C. Portillo of the NLRC Regional Arbitration Branch (RAB) No. IV issued an Alias Writ of Execution for recovery, by way of distraint, of the total sum of P1,737,400.00 representing the monetary award adjudged in favor of respondents including execution fees.
[5]
Pursuant to the writ, Sheriff Apolinario D. Del Rosario of RAB IV of Calamba City sent Taruc a demand letter dated June 30, 2014, notifying the latter that a levy was effected against the 240 sq. meters parcel of land covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-221363 (subject land) registered under Taruc's name, and demanding payment of the monetary award, otherwise, the subject land will be sold at a public auction.
[6]
Taruc filed a Motion To Lift Levy
[7]
arguing that the subject land was part of his family home where he and his family resided, and thus, exempt from execution. Taruc presented a Building Permit
[8]
dated May 27, 1998 as proof that he constructed his family home in the subject land in May 1998.","In its Decision dated March 30, 2016, the CA denied Taruc's petition for lack of merit. The CA held that since Taruc alleged that he had been occupying the subject land as part of his family home since May 1988, the provisions of the Civil Code shall apply. Thus, the petition was denied on the basis of Taruc's failure to prove that the subject land complied with the requirements of constitution of a family home provided under the Civil Code.","The Court's Ruling The petition is denied for lack of merit. . . Records show that Taruc contended that as evidenced by the Building Permit, he constructed his alleged family home on the subject land in May 1998[29] or after the effectivity of the Family Code on August 3, 1988. It bears underscoring that for family homes constructed after the effectivity of the Family Code on August 3, 1988, there is no need to constitute them extrajudicially or judicially[30] in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Code.[31] In this regard, the Court holds that the applicable provisions are those provided under the Family Code and not the provisions of the Civil Code, as held by the CA.[32] . . . Thus, the Court rules that the subject land is not a family home and thus, is not exempt from levy and execution, as will be explained below. . . We see nothing in the Building Permit and utility bills which prove that the subject land complied with the requirements for exemption from levy and execution provided under the Family Code. . . Indubitably, Taruc failed to adduce evidence that the subject land complied with the requisites that would exempt it from levy and execution under the Family Code. . . The Court, therefore, rules that the subject land is not exempt from levy and execution.","ACCORDINGLY, the petition is DENIED. The Decision dated March 30, 2016 of the Court of Appeals in CA-GR. SP. No. 139312, which affirmed the National Labor Relations Commission Resolution dated November 13, 2014 and the Resolution dated October 5, 2016 denying the motion for reconsideration are hereby AFFIRMED."
"G.R. Nos. 219986-87, September 28, 2022","LAWRENCE LLUCH-CRUZ, PETITIONER, VS. ROBERT L. ONG, RESPONDENT.","Roberto L. Ong (Ong) is a licensed mechanical engineer employed as Engineer III in the City Engineer's Office of Iligan City. In September 2009, Ong filed an administrative case against several persons, including Mayor Lluch-Cruz. On August 31, 2017, during the administrative case's pendency, Mayor Lluch-Cruz issued a Memorandum reassigning Ong from the City Engineer's Office to the City Veterinarian Office. This prompted Ong to appeal the reassignment order before the Civil Service Commission, alleging that the reassignment constituted constructive dismissal since: (1) he had not been given definite duties and responsibilities; (2) the office he was reassigned to was not in the existing organizational structure; and (3) the office he was reassigned to was too far from the place he was assigned. Mayor Lluch-Cruz explained that Ong had been reassigned to several other offices before and that his reassignment to the City Veterinarian's Office was connected to the rehabilitation of the slaughterhouse. In its September 13, 2011 Decision, the Civil Service Commission found that while the reassignment order had been recalled during the pendency of the appeal, the order nonetheless transgressed the reassignment guidelines. The Commission found that Ong's reassignment placed him on floating status and that his alleged duties of rehabilitating the slaughterhouse appeared to be an afterthought since the slaughterhouse and the City Veterinarian's Office were separate and distinct units. Ong had likewise filed a Complaint against Mayor Lluch-Cruz and Acting City Human Resource Management Officer Ophelia A. Cayaco before the Office of the Ombudsman for oppression and violation of Republic Act No. 6713.","In its November 29, 2012 Decision, the Office of the Ombudsman found Mayor Lluch-Cruz guilty of oppression and suspended him from service for four months. The charge for violation of Republic Act No. 6713 was dismissed. Aggrieved, Mayor Lluch-Cruz filed both a Petition for Review and a Petition for Certiorari before the Court of Appeals, questioning the Decision of the Office of the Ombudsman. On October 17, 2014, the Court of Appeals rendered a Consolidated Decision denying the Petitions but modifying the penalty to a fine equivalent to four months salary in lieu of suspension. The Court of Appeals affirmed the Civil Service Commission's finding that Mayor Lluch-Cruz reassigned Ong during the pendency of the administrative cases the latter filed against the former and placed Ong on floating status.","This Court is tasked to resolve the issues of whether or not the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the Decision of the Office of the Ombudsman finding petitioner guilty of oppression. The Court held that for the Office of the Ombudsman to determine the existence of oppression, there must first be a definitive ruling from the Civil Service Commission that the reassignment was invalid, as discussed in Reyes v. Belisario. In this case, there was a definitive ruling by the Civil Service Commission that respondent's reassignment was invalid. The Commission found that respondent was reassigned during the pendency of an administrative case he filed against petitioner and that his reassignment resulted in his floating status. The Office of the Ombudsman, using as its basis the Civil Service Commission's finding that respondent's reassignment was invalid, found petitioner guilty of oppression. The Court found no merit in petitioner's argument that the Office of the Ombudsman failed to conduct an independent investigation. The Court affirmed that respondent's task of overseeing the slaughterhouse was a mere afterthought, designed to provide a somewhat palatable excuse as to why respondent was placed on an indefinite floating status. Clearly, petitioner exercised an excessive use of authority to be able to oppress respondent in retaliation to the complaints respondent filed against him.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DENIED. The October 17, 2014 Consolidated Decision and June 17, 2015 Consolidated Resolution in CA-G.R. SP No. 05500-MIN and CA-G.R. SP No. 05524-MIN are AFFIRMED. Petitioner Lawrence Lluch-Cruz is found GUILTY of oppression in violation of Section 52 of the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service in the course of official duties and is hereby FINED, in lieu of suspension, in the amount equivalent to four (4) months of his salary as Mayor of Iligan City. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 250787, September 27, 2022","PHILIPPINE HEALTH INSURANCE CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON AUDIT, HON. MICHAEL G. AGUINALDO, CHAIRPERSON, RESPONDENT.","The present controversy stems from the COA Auditor's issuance of two NDs [5] disallowing benefits and allowances paid by Philhealth to HO/RO officials in the aggregate amount of P83,062,385.27 computed [6] as follows: Benefit/Allowance Amount EAA — HO P51,529,824.29 EAA — NCR and Rizal RO 27,837,560.98 Birthday Gift 3,695,000.00 Total P83,062,385.27 [7] The COA Auditor found that Philhealth granted the EAA and Birthday Gift to its officials without the President's approval, contrary to the requirement set forth under the following legal provisions: [8] 1) Presidential Decree No. (PD) 1597 [...] 2) Republic Act No. (RA) 6758, [10] otherwise known as the Salary Standardization Law (SSL) [...] 3) Memorandum Order No. (MO) 20 [11] dated June 25, 2001 [...] 4) Administrative Order No. (AO) 103 [12] dated August 31, 2004 [...] 5) Executive Order No. (EO) 7 [13] dated September 8, 2010 [...] 6) RA 10149, [14] otherwise known as the GOCC Governance Act of 2011. When the COA Director denied its subsequent appeal from the disallowances, Philhealth [15] elevated the case to the COA Proper. [16]","In its assailed Decision, [17] the COA Proper affirmed the disallowances. It explained as follows: First, based on Eng. Mendoza v. Commission on Audit, [18] it is true that selected entities have been exempted from the application of the SSL by virtue of their charters. These exempted entities were allowed to create their own compensation and position classification systems that apply to their respective offices. However, the charter [19] of Philhealth (Philhealth Charter) does not contain the same express exemption. [20] Second, Philhealth's power to fix the compensation of its personnel, as provided under Section 16(n) [21] of the Philhealth Charter, does not expressly grant fiscal autonomy upon the entity. Further, based on Intia, Jr. v. Commission on Audit, [22] the Board of Directors' authority to determine and fix Philhealth personnel's compensation and classification is not absolute. Section 26(a) [23] of the Philhealth Charter mandates that all funds under Philhealth's management and control shall be subject to all rules and regulations applicable to public funds. [24] Third, even if Philhealth were expressly allowed by its charter to have its own position and compensation plans, it would still be required to report the same to the President of the Philippines through the Department of Budget and Management (DBM). [25] Fourth, contrary to Philhealth's assertion, the subject benefits and allowances are not Collective Negotiation Agreement (CNA) incentives. [26] Fifth, the granting of benefits and allowances by virtue of the resolutions passed by Philhealth in the exercise of its fiscal autonomy, no matter how long practiced, if done in violation of existing rules and regulations, is still considered unauthorized and should be disallowed. [27] Sixth, the claim that former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (President Arroyo) twice confirmed the power of the Board of Directors to fix Philhealth's compensation framework, as provided under Section 16(n) of its Charter, is untenable. [28] Finally, the COA Proper found that all approving/certifying officers and recipients of the subject benefits and allowances are liable for the disallowed amounts.","The petition lacks merit. [...] Philhealth's failure to point out the specific acts of the COA Proper that may constitute grave abuse of discretion in upholding the subject disallowances [49] is sufficient ground to dismiss the present petition. [50] Be that as it may, even if the Court brushes aside the deficiency in Philhealth's allegations, there is no reason to depart from the COA's rulings. I [...] it is already settled that Philhealth does not have absolute discretion in determining the compensation of its officials. [...] The Court reiterated its rejection of Philhealth's fiscal autonomy as justification for the payment of allowances and benefits in the following disallowance cases also involving Philhealth: (a) Philippine Health Insurance Corp. v. Commission on Audit, G.R. No. 235832, November 3, 2020; (b) Philippine Health Insurance Corp. v. Commission on Audit, G.R. No. 222129, February 2, 2021; (c) Philippine Health Insurance Corp. Regional Office-CARAGA v. Commission on Audit (Resolution), G.R. No. 230218, July 6, 2021; and (d) Philippine Health Insurance Corp. v. Commission on Audit, G.R. No. 250089, November 9, 2021. [...] To be sure, the resolutions of the Board of Directors granting the EAA and Birthday Gift sans executive/DBM review and approval as required under PD No. 985, as amended, PD No. 1597, the SSL, and RA No. 10149 are ultra vires acts, [56] which rendered the subsequent disbursements illegal and irregular. [57] II The general principle of the SSL is that the basic salary of civil service personnel is deemed to already include all allowances and other forms of additional compensation. [...] the EAA and Birthday Gift are not among the exceptions to the standardization of salaries. These are deemed already incorporated in the basic salary of Philhealth personnel. Consequently, 'the unauthorized issuance and receipt of [these benefits are] tantamount to double compensation justifying COA disallowance.' [61] III The Court also rejects Philhealth's theory that the subject benefits are valid CNA Incentives. [...] V The payees of the EAA and Birthday Gift and the officers who approved and/or certified the grant/payment thereof are liable for the disallowance. Their respective liabilities are discussed below. Approving/Certifying Officers [...] the approving/certifying officers shall be solidarily liable for the net disallowed amount. Payees [...] they must refund the corresponding amounts received in error.","WHEREFORE, the petition is DISMISSED. The COA Proper Decision dated January 29, 2018 and Resolution dated August 15, 2019 in COA CP Case No. 2015-683 are AFFIRMED."
"G.R. No. 258100, September 27, 2022","PHILIPPINE HEALTH INSURANCE CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON AUDIT, AS REPRESENTED BY ITS CHAIRPERSON, MICHAEL G. AGUINALDO RESPONDENT.","The case stemmed from the various NDs issued by the Supervising Auditor and Audit Team Leader disallowing benefits and allowances paid by PHIC Regional Office (RO) IV-A to its regular and contractual employees for CY 2009 and 2010. The disallowances are summarized as follows: Transportation Allowance for Contractual Employees in CY 2009 (P220,736.19); Project Completion Incentive for Contractual Employees in CY 2009 and 2010 (P144,587.08 and P153,769.11, respectively); and Educational Assistance Allowance for Regular Employees in CY 2009 and 2010 (P6,632,059.55 and P8,136,253.70, respectively), totaling P15,287,405.63. The basis for disallowance was lack of proper authority and violation of budget circulars and the General Appropriations Act. PHIC filed an appeal before the COA Regional Director, which affirmed the NDs. PHIC then filed a Petition for Review before the COA Commission Proper, arguing that Section 16(n) of RA 7875 bestowed PHIC with fiscal autonomy, confirmed by former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and OGCC opinions, and that the PHIC BOD had exclusive authority to approve the internal operating budget. It also argued that the personnel received the benefits in good faith.","In the Decision No. 2018-253 dated 15 March 2018, the COA Commission Proper dismissed the petition, affirming COA RO No. IV-A Decision No. 2014-23, which affirmed the NDs on the payment of Transportation Allowance, Educational Assistance Allowance, and Project Completion Incentive for calendar years 2009 and 2010, in the total amount of P15,287,405.63. Upon motion for reconsideration, the COA Commission Proper modified the decision in Decision No. 2020-466 dated 31 January 2020, affirming the NDs but excluding Mr. Benjie A. Cuvinar and Ms. Erlinda R. Pronton from solidary liability, though they remained liable to refund the amount they each received.","The Court ruled that PHIC's authority under Section 16(n) of RA 7875 is not absolute and cannot be the sole basis for the grant of benefits or allowances. Notwithstanding this provision, PHIC is duty-bound to observe the guidelines and policies under relevant laws such as Section 12 of RA 6758, Section 6 of PD 1597, and Section 9 of JR 04. The disallowance of the educational assistance allowance was warranted in the absence of law or DBM issuance. The grant of transportation allowance and project completion incentive to contractual employees was inconsistent with CSC MC No. 40 and contrary to their job order contracts. The approving officers (BOD and others) were found to have acted in gross negligence amounting to bad faith because disallowances of the same nature had been previously issued. Consequently, the approving or authorizing officers and the recipients are liable to refund the disallowed benefits, with recipients being liable under the principle of solutio indebiti, as the benefits lacked proper legal basis.","WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant Petition is hereby DENIED.

"A.C. No. 13365, September 27, 2022","ALVIN Y. FERNANDEZ, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. JOSE A. DIÑO, JR., RESPONDENT.","Complainant Alvin Y. Fernandez lodged a disbarment suit (docketed as CBD 14-4126) against Atty. Jose A. Diño, Jr. Complainant was the plaintiff in an illegal dismissal case before the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) against respondent's clients, namely: Don Mariano Transit Corporation and Dr. Melissa L. Lim. On 8 August 2013, respondent filed, on behalf of his clients, a Petition for Review on Certiorari (docketed as G.R. Nos. 207751-52) before this Court, seeking the dismissal of complainant's labor case. Notwithstanding the NLRC's dismissal of complainant's labor case, the Court denied respondent's aforecited Petition through the Resolution dated 2 September 2013. Consequently, complainant filed an Urgent Manifestation before the NLRC, citing the Court's Resolution in G.R. Nos. 207751-52 to bolster his bid for reconsideration. In turn, respondent filed a Motion to Expunge (Re: Sham Urgent Manifestation), accusing complainant of '[littering] the case records with 'C.M. Recto' manufactured documents' intended to 'fool and mislead' the NLRC. Ultimately, respondent's Motion for Reconsideration in G.R. Nos. 207751-52 was denied by the Court via the Resolution dated 25 November 2013. Immediately thereafter, complainant filed a Very Urgent Manifestation before the NLRC to apprise the tribunal of this development. Unflinching, respondent lodged anew a Motion to Expunge (Re: Sham Very Urgent Manifestation), reiterating that complainant 'attempted to fool and mislead' the NLRC by attaching 'C.M. Recto' manufactured or bogus documents, i.e., the Supreme Court's Notices of the Resolutions dated 2 September 2013 and 25 November 2013. In his Complaint, complainant claimed that respondent willfully and viciously maligned and insulted not only him, but also this Court, by branding its official Notices and Resolutions as 'C.M. Recto' manufactured or bogus documents. For this reason, complainant implored this Court to disbar respondent.","Upon judicious rumination, this Court adopts the findings of the IBP Investigating Commissioner and the Board of Governors, but modifies the penalty to be imposed upon respondent. Atty. Jose A. Diño, Jr. is hereby declared GUILTY of violating Rule 8.01, Canon 8, and Rule 11.03, Canon 11 of the Code of Professional Responsibility.","The Court dismissed respondent's procedural claims that the IBP Board's 22 March 2018 Resolution was an utter nullity for being undated and unnumbered, and for being rendered without the conduct of a formal and evidentiary hearing, holding that due process was accorded through his opportunity to file numerous submissions. The Court found that respondent failed to use temperate and respectful language in his submissions, having persistently ascribed discourteous and unsupported imputations against complainant, his counsel, the Investigating Commissioner, the IBP Board, and others. The Court noted that respondent's use of abusive language—such as calling the complaint a SHAM, the complainant a 'semi-literate former bus-driver,' and accusing the Investigating Commissioner and IBP Director of Bar Discipline of lying—violates Rule 8.01, Canon 8, and Rule 11.03, Canon 11 of the CPR. Specifically, respondent's act of denouncing this Court's Notices and Resolutions in G.R. Nos. 207751-52 as 'C.M. Recto manufactured or bogus documents' violated his professional duty, as a lawyer's language, though forceful and emphatic, must always be dignified and respectful. Considering respondent was previously disbarred in Vantage Lighting Philippines, Inc. v. Diño, Jr. for gross misconduct, the Court imposed the penalty of suspension for the sole purpose of recording it in his personal file in the Office of the Bar Confidant (OBC), to be considered in the event he files a petition to lift his disbarment.","Atty. Jose A. Diño, Jr. is hereby declared GUILTY of violating Rule 8.01, Canon 8, and Rule 11.03, Canon 11 of the Code of Professional Responsibility. He is SUSPENDED from the practice of law for one (1) year. Nevertheless, considering that he was previously disbarred, his suspension is only for the sole purpose of recording it in his personal file in the Office of the Bar Confidant (OBC)."
"G.R. No. 222469, September 21, 2022","DENNIS M. VILLA-IGNACIO, PETITIONER, VS. WENDELL E. BARRERAS-SULIT, RESPONDENT.","In 2008, petitioner was holding the position of Special Prosecutor of the Office of the Special Prosecutor (
OSP
) at the Office of the Ombudsman (
OMB
). Respondent Wendell E. Barreras-Sulit (
Barreras-Sulit
) was the Acting Deputy Special Prosecutor and Officer-in-Charge of the Administrative Division of the OSP. IAB Case No. IAB-08-0013 on petitioner's alleged failure to report to work on various dates and leaving work early Under an anonymous letter dated July 16, 2008, ""supposed concerned employees"" complained that petitioner failed to report to work on various dates and had a penchant for leaving work early. The letter cited the entries in the Security Logbooks of the dates and times when petitioner entered and left his place of work.[4] The letter was treated as a complaint and docketed as IAB Case No. IAB-08-0013. Per IAB Fact-Finding Investigation Report dated July 3, 2013,[5] then Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon Gerard A. Mosquera (
Mosquera
) ruled that the logbook entries were not sufficient, nor accurate evidence of absences, tardiness, or under times allegedly incurred by petitioner. Too, by the nature of petitioner's office and functions, there were times he was
necessarily impelled to perform
his official duties
outside
the office.[6] Thus, the complaint was dismissed and considered closed and terminated. OMB-C-A-080534-J on petitioner's alleged habitual unauthorized absences and submission of falsified Certificates of Service from January 2008 to July 2008 Assistant Special Prosecutor Rabendranath T. Uy (
Uy
) charged petitioner with dishonesty, falsification of public documents,
estafa
, and violation of Section 3(e)[7] of Republic Act (
RA
) No. 3019, the ""Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act,"" for his supposed habitual and unauthorized absences and submission of falsified Certificates of Service from January 2008 to July 2008. The case was captioned
Rabendranath T. Uy v. Dennis M.Villa-Ignacio
and docketed as OMB-C-A-080534-J.[8] As in IAB Case No. IAB-08-0013, the charges were similarly anchored on exactly the same entries in the Security Logbook. Under IAB Consolidated Resolution[9] dated September 26, 2014, the IAB also dismissed the charge of dishonesty for lack of evidence, the charges of falsification of public documents, and violation of Section 3(e), RA 3019 for lack of probable cause.[10] The IAB held that the security logbooks were not a reliable source of petitioner's attendance and could not be utilized as evidence of such fact since they were by nature inaccurate and incomplete. Further, the IAB ruled that the attendant circumstances negated petitioner's alleged criminal intent and malice. Petitioner's admission that he resorted to working outside his office due, among others, to the hostile environment created by respondent and colleagues indicated his good faith.[11] OMB-C-C-06-0296-F[12] on petitioner's alleged habitual unauthorized absences and submission of falsified Certificates of Service from August 2008 to December 2008; OMB-C-A-09-0313-F on petitioner's alleged violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019 Except for the period covered, these cases were essentially the same as the complaints in IAB Case No. IAB-08-0013 and OMB C-A-080534-J. In her Complaint-Affidavit[13] dated June 17, 2009, the respondent charged petitioner before the IAB[14] with violations of Articles 171[15] and 174[16] of the Revised Penal Code; serious dishonesty,[17] grave misconduct,[18] conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service,[19] frequent unauthorized absences/habitual absenteeism[20] under the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service;[21] and violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019. The criminal and administrative cases, both entitled
Wendell E. Barreras-Sulit v. Dennis M. Villa-Ignacio
, were docketed OMB-C-C-06-0296-F[22] and OMB-C-A-09-0313-F, respectively.[23] Respondent averred that petitioner falsified his certificates of service from August 2008 to December 2008. As indicated in these certificates, he rendered full-time service during the covered period, except for the indicated 36 days when he took a leave of absence. In truth, according to the complaint, he was actually absent for 64 days from August 2008 to December 2008, or an absence of 28 days without approved leave.[24] In support of these charges, respondent submitted the five certificates of service executed by petitioner corresponding to the period of August 2008 to December 2008. Except for the specific month covered, these certificates of service were uniformly worded, 
viz
.: I HEREBY CERTIFY upon my honor that I have rendered full time service for the period [of] _________________, except on the following days, leave application for which has been filed/duly approved.[25] Respondent also submitted: (a) petitioner's applications for leave from September 2008 to December 2008;[26] (b) Medical Certifications dated October 18 and 22, 2008 stating that petitioner was confined at the Chinese General Hospital from October 14 to 18, 2008 for surgery;[27] (c)
Information Report dated January 19, 2009 of the security guards
at the Office of the Ombudsman showing petitioner's ingress and egress at the OSP from January 2008 to December 2008;[28] (d)
Joint Affidavit of the security guards
assigned at the OSP attesting the veracity of the entries in the Information Report;[29] and (e) Summary of Attendance and Absences for the months of August 2008 to December 2008.[30] x x x In response, petitioner and Atty. Monica C. Villa-Ignacio filed their Joint Counter-Affidavit
Ex Abundanti Ad Cautelam
[34] dated January 18, 2010. Insofar as petitioner is concerned, he assailed as illegal the Order[35] dated November 24, 2009 of the IAB allegedly because: (1) Its service on him on December 23, 2009, was irregular, unfair, and impelled by sinister motives as it effectively required him to prepare his pleadings and evidence during the holidays, thus, amounting to a denial of due process; (2) The complaint was handled in a highly irregular and anomalous manner as it did not undergo proper evaluation soon after it was filed; it was docketed with undue haste, in violation of III. Procedures in Handling Complaints of Administrative Order No. 16 (
AO16
), Series of 2003, the Creation of an Internal Affairs Board; and (3) Under III(F)[36] Action on Evaluation Report of AO16, Series of 2003, the Ombudsman should personally sign orders in cases involving respondents with Salary Grades of 25 and higher, as in his case. But the Order dated November 24, 2009 was signed only by Overall Deputy Ombudsman and IAB Chairman Orlando C. Casimiro (
Casimiro
). Although AO21, Series of 2009, deleted the proviso, the revised rule, which was promulgated only after the complaint-affidavit was filed, cannot be applied to him.[37] Petitioner also questioned the title of Casimiro as Overall Deputy Ombudsman and IAB Chairman, since he (Casimiro) was previously Deputy Ombudsman for Military and Other Law Enforcement Officers (
MOLEO
). This was purportedly a violation of Section 7[38] of RA 6770, The Ombudsman Act, and Section 11, Article XI of the Constitution,[39] which prohibited Casimiro's reappointment. More, the IAB had no jurisdiction over petitioner as the OSP was directly under the control and supervision of the Office of the President pursuant to Section 8 of RA 6770. Refuting the alleged falsification of his certificates of service, he asserted that these documents accurately reflected the dates when he rendered service to the OSP. The
entries in the logbook or Information Report of the OSP security guards
were
inaccurate
and
unreliable
since they were not notarized nor written by public officers in their official capacities. He admitted though there were certain days he was
compelled to work at home
because respondent subjected him to harassment and created a hostile work environment for him at the OSP.","Under Decision[43] dated April 30, 2010, the IAB,[44] as approved by the Ombudsman and her two deputies, found petitioner guilty of the offenses charged in OMB-C-A-09-0313-F and consequently ordered his dismissal from the service, 
viz
.: WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the Internal Affairs Board hereby finds Special Prosecutor Dennis M. Villa-Ignacio GUILTY of Dishonesty, Grave Misconduct, Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service[,] and Habitual Absenteeism. Pursuant to Section 52, paragraph (A), sub-paragraph (1 and 3)[,] and Section 55 of the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, the offenses of Dishonesty and Grave Misconduct being classified as grave, respondent is consequently meted the penalty of DISMISSAL FROM SERVICE. As aforesaid, the non-imposition of the penalty of dismissal on the respondent shall be without prejudice to the application of the accessory penalties of perpetual disqualification to hold public office, cancellation of civil service eligibility, and forfeiture of benefits, effective upon the finality of this Decision. SO ORDERED.[45] (Emphases in the original) According to the IAB, there was nothing irregular with the issuance and service of the Order dated November 24, 2009 on petitioner on December 23, 2009. Nothing under AO16, Series of 2003, proscribed the service of petitioner of the Order on December 23, 2009, a regular working day; petitioner even got to file a Motion for Extension which the IAB granted. The IAB's failure to immediately assign a case number to the complaint and subject the same to preliminary evaluation was not fatal to the case either. Further, Casimiro's title as Overall Deputy Ombudsman and IAB Chairperson may not be collaterally attacked. Too, Section 8(2) of RA 6770 does not prohibit the Ombudsman from exercising administrative disciplinary power over the Special Prosecutor as Section 11(3)[46] of the same law places the OSP under the supervision and control of the Ombudsman. Finally, petitioner declared in his certificates of service that he rendered full-time service from August 2008 to December 2008, although he himself admitted that on certain days, he did not physically report to the office without applying for leave. This constituted dishonesty, grave misconduct, conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service, and habitual absenteeism. Under Order[47] dated August 18, 2010, petitioner's motion for reconsideration was denied. Proceedings before the Court of Appeals In his Petition for Review under CA-G.R. SP No. 117703,[48] petitioner faulted the IAB for giving due course to the complaint despite its alleged glaring irregularities. He questioned anew the constitution of the IAB since Casimiro had no authority to head the same, much less, to participate in the proceedings therein;[49] and the jurisdiction of the IAB over him considering that under Section 8 of the Ombudsman Act, it is the President who is authorized to remove the Special Prosecutor from service and only for culpable violation of the Constitution, treason, bribery, graft and corruption, other high crimes, or betrayal of public trust after due process.[50] Petitioner also reiterated there was nothing irregular with his certificates of service for the period of August 2008 to December 2008. He argued that except for those days covered by his leave of absence, he rendered full service on the days declared in his certificates of service. He cited that no law restricted his workspace to be only at his office. Thus, he concluded, on certain days though he was not in the office, he still rendered full service at his house, free from hostility, persecution, harassment, and general ill caused by respondent and her cohorts.[51] Petitioner asserted that the IAB erred when it relied on the Information Report based on the security logbook alone since its due execution was doubtful as it was incomplete, unauthenticated, and unreliable.[52] In her Comment/Opposition,[53] respondent defended the dispositions of the IAB. She admitted that while Section 8 of the Ombudsman Act empowers the President to remove the Special Prosecutor, this power is not exclusively vested in the President. This removal power is shared by the Ombudsman per Section 11(3) of the same law. In his Reply,[54] petitioner posited that based on the congressional deliberations, insofar as the Special Prosecutor is concerned, the legislative intent was to confine the Ombudsman's power of supervision and control to the prosecutorial functions of the OSP, excluding the exercise of disciplinary authority over this office and the Special Prosecutor. Dispositions of the Court of Appeals By Decision[55] dated February 4, 2014, in CA-G.R. SP No. 117703, the Court of Appeals affirmed. It ruled that the power of the Ombudsman to remove any erring public official from the service is set forth under Section 15, RA 6770. On this score, the Office of the Ombudsman has the power to promulgate its own rules of procedure for the effective exercise of its powers, functions, and duties. The alleged unreasonable service of the Order dated November 24, 2009, on December 23, 2009, was negated by the 15-day extension granted to petitioner within which to file his reply affidavit. More, the retroactive application of AO21, Series of 2009, did not violate petitioner's right to due process as no person could have a vested right to any procedural rules. On the substantive issue, the Court of Appeals agreed that petitioner is guilty of serious dishonesty. For he allegedly knew that the entries in his certificates of service were false. He himself admitted that on certain days he opted to work within the confines of his house. Despite this admission, he did not make any effort to rectify his certificates of service by filing his corresponding leave applications. Based on his false certificates of service, he was able to collect his full salary from August 2008 to December 2008. In closing, the Court of Appeals expressed its adherence to the principle of non-interference in the exercise by the Office of the Ombudsman of its power to prosecute offenses committed by public officers and the general rule that ""findings of fact of the Office of the Ombudsman when supported by substantial evidence are conclusive."" By Resolution[56] dated January 13, 2016, the Court of Appeals denied petitioner's motion for reconsideration.","We reverse. The Ombudsman has the power to remove the Special Prosecutor. x x x To address petitioner's argument, suffice it to state at this time that the Ombudsman has the power to remove the Special Prosecutor. This is found both in the Constitution and RA 6770. The Office of the Ombudsman is constitutionally envisioned to be an independent agency. This has been affirmed in Gonzales III v. Office of the President (Gonzales 2012),[66] and the Resolution dated January 28, 2014, in the same case (Gonzales 2014).[67] The Ombudsman's power to remove the Special Prosecutor is in line with and supportive of this institutional independence as discussed in these precedents. x x x This rationalization was aptly discussed in the Concurring and Dissenting Opinion of then Associate Justice, now Senior Associate Justice Marvic M.V.F. Leonen in Gonzales 2014,[91] thus: x x x By clear constitutional design, the Tanodbayan or the Office of the Special Prosecutor is separate from the Office of the Ombudsman. Section 7 is explicit on this point, in that the Office of the Special Prosecutor is allowed to exercise its powers, except for those conferred on the Office of the Ombudsman. x x x Thus, the provision of Section 8, Paragraph (2) of Republic Act No. 6770 which provides for the power of the President to remove the Special Prosecutor is valid and constitutional.[92] While Gonzales 2014 upheld the power of the President to remove the Special Prosecutor, it did not rule that the Office of the Ombudsman lacked such power. In fact, as will be explained below, the Special Prosecutor enjoys the same independence as the Deputies of the Ombudsman. We emphasize that the disciplinary authority of the Ombudsman proceeds from a constitutional imprimatur. It is not a mere statutory power. x x x Hence, We confirm the rationale in Gonzales 2014 as being relevant to both the Deputies of the Ombudsman and the Special Prosecutor. The rationale applies equally to both if not with more reason to the Special Prosecutor. The Office of the Ombudsman must stand at par with other government offices whose independence has been constitutionally guaranteed. In the case of the Judiciary and the Constitutional Commissions, they have plenary disciplinary authority over their own officials and employees. In view of the foregoing considerations, the IAB and the Offices of the Ombudsman and her Deputies here exercised the powers which properly belong to them, i.e., the power to investigate the complaints filed against the Special Prosecutor and impose disciplinary sanctions on him, if proper. x x x Petitioner was not denied his constitutional right to due process of law x x x Admittedly here, petitioner was granted an extension of time to file a counter-affidavit. Thereafter, he duly filed a Joint Counter-Affidavit Ex Abundanti Ad Cautelam[107] dated January 18, 2010. When he received the IAB ruling, he also filed a motion for reconsideration. Verily, petitioner cannot claim denial of due process. x x x However, there is simply no substantial evidence to find petitioner liable – he must be exonerated. x x x Applying this standard of proof, there is no substantial evidence to support petitioner's administrative liability. x x x The Information Report is not a reliable source of attendance. This has already been pointed out by the Office of the Ombudsman itself. In the Fact-Finding Investigation Report[122] dated July 3, 2013, the IAB then headed by its Chairperson and Deputy Ombudsman Mosquera dismissed IAB Case No. IAB-08-0013, citing the following reasons: Given the nature of the functions of Atty. Villa[-]Ignacio as Special Prosecutor, it cannot be denied that he has to perform some of his official duties outside his office at the Sandiganbayan Bldg. located along Commonwealth Avenue, Quezon City. x x x. In addition, thereto, entries in the logbooks are usually limited to matters seen or observed by the security guards. Therefore, persons or events/dealings that were unnoticed are not recorded in the logbook. Likewise, entries in the logbooks only establish the fact that a particular official or employee went inside or outside his/her workplace but not the fact that he/she actually reported for work or was just in the premises for a visit or some other unofficial business. In fine, logbook entries of security guards at the Office of the Special Prosecutor are not sufficient and accurate proof of the absences, tardiness or under time incurred by Atty. Villa-Ignacio and Monica Villa-Ignacio.[123] x x x The Information Report that was used to track petitioner's attendance in the office is not a reliable, accurate, or complete source for determining petitioner's attendance and rendition of service. At the most, it only established the fact that a particular official or employee went inside or outside his/her workplace but not the fact that he or she actually reported for work or was just on the premises for a visit or some other unofficial business. To refute the declaration of petitioner in his certificates of services, his mere physical absence or absence is not enough as one must prove that the high-ranking public official did not actually and fully render services. The nature of the work of petitioner as the Special Prosecutor may require him to be outside of his workstation. Allegations of absence from one's workplace do not prove that he or she did not render the services required by his or her job or position.","ACCORDINGLY, the petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated February 4, 2014, and Resolution dated January 13, 2016 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 117703 are REVERSED. The Office of the Ombudsman is ordered to pay the back salaries of petitioner Dennis M. Villa-Ignacio and all the benefits which should have accrued to him from the date of his separation from the service until the date of the expiration of his term of office, which we shall refer to as the date of his separation from the service. He is also entitled to all the benefits accruing to him as a retired Special Prosecutor. The total amounts shall earn legal interest. x x x The Office of the Ombudsman is ordered to pay the back salaries of petitioner Dennis M. Villa-Ignacio and all the benefits which should have accrued to him from the date of his separation from the service until the date of the expiration of his term of office, with twelve percent (12%) legal interest per annum from the date of separation from the service until June 30, 2013, and thereafter, six percent (6%) legal interest per annum until fully paid. He shall also be paid all the retirement benefits accruing to a retired Special Prosecutor. SO ORDERED."

Each of them signed an Independent Contractor Agreement (Contract) which states that they will be paid P1,200.00 per day as service fee.[6] The contract also states that they are engaged for a period of one year.[7] The riders used their privately-owned motorcycles in their trips.[8] Sometime in January 2017, the riders were told by a dispatcher that they have been removed from their usual routes and will no longer be given any schedules. Despite this, they still reported to work for three days and waited all day for new assignments to no avail.[9] Thereafter, they learned that their routes were already given to other employees.[10] The riders then filed a complaint before the National Labor Relations Commission against Lazada, its employees, and its officers for illegal dismissal, non-payment of salary, overtime pay, holiday pay, service incentive leave pay, thirteenth month pay, separation pay, and illegal deduction, with claims for moral and exemplary damages and attorney's fees.[11] The Labor Arbiter dismissed the complaint and ruled that the riders are not regular employees of Lazada.

In March 2017, Macslink closed shop and terminated the services of Macalino et al., prompting them to file a complaint before the labor arbiter (LA). In a Decision dated December 28, 2018, the LA ruled that Macalino et al. are regular employees of Coca-Cola since TRCI was engaged in labor-only contracting. The LA held their dismissal illegal and awarded them reinstatement with backwages, monetary benefits, and damages. TRCI filed a partial appeal before the NLRC, arguing that it is a legitimate contractor. In a Resolution dated March 25, 2019, the NLRC denied TRCI's partial appeal, ruling that TRCI failed to perfect its appeal for nonpayment of the required cash or surety bond equivalent to the monetary award (P545,051.03), having only paid P520.00 for appeal fees. TRCI's Motion for Reconsideration was denied. TRCI filed a petition for certiorari before the CA. In a Resolution dated November 7, 2019, the CA dismissed the petition for certiorari, agreeing that TRCI's appeal was not perfected due to the failure to pay the appeal bond, emphasizing that the bond was necessary because TRCI, if its appeal was granted, would be declared the real employer or, as a labor-only contractor, solidarily liable for the monetary awards. The CA denied reconsideration on June 15, 2020. Hence, TRCI filed this Petition for Review on Certiorari, insisting it was not required to pay the bond as the LA did not declare it the employer.","This Court resolves the Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court seeking to reverse and set aside the Resolutions dated November 7, 2019 and June 15, 2020 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 162182, which ruled that the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) did not gravely abuse its discretion in dismissing the appeal of The Redsystems Company, Inc. (TRCI) for its failure to file the requisite appeal bond. The Court holds that the CA correctly determined the absence of grave abuse of discretion in the NLRC decision. The posting of a bond, in the form of cash or surety, is required to perfect an appeal from a decision of the LA involving monetary awards, pursuant to Article 229 (formerly 223) of the Labor Code.","The Petition is denied. Having been declared as a labor-only contractor, petitioner is solidarily liable with Coca-Cola for the monetary benefits awarded by the LA to respondents. It does not matter that the LA did not specifically rule to this effect, since the solidary liability between the principal and the labor-only contractor is mandated by the law itself (Articles 106 and 109 of the Labor Code). The term employer under Article 229 of the Labor Code, and Section 6 of the NLRC Rules of Procedure, for purposes of requiring an appeal bond, includes parties who are adjudged by the LA as solidarily liable with the employer for the payment of monetary awards to workers, including a labor-only contractor, as in this case. The failure of petitioner to post a bond equivalent in amount to the monetary award is fatal to its appeal. The CA did not err in finding no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC, which merely followed the law and its own rules of procedure.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DENIED. The Resolutions dated November 7, 2019 and June 15, 2020 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 162182 are hereby AFFIRMED. The Resolution dated March 25, 2019 of the National Labor Relations Commission dismissing the appeal of petitioner The Redsystems Company, Inc. for nonperfection is UPHELD. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 240895, September 21, 2022","REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, REPRESENTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS AND HIGHWAYS, PETITIONER, VS. WILLIAM RALLOS, MATEO RALLOS, LUCIA RALLOS,* ROMEO RALLOS, CATHERINE RALLOS, ROCHELLE RALLOS, CHRISTINE RALLOS, JANUARIO V. SENO,** AND THE REGISTER OF DEEDS FOR CEBU CITY, RESPONDENTS.","The subject matter of the case is a 439-square-meter parcel of land in Cebu City which is referred to as Lot No. 7245 and forms part of the V. Rama Avenue (previously, Guadalupe Road). It was earlier registered under Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. RO-3105 (O-1930) issued on January 31, 1919 in the names of Victoria, Juan, and Numeriana, all surnnamed Rallos. OCT No. RO-3105 (O-1930) was cancelled and TCT No. 145498 was issued over the same property in the names of: Romeo, William, Mateo, Lucia, Catherine, Rochelle, and Christine, all surnamed Rallos; and Januario V. Seno (Januario). Two civil cases were filed: Civil Case No. CEB-21557 (Romeo Rallos, et al.) for recovery of possession, partition and damages against DPWH for non-payment of the value of the property used as a national road; and Civil Case No. CEB-25079 (DPWH/Republic) for reversion and cancellation/annulment of title, claiming the subject property has always been part of V. Rama Avenue and titles were irregularly obtained. The RTC rendered a Joint Judgment dismissing both Complaints, finding that private respondents failed to establish their heirship and that evidence showed their predecessor-in-interest, Francisco Rallos, had already sold the subject property in 1948, making it unclear how they secured TCT No. 145498 in 1997. The RTC also dismissed the reversion case as the Republic failed to prove fraud or that the land was initially public road. The CA reversed the dismissal of Civil Case No. CEB-21557, finding that Ralloses' title (TCT No. 145498) entitled them to just compensation, and remanded the case for determination of payment, while affirming the dismissal of the reversion case (Civil Case No. CEB-25079).","the Decision dated December 14, 2017 and the Resolution dated July 23, 2018 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CEB-CV No. 03522 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE.","The Court found that the Republic substantially complied with the Rules of Court regarding assignment of errors on appeal. On the substantive issues, the Court ruled that the CA's finding on the entitlement of private respondents to just compensation was founded on a misapprehension of facts. Private respondents failed to establish by preponderant evidence their entitlement to just compensation because (1) Numeriana, a co-owner, could not convey the whole property to Francisco, and (2) evidence submitted by private respondents themselves (the project of partition) showed that Francisco Rallos had already sold the subject property in 1948, making the subsequent issuance of TCT No. 145498 in 1997 unclear and irregular. Thus, the private respondents' Complaint in Civil Case No. CEB-21557 must be dismissed for lack of sufficient evidence. However, the Court affirmed the dismissal of the Republic's Complaint in Civil Case No. CEB-25079 for reversion and cancellation/annulment of title, as the Republic failed to discharge its burden of proving that the land forms part of the public domain and that there was fraud surrounding the issuance of the original title (OCT No. RO-3105).","WHEREFORE, the Decision dated December 14, 2017 and the Resolution dated July 23, 2018 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CEB-CV No. 03522 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The Joint Judgment dated October 30, 2009 and Joint Order dated March 20, 2010 of Branch 6, Regional Trial Court of Cebu City dismissing the Complaints in Civil Case Nos. CEB-21557 and CEB-25079 are REINSTATED. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 253186, September 21, 2022","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. WU JIAN CAI AND JIANG HUO ZAO, ACCUSED, CHEN JUNYUE, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","The case stemmed from two Informations charging accused-appellant Chen Junyue, Wu Jian Cai, and Jiang Huo Zao with Illegal Sale (Criminal Case No. Q-09-159311) and Illegal Possession (Criminal Case No. Q-09-159312) of Dangerous Drugs. The prosecution's version states that on June 12, 2009, a buy-bust operation (COPLAN: 'South Stone') was conducted against the Chong Group. SPO3 Parreño acted as the poseur-buyer for two kilograms of shabu. During the transaction, Ilao, the driver of the black Toyota Altis, alighted and approached the green Honda Civic. Jiang, the driver of the Honda Civic, spoke to accused-appellant Chen Junyue, the driver of the silver Nissan Exalta Grandeur (where Wu was also present). Jiang then boarded the Nissan, returned carrying a blue and black backpack, and entered the Honda Civic. Ilao then came out of the Honda Civic with the backpack and handed it to SPO3 Parreño inside the Toyota Altis. SPO3 Parreño saw a vacuum-sealed plastic bag containing about two kilograms of white crystalline substance. Upon execution of the pre-arranged signal, the arresting officers blocked the vehicles. SPO1 Pascua and PO2 Perida arrested accused-appellant and Wu from the silver Nissan Exalta and recovered, from its compartment, one brown box containing five vacuum-sealed plastic bags (approx. 9993.32 grams) and one brown box containing four vacuum-sealed plastic bags (approx. 7982.10 grams), totaling 17,975.42 grams of shabu. Markings and inventory of all seized items were conducted at the place of arrest in the presence of accused-appellant and Wu, Prosecutor Pedro M. Tresvalles, Barangay Chairman Jaime Cabalona, and media representative Niko Baua. The contents of the seized substances tested positive for methamphetamine hydrochloride. Accused-appellant denied the charges, asserting he was merely driving a car with his co-accused when arrested, and denied selling and possessing illegal drugs. Jiang also maintained his innocence and denied knowing accused-appellant and Ilao.","The Regional Trial Court (RTC) found accused-appellant Chen Junyue, Wu Jian Cai, and Jiang Huo Zao guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 (Illegal Sale). The RTC also found accused-appellant Chen Junyue and Wu Jian Cai guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 11, Article II of RA 9165 (Illegal Possession), but acquitted Jiang Huo Zao of possession. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the Joint Judgment of the RTC, confirming the convictions of accused-appellant and Jiang.","The Court resolves to dismiss the appeal, finding that the prosecution had satisfactorily established the elements of Illegal Sale of shabu, noting that the transaction was consummated through the concerted acts of the accused, indicating conspiracy. For Illegal Possession, the finding of illicit drugs (17,975.42 grams of shabu) in the vehicle occupied by accused-appellant and Wu raised a presumption of knowledge and possession, which accused-appellant failed to rebut. The Court accorded credence to the testimonies of the law enforcers due to the presumption of regularity in their performance of duty, noting no improper motive. The Court upheld the integrity of the seized drugs, finding that the chain of custody was properly preserved, as the marking and inventory were conducted at the place of arrest in the presence of the three required witnesses (Prosecutor, Brgy. Chairman, Media). Furthermore, the fact that the seized illegal drugs (almost 20 kilos) underwent a rigorous process of ocular inspection and taking of representative samples, witnessed by the accused and judicial/prosecutorial officers, to facilitate destruction, mitigated any concerns regarding the absence of the evidence custodian's testimony.","WHEREFORE, the present appeal is DISMISSED. The Decision dated December 11, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 10394 finding accused-appellant Chen Junyue guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Illegal Sale and Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs is hereby AFFIRMED."
"G.R. No. 205737, September 21, 2022","SYSTEMS ENERGIZER CORPORATION (SECOR), PETITIONER, VS. BELLVILLE DEVELOPMENT INCORPORATED (BDI), RESPONDENT.","Systems Energizer Corporation (petitioner) and Bellville Development, Incorporated (respondent) entered into an Owner-Contractor Agreement (First Agreement) on May 21, 2009 whereby the former was to undertake the construction of the electrical works for the latter's proposed Molito 3—Puregold Building located inside the El Malito Commercial Complex located on the corner of Madrigal Avenue and the Alabang-Zapote Road in Barangay Alabang, Muntinlupa City.[5] The contract price agreed upon was a fixed lump sum of P15,250,000.00,[6] and the First Agreement had two crucial stipulations: the first being Article 2.02 which states the following: 2.02. The other documents, which hereafter may be mutually agreed upon between the OWNER and CONTRACTOR and duly signed by both of them, whether prepared before or after signing of the Contract Documents, shall likewise form part of the Contract Documents.[7] The second crucial stipulation is Article 5.05, which states the following: 5.05. Should the OWNER require the CONTRACTOR to perform additional work or extra work or to reduce any work, the costs of such additional and/or reduced work shall be added to or deducted from, as the case may be, to [sic] the Contract Price stated in Article 5.01.[8] Petitioner began work on the project but the same was suspended after only a few months, allegedly due to some issues with respondent's original contractor for the structural works, and the untimely demise of respondent's two vice presidents, who were signatories to the First Agreement.[9] However, respondent issued a new Notice of Award/Notice to Proceed[10] dated March 25, 2010 to petitioner... stipulating that 'the total contract amount shall be PESOS: Fifty One Million Five Hundred Fifty Thousand (Php. 51,550,000.00) Pesos inclusive of VAT and other applicable government taxes.' Eventually, the Parties entered into a Second Agreement[12] dated April 5, 2010, in order to reflect the new specifications indicated in the Notice of Award/Notice to Proceed dated March 25, 2010. The Second Agreement provided that petitioner was to undertake the construction and completion of electrical works at the same location/project, i.e., the Molito 3—Puregold Commercial Building. The scope of work covered the entirety of petitioner's undertaking in much more detail and additional major structures (i.e., the vault substation and the closed circuit television system [CCTV] for the project), and crucially, Article 2.4 called for an abandonment of the previous First Agreement, viz.: 2.4. The Contract Documents contain the entire agreement and understanding between the OWNER and CONTRACTOR as to the subject matter hereof, and the same supersedes all prior agreements, commitments, representations, writing, and discussions between them. All other documents relating to the subject matter executed by the parties prior to this Construction Contract but not forming part of the Contract Documents above enumerated are deemed waived an/or abandoned. Said Second Agreement had a contract price of P51,550,000.00, with payment to be made on monthly billings based on percentage of actual accomplishment... Over the course of the project's completion, additional Work Authorization Orders[15] (WAOs) were entered into between the Parties for further electrical installations. The actual final cost of respondent for petitioner's services vis-à-vis the construction of electrical works for the building amounted to P80,711,308.05, as stated in the Statement of Actual Cost Accounting & Summary of Expenses[16] prepared by respondent's accountant/finance manager. . . It appears from the records that respondent did pay petitioner for the full contract price of the First and Second Agreements, minus however the retention fees of 10% under both contracts. . . These retention fees (i.e., P1,525,000.00 for the First Agreement and P5,155,000.00 for the Second Agreement), plus the unpaid balance of WAO No. 20[19] (P1,350,000.00), amounted to a total of P8,030,000.00, and were the subject of a demand letter addressed to respondent from petitioner's counsel and dated July 12, 2011.[20] Respondent's reply dated July 15, 2011,[21] however, simply requested that petitioner provide all necessary documentation to support the allegedly 'tremendous increase of the project cost from the original contract price of [P]15,250,000.00 to a total price of [P]80,711,308.00.'[22] With no settlement as to their issues, and with no action on the part of respondent to pay the total remaining balance, petitioner filed its Complaint before the CIAC on September 13, 2011,[23] which started arbitration proceedings under both the First and Second Agreements.","WHEREFORE, premises considered, the questioned Final Award dated 9 July 2012 is hereby MODIFIED as follows: '(1) Respondent Systems Energizer Corporation (SECOR) is hereby ORDERED to reimburse petitioner BELLVILLE DEVELOPMENT INCORPORATED (BDI) the amount of Thirteen Million Five Hundred Ninety[-]Three Thousand Two Hundred Seventy[-]Three [Pesos] (P13,593,273.00), representing the excess amount paid by the petitioner to the respondent; (2) Respondent's claim for exemplary damages and attorney's fees are hereby denied; (3) Petitioner's claim for exemplary damages and attorney's fees are hereby denied; (4) The arbitration cost[,] which includes the filing fee, administrative fee, arbitrator's fee, and Arbitration Development Fund charges, including all incidental expenses, shall be borne by both parties on a pro rata basis; (5) All other requests for relief not granted or disposed of here are hereby denied.' SO ORDERED.","The Petition is lacking merit, and must be denied. . . The Court first tackles the alleged doubt in the interpretation of the terms of Article 2.4 of the Second Agreement—the crux of the present controversy. . . The Court is obliged to pore over the evidence on record for any and all indications as to the intent of the Parties to either sustain and keep alive the First Agreement along with the Second, or to do away with the First altogether. . . The legal basis for the concept can be found in Article 1291 of the Civil Code. . . Article 1292 of the Civil Code further provides that '[i]n order that an obligation may be extinguished by another which substitutes the same, it is imperative that it be so declared in unequivocal terms, or that the old and the new obligations be on every point incompatible with each other.' This is the basis for the important concept that novation is never presumed. . . True enough, the fact that the Parties entered into the Second Agreement that points to a new or revised plan for the necessary electrical works for the Molito 3—Puregold Building is already telling. The contract price is significantly greater, and this alone should be sufficient to declare a new object of the contract. . . Since there was a new and revised plan based on new needs of the planned structure, and for works not found in the specifications under the First Agreement, such as the CCTV and FDAS systems and the power substation vault, the revised plan indeed constituted a new subject matter of the mutual understanding between the Parties. This is not merely an accidental change in the object of petitioner's obligations to respondent, but an essential one. . . In short, with enough evidence to conclude that the revised plan differed substantially from the original plan for the project's electrical works, the Court also concludes in turn that the revised plans constituted a different subject matter for the Second Agreement between the Parties. Put simply, there was an express novation in the terms of the Second Agreement concerning an essential change in the subject matter of the First Agreement. . . Common sense would also dictate that it was indeed impossible for petitioner to perform and collect on both contracts, since there was only one resulting output of finished electrical works for the project that conformed to the specifications of the revised plan under the Second Agreement. For petitioner to collect the full amount for work that was never finished would go against any notion of justice and equity. . . Overall, the CA was thus correct in finding that petitioner had unjustly enriched itself at respondent's expense; and in ordering that the Final Award be modified to allow respondent to recover its wrong payment under the full terms of the First Agreement. Solutio indebiti was correctly applied to the case, as was the compensation between the Parties as mutual creditors and debtors. A final word on the actual percentage of petitioner's accomplished work vis-à-vis the First Agreement is in order. . . To sustain the CA's ruling that petitioner was entitled to compensation under the 6.774% as determined by Jarhaus Options and Trends would be better than remanding the entire case back to the CIAC for the reception of evidence to prove something that would be nearly impossible: the completion of preparatory works for an original design that was abandoned in favor of the revised plan under the Second Agreement.","WHEREFORE, the present Petition for Review on Certiorari is hereby DENIED for lack of merit, and the Decision dated January 31, 2013 of the Court of Appeals (10th Division) in CA-G.R. SP No. 125889 is hereby AFFIRMED."
"G.R. No. 201147, September 21, 2022","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. FREDDIE SERNADILLA, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","The accused-appellant was charged with the crime of Rape in relation to R.A. No. 7610 by virtue of three (3) Informations: Criminal Case No. 3596 (February 9, 2006, 16 y/o), Criminal Case No. 3599 (October 28, 2005, 15 y/o), and Criminal Case No. 3600 (October 2004, 14 y/o). The victim, AAA, was a minor and the accused-appellant, Freddie Sernadilla, was a married man in his mid-thirties and a Pastor of Wenceslao Christian Fellowship, of which AAA and her family were members. Regarding Criminal Case No. 3600 (October 2004), AAA testified that the accused-appellant suddenly turned the lights off in the pastoral house, started embracing her, warned her not to shout or he would kill her, and succeeded in having carnal knowledge of her despite her resistance. He threatened to harm her if she told anyone. For Criminal Case No. 3599 (October 28, 2005), AAA testified that the accused-appellant offered her a ride in his tricycle but brought her to his hut in a citrus plantation where he had sexual intercourse with her, again threatening her not to tell anyone. For Criminal Case No. 3596 (February 9, 2006), the accused-appellant followed AAA to the comfort room and sexually abused her by inserting his penis in her vagina. After this incident, AAA revealed the incidents to her mother, and they reported it to the police. Medical examinations confirmed 'healed laceration' and 'sperm cells.' The defense presented testimonies seeking to establish the 'sweetheart theory,' claiming that AAA was the accused-appellant's girlfriend and that any sexual act was consensual.","The Regional Trial Court (RTC) rendered a Joint Decision dated March 28, 2008 finding the accused-appellant GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Rape in Criminal Case No. 3600, sentencing him to reclusion perpetua and payment of damages; and finding him GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of Child Abuse defined and penalized under Section 5(b), Article III of Republic Act No. 7610 in Criminal Case Nos. 3596 and 3599, sentencing him to indeterminate penalty and payment of damages/fine for each case. The Court of Appeals (CA) rendered the Decision dated June 17, 2011, affirming the RTC Joint Decision, rationalizing that while force was proven only in the first incident (CC 3600, Rape), the subsequent sexual encounters (CC 3596 and 3599) with a minor constituted sexual assault punishable under R.A. No. 7610, rendering consent irrelevant.","The Court affirmed the conviction for Rape in Criminal Case No. 3600, finding the presence of intimidation based on the victim’s testimony (she tried to resist but was threatened that he would kill her), the great disparity in age, and the accused-appellant’s moral ascendancy as a Pastor over the 14-year-old victim. The accused-appellant’s 'sweetheart theory' was rejected for being self-serving and lacking strong corroboration. However, the Court acquitted the accused-appellant in Criminal Case Nos. 3596 and 3599. While the lower courts found that the sexual congress in these latter two incidents lacked force and intimidation and were instead characterized by AAA submitting due to inducement, enticement, or coercion in the form of monetary support (suggesting Sexual Abuse under Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610), the Court ruled that the Informations failed to allege the constitutive elements of Sexual Abuse under R.A. No. 7610. Therefore, convicting the accused-appellant of a crime whose elements were not alleged in the Information, despite proof during trial, would violate his constitutional right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him, necessitating acquittal for Criminal Case Nos. 3596 and 3599.","The appeal is hereby PARTLY GRANTED. In Criminal Case Nos. 3596 and 3599, Accused-appellant Freddie Sernadilla is ACQUITTED. The Decision dated June 17, 2011 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 31721 which affirmed the Regional Trial Court of xxxxxxxxxxxxxx, Branch 96, is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. In Criminal Case No. 3600, the Decision dated June 17, 2011 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 31721 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. Accused-appellant Freddie Sernadilla is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Rape under Article 266-A(1) in relation to Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code, for which he is sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua. Accused-appellant is also ORDERED to pay the victim, AAA, P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages, and P75,000.00 as exemplary damages. Legal interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum is imposed on the monetary awards from the finality of this Decision until fully paid."

SERQUIÑA, RENE P. ALAGANO[,] and ROBERT R. NUÑEZ. CONTRARY to Article 315, par. 2(a) of the Revised Penal Code. Tayug, Pangasinan, December 1, 2006. [19] The cases were raffled to the Regional Trial Court ( RTC ) Branch 52, Tayug, Pangasinan. [20] Only Spouses Fely and Apolonio Dulay and Spouses Irene and Bal Marzan were arrested, while Marlon and Alex remain at-large. [21] On arraignment, the four accused pleaded not guilty to the respective charges against them. [22] Thereafter, the cases got consolidated and jointly tried. Notably, during the pre-trial,[23] Spouses Dulay admitted that they had no license to recruit workers for overseas employment. [24] The Prosecution's Version In her Complaint-Affidavit dated September 4, 2006,[25] Cholin Pinto ( Cholin ),[26] claimed to have paid the total amount of Php75,000.00[27] to Spouses Marlon and Marzan. During the trial in Crim. Case Nos. T-4200[28] and T-4207,[29] Cholin reiterated that she paid a placement fee of Php75,000.00 for employment in South Korea. Initially, she paid Php30,000.00 to Irene as evidenced by receipt dated May 20, 2006 issued by Marlon. A week thereafter, she paid another Php45,000.00, but this time, no receipt was issued. Irene promised that the receipt will be issued upon her (Irene) return from Manila. [30] Cholin patiently waited for her deployment abroad, but it never came into fruition. Upon verification with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) in Dagupan, she discovered that Spouses Marzan, Alex, and Marlon were not authorized to conduct any recruitment activity for overseas employment. They proceeded to the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) in Dagupan City to file a case which was referred to the trial court. [31] Per her testimony, she paid Php75,000.00 for her application for work in South Korea. In his Complaint-Affidavit[32] dated August 28, 2006, Armando Hidalgo ( Armando ),[33] claimed to have paid Php 180,000 to Spouses Marzan and Marlon of his employment application in South Korea. [34] Armando testified in Crim. Case Nos. T-4200[35] and T-4203[36] that Spouses Marzan and Marlon offered him employment in South Korea for a placement fee of Php 180,000.00. While at San Quintin, Pangasinan, he initially paid Php10,000.00 with receipt dated March 24, 2006 and another Php20,000.00 with receipt dated April 23, 2006 to Irene as his recruiter. Marlon issued the receipts. [37] After two months, Armando paid another placement fee of Php60,000.00. On August 7, 2006 at the Manila office of the accused, he paid another Php90,000.00 as placement fee to Irene in the presence of Bal, Marlon, and their boss Alex. He requested for a receipt, but he was ignored. Per his testimony, he paid Php180,000.00 for his application for overseas work. [38] On the day of Armando's supposed departure, his flight was allegedly postponed since there was no available ticket. Despite repeated inquiries to Irene for an alternative flight, Armando never left for South Korea as promised. Thus, he filed a case before the NBI with his co-applicants. [39] In his Complaint-Affidavit dated September 4, 2006, Aristotle De Vera ( Aristotle ),[40] claimed to have paid the total amount of Php74,850.00[41] for his supposed employment in South Korea. Aristotle testified in Crim. Case Nos. T-4373[42] and T-4401[43] that Spouses Marzan, together with Fely, offered him employment in South Korea. On May 15, 2006, Spouses Marzan asked him to prepare the initial amount of Php25,000.00 to be paid on May 20, 2006. On said date and in the presence of Spouses Marzan, he paid this amount to Marlon, as evidenced by a receipt. [44] On June 18, 2006, while in Manila, Aristotle paid another Php45,000.00 for the remaining balance to Spouses Marzan and Marlon. This time, his payment did not come with a receipt. He also paid the following: Php3,500.00 as medical fee, Php350.00 for a jacket, and Php1,000.00 as membership fee. He repeatedly asked for a receipt, but he was always told to wait. He was ultimately not deployed for overseas work as promised. [45] Per his testimony, he paid Php74,850.00 for his application. In her Complaint-Affidavit,[46] Shielyn Framil ( Shielyn )[47] claimed to have paid a total of Php70,450.00 to Spouses Dulay for the processing of her employment in South Korea. In Crim. Case Nos. T-4200[48] and T-4223,[49] Shielyn testified that Spouses Dulay personally visited her to offer employment in South Korea for a placement fee of Php180,000.00. On March 30, 2006, she paid an initial processing fee of Php30,000.00 to Spouses Marzan. Marlon issued her a receipt. Thereafter, Spouses Dulay, Marlon, and Spouses Marzan accompanied her to Malate, Manila for medical examination. [50] On April 23, 2006, Shielyn paid another Php30,000.00 to Spouses Marzan. Marlon issued a receipt for this amount. [51] Shielyn also paid the following though she was not issued any receipts: Php5,000.00 as training fee, Php2,600.00 as medical fee, Php350.00 for a jacket, Php1,500.00 for Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) fee, and Php1,000.00 as insurance. Per her testimony, she paid a total of Php70,450.00 for the processing of her supposed employment in South Korea. [52] But she was not deployed to South Korea, hence, she filed a complaint against the accused before the NBI. She also discovered that the accused were not licensed to deploy workers abroad per DOLE Certification. [53] In his Complaint-Affidavit[54] dated September 13, 2006, Nelson Compay ( Nelson )[55] claimed to have paid Php69,850.00[56] for his supposed employment in South Korea. In Crim. Case Nos. T-4200[57] and T-4223,[58] Nelson testified that on May 20, 2006, at San Nicolas, Pangasinan, he paid Php30,000.00 to Irene who turned over the same to Marlon who then issued him a receipt. Bal and Spouses Dulay were also present at that time. On May 28, 2006, he paid another Php30,000.00, this time, to Fely. According to Fely, Irene will issue the receipt. [59] Nelson also paid Fely Php3,500.00 as medical fee, Php1,000.00 for insurance, and Php350.00 for uniform. [60] With regard to the Php5,000.00 training fee, Marlon issued a Philippine Academy for Career and Technology Incorporated Receipt dated May 15, 2006 for a training slot in Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) Manila. Per his testimony, he paid Php68,850,00 for the processing of his application for overseas employment. [61] Nelson was not able to work abroad though. He discovered that Marlon and Alex absconded with the money that he and his co-applicants paid. They (Nelson and his co-applicants) proceeded to the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) and learned that Alex was not even an employee there. Consequently, they filed the complaint before the NBI Dagupan. [62] In her Complaint-Affidavit[63] dated September 4, 2006, Vilma Serquiña ( Vilma )[64] claimed to have paid a total of Php116,000.00 as placement and processing fee for her employment in South Korea. In Crim. Case Nos. T-4200[65] and T-4231,[66] Vilma testified that on May 25, 2006, she paid Php20,000.00 to Fely at the latter's residence[67] for her application for employment abroad. On August 2, 2006, she paid Php30,000.00 but, this time, to Irene at her residence,[68] who also issued a corresponding receipt. Aside from these amounts, she also paid the following to Fely: Php40,000.00 as medical examination fee at Lucas Medical Center, Php26,000.00 for training, other medical fees, transportation fees, and a jacket. She repeatedly asked Fely for a receipt but was not given any. Per her testimony, she paid Php116,000.00 for her overseas employment. [69] Consequently, Vilma discovered that she was defrauded by Irene. She then went to the NBI to file a complaint. [70] In her Complaint-Affidavit[71] dated September 13, 2006, Priscilla Tambo ( Priscilla )[72] claimed to Have paid a total of Php71,000.00 to Spouses Dulay for the latter's offer of employment in South Korea. [73] In Crim. Case Nos. T-4200[74] and T-4223,[75] Priscilla testified that on June 21, 2006, Spouses Dulay recruited her for overseas employment in South Korea as factory worker. They then introduced her to Irene. After a week, she initially paid Php35,000.00 to Apolonio. For the second payment, she paid Php30,000.00 to Fely. Only a receipt for Php60,000.00 as processing fees was issued to her. Other payments to Irene and Fely such as Php5,000.00 as training fee, Php3,000.00 as medical fee, Php2,800.00 for passport, Php1,000.00 as OWWA fee, and Php350.00 for a jacket were not issued any receipt. She also went to Manila to attend a Pre-Departure Orientation Seminar. [76] Per her testimony, she paid Php77,150.00 for the processing of her application for overseas employment. She was never deployed overseas as promised. In his Complaint-Affidavit[77] dated September 13, 2006, Nathaniel dela Cruz ( Nathaniel )[78] claimed to have paid Php71,350.00[79] for the processing of his overseas employment in South Korea. Nathaniel testified in Crim. Case Nos. T-4200[80] and T-4225[81] that Fely introduced him to Irene who, at that time, was recruiting for overseas work in South Korea. Irene then instructed him, together with 15 other applicants, to prepare a placement fee of Php60,000.00. On April 6, 2006, while in Manila, Nathaniel paid Irene Php30,000.00. On April 23, 2006, this time in Pangasinan, he paid another Php30,000.00 to her. Aside from these, he also paid Php11,350.00 for Korean language training fees, medical fee, OWWA fee, and a jacket. He asked for a receipt but was not given any. Irene even took his passport and never returned it. Per his testimony, he paid Php71,350.00 for the processing of his application for overseas employment. When Nathaniel discovered that he got defrauded, and that Spouses Marzan, Spouses Dulay, Marlon, and Alex were not actually authorized to conduct recruitment activities per DOLE Certification, he immediately filed a complaint before the NBI Dagupan. [82] By his Complaint-Affidavit dated June 19, 2007, Remo Pontanos ( Remo ),[83] declared[84] that he paid Irene Php70,000.00 for prospective employment in South Korea. [85] Remo also testified that he found out about Spouses Marzan through his friends who previously applied for jobs overseas. [86] Intent on seeking greener pastures, he went to Barangay Casantamaria-an some time in February 2006 and told Irene that he too wanted to work abroad. [87] Irene and Bal went to Barangay Cabangaran, San Quintin, Pangasinan and offered him work in South Korea. [88] Irene told him she would process his papers, such as his NBI Clearance and passport. [89] Irene will handle his training for Korean and his medical examination. [90] Remo gave Spouses Marzan and Marlon a total of Php70,000.00 as placement fee. [91] As proof, he presented two (2) receipts issued by Irene for Php35,000.00 each, dated April 23, 2006 and July 31, 2006, respectively. [92] He delivered his second payment on July 31, 2006 based on Irene's representations that his flight will be on August 2006. [93] On the day of his supposed departure, Remo found his companions crying because they were unable to go abroad[94] since Irene and her cohorts did not show up. [95] When he called Irene, she responded that she was in Urdaneta and that he should not panic. Afterwards, Irene went into hiding. [96] Per his testimony, he paid Php70,000.00 for his application for overseas employment. By Joint Complaint-Affidavit dated June 19, 2007, Evita Tome ( Evita )[97] declared[98] that she paid Irene Php45,000.00 for prospective employment in Korea. [99] Evita also testified that Spouses Marzan and Marlon (whom Spouses Marzan introduced as their secretary),[100] went to her house sometime in February 2006 because Irene was recruiting persons who wished to work abroad. [101] Irene also went to her cousin and neighbors to recruit them. [102] When Spouses Marzan learned she was interested, they told her to prepare Php30,000.00 as initial payment and go to Manila for her medical examination. [103] While they were all together in Ermita, Manila, Spouses Marzan told Evita to hand in the Php30,000.00 to Marlon[104] for her medical examination and seminar. [105] She also paid Php15,000.00 to Marlon in the presence of Spouses Marzan. [106] Evita presented two receipts issued by Marlon, one for Php30,000.00 dated March 20, 2006 and another for Php15,000.00 dated April 23, 2006. As for the remaining Php25,000.00, Irene gave her a piece of paper, with the promise that she (Irene) would issue an official receipt. [107] But she was never given that receipt. [108] In total, she gave Spouses Marzan and Marlon Php70,000.00 for his supposed employment in South Korea. [109] In her Complaint-Affidavit dated September 13, 2006, Cherry Lyn Doton ( Cherry ),[110] declared[111] that she paid Php75,150.00 to Spouses Marzan, Marlon, and Fely in consideration of her prospective employment in South Korea. [112] Cherry testified that Fely introduced her to Spouses Marzan and Marlon who were supposedly recruiting for overseas employment. [113] Spouses Marzan told her that a placement fee of Php60,000.00 was needed to deploy her abroad. [114] Thus, she gave Php30,000.00 to Irene in the house of Fely. Subsequently, Marlon issued her a receipt dated May 20, 2006. [115] On a later date, she gave Spouses Marzan another Php30,000.00, but no receipt was issued because Marlon was not present. [116] Cherry also testified that she paid Php5,000.00 as training fee, Php3,500.00 as medical fee, Php2,800.00 for her passport, Php2,000.00 for processing of her National Statistics Office (NSO) documents, and Php350.00 for her jacket, and an indefinite amount for Medicare. [117] Per her testimony, she paid a total of Php73,650.00 for the processing of her employment abroad. Despite these payments, Chery's application for employment abroad proved futile because Spouses Marzan and Marlon absconded with her money. [118] In his Complaint-Affidavit dated September 14, 2006, Mariano Miranda, Jr., ( Mariano )[119] declared[120] that he paid Php100,000.00 for prospective employment in South Korea. [121] Mariano testified that Irene recruited him for work in South Korea while he was in the house of Fely. [122] Irene told him to pay Php30,000.00 as down payment. He complied, and Marlon furnished him a receipt dated March 30, 2006. [123] Then, Irene told him to go to Manila for a Pre-Departure Orientation Seminar (PDOS). [124] In Manila, Mariano gave Irene another Php30,000.00, covered by a receipt dated April 23, 2006, issued by Marlon. [125] While in Manila he also spent Php7,000.00 for two rounds of medical examinations. [126] He spent another Php5,000.00 for a seminar. He also testified that he spent an unspecified amount for his jacket and for transportation costs to Manila. As with the others, he was unable to go abroad. [127] Per his testimony, he paid Php72,000.00 for his application for employment abroad. In his Complaint-Affidavit[128] dated September 4, 2006, Rene Alagano ( Rene ),[129] declared that he paid[130] a placement fee of Php75,000.00 for prospective employment as a factory worker in South Korea. [131] Rene also testified that he applied for a job abroad because his mother wanted him to have a better life. [132] Consequently, he paid Php60,000.00 to Fely in consideration of prospective overseas employment. [133] Nevertheless, it was Irene who introduced him to Fely as a recruiter. It was also Fely who issued the temporary receipt dated June 20, 2008. [134] Rene also claimed that he spent Php3,500.00 for his medical examination, Php2,500.00 for the OWWA and medicare, and Php3,500.00 for his jacket. These transactions, however, were not c",,,
"vered by receipts.""","Ruling of the Regional Trial Court By Decision[200] dated August 16, 2010, trial court ordained: WHEREFORE, the Court hereby finds the following: In Criminal Case No. 4200, accused Irene Marzan and Fely Dulay GUILTY of Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale and are accordingly sentenced to each suffer Life Imprisonment, and to pay a fine to the government in the amount of Php500,000.00; In Criminal Case No. 4273, accused Irene Marzan GUILTY of Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale, and is sentenced to suffer Life Imprisonment, and to pay a fine to the government in the amount of Php500,000.00; In Criminal Case Nos. 4373 and 4401, accused Irene Marzan GUILTY of Simple Illegal Recruitment and is sentenced to suffer in each case a prison term of six (6) years and one (1) day of prision correccional , as minimum, to twelve (12) years of prision mayor , as maximum, and to pay a fine Php200,000.00.

BJMP Tayug is directed to forthwith release Bal Marzan and Apolonio Dulay upon receipt of a copy of this [D]ecision. The cases against Marlon Agoncillo and Alejandro Navarro[, Jr.] are ordered archived. SO ORDERED. [201] The trial court found the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses to be credible and positive, thus, deserving of full faith and credit. [202] Against their credible and positive testimonies, the denial of appellant must crumble. [203] The elements of illegal recruitment in large scale and the elements of estafa by false pretenses were duly established in these cases. [204] The trial court, however, acquitted Apolonio and Bal for the prosecution's failure to establish with clarity their participation in the recruitment of complainants. The trial court awarded the following amounts to complainants as actual damages based on the receipts presented by the prosecution: Criminal Case No. Complainant Amount T-4203 Armando Hidalgo Php30,000.00 T-4207 Cholin Pinto Php 30,000.00 T-4219 Catherine Gatchalion Php 30,000.00 T-4221 Mary Charmy Mariano Php 30,000.00 T-4223 Nelson Compay Priscilla Tambo Shielyn Framil Php 30,000.00 Php 60,000.00 Php 60,000.00 T-4225 Nathaniel dela Cruz Php 60,000.00 T-4227 Mariano Miranda Php 60,000.00 T-4231 Vilma Serquiña Rene Alagano Php 30,000.00 Php 60,000.00 The trial court though, noted that there was a supposed duplicity of offenses in Criminal Case Nos. T-4223 and T-4231 which should have been a ground for the quashal of the Informations. Particularly, it observed that there were three complainants (Nelson, Priscilla, and Shielyn) in Crim. Case No. T-4223, and same number of complainants (Vilma, Rene, and Robert) in Crim. Case No. T-4231. Since the accused failed to timely object thereto, they were deemed to have waived the same, hence, the court could convict them for as many offenses as charged and proved. [205] Based on the evidence presented, therefore, the accused should be held liable for three counts (Nelson, Priscilla, and Shielyn) of estafa in Crim. Case No. T-4223, and two counts of estafa (Vilma and Rene) in Crim. Case No. T-4231. [206] Meanwhile, in Criminal Case Nos. T-4373 and T-4401, appellant was only held liable for Simple Illegal Recruitment since according to the trial court, only Aristotle was the subject of recruitment in the first case; and only Remo and Evita in the second case. [207] It was also proved that Remo paid a total of Php70,000.00 to Irene, thus, the same amount should be paid back to him as actual damages. [208] Finally, appellant was acquitted in Criminal Case Nos. T-4201, T-4205, T-4229, T-4233, T-4272, and T-4372 as the trial court found that the element of damage capable of pecuniary estimation caused to the offended parties was absent. [209] Ruling of the Court of Appeals By Decision[210] dated October 26, 2015, the Court of Appeals affirmed in the main but increased the fine imposed in Crim. Case Nos. T-4200 and T-4273, thus: WHEREFORE, the instant appeal of accused-appellants Irene Marzan and Fely Dulay is DENIED. The Decision dated August 16, 2010 of the RTC, Branch 52 of Tayug, Pangasinan in Criminal Case Nos. T-4200, T-4219, T-4221, T-4223, T-4225, T-4201, T-4203, T-4205, T-4207, T-4227, T-4229, T-4231, T-4233, T-4272, T-4372, T-4273, T-4373 and T-4401 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATIONS to read as follows: 1.

SO ORDERED. [211] In the illegal recruitment cases, the appellate court affirmed the finding of the trial court that appellant gave the impression to complainants that she had the authority to recruit workers for overseas employment despite not being duly authorized by law. [212] It also sustained the credibility of the positive and categorical testimonies of the prosecution witnesses that: (1) they personally met appellant; and (2) appellant promised them an employment abroad, encouraged them to apply therefor, provided them copies of job orders, and received placement fees, training fees, medical examination fees and other fees from them. [213] In the estafa cases, the appellate court ruled that the prosecution was able to establish that appellant acted in conspiracy with her co-accused Marlon and Alex to mislead complainants into believing that they, in exchange for payment of various fees, could deploy them for employment abroad. As a consequence of appellant's false pretenses, complainants suffered damages for their failed overseas employment and for the fees they paid and could no longer recover. [214] Appellant's bare denial cannot prevail over the positive testimonies of the prosecution witnesses. [215] The Court of Appeals modified the imposed fine from Php500,000.00 to Php1,000,000.00 in Criminal Case Nos. T-4200 and T-4273 considering that appellant and her co-accused were non-licensees or non-holders of authority to engage in the recruitment of workers. [216] By Certification dated October 26, 2015, the appellate court noted that Fely no longer filed reconsideration nor filed a petition to the Supreme Court. [217] The assailed Decision dated October 26, 2015, therefore, attained finality insofar as Fely was concerned.","In Criminal Case Nos. T-4200, T- 4273, T-4373, and T-4401, appellant is guilty of illegal recruitment. Illegal recruitment, when undertaken by a non-licensee or non-holder of authority as contemplated under Article 13(f)[220] (now Article 38) of the Labor Code (Renumbered), shall mean any act of canvassing, enlisting, contracting, transporting, utilizing, hiring, procuring workers, and including referring, contract services, promising, or advertising for employment abroad, whether for profit or not. [221] Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale, on the other hand, is defined under Section 6 of Republic Act ( RA ) No. 8042, thus: Section 6. Definition. - For purposes of this Act, illegal recruitment shall mean any act of canvassing, enlisting, contracting, transporting, utilizing, hiring, or procuring workers and includes referring, contact services, promising or advertising for employment abroad, whether for profit or not, when undertaken by a non-licensee or non-holder of authority contemplated under Article 13(f) of Presidential Decree No. 442, as amended, otherwise known as the Labor Code of the Philippines: Provided , that any such non-licensee or non-holder who, in any manner, offers or promises for a fee employment abroad to two or more persons shall be deemed so engaged. It shall likewise include the following acts, whether committed by any person, whether a non-licensee, non-holder, licensee or holder of authority: xxx Illegal recruitment is deemed committed by a syndicate if carried out by a group of three (3) or more persons conspiring or confederating with one another. It is deemed committed in large scale if committed against three (3) or more persons individually or as a group . (Emphasis and underscoring supplied) To sustain a conviction for illegal recruitment in large scale, the following elements must concur: ( a ) the offender has no valid license or authority to enable him or her to lawfully engage in recruitment and placement of workers; ( b ) he or she undertakes any of the activities within the meaning of ""recruitment and placement"" under Article 13(b) of the Labor Code or any prohibited practices enumerated under Article 34 of the Labor Code (now Section 6[222] of RA 8042); and ( c ) he or she commits the same against three or more persons, individually or as a group. Illegal recruitment when committed by a syndicate or in large scale shall be considered an offense involving economic sabotage. [223] As uniformly ruled by the trial court and the appellate court, these elements are all present in this case. First, per DOLE Certification dated August 25, 2006, appellant was not authorized nor licensed to conduct recruitment activities for overseas employment. [224] Second, despite lack of authority or license, appellant and Fely conducted recruitment and placement activities. They offered and promised to deploy complainants in South Korea for employment. In exchange, they collected placement, training fees, and other fees despite not being authorized to do so. Indubitably, these are prohibited activities within the purview of Article 13(b)[225] (now Article 38) of the Labor Code (Renumbered) and Section 6 of RA 8042. Appellant, nonetheless, insists she and her husband Bal were merely implicated in these cases upon the suggestion of an NBI agent. She manifested that Marlon was a regular customer in her carinderia. Apart from using her carinderia as a meet-up place for Marlon and the applicants, she only took favors from complainants who lived in far areas to hand over the fees to Marlon. She issued receipts, as complainants requested, but she never had a hand in the recruitment process. The Court is not convinced. The lower courts uniformly found that appellant conspired together with Fely, Alex, and Marlon to generate a systematic scheme to prey on innocent people like herein complainants who seek overseas employment, viz. : One, Fely scouted for and recruited prospective applicants for supposed employment in South Korea; Two, appellant collected placement and other fees from these applicants; Three, Marlon acted as the pseudo- speaker who convinced the applicants to secure their services and provided them the supposed list of requirements, including the payment of placement and other fees. He also issued the receipts therefor; and Finally, it was Alex who served as the ""boss"" of the group. Evidently, these four accused were impelled by one common objective – to milk out money from innocent applicants by foisting lies to them regarding their supposed ability and authority to deploy them for overseas employment in South Korea in exchange for payment of certain amounts of money. In conspiracy, the act of one is the act of all. The precise extent or modality of participation of each of them becomes secondary since all the conspirators are principals. [226] In People v. Vicente , [227] the Court found that Vicente's synchronized action with Minnie indubitably showed they acted in conspiracy with each other to obtain a common objective: to recruit complainants for employment abroad despite not being authorized to do so. There, Vicente was physically present in the agency's office when: (1) Minnie convinced therein complainants to apply for employment abroad; (2) complainants paid Minnie for the supposed employment; (3) Minnie issued receipts for the payments received from complainants; and (4) complainants signed their employment contracts. Vicente also conducted seminars for complainants' pre-deployment where he talked about the living conditions in Japan and answered questions from the applicants. Like Vicente , appellant here was not an innocent bystander. Not only did she know about Marlon's repeated acts of recruitment, she herself participated therein by collecting placement fees and issuing receipts therefor. Third. These prohibited practices were committed against three (3) or more persons. Specifically, there were more or less 30 complainants altogether, albeit only 22 of them testified. Appellant is therefore guilty of Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale under Section 6, RA 8042 in Crim. Case Nos. T-4200 and T-4273. In Crim. Case Nos. T-4373 and T-4401, however, appellant is only guilty of Simple Illegal Recruitment. While all the elements of Illegal Recruitment under Section 6 of RA 8042 are present in these cases, the offense was committed only against one complainant, Aristotle in Crim. Case No. T-4374; and against two complainants, Remo and Evita in Crim. Case No. T-4401. In Criminal Case Nos. T-4203, T-4207, T-4219, T-4221, T-4223, T-4225, T-4227, and T-4231, appellant is also guilty of estafa under Art 315(2)(a). Appellant, for the same acts, may be convicted separately for illegal recruitment under RA 8042 and estafa under Article 315(2)(a) of Revised Penal Code ( RPC ). People v. Daud [228] is apropos : In this jurisdiction, it is settled that a person who commits illegal recruitment may be charged and convicted separately of illegal recruitment under the Labor Code and estafa under par. 2(a) of Art. 315 of the Revised Penal Code. The offense of illegal recruitment is malum prohibitum where the criminal intent of the accused is not necessary for conviction, while estafa is malum in se where the criminal intent of the accused is crucial for conviction. Conviction for offenses under the Labor Code does not bar conviction for offenses punishable by other laws. Conversely, conviction for estafa under par. 2(a) of Art. 315 of the Revised Penal Code does not bar a conviction for illegal recruitment under the Labor Code. It follows that one's acquittal of the crime of estafa will not necessarily result in his acquittal of the crime of illegal recruitment in large scale, and vice versa. [229] More, Article 315, paragraph 2(a) of the RPC states: Art. 315. Swindling (estafa). - Any person who shall defraud another by any of the means mentioned hereinbelow xxxx: xxx 2. By means of any of the following false pretenses or fraudulent acts executed prior to or simultaneously with the commission of the fraud: (a) By using a fictitious name, or falsely pretending to possess power, influence, qualifications, property, credit, agency, business[,] or imaginary transactions; or by means of other similar deceits. To sustain a conviction for estafa by means of false pretenses or deceit, the following elements must concur: (a) There must be a false pretense or fraudulent representation as to his power, influence, qualifications, property, credit, agency, business or imaginary transactions; (b) such false pretense or fraudulent representation was made or executed prior to or simultaneously with the commission of the fraud; (c) the offended party relied on the false pretense, fraudulent act, or fraudulent means and was induced to part with his money or property; and (d) as a result thereof, the offended party suffered damage. [230] Again, these elements are all present here. The same pieces of evidence which establish appellant's liability for illegal recruitment in large scale likewise confirm her culpability for estafa. [231] One, appellant falsely and fraudulently represented that she, together with her co-conspirators, possessed the authority to engage in recruitment and placement activities. They promised complainants overseas employment in South Korea in exchange for the payment of placement and other fees. They did so knowing full well that they were not authorized or licensed to do so. Two, such false pretense and fraudulent representation was made or executed prior to or simultaneously with the commission of the fraud. Three, it was appellant's and her co-conspirators' false and fraudulent representations which induced complainants to part with their hard-earned money as payment for the supposed placement and other fees. They believed appellants' deceit and held on to the latter's promise to deploy them for work abroad. Finally, the victims were not able to leave for work abroad nor get back their money. The Court, in People v. Estrada , [232] sustained Estrada's conviction for three counts of estafa under Article 315 par. 2(a) concurrent with her culpability for illegal recruitment in large scale. The Court ratiocinated – she falsely represented herself as possessing power to deploy persons for overseas placement. By these pretenses, Estrada deceived therein private complainants into believing that she would provide them their desired jobs in Dubai. This active representation of having the capacity to deploy the private complainants abroad despite not having the authority or license to do so from the POEA constituted deceit. More, because of her assurances, the private complainants parted with their money to pay Estrada the various fees which they thought were necessary for their deployment abroad resulting in damage to each of the private complainants. So must it be. In another vein, the Court notes that except for Crim Case Nos. T-4203[233] and T-4207,[234] each of the other Informations charged more than one count of estafa, viz. : Crim Case No. Complainant/s Count/s T-4203[235] Estafa under Article 315, par. 2(a) of the RPC against Irene Marzan, Bal Marzan, Alejandro Navarro, and Marlon Agoncillo Armando Hidalgo One T-4207[236] Estafa under Article 315, par. 2(a) of the RPC against Irene Marzan, Bal Marzan, Alejandro Navarro, and Marlon Agoncillo Cholin T. Pinto One T-4219[237] Estafa under Article 315, par. 2(a) of the RPC against Irene Marzan, Bal Marzan, Alejandro Navarro, Marlon Agoncillo, Fely Dulay, and Apolonio Dulay Marcus D. Gruspe Did not testify Catherine Gatchalion Two Alex P. Doton, Jr. T-4221[238] Estafa under Article 315, par. 2(a) of the RPC against Irene Marzan, Bal Marzan, Alejandro Navarro, Marlon Agoncillo, Fely Dulay, and Apolonio Dulay Juanito N. Sebastian Did not testify Sherene A. Mensalvas Mary Charmy C. Mariano Three Joel C. Bartolome Cherry Lyn C. Doton T-4223[239] Estafa under Article 315, par. 2(a) of the RPC against Irene Marzan, Bal Marzan, Alejandro Navarro, Marlon Agoncillo, Fely Dulay, and Apolonio Dulay Nelson S. Compay Three Priscilla P. Tambo Shielyn A. Framil T-4225[240] Estafa under Article 315, par. 2(a) of the RPC against Irene Marzan, Bal Marzan, Alejandro Navarro, Marlon Agoncillo, Fely Dulay, and Apolonio Dulay Romar R. Marzan Did not testify Sofronio J. Luzano, Jr. Two Nathaniel P. Dela Cruz T-4227[241] Estafa under Article 315, par. 2(a) of the RPC against Irene Marzan, Bal Marzan, Alejandro Navarro, and Marlon Agoncillo Daisy S. Desisto, Jr. Did not testify Romeo V. Miranda Mariano V. Miranda One T-4231[242] Estafa under Article 315, par. 2(a) of the RPC against Irene Marzan, Bal Marzan, Alejandro Navarro, and Marlon Agoncillo Robert R. Nuñez Did not testify Rene P. Alagano Two Vilma R. Serquiña Appellant did not move to quash the aforesaid Informations on the ground of duplicity of offense pursuant to Section 9, Rule 117 of the Rules of Court, viz. : Section 9. Failure to Move to Quash or to Allege Any Ground Therefor. — The failure of the accused to assert any ground of a motion to quash before he pleads to the complaint or information, either because he did not file a motion to quash or failed to allege the same in said motion, shall be deemed a waiver of any objections except those based on the grounds provided for in paragraphs (a), (b), (g), and (i) of Section 3 of this Rule. Consequently, appellant is deemed to have waived the defect in the Informations and to have understood the acts imputed therein. [243] Appellant, therefore, may be convicted of as many offenses as were charged and proved, and impose on her the penalty for each offense, setting out separately the findings of fact and law in each offense in accordance with Sec. 3, Rule 120 of the Rules of Court, viz. : Section 3. Judgment for two or more offenses. — When two or more offenses are charged in a single complaint or information but the accused fails to object to it before trial, the court may convict him of as many offenses as are charged and proved, and impose on him the penalty for each offense, setting out separately the findings of fact and law in each offense. (3a) Suffice it to state that the series of acts committed against the complainants was not the product of a single criminal intent. The misrepresentation or deceit was employed against each complainant on different dates. Hence, they originated from separate criminal intents and consequently resulted in separate felonies. [244] Speaking through the esteemed then Associate Justice Florenz Regalado, the Court, in Ilagan v. Court of Appeals , [245] ratiocinated: The series of acts committed against the seven lot buyers was not the product of a single criminal intent. The misrepresentation or deceit was employed against each lot buyer on different dates and in separate places, hence they originated from separate criminal intents and consequently resulted in separate felonies. Furthermore, even assuming arguendo that the defraudations were pursuant to an identical design, they were committed over a period of about one and a half years and at substantial intervals both in time and in distance of situs. More conclusive is the fact that, after the commission of one estafa, the accused could not have had the foreknowledge as to when or whether they could replicate the same felony against another victim still necessarily unknown. This lack of prevision on their part definitely proves that the criminal intent entailed in a preceding swindle could not operate as the same criminal intent in futuro as regards another subsequent estafa. The inescapable conclusion is that, all told, a total of eight crimes of estafa were actually committed by the accused against different victims. [246] So must it be. Penalties Appellant committed illegal recruitment in 2006. The applicable penalties, therefore, are those provided under RA 8042 prior to its amendment by RA 10022 in 2010. In Criminal Case Nos. T-4200 and T-4273 for Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale, appellant, a non-licensee or non-holder of authority, who committed illegal recruitment constituting economic sabotage was properly sentenced to life imprisonment in accordance with Section 7(b) of RA 8042, viz. : SECTION 7. Penalties. — (a) Any person found guilty of illegal recruitment shall suffer the penalty of imprisonment of not less than six (6) years and one (1) day but not more than twelve (12) years and a fine of not less than Two hundred thousand pesos (P200,000.00) nor more than Five hundred thousand pesos (P500,000.00). (b) The penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of not less than Five hundred thousand pesos (P500,000.00) nor more than One million pesos (P1,000,000.00) shall be imposed if illegal recruitment constitutes economic sabotage as defined herein. (Emphasis supplied) Provided, however, That the maximum penalty shall be imposed if the person illegally recruited is less than eighteen (18) years of age or committed by a non-licensee or non-holder of authority. [247] Considering the number of innocent victims that appellant and her cohorts preyed on, the appellate court correctly increased the imposed fine from Php500,000.00 to Php1,000.000.00 for each case. Notably though, both the trial court and the appellate court declined to indemnify complainants Dante and Arleen in Crim. Case No. T-4200; and Arnulfo and Everlina in Crim Case No. T-4273 on the ground that their respective payments were not covered by receipts. We disagree. The recruiter's failure to issue receipts should not be taken against complainants. The absence of receipts in a case for illegal recruitment is not fatal if the prosecution is able to establish through credible testimonial evidence that appellant has engaged in illegal recruitment. The case is proved not by the issuance or signing of receipts for placement fees, but by engagement in recruitment activities without the necessary license or authority. [248] People v. Alvarez [249] is instructive: We disagree. The Court has already ruled that the absence of receipts in a case for illegal recruitment is not fatal, as long as the prosecution is able to establish through credible testimonial evidence that accused-appellant has engaged in illegal recruitment. Such case is made, not by the issuance or the signing of receipts for placement fees, but by engagement in recruitment activities without the necessary license or authority. In People v. Pabalan , the Court held that the absence of receipts for some of the amounts delivered to the accused did not mean that the appellant did not accept or receive such payments. Neither in the Statute of Frauds nor in the rules of evidence is presentation of receipts required in order to prove the existence of a recruitment agreement and the procurement of fees in illegal recruitment cases. Such proof may come from the testimonies of witnesses. [250] Thus, in Crim. Case No. T-4200, actual damages of Php70,000.00 should be awarded as well to Dante; in Crim. Case No. T-4200, Php72,000.00 to Arlene; and in Crim. Case No. T-4273, Php80,000.00 to Arnulfo, and Php50,000.00 to Everlina. In People v. Rios , [251] the Court affirmed the conviction of Isabel Rios for large scale illegal recruitment and awarded actual damages representing the supposed placement fee paid by complainant despite the absence of receipts. Notably, Article 2177[252] of the Civil Code proscribes a party from recovering twice for the act or omission of a defendant. The awards in favor of complainants Cholin T. Pinto, Catherine Gatchalion, Alex P. Doton, Jr., Mary Charmy Mariano, Joel C. Bartolome, Cherry Lyn Doton, Vilma R. Serquiña, Rene P. Alagano, Nelson S. Compay, Priscilla D. Tambo, Shielyn A. Framil, Sofornio J. Luzano, Jr., Nathaniel P. Dela Cruz in the estafa cases, therefore, preclude them from recovering the same amounts in the illegal recruitment cases. In Crim. Case Nos. 4373 and 4401 for Simple Illegal Recruitment, the appellate court correctly imposed the fine of Php500,000.00 pursuant Section 7 (a) of RA 8042. SECTION 7. Penalties. — (a) Any person found guilty of illegal recruitment shall suffer the penalty of imprisonment of not less than six (6) years and one (1) day but not more than twelve (12) years and a fine of not less than Two hundred thousand pesos (Php200,000.00) nor more than Five hundred thousand pesos (Php500,000.00). xxxx Now as for the penalty, following People v. Vicente, [253] appellant should be sentenced to an indeterminate sentence of ten (10) years and one (1) day, as minimum, to twelve (12) years, as maximum. In addition to the award of Php70,000.00 to Remo Pontanos in Crim. Case No. T-4401, the Court also awards Php70,000.00 to Evita Tome, and Php 74,850.00 to Aristotle De Vera in accordance with People v. Rios . [254] Since these complainants are only involved in the illegal recruitment cases in Crim. Case Nos. T-4373 and T-4401, and not in the estafa cases, there can be no double recovery of damages to speak of. As for the crime of estafa in Crim. Case Nos. T-4203, T-4207, T-4219, T-4221, T-4223, T-4225, T-4227, T-4231, we reckon with the amended penalties in RA 10951[255] viz. : Section 85. Article 315 of the same Act, as amended by Republic Act No. 4885, Presidential Decree No. 1689, and Presidential Decree No. 818, is hereby further amended to read as follows: Art. 315. Swindling (estafa). — Any person who shall defraud another by any of the means mentioned herein below shall be punished by: xxx 3rd. The penalty of arresto mayor in its maximum period to prision correccional in its minimum period, if such amount is over Forty thousand pesos (Php40,000) but does not exceed One million two hundred thousand pesos (Php1,200,000). (Emphases supplied) xxx Considering that the amount of fraud in each estafa case here does not exceed Php1,200,000.00, the imposable penalty is arresto mayor in its maximum period to prision correccional in its minimum period, which has a range of four (4) months and one (1) day to two (2) years and four (4) months. Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the minimum penalty shall be within the range of the penalty next lower to that prescribed for the offense. Since the penalty prescribed by law for the crime of estafa against appellant is arresto mayor in its maximum period to prision correccional in its minimum period, the penalty next lower would then be arresto mayor in its minimum to medium periods. Thus, the minimum term of the indeterminate sentence should be taken anywhere from one (1) month and one (1) day to four (4) months. The penalty that may be imposed for the crime of estafa in this case, therefore, is anywhere from one (1) month and one (1) day to four (4) months, for the minimum period, and ranging from six (6) months and one (1) day to two (2) years and four (4) months for the maximum period. [256] In Rosero v. People [257] where the amount of fraud involved was also below the threshold of Php1,200,000.00 (Php274,020.00), the Court sentenced therein appellant to two (2) months and one (1) day of arresto mayor , as minimum, to one (1) year and one (1) day of prision correccional, as maximum. We impose the same penalty on appellant for each estafa case charged and proved. We also award the following actual damages to the complainants concerned: Crim Case No. Complainant/s Amount Paid Crim. Case Nos.

"G.R. No. 202131, September 21, 2022","ABS-CBN IJM WORKERS UNION, PETITIONER, VS. ABS-CBN CORPORATION, RESPONDENT.","Respondent ABS-CBN Corporation, formerly ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation ( ABS-CBN ), is a domestic corporation, principally engaged in the business of broadcasting television and radio content in the Philippines.[7] Sometime in 2002, ABS-CBN adopted the Internal Job Market System ( IJM ), a database which provides a list of accredited technical or creative manpower, and/or talents who offer their services for a fee. Found in the database, among other things, are the competency rating of the technical manpower and their corresponding professional rates.[8] Workers in ABS-CBN who have been hired through the IJM system ( IJM workers ) include Electronic Field Production Camera Personnel, Studio Camera Personnel, OB Van Operators, Technical Directors, Light Operators, Video Engineers, Video Editors, Compositing Artists, VTR Personnel, Audio Personnel, Audio Engineers,[9] Crane Operators and Drivers.[10] Together, IJM workers formed the AIWU. AIWU is registered with the Department of Labor under NCR-QCFOO-UR-06-005-09.[11] On November 23, 2009, AIWU, through its president, Antonio B. S. Perez, filed a Petition[12] before the Bureau of Labor Relations ( the Bureau ), praying for the conduct of a certification election among IJM workers.[13] AIWU alleged that it seeks to represent 1,101 employees from the IJM work pool and be certified as their exclusive bargaining agent. ... In response, ABS-CBN filed a Comment[15] dated December 18, 2009, which sought the denial of AIWU's petition on the ground that there was no employer-employee relationship between the company and IJM workers. ... After the parties submitted their respective memoranda, the Mediator-Arbiter issued the Order[21] dated April 14, 2010, denying the petition for certification election filed by AIWU. The Mediator-Arbiter reasoned that the DOLE is bound to respect the Commission's determination of the status of AIWU members in Payonan and Jalog, even if these cases were pending appeal before the Court of Appeals.[23] Aggrieved, AIWU filed a Notice of Appeal and Memorandum of Appeal[24] with the DOLE Secretary... On August 13, 2010, DOLE Secretary Rosalinda Dimapilis-Baldoz rendered a Decision,[31] ... reversing and setting aside the Order dated 14 April 2010... Accordingly, let the entire records of the case be remanded to DOLE-NCR for the conduct of a certification election among the ABS-CBN IJM Workers...[32] To seek the reversal of the DOLE Secretary's rulings, ABS-CBN elevated the case to the Court of Appeals via a petition for certiorari[37] dated November 15, 2010... Subsequently, the Court of Appeals rendered the assailed Decision,[42] disposing the case as follows: ACCORDINGLY, the petition is GRANTED. The assailed Decision dated August 13, 2010 and Resolution dated October 26, 2010 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. No costs. SO ORDERED.[43] In the assailed Decision, the Court of Appeals ruled that the existence or absence of an employer-employee relationship is a question of fact that requires examination of evidentiary matters within the competence and primary jurisdiction of the labor arbiter and the Commission... [44]","This Court resolves the Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court, filed by petitioner ABS-CBN IJM Workers Union ( AIWU ), seeking the reversal of the Decision[2] and the Resolution,[3] both rendered by the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 116883. The Court finds the instant petition meritorious.","Under these parameters, this Court finds the instant petition meritorious. The DOLE Secretary did not commit grave abuse of discretion in resolving the issue of the existence of employer-employee relationship... [T]he med-arbiter has the authority, original and exclusive, to determine the existence of an employer-employee relationship between the parties... and his finding thereon may only be reviewed and reversed by the Secretary of Labor... Furthermore, the DOLE Secretary correctly observed that the Commission's rulings in the Payonan and Jalog cases are not binding on petitioner as these have not yet attained finality when the instant case was pending before the DOLE Secretary. ... Guided by the Labor Code provisions and jurisprudence, We find the DOLE Secretary to have properly exercised her discretion in resolving the issue on the existence of an employer-employee relationship in favor of AIWU. ... The DOLE Secretary did not commit grave abuse of discretion in granting the petition for certification election. ... Aside from being anchored on substantial evidence, the findings of the DOLE Secretary are also consistent with this Court's rulings in Del Rosario, et al v. ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corp., ABS-CBN Corp. v. Concepcion, Gava, et al. v. ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corp., and ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corp. v. Tajanlangit, et al. In all these cases, the Court uniformly declared that IJM workers are regular employees of respondent. ... There being no other ground raised to deny the petition besides the purported absence of employer-employee relations, this Court deems the conduct of certification election among IJM workers proper, in recognition of their right to self-organization and collective bargaining.","ACCORDINGLY, the petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated December 1, 2011 and the Resolution dated May 18, 2012 of the Court of Appeals in G.R. SP No. 116883 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

"G.R. No. 235790, September 21, 2022","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. MONICO D. SANTOS AND FRANCIS H. CANOZA, ACCUSED, MONICO D. SANTOS, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","In an Information, Santos and Canoza were charged with the special complex crime of kidnapping with double homicide. The accusatory portion of the Information reads: That on or about October 17, 2000 in the City of Manila and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring, confederating and mutually helping one another, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously take, carry away, detain and deprive EUNICE KAYE CHUANG, five (5) years old and her ""yaya"" JOVITA ""BIBET"" MONTECINO of their liberty against their will and thereafter brought to a house in Malolos, Bulacan where they were tied together in both hands and feet intertwined with each other with a nylon cord and electric wire, and then placed and left them in the ceiling of the house without food and water and as a result thereof, said EUNICE and JOVITA died of asphyxia by suffocation. CONTRARY TO LAW. Upon arraignment, both Santos and Canoza pleaded not guilty. The prosecution presented evidence showing that Santos, a taxi driver hired by Pwe Eng, was the last person seen with the victims, Eunice (Pwe Eng's granddaughter) and Jovita Montecino (yaya), on October 17, 2000. Pwe Eng saw Santos's cousin, Canoza, board the taxi shortly after. When the victims failed to arrive home, Emily (Eunice's mother) and others located Santos, who claimed the victims were kidnapped at Delpan Bridge, Manila. Santos subsequently accompanied Emily and the Task Force operatives (PC/Insp. Adanglao's team) during an ocular inspection. After tracing the alleged abduction route, Santos insisted that the group check his house in Malolos, Bulacan, saying, ""Sir, kung gusto niyo, para maniwala kayo, tingnan natin ang aming bahay para makita ninyo na wala doon ang mga biktima."" Inside his house, PC/Insp. Adanglao noticed an opening in the ceiling. Despite Santos attempting to deter them, SPO1 Esparcia inspected the ceiling and discovered the lifeless bodies of Eunice and Montecino, hogtied with nylon rope and electrical wire. Santos cried and admitted to abducting them, implicating Canoza: ""dalawa po kami ni Francis ang nagdala diyan."" Postmortem examination confirmed death by asphyxia by suffocation. Dactyloscopy found prints matching Santos and Canoza near the bodies. Canoza was later identified by Pwe Eng as the man who boarded Santos's taxi. The defense raised denial, alibi, and claimed that Santos was subjected to torture, forcing him to admit to the crime, and that the search of his house was illegal as it was conducted without a warrant and counsel was not present during his admissions. Santos also claimed he was acquitted in a related rape case. The trial court rejected the defense's claims, finding Santos guilty of kidnapping with double homicide and Canoza guilty as an accomplice. The Court of Appeals affirmed the RTC judgment but modified the damages awarded.","In its February 10, 2017 Decision, the Court of Appeals upheld the Regional Trial Court's finding that Santos was guilty beyond reasonable doubt of kidnapping with double homicide. It found no reason to reverse the trial court's findings, considering that Santos has not adduced any evidence to show he was physically coerced to make any adverse or demining admission. The dispositive portion of the Decision reads: .... WHEREFORE , all premises considered, the accused MONICO SANTOS y SANTOS is hereby found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Kidnapping with Double Homicide and is sentenced to RECLUSION PERPETUA with all its accessory penalties and without eligibility for parole under Act No. 4103. Accused FRANCIS CANOZA y HERVIAS is likewise found guilty of the said crime as an accomplice and is hereby sentences to intermediate penalty of ten (10) years and one (10) day of PRISION MAYOR as minimum period to fifteen (15) years and six (6) months of RECLUSION TEMPORAL as maximum. In the service of his sentence, he is hereby credited with the number of days he has undergone preventive imprisonment pursuant to Article 29 of the Revised Penal Code. The accused-appellant and accused Canoza are hereby ordered to pay one hundred thousand pesos (P100,000.00) as and by way of moral damages, one hundred thousand pesos (P100,000.00) as and by way of civil indemnity and one hundred thousand pesos (P100,000.00) as and by way of exemplary damages to the heirs of Eunice Kay Chuang and are further ordered to pay the same amounts to the heirs of Jovita 'Bibet' Montecino. Accused-appellant shall further pay interest of six (6%) percent per annum from the date of finality of this judgment until it is fully paid on the amount of damages awarded. .... SO ORDERED. (Emphasis in the original)","This Court dismisses the appeal and affirms the conviction of accused-appellant Monico D. Santos. The Supreme Court ruled that the evidence obtained from the search of Santos's dwelling was admissible because he voluntarily and actively consented to the warrantless search. Accused-appellant did not merely passively consent to a search. Instead, he initiated the re-inspection of his sister's house where he was living to demonstrate that he was not involved in the victims' disappearance. His act of volunteering his house for a search demonstrates his clear intent to waive his constitutional right to be secure against unreasonable searches and seizures. The Court also found the circumstantial evidence sufficient to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt, satisfying the requirements of Rule 133, Section 4 of the Rules of Court. The circumstantial evidence consisted of: (1) The victims were last seen alive in the taxi being driven by accused-appellant. (2) The victims' bodies were found in the ceiling of the house being occupied by accused-appellant alone. (3) Upon the discovery of the victims' bodies in accused-appellant's presence, he exclaimed, ""Buhay pa 'yan!"" (4) Accused-appellant's fingerprints were found around the area where the victims' bodies were found. These circumstances established the component offenses of kidnapping (deprivation of liberty, victims being a minor and female) and homicide (death occurring as a consequence of detention), constituting the special complex crime under Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code.","ACCORDINGLY, the Appeal is DISMISSED. The February 10, 2017 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 07719 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. Accused-appellant Monico D. Santos is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of Kidnapping with Double Homicide and is sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua with all its accessory penalties and without eligibility for parole. Accused-appellant Monico D. Santos and accused Francis H. Canoza are ordered to pay the heirs of Eunice Kaye Chuang and Jovita Montecino civil indemnity, moral damages, temperate damages and exemplary damages worth P100,000.00 each. All damages awarded shall be subject to interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the finality of this Decision until their full satisfaction. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 252986, September 20, 2022","SUNWAY BUILDERS, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON AUDIT AND MUNICIPALITY OF CARRANGLAN, RESPONDENTS.","In 2004, during the term of then-incumbent municipal mayor Luvimindo C. Otic (Mayor Otic), Carranglan, and Sunway, executed a Design-Build-Lease Contract for the construction of the municipality's water supply system. The project was financed through a loan obtained by Carranglan, represented by Mayor Otic, from the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP). Sunway commenced project works on August 8, 2005. The original project completion date was extended from August 4, 2008 to September 2008. However, the project was not completed in full despite the extension. In 2011, Carranglan's Sangguniang Bayan passed a resolution terminating the contract unilaterally. While the project remained unfinished, Sunway insisted that it had accomplished 59% of the project works. Thus, it demanded payment for the work done. However, Carranglan, which was then under the mayorship of Restituto A. Abad, did not heed the demands. Carranglan's non-payment prompted Sunway to file a complaint before the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission (CIAC), docketed as CIAC Case No. 02-2015, demanding the payment of the aggregate amount of P19,819,589.00, broken down as follows: Unpaid accomplishment P18,169,589.00 Attorney's fees 1,650,000.00 Total P19,819,589.00 Carranglan participated in the finalization of the terms of reference and filed an answer to Sunway's complaint after seeking several extensions. However, its representative failed to appear at the hearing scheduled on July 15, 2015. Only a messenger came and submitted a motion requesting to postpone the hearing. The arbitrator denied the motion. Consequently, the hearing and presentation of evidence proceeded without participation from the municipality. The case was then submitted for decision. Ruling of the CIAC In an Award promulgated on August 25, 2015, the CIAC partially granted Sunway's complaint: WHEREFORE, judgement [sic] is hereby rendered in favor of Claimant SUNWAY BUILDERS and against Respondent MUNICIPALITY OF CARRANGLAN in the total amount of EIGHT MILLION THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THREE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN & 17/100 (Php8,353,327.17) Pesos only Philippine Currency, broken down as follows: Unpaid accomplishment Php7,392,793.60 Interest 134,302.17 Retention Money 276,231.40 Attorney's fees 550,000.00 Total Php8,353,327.17 In addition, Respondent CARRANGLAN is directed to reimburse Claimant SUNWAY the cost of arbitration in the amount of Php309,728.84. Upon this award becoming final and executory, interest of six [percent] (6%) per annum shall be further paid to Claimant SUNWAY on the outstanding total amount of P8,353,327.17 from date of this award. After finality thereof, interest at the rate of 12% per annum shall be paid thereon until full payment of the awarded amount shall have been made, this interim period being deemed to be at the time already a forbearance of credit. (Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, et al, 243 SCRA 78 (1994)[)]. SO ORDERED[.] (Emphasis omitted) The CIAC resolved the claim for unpaid work accomplishment as follows: First, the CIAC determined that the correct total project cost was P18,211,760.00 on the basis of the following documents: (a) Sunway-issued Statement of Account and (b) Sunway-issued Request for Payment No. 5 dated September 4, 2007, which was certified and/or approved by selected officials of Carranglan, including: Engineer Cesar Baltazar, Coordinator of the Local Government Unit, Project Management Unit (LGU-PMU), and Mayor Otic. Second, it determined that the correct percentage of completion was 59%. The CIAC gave weight to the following documents: (1) the Letter dated January 13, 2010 written by Mayor Otic and addressed to DBP, asking the latter to pay Sunway an amount representing 59% accomplishment of the total project and (2) the Sunway-issued Statement of Work Accomplished dated April 30, 2008, which was verified true and correct by Engr. Ruel T. Cruz, Coordinator of the LGU-PMU, and approved by Mayor Otic. In brief, the CIAC regarded the parties to have mutually acknowledged the total project cost and percentage completion on account of the above-mentioned correspondences and commercial documents issued, exchanged, and approved between them. Third, the adjusted balance of unpaid work accomplishment and Total Award amounting to P7,392,793.60 was computed as follows: Total Project Cost P18,211,760.00 Multiply By Percentage of Completion 59.00% Unpaid work accomplishment acknowledged by both parties Less Amount already paid by Carranglan -3,352,144.40 Unpaid work accomplishment, as adjusted P7,392,793.60 The parties did not appeal from the CIAC Award. As a result, it lapsed into finality and consequently, the CIAC issued a Writ of Execution dated November 24, 2015 to implement the CIAC Award. On the basis of the above-mentioned CIAC Award and Writ of Execution, Sunway filed a money claim before the COA Proper to collect from Carranglan the amount of P10,166,654.90, computed as follows: Unpaid work accomplishment P7,392,793.60 Interest 134,302.17 Retention money 276,231.40 Attorney's fees 550,000.00 Cost of arbitration 309,728.84 Interest 6% per annum from August 25, 2015 501,199.63 12% per annum until full payment 1,002,399.26 TOTAL P10,166,654.90 After evaluation, the COA Audit Team Leader (ATL) found that the claim lacked legal basis. The ATL noted that the claim represented partial work performed as of September 8, 2008, which was beyond the original contract period. Further, it noted that Sunway should have been required to pay liquidated damages on account of the delay in the project's completion and implementation. In the 1st Indorsement dated May 25, 2017, the COA Regional Director agreed with the ATL's findings and recommended that the money claim be denied. In particular, the COA Regional Director cited the following reasons to justify denial: the project's completion was delayed; its implementation was attended by lapses and violations of pertinent rules and regulations; and the contract's terms and stipulations were not observed.","WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Petition for Money Claim of Sunway Builders against the Municipality of Carranglan, Nueva Ecija, for the enforcement of the Award in the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission Case No. 02-2015 for the payment of actual accomplishments relative to the Design-Build-Lease Contract for the water supply is hereby DENIED for lack of merit. The Audit Team Leader and Supervising Auditor are directed: To evaluate the difference between the actual payment made and the equivalent amount of accomplishment and issue a Notice of Disallowance, if warranted; To evaluate Audit Observation Memorandum No. 2007-04 dated August 2, 2007 relative to the 2nd and 5th payments made to Sunway Builders which were not supported with accomplishment reports and other supporting documents, and issue a Notice of Disallowance, if warranted; and To compute the liquidated damages for the delay in the completion of the project, and issue a Notice of Disallowance, if warranted. Further, the municipality is ordered to forfeit the performance security posted by Sunway Builders, if any. Finally, the Prosecution and Litigation Office, Legal Services Sector, this Commission, is hereby directed to forward the case to the Office of the Ombudsman for investigation and filing of appropriate charges, if warranted, against the persons liable for the transaction.","The Court recognizes that the law vests the COA Proper with original jurisdiction over money claims or collection suits filed against the Government. However, it is clear that the authority to take cognizance of these cases is not exclusive to the COA Proper. Other tribunals or adjudicative bodies, such as the CIAC, share this original jurisdiction. On the other hand, the CIAC has original and exclusive jurisdiction, in particular, over disputes arising from, or connected with, construction contracts, including contracts to which the government is a party. In disputes involving the collection from a government instrumentality of an amount payable arising from a construction contract, the CIAC's jurisdiction—which is more specific to construction contract matters—should take precedence over the COA Proper's general authority to adjudicate money claims against the government where the parties resort to the CIAC directly to resolve the controversy. That the CIAC, upon the submission of the construction contract dispute to arbitration, exercises its jurisdiction to the exclusion of the COA is a matter that has been settled squarely in the recent case of Taisei Shimizu Joint Venture (TSJV) v. Commission on Audit (Taisei), viz.: First off, there is noting in the Constitution, laws, or even the COA rules expressly granting the COA original and exclusive jurisdiction over money claims due from or owing to the government. x x x x Other tribunals/adjudicative bodies, too, may have concurrent jurisdiction with the COA over money claims against the government or in the audit of the funds of government agencies and instrumentalities. x x x x In the recent case of Tourism Infrastructure and Enterprise Zone Authority (TIEZA) v. Global-V Builders Co. , the Court ruled that where TIEZA and the private contractor validly agreed to submit their construction dispute to arbitration, the CIAC properly exercised its jurisdiction over the case. x x x x Considering that TSJV and [the Department of Transportation] had voluntarily invoked CIAC's jurisdiction, the power to hear and decide the present case has thereby been solely vested in the CIAC to the exclusion of COA. Being a specific law, [Executive Order] No. 1008 providing for CIAC's exclusive jurisdiction prevails over [Presidential Decree No.] 1445, granting the COA the general jurisdiction over money claims due from or owing to the government. x x x In other words, when the dispute is for arbitration, the CIAC shall have the exclusive authority to settle and resolve the issues arising therefrom. However, that is not to say that the COA loses completely its power to adjudicate these money claims. Upon the issuance of a CIAC award, the prevailing party must still file a money claim before the COA, inasmuch as ""the proper procedure to enforce a judgment award against the government is to file a separate action before the COA for its satisfaction."" Nature and extent of the COA's audit power over money claims previously tried/subjected to arbitration. At this juncture, it becomes apparent that all money claims against the government will eventually come within the COA's jurisdiction. However, not all money claims will invoke the fullest extent of the COA's audit and examination powers, inasmuch as some of these may have already been litigated or arbitrated previously. Taking from COA Chairperson Michael Aguinaldo's discussion in his dissenting opinion to the assailed COA Proper Decision in Taisei, the Court distinguished between the two types of money claims cognizable by the COA, viz.: (1) money claims originally filed before the COA, or those to be litigated/adjudicated for the very first time and (2) money claims arising from a final and executory judgment previously rendered by a court or arbitral body that duly exercised its original jurisdiction thereof ahead and, thus, to the exclusion of the COA. The COA is regarded to have full authority to adjudicate claims of the first type, as these are submitted to it at first instance. Certainly, it shall be the COA's duty to evaluate the claim properly and thoroughly, taken that these actions have not had the benefit of a previous trial or examination by a competent court or tribunal. In contrast, the COA's audit approach shall be necessarily different when claims of the second type are brought before it. In Taisei, the Court underscored the limited character of COA's authority over claims arising from a previous final and executory judgment of a court, tribunal, or other adjudicative body. The Court also outlined guiding principles as regards COA's limited authority. First, ""[o]nce a court or other adjudicative body validly acquires jurisdiction over a money claim against the government, it exercises and retains jurisdiction over the subject matter to the exclusion of all others, including the COA."" Second, ""[t]he COA has no appellate review power over the decisions of any other court or tribunal. Third, ""[t]he COA is devoid of power to disregard the principle of immutability of final judgments."" In sum, ""[t]he COA's exercise of discretion in approving or disapproving money claims that have been determined by final judgment is akin to the power of an execution court."" Stated differently, the CIAC's exercise of jurisdiction over the original controversy to the exclusion of the COA, the COA's lack of appellate jurisdiction over CIAC awards, and the principle of immutability of judgments, serve as bars to the COA's exercise of its general audit powers, such that the COA may no longer: (a) relitigate and re-examine the issues and evidence, respectively, which have already been passed upon by the CIAC; (b) review the case on the merits, as if on appeal; and much less (c) reverse or modify the final CIAC award. When these bars apply to a case but the COA disregards them, its actions shall be considered unauthorized, and thus, tainted with grave abuse. Lest it be misunderstood, the Court must clarify that while the COA's jurisdiction with respect to claims of the second type is limited, it is not reduced to a perfunctory function such that it is bound to approve all said money claims without exception. Certainly, the party that seeks to enforce a CIAC award has the foremost responsibility of establishing his or her claim by way of evidence, particularly that the CIAC rendered an award in his or her favor and the award has lapsed into finality. In filing the money claim/petition, the claimant must observe the formal requirements set forth under the 2009 Revised Rules of Procedure of the Commission on Audit, the most important of which is the submission to the COA of a certified true copy of the CIAC award relied upon as proof of his or her entitlement and the finality thereof. For its part, the COA remains duty-bound to validate the claims, only that it must do so within its limited authority. Once it has ascertained that the CIAC award has become final, there is nothing left for the COA to do but to execute the award. In its execution, the COA shall respect and uphold the award's finality. Thus, in Taisei, the Court pronounced that the COA is restricted to determining the source of funds from which the award may be satisfied, in accordance with the laws the COA is tasked to implement. To add, it is understood that the COA may also validate the clerical/mathematical accuracy of the award computation and verify whether there have been payments made from the time the award became final, if only to avoid double payment. III As applied to the present case To recall, Sunway submitted the dispute for arbitration. During the course of the proceedings, Carranglan participated in the finalization of the terms of reference and filed an answer to the complaint. However, due to its representative's failure to appear during the scheduled hearing, Sunway's presentation of evidence proceeded without Carranglan's involvement. Despite its absence during the presentation, there is nothing in the rollo that suggests that Carranglan submitted any objection to Sunway's subsequent formal offer of documentary evidence. Thereafter, the CIAC already determined that the correct completion rate for the project was 59%. Further, in computing the balance of unpaid accomplishment (P7,392,793.60), the arbitrator also considered the interim payments made by Carranglan. Carranglan did not appeal from the CIAC Award, allowing it to lapse to finality. The final and executory character of the CIAC Award is no longer disputed. On the other hand, in the assailed Decision, the COA Proper ignored the CIAC Awards final and executory character. First, it relitigated matters pertaining to the completion rate, payments already made by Carranglan, and the overall substantiation of the balance of unpaid accomplishment. Second, it re-examined the evidence already presented to and evaluated by the CIAC, particularly those establishing that the total project cost and completion rate have been mutually acknowledged by the parties. The COA Proper disregarded the probative value given by the CIAC to certain documents, viz.: The letter dated January 13, 201[0] of the then Mayor of Carranglan to the DBP, together with the [Statement of Work Accomplished] which was used by the [CIAC] as basis, should have been submitted to the Commission for verification or validation of the actual accomplishment. It is worth to note that the letter was not cross-examined by the municipality, having waived its right to cross-examine the claimant's evidence. In fact, the letter was not even duly identified and verified as to its genuineness and authenticity in the arbitration proceedings. Thus, the same may not be given credence. Basic is the requirement that claims against government funds shall be supported with completed documentation. It appears that the COA was under the impression that the key documents were neither admissible nor credible because these were: (a) not submitted to the COA for prior verification and (b) not authenticated and cross-examined. Stated differently, the COA brushed aside the key documents despite the absence of any CIAC rule or evidentiary rule requiring prior COA verification, as well as Carranglan's failure to timely object to the admissibility of evidence. Third, it refused to execute the final CIAC Award. The COA Proper gave more weight to the ATL/Regional Director's audit findings/recommendation and denied Sunway's money claim. In its complete turnaround from the Award, it even found Sunway liable for liquidated damages and ordered Carranglan to forfeit the performance security deposit posted by Sunway. In the end, the COA Proper directed the ATL and Supervising Auditor to quantify the liquidated damages and determine whether the issuance of notices of disallowance is warranted. It is clear from the foregoing that the COA stepped beyond its limited authority in dealing with Sunway's money claim, which was on a final and executory CIAC Award. Thus, the acts constitute grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of the COA Proper. Finally, as the Court resolved in Taisei, the Court likewise remands the present case to the COA. The COA shall dispose of Sunway's money claim: (a) by upholding the final and executory character of the CIAC Award upon which the money claim was based and (b) in accordance with the principles laid down in this Decision and in Taisei.","WHEREFORE, the instant petition is GRANTED. The COA Proper Decision No. 2019-082 dated March 27, 2019 and Resolution dated November 25, 2019 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The case is REMANDED to the COA for the proper execution of the final and executory CIAC Award promulgated on August 25, 2015, the determination of funding source, and the final settlement of the arbitral award. SO ORDERED."

The Petition, which was directly filed before this Court, seeks the issuance of a writ of continuing mandamus against Dr. Francisco T. Duque III (Duque), Dr. Lyndon L. Lee Suy, Nela Charade G. Puno, RPh, Hon. Leonor Magtolis Briones, and Hon. Catalino S. Cuy (collectively, respondents), who are all government officials involved in the implementation of the Dengvaxia vaccination program. Petitioners allege that respondents failed to protect the right to health of those who were subjected to the Department of Health's dengue immunization program. Petitioners claim that they were used as ""guinea pigs"" in an experiment conducted by the government and pharmaceutical giant Sanofi Pasteur. In December 2015, the procurement of Dengvaxia was proposed by former DOH Secretary Garin, and the school-based vaccination program was implemented in 2016. In November 2017, Sanofi Pasteur released an updated information on Dengvaxia, which stated that the vaccine is only beneficial to those ""who had [a] prior infection"" and that those who were not previously infected by the dengue virus may develop ""cases of severe disease ... following vaccination upon a subsequent dengue infection."" Following this advisory, Duque suspended the implementation of the dengue vaccination program on December 1, 2017. Petitioners pray that respondents be ordered to: (1) ""publicly disseminate, on a regular basis, the report of the Task Force created and designated to monitor and review the school-based immunization program involving Dengvaxia and submit the same to the House of Representatives and Senate Committees on Health[;]"" (2) ""conduct further study and review on the safety and efficacy of Dengvaxia,"" which should be open to the public and subject to review by independent medical experts; (3) create a registry or list of all those who had been inoculated with Dengvaxia; (4) provide free medical services to all inoculated children and monitor any adverse effects caused by the vaccine; (5) provide free medical treatment and hospitalization to inoculated children if they suffer from a Dengvaxia-related illness; and (6) conduct ""initial and free consultations of inoculated children"" in all areas covered by the program. Respondents argued that the petition is moot because they already accomplished the reliefs sought by petitioners, including disseminating information (under A.O. No. 2018-0008), conducting studies, creating a master list (but not releasing it publicly due to the Data Privacy Act), and providing free medical services and monitoring.","Clearly, the Petition for a Writ of Continuing Mandamus before this Court does not involve any ecological right nor does it allege any right involving protection of the environment or the ecology. It mainly invokes alleged violations on the right to health. Thus, petitioners cannot resort to this kind of writ. Even if it does, the Petition must be dismissed for insufficiency of substance. The acts sought by petitioners to be performed are not enjoined by law as a duty. They are not ministerial acts.","Petitioners have legal standing based on the direct injury they sustained for being inoculated with Dengvaxia. However, the Petition violates the doctrine of hierarchy of courts because a proceeding for the issuance of a writ of continuing mandamus necessarily requires the submission and evaluation of facts, meaning the questions presented are not purely legal. Furthermore, a writ of continuing mandamus cannot be issued because the controversy does not involve the enforcement or violation of an environmental law or right, but rather the right to health. Even if treated as a petition for mandamus under Rule 65, it fails because the requested acts are not enjoined by law as a duty; they involve purely administrative and discretionary functions of the Executive department, and granting them would usurp the power and prerogatives of the executive in their enactment of programs, violating the separation of powers. Moreover, the reliefs sought by petitioners were already satisfied by respondents, who have been disseminating public information, studying the vaccine's safety and efficacy, monitoring the children, and offering free medical services, except for the public release of the master list which is barred by the Data Privacy Act. This Court refrains from intervening in the discretionary functions and prerogatives of the Executive department.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Mandamus is DISMISSED. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 225433, September 20, 2022","LARA'S GIFTS & DECORS, INC., PETITIONER, VS. MIDTOWN INDUSTRIAL SALES, INC. RESPONDENT.","Lara's Gifts & Decors, Inc. (Lara's Gifts) purchased from Midtown Industrial Sales, Inc. (Midtown) various industrial and construction materials, from January to December 2007, in the total amount of P1,263,104.22. The purchases were on a 60-day credit term, subject to the condition that 24% per annum would be charged on all accounts overdue. Lara's Gifts issued post-dated checks to pay for its purchases. However, these checks were later dishonored due to ""insufficiency of funds"" or ""account closed."" Midtown informed Lara's Gifts of the bounced checks and demanded the settlement of its accounts, through a demand letter dated January 21, 2008. However, Lara's Gifts still failed to pay. Thus, on February 5, 2008, Midtown filed a Complaint for Sum of Money with Prayer for Attachment. Lara's Gifts admitted its purchases, but claimed that most of the deliveries were substandard and of poor quality. As such, the finished products, using those raw materials, were rejected by U.S. buyers. Lara's Gifts added that clue to the economic recession, some of the orders made by its U.S. buyers were cancelled. Also, on February 19, 2008, a fire razed its factory destroying its equipment, machineries, and inventories. On January 27, 2014, the Regional Trial Court, Branch 128, Caloocan City rendered a decision in favor of Midtown. It found insufficient evidence to prove Lara's Gifts' claim that the products were substandard. On appeal, the Court of Appeals upheld the Regional Trial Court's decision which prompted Lara's Gifts to file a Petition for Review before this Court. In an August 28, 2019 Decision, this Court denied Lara's Gifts' Petition, and affirmed the Court of Appeals' Decision with modification as to damages. Petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration. It argues that: (1) the due execution of the sales invoices was specifically denied in its Answer; (2) it cannot be considered in default of its obligation since it did not receive any demand; (3) it had sufficiently established that the materials delivered by respondent were substandard and of poor quality; (4) the 24% interest stated in the sales invoices is null and void for being excessive, unconscionable, and exorbitant, and was unilaterally imposed by respondent without petitioner's consent; and (5) the imposition of legal interest on the 24% compensatory interest is excessive.",This Court partially grants the Motion for Reconsideration.,"We find no valid justification to compel a modification or reversal of our Decision as to those issues. The only matter left for this Court to resolve is whether or not the imposition of legal interest on the compensatory interest of 24% per annum is excessive. ... Now to this case, we modify our earlier Decision and hold that the contract involved is not a loan or forbearance of money, goods, or credit, but a sale of goods on credit. From January to December 2007, petitioner Lara's Gifts purchased from respondent Midtown various industrial and construction materials totaling P1,263,104.22. The purchases were on a 60-day credit term, with the condition that a 24% interest rate per annum would be charged on all accounts overdue. This means that the 24% interest rate per annum would run only upon petitioner's failure to pay on the due date. Thus, the 24% interest rate is a compensatory interest, imposed as indemnity for damages caused by the delay in the payment of the raw materials' purchase price, pursuant to Article 2209. By the express provision of Article 2212, the 24% compensatory interest, which have accrued at the time of judicial demand, may be subject to ""interest on interest."" However, as Justice Amy C. Lazaro-Javier pointed out, the Regional Trial Court adjudged in favor of Midtown Industrial Sales only P1,263,104.22 plus interest at 24% per annum, computed from February 5, 2008 until fully paid; and P50,000.00 as attorney's fees. This judgment award became final and executory as to Midtown Industrial Sales as it did not appeal. Thus, the additional award of legal interest on the 24% interest, in an appeal brought by Lara's Gifts, is ultra vires.","the Motion for Reconsideration is PARTIALLY GRANTED. This Court's August 28, 2019 Decision is MODIFIED in that the award of legal interest on the 24% per annum compensatory interest is hereby DELETED. Petitioner Lara's Gifts & Decors, Inc. is ordered to PAY respondent Midtown Industrial Sales, Inc. the following: (1) ONE MILLION TWO HUNDRED SIXTY-THREE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FOUR PESOS and 22/100 (P1,263,104.22) representing the principal amount plus stipulated interest at 24% per annum to be computed from January 22, 2008, the date of extrajudicial demand, until full payment; (2) The sum of FIFTY THOUSAND PESOS (P50,000.00) as attorney's fees; and (3) Cost of the suit. The total monetary award shall bear legal interest at the rate of 6% per annum from finality of this Resolution until full payment."
"G.R. No. 256070, September 19, 2022","CYNTHIA G. MORENO, PETITIONER, VS. SANDIGANBAYAN [FIRST DIVISION] AND PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENTS.","Petitioner used to be the mayor of Aloguinsan, Cebu for twelve (12) years, and was the incumbent mayor when she was indicted together with Pepito A. Manguilimotan, Nonela N. Villegas, Marilyn P. Flordeliza, Gertrudes D. Ababon, John D. Lim, Emilia Luz B. Celis, and Orven M. Nengasca for violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. (RA) 3019, otherwise known as the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act in Criminal Case No. SB-10-CRM-0236. On June 5, 2014, all the accused in Criminal Case No. SB-10-CRM-0236, including petitioner, were found guilty of violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019, and were sentenced to suffer the indeterminate penalty of six (6) years and one (1) month, as minimum, to ten (10) years, as maximum, with perpetual disqualification from holding public office. Petitioner's conviction for violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019 attained finality on June 25, 2019. On December 2, 2020, petitioner filed the Motion praying that she be allowed to serve her sentence under home care or house arrest at Lunhaw Farm Resort, Barangay Bojo, Municipality of Aloguinsan, Cebu, under the 'direct and close monitoring and supervision of the local [Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP)] officers, or [Probation] Officers of the Department of Justice', together with her counsel by way of recognizance. The Sandiganbayan denied petitioner's Motion in the Resolution dated December 17, 2020 for failure to provide evidence, i.e., medical records or physician's report, and noted that 'home care/house arrest' does not appear in the Rules of Criminal Procedure and that there is no law providing for an alternative mode of confinement based on health considerations for prisoners convicted by final judgment. Petitioner moved for reconsideration, but it was denied by the Sandiganbayan in its Resolution dated March 9, 2021 for being filed out of time pursuant to the Revised Guidelines for Continuous Trial of Criminal Cases, and substantively, ruling that petitioner's circumstances are entirely different from that of the former Presidents who were granted similar relief, and her reliance on Paderanga v. Court of Appeals is misplaced. Hence, this Petition for Certiorari was filed.",The petition is hereby DISMISSED.,"Contrary to petitioner's assertion, the Continuous Trial Guidelines likewise governs post-conviction motions such as the Motion in question. The Court finds that petitioner's Motion is an unmeritorious motion which was correctly dismissed outright by the Sandiganbayan pursuant to the last paragraph of Section 2(c), Part III of the Continuous Trial Guidelines, as it was not supported by-relevant documents, i.e., medical record or physician's report. Assuming arguendo that the Motion is a meritorious motion, petitioner should have filed her Motion for Reconsideration of the Resolution dated December 17, 2020 within a non-extendible period of five calendar days from receipt of such Resolution in accordance with Section 2(c), Part III of the Continuous Trial Guidelines. Petitioner's reliance on Section 1, Rule 52 of the 2019 Rules of Court as to the timeliness of her Motion for Reconsideration is misplaced, as the assailed Resolution dated December 17, 2020 is not a judgment or final resolution but an interlocutory order. In any case, the duration of the penalty meted to petitioner, i.e., 6 years and one month up to 10 years, is within the duration of prision mayor. Verily, the Sandiganbayan has no discretion to allow petitioner to serve her sentence by rendering community service, more so, under 'home care/house arrest.' Petitioner's fear of contracting COVID-19 is understandable; however, petitioner may not be given a different treatment for the law is clear and the Court cannot carve an exception in Articles 78 and 86 of the RPC without violating the proscription against judicial legislation and the equal protection clause enshrined in the Constitution.","The Resolutions dated December 17, 2020 and March 9, 2021 of the Sandiganbayan, First Division in Criminal Case No. SB-10-CRM-0236 are AFFIRMED."
"[ A.C. No. 13343, September 14, 2022 ]","RENE B. CARANDANG, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. ALFREDO RAMIREZ, JR., RESPONDENT.","Records disclose that on August 20, 2014, respondent notarized a Deed of Sale of Motor Vehicle[2] involving a Nissan Almera (Nissan Deed of Sale), which was supposedly executed by complainant in favor of Rockyfeller F. Baltero (Baltero) for the amount of P520,000.00. Complainant, however, denied the authenticity of the document and alleged that he neither sold his vehicle to Baltero nor appeared before respondent notary public for the execution of the Nissan Deed of Sale. Consequently, complainant filed a criminal case for Falsification of a Public Document[3] (first criminal case) against Baltero, among others.[4] In his Counter-Affidavit,[5] Baltero narrated that on August 20, 2014, he purchased complainant's black Toyota Vios for P520,000.00. Less than a week later, he agreed to purchase complainant's Nissan Almera and silver Toyota Vios (silver Vios) for P520,000.00 each. Then, on August 28, 2014, he paid complainant P520,000.00 for the Nissan Almera and P250,000.00 for the silver Vios. Because he left a balance of P270,000.00 for the silver Vios unpaid, complainant refused to execute a deed of sale over the Nissan Almera.[6] Baltero thus stressed that he could not have committed the crime charged because no deed of sale over the Nissan Almera was ever executed to begin with.[7] In support thereof, Baltero submitted the following documents, viz.: Deed of Sale of Motor Vehicle[8] dated August 20, 2014 (Black Vios Deed of Sale); Deed of Sale with Assumption of Mortgage[9] dated August 28, 2014 (Silver Vios Deed of Sale); and Respondent's notarized Sworn-Statement[10] dated October 10, 2016, alleging that he personally witnessed the execution of the Black Vios Deed of Sale and the Silver Vios Deed of Sale (subject deeds) which he duly recorded in his notarial register under Doc. No. 450, Page 90, Book II, Series of 2014 and Doc. No. 496, Page No. 100, Book I, Series of 2014, respectively.[11] Complainant, certain that he did not execute the aforementioned documents, secured a certification[12] from the Notarial Section of the Office of the Clerk of Court (OCC), Biñan City, Laguna, which stated that: First, the Black Vios Deed of Sale and the Nissan Deed of Sale were not among the submitted notarial documents of respondent. Although respondent's transmittal letter dated December 29, 2014 states that Book II, Series of 2014 contained only 410 documents, both deeds of sale are denominated as Doc. No. 450, Page 90, Book II, Series of 2014.[13] Second, the Silver Vios Deed of Sale, denominated as Doc. No. 496, Page No. 100, Book I, Series of 2014, was not among the notarial documents submitted by respondent. This is because what was listed on respondent's notarial register as Doc. No. 496 in Book I is a document denominated as a ""Request for Termination of Housing Loan.""[14] This prompted complainant to file another criminal case for Falsification of a Public Document and Perjury[15] (second criminal case) against Baltero and respondent. In his Counter-Affidavit,[16] respondent stated that when complainant and Baltero came to his office on August 20, 2014, they had already signed the Black Vios Deed of Sale that they sought to have notarized. He added that his only duty then was to certify that they were the persons who signed the deed of sale and that he notarized the document in the presence of complainant, with his acknowledgment and solemn vow that he signed his name on it of his own free will. Hence, the present administrative case.[17] Complainant alleged that the OCC certification stating that the subject deeds were nonexistent in respondent's notarial records totally contradicted the latter's notarized Sworn Statement in the first criminal case wherein he averred that he personally witnessed and even notarized the documents purportedly executed by complainant and Baltero.[18] Complainant further alleged that respondent; in his Counter-Affidavit[19] in the second criminal case, made an inconsistent statement asserting that the Black Vios Deed of Sale was already signed by complainant and Baltero when they went to his office. Complainant pointed out that in the Police Report[20] dated October 4, 2016, respondent's secretary furnished the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG) with a different version of the Black Vios Deed of Sale which was also notarized by respondent.[21]","The Court adopts the findings of the IBP Board of Governors with modification as to the penalty to be imposed against respondent. It is well to stress that notarization is not a meaningless act, but is one imbued with substantial public interest.[35] This is because ""a notarized document is entitled to full faith and credit"" under the law.[36] A notary public, such as respondent, is thus mandated ""to discharge with faithfulness the sacred duties of his profession,""[37] and to strictly comply with the parameters set forth under the Notarial Rules.[38] ""Otherwise, the public's confidence in the integrity of a notarized document would be undermined.""[39] As the IBP correctly found, the subject deeds of sale in the case bore the following glaring irregularities: First, the Nissan Deed of Sale and the Black Vios Deed of Sale had the same notarial entries, that is, ""Doc. No. 450, Page No. 90, Book II, Series of 2014."" Likewise, the Silver Vios Deed of Sale and a document entitled ""Request for Termination of Housing Loan"" contained the same notarial details, which is, ""Doc. No. 496, Page No. 100, Book I, Series of 2014."" Second, the Black Vios Deed of Sale, which was supposedly notarized on August 20, 2014, was entered in respondent's notarial register, specifically, in Book II, Series of 2014. Meanwhile, the Silver Vios Deed of Sale, which respondent appears to have notarized later, or on August 28, 2014, was registered in Book I, Series of 2014. Last, the Nissan Deed of Sale and the Black Vios Deed of Sale were both numbered as ""Document No. 450"" even though respondent's notarial register designated as Book II, Series of 2014 contained only 410 documents. Taken together, the circumstances raise serious doubts as to respondent's notarization of the subject deeds of sale. Indeed, the mere fact that multiple documents contained the same notarial entries constitutes as a violation of Section 2(e),[40] Rule VI of the Notarial Rules, which requires a notary public to give each document he or she notarizes a number corresponding to the one in his or her register. Moreover, it is settled that ""[a] notary public is not allowed to notarize a document unless the persons who signed the same are the very same persons who executed [it] and personally appeared before him [or her] to attest to the contents and truth of what are stated therein.""[41] Here, respondent even attested to the fact of notarization of the subject deeds of sale in his sworn statements despite clear evidence that proves otherwise. For one, complainant has adamantly denied having appeared before respondent, or any notary public for that matter, to have the subject deeds of sale notarized. For another, all three deeds of sale are not among the notarial documents submitted by respondent as certified by the OCC. Even worse, respondent, during the CIDG investigation, submitted a different version of the Black Vios Deed of Sale, which also appears to have been notarized by him. To recall, the Black Vios Deed of Sale attached in Baltero's Counter-Affidavit, which was dated August 20, 2014, involved a vehicle with Engine No. 2NZ6987908 and MV File No. 1396-00000099155. In contrast, the document that respondent gave to the CIDG was dated August 28, 2014, and it pertained to the sale of a vehicle with Engine No. 2NZ6984362, and MV File No. 1301- 00000041762.[42] By being untruthful, respondent not only violated his solemn oath ""to do no falsehood, nor consent to the doing of any in court"" but also breached the following peremptory tenets of ethical conduct: x x x Respondent's unethical conduct was further compounded by his obstinate refusal to participate in the proceedings before the IBP, which in itself, constitutes as a violation of Canon 11 of the CPR: x x x The Court, however, is not inclined to adopt the IBP's recommendation as to the duration of respondent's period of suspension. The factual milieu in Viray — the IBP's basis for recommending the penalty of suspension from the practice of law for one year — is not in all fours with the instant case. While it is true that the notaries public in both cases allowed themselves to be used as instruments of fraud, the respondent lawyer in Viray immediately admitted to the illegal notarization, apologized for it, and explained that he did so because he was assured by the client that the document was executed by the complainant therein.[47] In contrast, respondent, in his Sworn-Statement in the first criminal case, averred that he notarized the subject deeds after personally witnessing the signing and execution of the documents in question. Then, in the second criminal case, respondent asserted that the subject deeds were already signed by the parties when they went to his office to have them notarized thereby contradicting the earlier statements that he made under oath in a criminal proceeding no less.[48] In light of the following, the Court deems it proper to increase the period of respondent's suspension from the practice of law from one (1) year to two (2) years in line with prevailing jurisprudence.[49]","WHEREFORE, the Court finds respondent Atty. Alfredo Ramirez, Jr. GUILTY of violating the Lawyer's Oath, the Code of Professional Responsibility, and the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice. Accordingly, the Court hereby SUSPENDS him from the practice of law for a period of two (2) years; REVOKES his incumbent notarial commission, if any; and PROHIBITS him from being commissioned as a notary public for a period of two (2) years. He is likewise STERNLY WARNED that a repetition of the same or similar conduct in the future shall be dealt with more severely.","GUILTY of violating the Lawyer's Oath, the Code of Professional Responsibility, and the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice."
"G.R. Nos. 242506-10 and G.R. Nos. 242590-94, September 14, 2022","LUIS RAMON P. LORENZO, PETITIONER, VS. HON. SANDIGANBAYAN (SIXTH DIVISION) AND THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENTS. [G.R. Nos. 242590-94] ARTHUR CUA YAP, PETITIONER, VS. SANDIGANBAYAN (SIXTH DIVISION) AND THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENTS.","On April 20, 2018, five Criminal Informations for violation of Section 3(e) [5] of Republic Act No. (R.A.) 3019 (the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act) were filed against Lorenzo, Yap, and Tomas A. Guibani (Guibani), the latter being the representative of Philphos. One Information reads in part: On 04 July 2003, or sometime prior or subsequent thereto, in the City of Manila, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused LUIS P. LORENZO, JR. and ARTHUR C. YAP, both public officers with salary grade 30, being then the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture and Administrator of the National Food Authority (NFA), respectively, while in the performance of their official functions and in grave abuse thereof, acting with evident bad faith, manifest partiality and/or gross inexcusable negligence, conspiring with one another and with co-accused TOMAS A. GUIBANI, Representative of the Philippine Phosphate Fertilizer Corporation (Philphos), did then and there, willfully, unlawfully, and criminally cause undue injury to the government and/or give unwarranted benefits, advantage and preference to Philphos, by (a) directing the Regional Bids and Awards Committees (RBACs) of NFA Regions 1 to 5 and the National Capital Region (NCR) to conduct procurement of their fertilizer requirements through the negotiated mode in violation of the general rule on competitive bidding prescribed under Section 10 of Republic Act 9184; (b) issuing a guideline that the opening of the bids for the Luzon-wide procurement of fertilizers shall be simultaneously done at the NFA Central Office in Manila; and (c) amending the original guideline allowing only those suppliers with depots within and/or adjacent to the procuring NFA Region to participate as bidders, which issuances and directives were issued to ensure the award to Manila-based Philphos of the Php595,636.37 procurement contract for the supply of 1,300 bags of fertilizers to NFA-NCR to the damage and prejudice of the government. CONTRARY TO LAW. [6] The other four Informations were similarly worded except for (a) the date and place of the commission of the crime, (b) the NFA region involved, (c) the amount of the contract, and (d) the quantity of fertilizers. [7] The factual backdrop of the case is summarized by the Office of the Ombudsman (Ombudsman) as follows: The national government, through the Department of Agriculture (DA) allotted Four Hundred Thirty[-]Two Million Pesos (PhP432M) for the Ginintuang Masaganang Ani (GMA) Rice Program in 2003 . In a Memorandum dated 30 April 2003, respondent DA Secretary [Lorenzo] authorized the National Food Authority (NFA) to enter into contracts for the procurement of fertilizers intended for the wet season (May to October 2003) . Thus, on May 13, 2003 the DA and the NFA entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) to jointly implement the fertilizer component of the GMA Rice Program for the government . Two Hundred Million Pesos (PhP200M) was transferred by the DA to the NFA Central Office, which in turn, released PhP151,981,640.00 to its Regional Field Units (RFUs) all over the country. The NFA Regional and Provincial Offices in Luzon received a total allocation of PhP108,885,979, but actual fund releases amounted only to PhP105,608,679.00 x x x. x x x x The PhP105,608,679.00 actual disbursement was utilized for the procurement of fertilizers (PhP74,701,400.00) arid certified seeds (PhP23,437,139.00) and other administrative expenses (PhP7,470,140.00) related thereto. [8] (Emphasis supplied) The regions in the Luzon-wide procurement of fertilizers were as follows: NFA Region I (Ilocos Region), NFA Region II (Cagayan Valley), NFA Region III (Central Luzon), NFA Region IV (CALABARZON and MIMAROPA), NFA Region V (Bicol Region), and National Capital Region (NCR). The Ombudsman found several irregularities in the procurement of fertilizers in the said regions. Mainly, the grounds relied upon by the Ombudsman were the absence of public bidding and other acts allegedly showing manifest partiality towards Philphos. The negotiated mode was adopted in the Luzon-wide procurement of fertilizers amounting to P46,831,638.00, upon the instruction of Yap, as authorized by Lorenzo. The mode was adopted for the reason given that there was an emergency brought by the urgency to buy the needed fertilizers in time for the May to October cropping season. [9] To ensure an unimpeded procurement process, Yap also issued general guidelines via wire instructions to the concerned NFA officials in Regions I to V and the NCR. Among these were: 1) the opening of bids to be conducted simultaneously at NFA Central Office; and 2) a directive that suppliers with depots outside or adjacent to the procuring region may submit their bids or be invited to participate in the bids. [10] The Ombudsman found that the DA-Central, as the primary implementing office of the 2003 GMA Rice Program, actively intervened in the procurement process through its regional directors who were given authority to confirm the initial recommendations of the Regional Bids and Awards Committee (RBAC) of each procuring NFA Region. The DA also submitted the list of accredited suppliers that were invited by the RBAC of each NFA Regional Office. Moreover, the DA issued certifications that enabled Philphos to participate in all the subject biddings despite it being a Manila-based business entity. [11] The Ombudsman Ruling In a Resolution [12] dated July 25, 2017, the Ombudsman ordered the filing of separate Informations for five (5) counts of violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. 3019 against Lorenzo, Yap, and Guibani. The Ombudsman found that Lorenzo and Yap, as public officers, and in conspiracy with Guibani, demonstrated manifest partiality towards Philphos. The Ombudsman found that Lorenzo intentionally favored Philphos by sanctioning the conduct of the Luzon-wide procurement without public bidding and by delegating the procurement task to the NFA. The resort to negotiated procurement was done even without meeting the criteria set forth in R.A. 9184 or the Government Procurement Act, allegedly to meet an emergency. [13] As for Yap, the Ombudsman found that he actively intervened in the biddings conducted. Specifically, the Ombudsman found that Yap's issuances enabled Philphos to participate in the procurements conducted for Regions I to V and the NCR. According to the Ombudsman, the law provides for the non-discretionary pass/fail criteria on eligibility check of bidders, hence, Yap's amendments of the criteria or guidelines after the conduct of the June 27, 2003 bidding in order to make Philphos eligible and compliant was highly irregular and showed his predilection towards Philphos. [14] According to the Ombudsman, Lorenzo and Yap ""wielded their power and influence as DA Secretary and NFA Administrator, respectively, to control the bidding procedures and the technical requirements/eligibility of prospective bidders to tailor-fit the requirements of favored bidder Philphos,"" [15] and therefore, probable cause exists to indict them for violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. 3019. The Ombudsman, however, found no showing that the government was grossly disadvantaged when the fertilizers were purchased from Philphos as to hold Lorenzo and Yap liable for violation of Section 3(g) of R.A. 3019. [16] Likewise, the Ombudsman dismissed the charge for violation of Section 65(6)(4) of R.A. 9184 against Lorenzo, Yap, and their co-respondents. [17] Yap moved for partial reconsideration where he: (i) maintained the absence of the elements of violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. 3019, (ii) disputed the finding of conspiracy, and (iii) claimed that his right to speedy disposition of cases has been violated. He also attached the Ombudsman's May 6, 2015 Joint Resolution in OMB-C-C-14-0064 titled FIO v. Lorenzo, et al. , which dismissed a case involving the same set of facts but in the Visayas region. [18] In a Joint Order [19] dated October 23, 2017 and approved on January 15, 2018, the Ombudsman denied the Motion for Partial Reconsideration. Aggrieved, Lorenzo, Yap, and Guibani filed before the Sandiganbayan their respective Motions to Quash and/or Dismiss. [20] Yap and Lorenzo both assailed the Informations on the following grounds: 1) the facts alleged in the Informations do not constitute an offense; and 2) the inordinate delay in the proceedings had ousted the Ombudsman of its authority to file the lnformations. [21] Among the contentions made by Lorenzo is that the resort to negotiated procurement was above board. [22] He pointed out that R.A. 9184 became effective on January 26, 2003 while the questioned procurements occurred between May to August 2003. However, the Implementing Rules and Regulations-A (IRR-A) of R.A. 9184, which require public bidding in government procurement, took effect only on October 8, 2003 and, under Section 77 thereof, it is specifically stated that where the advertisements or invitations for bids were issued after the effectivity of R.A. 9184 but before the effectivity of the IRR-A, then the applicable law at the time of the questioned procurements would be Executive Order No. (E.O.) 40: In cases where the advertisements or invitations for bids were issued after the effectivity of the Act but before the effectivity of this IRR-A , procuring entities may continue adopting the procurement procedures, rules and regulations provided in E.O. 40 and its IRR, P.D. 1594 and its IRR, R.A. 7160 and its IRR, or other applicable laws, as the case may be. [23] (Emphasis and underscoring supplied) Lorenzo also brought to fore the previous rulings by the Ombudsman in similar cases involving the same parties and factual backdrop where the charges against him and his co-respondents were dismissed. In this regard, Yap invoked the exception to the general rule that only allegations within the four comers of an information should be considered in resolving a motion to quash based on the ground that the facts alleged therein do not constitute an offense. [24] Lastly, Lorenzo and Yap alleged that there has been an inordinate delay in the termination of the preliminary investigation against them, which amounts to a violation of their right to speedy disposition of cases. [25] As emphasized by Lorenzo, counting from October 2003 when the fact-finding investigation was officially commenced and up to April 20 2018 when the five Informations were filed with the Sandiganbayan, it took more than 14 years for the Ombudsman to build a case against them. [26] The Sandiganbayan Ruling In a Resolution [27] dated August 9, 2018, the Sandiganbayan denied the motions of Lorenzo, Yap, and Guibani. The Sandiganbayan found that the material averments in the Informations, assuming them to be true, sufficiently allege all the elements constitutive of violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. 3019, as amended. An Information needs only to state the ultimate facts constituting the offense, not the finer details of why and how the illegal acts amounted to undue injury or damage — matters that are appropriate for trial. [28] On Lorenzo's allegation that negotiated procurement was proper, the Sandiganbayan ruled that even granting arguendo that E.O. 40, and not R.A. 9184 was applicable, resort to methods of procurement other than competitive bidding remained subject to the following preconditions: 1) when justified by extraordinary conditions; 2) prior approval of the head of the agency; and 3) resort thereto was made in the interest of economy and efficiency. The Sandiganbayan agreed with the prosecution that ""whether Lorenzo was justified from deviating from the general requirement of competitive bidding is evidentiary in nature and is a matter of defense that may be passed upon after a full-blown trial on the merits."" [29] The Sandiganbayan also ruled that Lorenzo and Yap cannot rely on past resolutions of the Ombudsman to justify the quashal of the instant Informations since the facts in those cases are not on all fours with the present case. The Sandiganbayan also ruled that evidence aliunde cannot be used to quash the information and likewise, matters of defense cannot be considered in a motion to quash. [30] The Sandiganbayan also rejected their claim of violation of the right to speedy disposition of cases. The Sandiganbayan reckoned the commencement of the prosecutorial process as of the year 2013, when the Complaint was filed by the Field Investigation Office (FIO) of the Ombudsman against petitioners. While the Sandiganbayan recognized that there was a delay of more than three years to finish the preliminary investigation, it found that such delay alone should not be a cause for an unfettered abdication of its duty to try cases and to finally make a determination of the controversy after the presentation of evidence. According to the Sandiganbayan, the delay adverted to in these cases does not measure up to the unreasonableness of the delay of disposition as laid out in jurisprudence. [31] In any case, the Sandiganbayan ruled that Lorenzo and Yap waived their right to speedy disposition of cases for their failure to seasonably invoke the same. [32] Lorenzo and Yap moved for reconsideration, which was denied by the Sandiganbayan in a Resolution [33] dated September 25, 2018. Thus, Lorenzo and Yap filed before the Court their respective petitions for certiorari with application for issuance of a temporary restraining order (TRO). Proceedings before the Court In his Rule 65 Petition, [34] Lorenzo argues that the Sandiganbayan committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction: 1) when it did not apply the exception to the hypothetical admission rule that evidence aliunde may be allowed or considered in resolving a motion to quash to serve the ends of justice; 2) in not quashing the subject Informations when Lorenzo was being charged for violating IRR-A of R.A. 9184 which took effect only on October 8 2003 for a transaction undertaken during the period of May to August 2003; and 3) when it did not apply the prevailing and applicable jurisprudence on the matter of inordinate delay at the time his omnibus motion was filed with the court. [35] Yap's Petition [36] is based on similar grounds. He claims that the Sandiganbayan committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction when it denied his motion to quash informations on the ground that the facts charged therein do not constitute an offense. Yap maintains that in resolving his motion to quash, the Sandiganbayan should have considered evidence aliunde which are admitted or not denied by the prosecution, emphasizing that the prosecution's mere objection to a motion to quash information does not foreclose the application of the exception to the general rule. Moreover, Yap argues that the inordinate delay in the termination of the preliminary investigation ousted the Ombudsman of its authority to file the Informations. [37] On June 10, 2019, the Court issued a TRO enjoining the Sandiganbayan from proceeding with the arraignment and trial of Criminal Case Nos. SB-18-CRM-0288 to 0292, pending final adjudication of the instant case. [38] Respondent People of the Philippines (respondent People) was also ordered to comment on the petitions. [39] Respondent People, represented by the Ombudsman, through the Office of the Special Prosecutor, filed its Comment and Opposition [40] on the petitions of Lorenzo and Yap and their prayers for issuance of TRO. On both Comments, respondent People counters that the Sandiganbayan correctly ruled that: 1) the inquiry into the facts outside the Informations is not permitted where the prosecution objects to the presentation thereof; 2) the Informations clearly and categorically alleged that petitioners failed to observe the general rule on competitive public bidding as prescribed under Section 10 of R.A. 9184, which took effect on January 26, 2003, and that the Informations sufficiently stated all the elements of violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. 3019; and 3) there was no inordinate delay. [41] Lorenzo and Yap filed their respective Replies [42] maintaining their arguments in their petitions. On September 23, 2019, the petitions of Lorenzo and Yap were consolidated considering that they involve the same parties and raise the same issues. [43] Issue The issue for the Court's resolution is whether the Sandiganbayan committed grave abuse of discretion in denying the Motions to Quash the Informations filed by Lorenzo and Yap.",The Petitions are granted.,"The Petitions are granted. At the very outset, the Court finds meritorious the argument that petitioners' right to speedy disposition of cases has been violated. On this ground alone, the cases against them are already dismissible. Moreover, the Court likewise finds meritorious petitioners' stand on the other substantive issue regarding the admission of evidence aliunde in resolving a motion to quash. I. In resolving questions involving the right to speedy disposition of cases, the Court is guided by its ruling in Cagang v. Sandiganbayan [44] (Cagang)... From the foregoing guidelines, the Court finds that Lorenzo and Yap's right to speedy disposition of cases was violated by the Ombudsman's inordinate delay in concluding the preliminary investigation... the entire preliminary investigation spanned more than four years, counted from the filing of the Complaint on November 11, 2013 until January 15, 2018, when the Ombudsman approved the October 23, 2017 Joint Order denying Yap's Motion for Partial Reconsideration of the Joint Resolution finding probable cause for violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. 3019. Whether the Court applies the 10-day period provided in Javier and Catamco , or the more generous periods of 12 to 24 months under A.O. 1, the conclusion is the same — that the Ombudsman exceeded the specified period provided for preliminary investigations. Consequently... the burden of proof to show that petitioners' right to speedy disposition of cases was not violated shifts to the prosecution, which must establish that the delay was reasonable and justified... the prosecution neither alleged nor proved any of these circumstances. The oft-recognized principle of institutional delay is not a blanket authority for the Ombudsman's non-observance of the periods fixed for preliminary investigation. ... the Sandiganbayan gravely abused its discretion in denying petitioners' motions to quash. II. As earlier mentioned, while the cases herein may already be dismissed on the ground of violation of petitioners' right to speedy disposition of cases, the Court nonetheless reviewed the records of the cases and finds it important to rule on the other substantive issue regarding the admission of evidence aliunde in resolving a motion to quash. ... That said, case law also recognizes exceptions to the aforementioned general rule — one of which being a situation where there are additional facts not alleged in the Information but are admitted or not denied by the prosecution. Inquiry into such facts may be allowed where the ground invoked is that the allegations in the Information do not constitute an offense. [95] Petitioners invoke this exception. ... From the aforementioned jurisprudential guidelines, it becomes clear that in the application of the exception to the general rule on non-admission of evidence aliunde in a motion to quash on the ground that the allegations of the Information do not charge an offense, what is controlling is the presence of facts that are apparent from the records and are admitted, directly or impliedly, or not denied by the prosecution, which destroy the prima facie truth accorded to the allegations of the Information on the hypothetical admission thereof. Applying the foregoing, the Court finds that the exception applies in the instant case. As readily evident, the previous issuances of the Ombudsman in the Visayas and Mindanao cases, as well as the findings of the Ombudsman in the Complaint herein, which are not denied by the prosecution, put in serious doubt the prima facie truth accorded to the allegations in the Informations, as the findings therein negate the presence of the second and third elements of the crime of violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. 3019. ... the Sandiganbayan should not have turned a blind eye to the previous issuances of the Ombudsman in the Visayas and Mindanao cases by the simple expedient of the prosecution's opposition, especially when the prima facie truth accorded to the allegations in the Informations have already been put into serious doubt. Had the Sandiganbayan considered the previous Resolution and Order of the Ombudsman in the Visayas and Mindanao cases, it would have already arrived at the same conclusion that the elements of the crime charged are wanting. ... The same finding was echoed in the Order of the Ombudsman in the Mindanao case. [131] At this juncture, the Court notes that even without resorting to the Ombudsman's ruling in the Visayas and Mindanao cases, the Sandiganbayan should already have given credence to Lorenzo's position that the applicable law in this case is E.O. 40, not R.A. 9184, as stated in the Informations... In sum, the Court finds that the Sandiganbayan committed grievous error in refusing to consider the evidence aliunde presented by petitioners in their motions to quash on the ground that the facts charged do not constitute an offense. Moreover, the Sandiganbayan gravely abused its discretion in denying petitioners' motions to quash despite the prosecutions' failure to provide sufficient justification for the delay in the termination of the preliminary investigation.","WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Petitions are GRANTED. The assailed Resolutions dated August 9, 2018 and September 25, 2018 of the Sandiganbayan Sixth Division in Criminal Case Nos. SB-18-CRM-0288 to 0292 are ANNULLED and SET ASIDE.

"G.R. No. 250839, September 14, 2022","PHILIPPINE BANK OF COMMUNICATIONS EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION (PBCEA), PETITIONER, VS. PHILIPPINE BANK OF COMMUNICATIONS, RESPONDENT.","The Multi-Purpose Loan Program Sometime in the 1980s, PBCom adopted a policy on its loan program which allowed their qualified employees to avail themselves of simultaneous loans subject to a debt service ratio, such that the overall debt servicing for all types of loans should not be more than 35% of the employee's net pay. The aim of the loan program was to help qualified employees meet certain difficulties and emergencies and improve their quality of life. Under the policy, employees could use their mid-year and year-end bonuses to pay for their loan amortizations. The Primer on PBCom Multi-Purpose Loan Programs for Officers and Staff expressly states: REPAYMENT Fixed monthly amortization (principal plus interest) via semi-monthly payroll [ sic ] deduction. Repayment through pledges/deduction/s from Mid-year/Year-end bonuses shall be allowed. x x x. Since 2003, the loan program was incorporated in Section 2 of Article XVI of the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) between PBCom and herein petitioner Philippine Bank of Communications Employees Association (PBCEA). The provision reads: Section 2. The BANK shall maintain its existing loan program, i.e. Multi-Purpose Loan Program for employees. (Italics supplied) The same provision was carried over into the parties' succeeding CBAs and still remains in the present CBA. Sometime in 2014, a new group of investors took over the management of PBCom and redefined the loan program. The new management then issued the latest Primer on Bank and Provident Funded Multi-Purpose Loan Programs for Officers and Staff which reads in part: Repayment through pledges/deductions from Mid-year/ Year­-end Bonuses shall be allowed, provided the employee has rendered five [5] years of continuous service with the Bank and the loan amortization cannot be accommodated by his Net Take Home Pay. Under the latest policy, employees whose net take home pay can accommodate the value of their loan amortization are not allowed to use their mid-year and year-end bonuses to pay for their loans. PBCEA opposed the change in the loan program. However, despite its opposition, PBCom unilaterally enforced the latest policy which prevented several employees to use their mid-year and year-end bonuses to pay for their loans and discouraged others from availing themselves of additional loan. This prompted PBCEA to refer the controversy to the Grievance Machinery for possible settlement but to no avail. Service Award Policy Since January 1, 1998, it had been the policy of PBCom to grant, during its anniversary every fourth of September, a Service Award to its employees who have rendered at least ten (10) years of service and to those of them who continue to serve the company every five (5) years thereafter. Under Section II of the policy on Service Award, employees who either retired under the mandatory retirement policy of PBCom or resigned prior to the date of PBCom's anniversary are eligible to receive the award. The policy was formalized in the parties' CBA in Section 2, Article XII thereof. On September 18, 2015, the new management, however, modified the policy on service awards by requiring the employee to be 'on board as of [the] release date or September 4 of each year' to be entitled to the award. Because of the new policy, at least three employees who were otherwise eligible did not receive their Service Award as they were not 'on board' as of the release date. PBCEA opposed the new policy and asked PBCom for its immediate recall, but the latter denied it. Hence, PBCEA referred the controversy to the Grievance Machinery and eventually to the OVA.","In the assailed Decision dated October 18, 2019, the CA partly granted the petition for review of PBCom. The dispositive portion of the assailed Decision reads: The Petition for Review dated 04 May 2018 is PARTLY GRANTED. The assailed Decision dated 20 April 2018 is MODIFIED in that the amendment on the payment of loans through pledges/deductions from mid-year/year-end bonuses, subject to an employee's length of service and the amount of his Net Take Home Pay, is DECLARED a valid imposition. The declaration as void, of the requirement that employees should be on board on the date of PBCom's anniversary to be entitled to the Service Award, is SUSTAINED.","The petition is meritorious. ... The basic and well entrenched rule is that although jurisprudence recognizes the validity of the employer's exercise of its management prerogative and that courts will not ordinarily interfere with such exercise, this prerogative is not absolute. The valid exercise of management prerogative is subject to limitations imposed by law, the collective bargaining agreement, and the general principles of fair play and justice. Therefore, the provisions of the CBA bind all the parties and must be respected during its lifetime because its terms and conditions constitute the law between them. Unless and until a new CBA is executed between the parties, 'they are duty-bound to keep the status quo and to continue in full force and effect the terms and conditions of the existing one.' Further, nothing is clearer than what Article 264 of the Labor Code provides: ARTICLE 264. [253] Duty to Bargain Collectively When There Exists a Collective Bargaining Agreement. — When there is a collective bargaining agreement, the duty to bargain collectively shall also mean that neither party shall terminate nor modify such agreement during its lifetime. x x x It shall be the duty of both parties to keep the status quo and to continue in full force and effect the terms and conditions of the existing agreement during the 60-day period and/or until a new agreement is reached by the parties. All told, PBCom's implementation of the latest policy on its loan program is a blatant disregard or circumvention of Article 264 of the Labor Code. Also, to uphold PBCom's defense that the new policy is a valid exercise of its management prerogative might set a precedent in giving the banks a license to unduly add, modify, or restrict the grant of loans beyond the terms of the CBA under the defense that such act is nothing more than imposing reasonable conditions affecting only the mode of payment of loans.","WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated October 18, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 155585 is MODIFIED in that the new policy of respondent Philippine Bank of Communications unilaterally imposing additional conditions on its employees regarding the allowance of repayment of their loans through pledges/deductions from their mid-year/year-end bonuses and enforcing the same under Section 2, Article XVI of the Collective Bargaining Agreement of the parties is declared ineffective and invalid for being in contravention of Article 264 of the Labor Code. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 249153, September 12, 2022","PRIME STEEL MILL, INCORPORATED, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, RESPONDENT.","On 7 January 2009, petitioner Prime Steel Mill, Incorporated received a Preliminary Assessment Notice (PAN) dated 19 December 2008 from the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), assessing it with deficiency income tax, value-added tax (VAT), and expanded withholding tax (EWT) for taxable year 2005. On 22 January 2009, petitioner filed a letter protesting the PAN.[4] On 12 February 2009, petitioner received a Final Assessment Notice (FAN) and Formal Letter of Demand (FLD) dated 14 January 2009 from the BIR, which reiterated the findings contained in the PAN. Subsequently, petitioner received the Final Decision on Disputed Assessment (FDDA) dated 14 April 2014, which maintained petitioner's liability for deficiency income tax and VAT in the aggregate amount of P37,675,379.58, inclusive of interest and compromise penalties.[6] Petitioner then filed a Petition for Review before the CTA, before which it challenged the validity of the assessments.[7] The CTA Third Division partially granted the Petition, and cancelled the deficiency VAT assessment against petitioner while still upholding its deficiency income tax assessment. Both parties filed Petitions for Review before the CTA En Banc. Before the CTA En Banc, petitioner argued for the first time that the FAN was issued prior to the lapse of the fifteen (15)-day period given to a taxpayer to protest the PAN, hence petitioner's right to due process was violated.[19] The CTA En Banc denied the parties' Petitions, affirming the income tax liability, and holding that there was substantial compliance with the due process requirements.","The CTA En Banc denied the parties' Petitions and affirmed the ruling of the CTA Third Division, upholding the deficiency income tax assessment against the petitioner for taxable year 2005. With regard to the alleged violation of due process due to the premature issuance of the FAN, the CTA En Banc adjudged that there was substantial compliance with the due process requirements in this case considering that petitioner was still able to submit a well-prepared protest letter.",The Petition is meritorious. The issue on the violation of petitioner's right to due process is inextricably linked to the validity of the assessment. The non-observance of the 15-day period to reply to PAN may be resolved by an examination of the evidence on record without requiring the presentation of additional proof. There can be no substantial compliance with the due process requirement when the BIR completely ignored the 15-day period by issuing the FAN and FLD even before petitioner was able to submit its Reply to the PAN. Well-settled is the rule that an assessment that fails to strictly comply with the due process requirements set forth in Section 228 of the Tax Code and Revenue Regulations No. 12-99 is void and produces no effect.,"WHEREFORE, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is hereby GRANTED. The Decision dated 3 January 2019 and the Resolution dated 27 August 2019 of the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc in CTA EB Nos. 1678 and 1680 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The deficiency tax assessments issued against petitioner Prime Steel Mill, Incorporated for taxable year 2005 are declared NULL and VOID and are CANCELLED. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 255397, September 12, 2022","MARLENE D. DE MESA, PETITIONER, VS. RUDY D. PULUTAN AND MEDY P. BUNDALIAN, RESPONDENTS.","The instant legal strife has its provenance in a Complaint for Unlawful Detainer and Damages filed by petitioner Marlene D. De Mesa against respondents Rudy D. Pulutan (Rudy) and Medy P. Bundalian (Medy) before the Municipal Trial Court in Cities (MTCC) of San Pablo City, Laguna. Petitioner avowed that she was the owner of the house and lot located in Barangay Sta. Maria Magdalena, San Pablo City and previously covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-61656. She purchased the said realty from Amelia D. Pulutan (Amelia), the mother of respondents. TCT No. T-61656 was cancelled and a new certificate of title, TCT No. T-75686, was issued in petitioner's name. Prior to the issuance of the new title in 2008, the parties entered into a contract of lease for the same property from October 2006 to September 2007 at a monthly rate of P2,000.00. Thereupon, Amelia continued to occupy the house and lot as lessee thereof, together with Rudy and his family. Having failed to pay rent when it fell due, Amelia was asked to vacate the premises. Instead of moving out, she requested petitioner to allow her to repurchase the property until 30 December 2009. Amelia was unable to repurchase the property before the expiration of the stipulated period, prompting petitioner to demand that she vacate the premises. Petitioner acceded to Amelia's plea to stay therein out of pity and compassion, and considering that she was already old and sickly at that time. Upon Amelia's death on 24 October 2016, petitioner required Rudy to move out of the subject realty, but he refused to do so upon the advisement of Medy. Ultimately, she was impelled to file the instant unlawful detainer case after her demand letter to vacate the property was left unheeded by respondents. For their part, respondents posited, inter alia, that: one, the contract between Amelia and petitioner was actually a real estate mortgage and not a sale as evidenced by Amelia's continued possession of the property until her death; and two, she remained as the owner of the subject house and lot considering that her contract with petitioner was ""akin to an equitable mortgage."" The MTCC ruled it was a sale and ordered respondents to vacate the property, pay P20,000.00 attorney's fees, and P5,000.00 monthly rent. The RTC affirmed the MTCC Decision with modification, reducing the monthly rental fee to P2,000.00.","In the now-impugned Decision, the CA annulled and set aside the RTC Decision and dismissed the Complaint for lack of merit. Delving into the determination of the true nature of the contract between petitioner and Amelia, the CA deemed it evident from the totality of the evidence presented that the purported deed of sale was in sooth an equitable mortgage. Specifically, the CA declared that the essential requisites of an equitable mortgage are present, namely: that the parties entered into a contract denominated as a contract of sale; and that their intention was to secure existing debt by way of a mortgage. In addition, the circumstances under paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 1602 of the Civil Code were extant in the instant case, as shown primarily by Amelia's actual and continuous possession of the realty from the execution of the supposed sale in 2006 until her death in 2016, and even after her failure to repurchase the property on or before 30 December 2009. Finally, the CA did not give credence to petitioner's explanation that she merely tolerated Amelia's possession, given that no sufficient evidence was adduced to prove such allegation.","After a diligent review of the records and a meticulous consideration of the arguments, the Court holds that the instant Petition is bereft of merit. The CA's ruling must perforce be upheld. The Court found no serious error in the CA's provisional ruling on ownership, holding that the presence of even one of the circumstances enumerated in Article 1602 suffices to convert a purported contract of sale into an equitable mortgage. Verily, it is undisputed from the records that Amelia remained in possession of the premises as a lessee, which is one of the badges of equitable mortgage. As the transaction between the parties herein is demonstrably one of equitable mortgage, petitioner did not become owner of the subject property but a mere mortgagee thereof. Given the foregoing discourse, it is crystal clear that petitioner failed to sufficiently comply with all the requirements necessary for the success of an unlawful detainer suit. In light of the finding that the Deed of Sale between petitioner and Amelia was in truth an equitable mortgage, it was properly determined that the latter's possession of the contested realty was in the concept of an owner and not by mere tolerance. The Court also ruled that the CA's provisional determination of ownership in the ejectment case did not constitute a proscribed collateral attack on petitioner's TCT.","WHEREFORE, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is hereby DENIED. The Decision dated 6 March 2020 and the Resolution dated 20 January 2021 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 159665 are AFFIRMED. SO ORDERED."

The CONTRACTOR shall provide AGPH set of organizational chart showing designation of Supervisor/s assigned or deployed at AGPH site. [5] In turn, 9R Manpower hired Ma. Cecilia G. Natividad, Glenn U. Costiniano, and Ben Joseph S. Ison (Natividad, et al.) and Miguel E. Bautista III (Bautista) as project employees, [6] viz.: We are happy to engage your services for the period February 1, 2012 to January 31, 2013, or until such time that the following projects are completed: 1) Quality inspection of glass. 2) Other activities that maybe assigned[.] x x x x It is understood that in the event the above projects are completed at an earlier date, your services shall automatically be considered terminated. Likewise, your services shall be deemed terminated automatically upon expiration of the period above specified without need of further notice. Nothing, however, shall prevent the company from terminating your services sooner for cause. [7] In 2013, Natividad, et al. and Bautista filed a complaint for illegal dismissal and regularization before the Labor Arbiter (LA). [8] Natividad, et al. alleged that 9R Manpower deployed them to Pioneer Float as quality assurance coordinators. In 2012, 9R Manpower disallowed Natividad, et al. to report for work. Whereas, Bautista claimed that he had been working for Pioneer Float since 1998 as truck driver, forklift operator, and glass handler. In 2009, 9R Manpower became Bautista's hiring agency. [9] On the other hand, Pioneer Float denied any employment relationship with Natividad, et al. and Bautista. Pioneer Float asserted its separate and distinct legal personality from 9R Manpower with which it entered a valid service contract. For its part, 9R Manpower contended that it is a legitimate independent service contractor and that it hired Natividad, et al. and Bautista for a fixed period from February 1, 2012 to January 31, 2013 as project employees. On July 12, 2012, Natividad, et al. and Bautista voluntarily resigned and pre-terminated their contracts. Natividad, et al. and Bautista then executed quitclaims releasing 9R Manpower from any liability arising from their employment relationship. [10] On October 8, 2013, the LA dismissed the complaint for lack of merit. The LA ruled that Natividad, et al. have no cause of action for illegal dismissal against Pioneer Float. Admittedly, it was 9R Manpower which hired Natividad, et al. and Bautista as evident from their respective project employment. Yet, Natividad, et al. and Bautista failed to prove that 9R Manpower repeatedly renewed their contracts, or that it employed them for a long period of time. What is extant from the records are Natividad, et al. and Bautista's fixed-term employment contracts and quitclaims. [11] Aggrieved, Natividad, et al. and Bautista appealed to the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC). [12] On November 29, 2013, the NLRC affirmed the LA's findings that Natividad, et al. and Bautista pre-terminated their fixed-term employment and signed the corresponding quitclaims. The NLRC also pointed out that Natividad, et al. and Bautista did not prove any work with Pioneer Float before they entered into job contracts with 9R Manpower. The NLRC likewise ruled that 9R Manpower is a legitimate independent service contractor as shown in the certification issued by the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE). Moreover, the NLRC held that 9R Manpower's audited financial statements established that it has substantial capital and investments in the form of tools, equipment and facilities, and that it undertook the contracted work in its own manner and methods except as to the results. [13]","On October 27, 2015, the CA reversed the labor tribunals' findings and held that 9R Manpower is a labor-only contractor, hence, Natividad, et al. are deemed regular employees of Pioneer Float. However, the CA dismissed Bautista's complaint for lack of merit, [15] thus: While it is true that 9R submitted its financial statements for the year 2012 and 2013 to prove that it has substantial capital and investment, records reveal that 9R does not exercise the right to control the performance of the work of Petitioners. x x x x The above-cited provisions of the service contract readily shows that 9R does not exercise the power of control and supervision over the means and methods of performing the work assigned to Petitioners. The procedure to be followed by Petitioners in inspecting the quality of the glass products of AGC must be in accordance with the ""mutually agreed procedure and method"" between AGC and 9R. The inspection procedure must follow and must be in accordance with the Flow Chart prepared and approved by AGC regular employees. Further, 9R's deployed employees ""must fulfill its assigned tasks within the schedule set by AGC."" Petitioners were deployed to AGC as Quality Control Inspector/Quality Assurance Coordinator, common sense dictates that the procedure or determining whether the glass products of AGC passed its quality standards would necessarily be set by the latter and Petitioners will be expected to follow the same to the letter. Hence, no discretion is left to the Petitioners on how to perform their assigned tasks. Considering that 9R does not exercise the power to control the means and methods of Petitioners' performance of their job, We find 9R as a labor-only contractor. As such, AGC is deemed the employer of Petitioners. x x x x We hold that Petitioners as Quality Control Inspector/Quality Assurance Coordinator are performing activities which are necessary and desirable to the business of AGC as manufacturer of glass products. x x x x Clearly, the said project employment contracts failed to state the specific project or undertaking for which the Petitioners were hired. There is no mention of any project where Petitioners will be deployed to. Further, the work delegated to Petitioners were not specific since other activities may also be assigned to Petitioners. x x x x Hence, Petitioners are clearly regular employees of AGC. Petitioners[,] being regular employees of AGC, they are entitled to security of tenure as provided in Article 279 of the Labor Code, as such[,] Petitioners can only be removed for just cause. x x x x Since Petitioners were suddenly not allowed to work without just cause, We find Petitioners to have been illegally dismissed by AGC. Therefore, Petitioners were entitled to reinstatement with full backwages computed from the time they were not allowed to work until their actual reinstatement. x x x x As to Petitioner Bautista's claim for regularization, since there is nothing in the records of the case that will support his claim for regularization, his claim necessarily fails and cannot be granted by this Court.","Pioneer Float's and 9R Manpower's Petitions are meritorious. The parties raise factual issues which are beyond the ambit of this Court's jurisdiction in a Petition for Review on Certiorari. It is not this Court's task to go over the proofs presented below to ascertain if they were correctly weighed. [22] However, this rule of limited jurisdiction admits of exceptions, and one of them is when the factual findings of the CA and the labor tribunals are contradictory. [23] In this case, the NLRC and the LA concluded that 9R Manpower is a legitimate independent contractor while the CA ruled that it is a labor-only contractor. Considering these conflicting findings, this Court will entertain the factual issues raised in the Petitions. It bears emphasis that the law allows contracting arrangements for the performance of specific jobs, works, or services. It is a management prerogative to outsource any of its activities, whether peripheral or core in nature, provided it is made to an independent contractor. [24] This is because the current rules expressly prohibit labor-only contracting [25] where the contractor or subcontractor merely recruits, supplies, or places workers to perform services for a principal, and where any of the following elements is present: i) The contractor or subcontractor does not have substantial capital or investment which relates to the job, work or service to be performed and the employees recruited, supplied or placed by such contractor or subcontractor are performing activities which are directly related to the main business of the principal; or ii) the contractor does not exercise the right to control over the performance of the work or the contractual employee. [26] Here, records reveal that 9R Manpower's business consists of providing services relative to furnace maintenance, mechanical and electrical maintenance, clerical works, steel fabrication, quality control checking, civil works, and other allied services. [27] Notably, Pioneer Float engaged 9R Manpower to perform a specific job of providing quality control inspection services, which is one of the strong indicators that an entity is an independent contractor. [28] Moreover, 9R Manpower is registered in the list of legitimate contractors and subcontractors. In 2013, 9R Manpower renewed its DOLE Certificate of Registration. Also, 9R Manpower has substantial capital and assets that are necessary in the conduct of its business. Its audited financial statements showed that it has subscribed and paid-up capital stock of P500,000.00 and total assets of P4,996,297.51 when the service contract was executed in 2011. . . . More importantly, 9R Manpower has substantial investment in the form of tools and equipment to carry out the job, work, or service demanded under the service contract. Records show that it provides the materials used in quality control inspection such as safety supplies, e.g., safety shoes, helmet with chin strap, knitted and canvass gloves, eye goggles, sleeve protector, and medical supplies, tools and equipment, e.g., meter tape, micrometer, and scale lupe, and cleaning materials, and office stationery items. [33] . . . Further, 9R Manpower owns the truck and forklift which Bautista used in carrying out his duties. [35] Taken together, these circumstances lead to no other conclusion that an independent and permissible contractor relationship exists between Pioneer Float and 9R Manpower. Accordingly, Natividad, et al. and Bautista remain the employees of 9R Manpower and not Pioneer Float. Even applying the four-fold test of employment relationship, namely: (1) the selection and engagement of the employee or the power to hire; (2) the payment of wages; (3) the power to dismiss; and (4) the power to control the employee, [36] would reveal that 9R Manpower is the true employer of Natividad, et al. and Bautista. First, with regard to the power to hire, 9R Manpower executed employment contracts with Natividad, et al. and Bautista and has custody of all the pre-employment records. . . . Second, with respect to the payment of wages, it was shown that Natividad, et al. and Bautista directly received their salaries from 9R Manpower, [37] which deducted and remitted their Social Security System, [38] PAG-IBIG, [39] and Philippine Health Insurance Corporation premium contributions. [40] Third, as to the power to dismiss, it is 9R Manpower that issued disciplinary memoranda to employees who violated the company rules and regulations. The memoranda describe the nature of the offense and cited the corresponding penalty. [41] There is no evidence that Pioneer Float wielded such authority. Lastly, concerning the power of control, it is 9R Manpower that issued Work Instructions [42] to Natividad, et al. and Bautista which detailed the specific steps to correctly perform their quality assurance tasks. Also, 9R Manpower prescribed the daily work schedule of employees, [43] maintained their attendance sheets, [44] and required leave forms from those who failed to report for work. [45] Pioneer Float had no hand in selecting who among the inspectors shall be assigned to it. More telling is that 9R Manpower assigned the supervisors who monitored the proper performance of the work of its employees pursuant to Section 6 of the service contract which the CA completely disregarded. Contrary to the CA's interpretation, the phrase ""mutually agreed procedure and method"" in Section 1 of the service contract is insufficient to establish the required degree of control on the part of Pioneer Float over the work performance of the inspectors. . . . Verily, Natividad, et al. and Bautista utterly failed to show how Pioneer Float controlled the performance of their tasks, other than the desired results. Without convincing evidence that the principal subjected the contractor's employees to its effective control as to the manner or method by which they conduct their work, this Court holds that no employer-employee relationship exists between Pioneer Float and Natividad, et al. and Bautista. In illegal dismissal cases, it is incumbent upon the employee to first establish by substantial evidence the fact of his or her termination from the service before the employer bears the burden of proving that it was for a valid or authorized cause. If there is no dismissal, then there can be no question as to its legality or illegality. [48] Here, Natividad, et al. did not submit evidence proving actual or constructive dismissal, and how they were terminated or prevented from returning to their work. The bare allegation of having been dismissed from the service cannot be given credence. [49] Similarly, Bautista's claim for regularization was unsubstantiated. Bautista failed to present any document or witness showing that he worked for Pioneer Float before he entered into contracts with 9R Manpower. In contrast, the records show that Natividad, et al. and Bautista are fixed-term project employees. . . . The fact that an employee is engaged to perform activities that are necessary and desirable in the usual business of the employer does not prohibit the fixing of employment for a definite period, [56] . . . Yet, Natividad, et al. and Bautista voluntarily resigned and pre-terminated their contracts. The intention to leave their posts became more evident when they executed the quitclaims.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petitions in G.R. Nos. 225293 and 225314 are GRANTED.

OCT No. P-3303 was issued on January 8, 1984, by virtue of Free Patent No. (IV- 19)-3005. Petitioners and the spouses Binay have been in lawful and peaceful possession of the subject property since 1945. On August 22, 2005, respondents, through force, threat, and intimidation, with bolos tucked in their waist, prevented Anselmo's son, Efren Binay and his three (3) helpers from gathering ripe fruits at the subject property. Subsequently, in October 2005, respondents fenced the subject property. Respondents filed their Answer alleging that they are members of the Iraya-Mangyans Tribe of Puerto Galera, Oriental Mindoro, and have been in peaceful possession and occupation of the subject property, which is their ancestral land, since the time of their ancestors, now covered under Certificate of Ancestral Domains Title (CADT) No. R04-PUE-0404-023. The Municipal Circuit Trial Court (MCTC) granted the complaint for forcible entry on March 25, 2008, holding that petitioners are the absolute and lawful registered owners of the subject property, and that possession is an attribute of ownership. The Regional Trial Court (RTC) affirmed the MCTC ruling on October 27, 2008. The Court of Appeals (CA) subsequently reversed the findings of the MCTC and the RTC in a Decision dated July 23, 2015, holding that petitioners failed to establish by a preponderance of evidence their material or physical possession of the subject property from 1945 to August 2005, remarking that their title OCT No. P-3303 and tax declaration do not prove their prior physical possession.","This resolves the Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court filed by petitioners Heirs of Spouses Anselmo and Sevilla Binay, Asuncion B.

Petitioners presented OCT No. P-3303 from Free Patent No. (IV-19)-3005, as proof of their ownership of the subject property, coupled with a tax declaration. Well-settled is the rule that a person who has a Torrens title over the property is entitled to its possession. The Court stressed that possession may be acquired not only through material occupation, but also through juridical acts, such as the registration of public instruments. Moreover, the petitioners presented documents such as the Joint Affidavit of witnesses, the Lands Examiner Report confirming Anselmo's occupation and possession since May 1945, and the Order of approval of Anselmo's application for Free Patent, which strongly proved their possession prior to respondents' entry. The grant of the free patent and the issuance of the corresponding title to petitioners enjoy the presumption of regularity. The petitioners’ evidence, consisting of muniments of title, a tax declaration, and other public records proving prior possession are far more convincing than the respondents' one-sided affidavits (Sinumpaang Salaysay).","WHEREFORE , premises considered, the petition is hereby GRANTED .

Despite granting two extensions, the CA issued a Resolution dated February 13, 2018, denying the Third Motion for Extension of Time to File Appellant's Brief and dismissing his appeal, treating his failure to file the required brief as an abandonment.

A distinction must be made between the failure to file a notice of appeal (fatal) and the failure to file a brief (which results in abandonment). Where the appellant is represented by a counsel de officio, the appeal should not be dismissed outright as the rule on filing briefs on time is not automatically applied to the appellant. If accused-appellant's appeal is denied due course, he could be wrongfully imprisoned for life over a mere technicality. Procedural rules take a step back when the life and liberty of the accused is at stake. The dismissal of the appeal on purely technical grounds is frowned upon because the general policy is to encourage hearings of appeals on their merits.

MANUEL MATEO;* MAGDALENA MATEO LORENZO, ASSISTED BY HER HUSBAND, JAIME LORENZO; CAMELIA** HOMES, OWNED AND OPERATED BY COMMUNITIES ISABELA, INC.; & REGISTER OF DEEDS OF ILAGAN & SANTIAGO, RESPONDENTS.","Teodoro Tulauan (Teodoro) was the absolute and registered owner of a parcel of land located in Santiago, Isabela (now Santiago City) and covered by Original Certificate of Title No. P-1080 (subject property). Sometime in the early 1950s, Teodoro left Santiago and resided in Tuguegarao, Cagayan for security reasons. Nonetheless, he visited his property from time to time and continued to pay the real estate taxes due thereon.[7] In 1953, the Registry of Deeds of Isabela (Registry of Deeds) issued Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-4232 covering the subject property in the name of Manuel. The subject property was thereafter divided into four (4) lots — Lot Nos. 938-A-1 to 938-A-4. In turn, Lot No. 938-A-4 was further subdivided into four (4) more lots — Lot Nos. 938-A-4-A to 938-A-4-D. Manuel then sold Lot Nos. 938-A-1, 938-A-2, 938-A-3, 938-A-4-B, and 938-A-4-C to different buyers.[8] In 1979, the Registry of Deeds issued TCT No. 118858 covering Lot No. 938-A-4-D in the name of Magdalena.[9] Later on, the Heirs discovered that the title to the subject property under the name of Teodoro was cancelled by virtue of a deed of conveyance, the copy of which was burned when the Registry of Deeds was gutted by fire. Upon further verification with the Bureau of Lands, the Heirs found out that sometime in 1981, a certain Lope H. Soriano presented a deed of conveyance transferring the title to the subject property under his name.[10] The foregoing antecedents prompted the Heirs, represented by Tito Tulauan, to file a Complaint[11] before the RTC against respondents for annulment of documents, reconveyance with prayer for the issuance of a temporary restraining order, and damages. In essence, the Heirs asserted that the TCTs under the names of respondents Manuel and Magdalena were fraudulently issued because the transfer of the ownership of the subject property was based on an inexistent document.[12] Respondents Magdalena[13] and the owner of Camella Homes, Communities Isabela, Inc. (respondent CHCII),[14] filed their respective answers with counterclaims wherein both moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the Heirs had no cause of action against them. In addition, respondent Magdalena raised the defense that the action for reconveyance was already barred by prescription and/or laches.[15]","This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court seeking to reverse and set aside the Decision[2] dated July 31, 2018 and the Resolution[3] dated July 15, 2019 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 107610. The CA affirmed the Orders dated September 16, 2014[4] and June 20, 2016[5] of Branch 36, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Santiago City that dismissed the Complaint[6] for annulment of documents, reconveyance, and damages filed by petitioner Heirs of Teodoro Tulauan (Heirs) against respondents Manuel Mateo (Manuel), Magdalena Mateo Lorenzo (Magdalena), Camella Homes, and the Registry of Deeds of Santiago City (collectively, respondents) for being barred by prescription and laches, for failure to state a cause of action, and for lack of merit.","In the case, the action for reconveyance hinges on a supposed inexistent contract that became the basis for the issuance of TCT-(T-118858) SC-46663.[56] Evidently, the foundation of the complaint for reconveyance is the absence or inexistence of a deed or instrument transferring ownership of the subject property in favor of respondent Manuel. Following Article 1410 of the New Civil Code, the action for reconveyance filed by the Heirs is thus imprescriptible. Because it is apparent that the complaint on its face does not show that the action had already prescribed, the RTC erred in dismissing it on such ground. It must be stressed that the summary or outright dismissal of the action for reconveyance based on the pleadings of the parties was not proper as there are factual matters in dispute. These factual matters are better threshed out in a full-blown trial to prove that, indeed, the issuance of the title was based on an inexistent contract. In addition, the Court agrees with the submission of the Heirs that the RTC likewise erred in dismissing the complaint on the ground of laches. ... All told, the trial court, as affirmed by the CA, gravely erred when it dismissed the action for reconveyance on the grounds of prescription and laches, and on the ground that the title to the subject property had already passed to an innocent purchaser and for value. The issues are factual in nature that should be threshed out in a full-blown trial on the merits and after the appreciation of the pieces of evidence presented by all parties concerned.","WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated July 31, 2018 and the Resolution dated July 15, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 107610 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

"G.R. No. 214588, September 07, 2022","PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK BINALBAGAN BRANCH, BINALBAGAN, NEGROS OCCIDENTAL, PETITIONER, VS. ANTONIO TAD-Y, FOR HIMSELF AND AS ATTORNEY-IN-FACT OF PATRICIA TAD-Y, ET AL., RESPONDENTS.","On January 30, 1975, the spouses Jose Tad-y and Patricia Toledanes Tad-y (spouses Tad-y) obtained an agricultural sugar crop loan from the Binalbagan, Negros Oriental Branch of PNB, in the amount of P109,000.00. To secure the loan, PNB and the spouses Tad-y executed a Real Estate Mortgage (REM) over six (6) parcels of land located at Himamaylan City and Hinigaran, both in Negros Occidental. On August 14, 1975, the spouses Tad-y obtained another agricultural sugar crop loan from PNB in the amount of P63,000.00. On August 9, 1988, two of the parcels covered by the REM, Lots 778 and 788, were sold on auction by the provincial treasurer of Negros Occidental, for failure to pay real property taxes thereon. PNB participated in the auction and won as the sole bidder, for a total price of P10,609.63. On August 23, 1989, the provincial treasurer conveyed the parcels to PNB through the issuance of two Final Bills of Sale. Sometime in November 1995, the spouses Tad-y availed of the loan restructuring provisions of Republic Act No. 7202. A year later, the spouses completed the payments on the two loans. Accordingly, on March 6, 1996, PNB executed a deed of release of the REM. However, PNB excluded Lots 778 and 788 from the release, claiming that it had already acquired title to said lots by virtue of the auction sale. Through letters dated July 19, 2001 and October 23, 2003, Patricia Toledanes Tad-y (Patricia) asked PNB to release Lots 778 and 788 and manifested her willingness to reimburse PNB for the price it paid in the auction sale. PNB reiterated that it had already acquired ownership of Lots 778 and 788; but it was willing to negotiate the repurchase of the lots. On March 23, 2004, Patricia and her children (the Tad-ys), represented by herein respondent Antonio Tad-y, filed the present complaint for breach of contract and reconveyance of property before the RTC of Himamaylan City.","The RTC of Himamaylan City in Civil Case No. 912 rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendant, ordering the defendant, Philippine National Bank, to reconvey title of Lot No. 788, covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-235S0 and Lot No. 778 covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 2S24 now T-261298 to the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs are hereby ordered to pay the defendant, the acquisition price in the auction sale and other expenses relative thereto plus interest, at the rate of twelve (12%) per cent per annum. The CA affirmed the RTC decision, concluding that PNB's purchase of the disputed lots should inure to the benefit of the Tad-ys based on the agency provisions of the REM and that a constructive trust was created over the disputed lots.","The Court ruled that the CA's refusal to pass upon the defense of prescription was justified because it was not apparent on the face of the complaint and involved factual matters first raised on appeal. While the Court sustained PNB's contention that its obligation to advance real property taxes arose only in case of judicial foreclosure, it found that PNB's purchase of the lots at the tax sale constituted an act of administration under the general agency clause (paragraph (d)) of the REM, done to protect its interest as mortgagee. Since the loans were fully paid in 1996, PNB's interest in the properties became functus officio. As an agent, PNB cannot acquire title adverse to its principal. PNB was found guilty of constructive fraud for breaching its fiduciary duty when it refused to release the disputed lots, resulting in a constructive trust under Article 1456 of the Civil Code in favor of the Tad-ys.","The present petition is hereby DENIED. The April 16, 2013 Decision and the September 4, 2014 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 01412 are AFFIRMED."
"G.R. No. 210422, September 07, 2022","LAND BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES, PETITIONER, VS. SPOUSES LYDIA G. CORTEZ AND CARLOS CORTEZ, RESPONDENTS.","Spouses Cortez are the owners of a coconut land, identified as Lot 181893, Cad. 56, located at Villahermosa, Daraga, Albay, with an area of approximately 16.5415 hectares and covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-45714. [8] On January 5, 2000, spouses Cortez offered the aforesaid property for acquisition under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program. [9] Thus, sometime in April 2000, the necessary notice of coverage was issued by DAR. Thereafter, on April 24, 2000, LBP together with the DAR representative, the Municipal Agrarian Reform Officer of Daraga, Albay, and the Barangay Agrarian Reform Council representative, conducted a field investigation of spouses Cortez' property. [10] The field investigation revealed that only 6.004 hectares of the 16.5415 hectares are fit for acquisition under the agrarian reform program. [11] On September 26, 2001, the DAR issued a Memorandum Request to Value Land [12] addressed to LBP. LBP received the claims folder on September 27, 2001. [13] Thus, on January 15, 2002, the Register of Deeds of Albay partially cancelled TCT No. 45715 and issued TCT No. T-127132 in the name of the Republic of the Philippines, represented by the DAR covering the 6.0004-hectare area (subject property) of the property subject of agrarian reform. [14] LBP conducted the land valuation for the subject property using the two-factor formula prescribed under AO No. 5, Series of 1998 and arrived at the amount of P106,542.98 or P17,755.98 per hectare as the initial determination of the Subject Property's valuation. LBP computed its preliminary valuation using the following formula and values: [15] Computation of Land Value of acquired area of 6.0004 hectares coconut land: Land Value = (CNI [16] x 0.9) + (MV [17] x 0.1) CNI = (AGP [18] x SP [19] x NIR [20] ) 0.12 = 480 kg./ha. x P6.44/kg. x 70% 0.12 = P18,032.00 /hectare MV for Land = UMV [21] x Location Adj.

[24] Because of their rejection of LBP's offer, the amount was deposited in the names of spouses Cortez as provisional compensation on December 20, 2001 in accordance with Section 16(e) of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 6657. [25] Thus, the matter was elevated to the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB), which eventually rendered a decision fixing the compensation for the acquired subject property at P183,273.93. [26] LBP rejected the determination made by the DARAB, as the decision did not include the computation on how the amount was arrived at and its basis. [27] Accordingly, LBP filed a Petition for Determination of Just Compensation [28] before the RTC docketed as Agrarian Case No. 07-02, arguing that the preliminary determination of valuation of the subject property made by LBP was in accordance with Section 17 of R.A. No. 6657. [29]","In its Decision dated July 9, 2013, the Court of Appeals denied LBP's petition for review and affirmed the RTC's Decision, the dispositive portion of which reads: WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the Petition for Review is DENIED. The Decision, dated December 21, 2011, rendered by the Regional Trial Court of Legazpi City, Branch 3 in Agrarian Case No. 07-02, is AFFIRMED. SO ORDERED.","Given the foregoing, We find the RTC's deviation from the law, DAR issuance, and established jurisprudence is an ""utter and blatant disregard of the factors"" laid down therein and amounts to grave abuse of discretion. [72] ... In the present case, there is no dispute that the claims folder for the subject property was received by LBP on September 27, 2001 [86] placing it well within the ambit of R.A. No. 6657 and AO No. 5, Series of 1998 and beyond the scope and applicability of the amendments introduced by R.A. No. 9700 and DAR guidelines issued in relation thereto. Clearly, therefore, the RTC had no basis to apply the presumptive date of taking prescribed under R.A. No. 9700 and as further reiterated under AO No. 1, Series of 2010. Thus, the RTC committed grave abuse of discretion when it abandoned the reckoning periods for the production values and data prescribed under AO No. 5, Series of 1998. Given the foregoing discussion, this Court finds cogent and compelling reason to set aside the decision of the CA. III. Imposable Interest... legal interest shall be fixed at the rate of twelve percent (12%) interest per annum from the time of taking, which in this case was on January 15, 2002, until June 30, 2013. From July 1, 2013, until finality of the Decision, interest shall be at six percent (6%) per annum. Thereafter, the total amount of compensation shall earn legal interest at six percent (6%) per annum from the finality of the Decision until its full payment.","WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Petition for Review on Certiorari dated January 17, 2014 filed by petitioner Land Bank of the Philippines is PARTIALLY GRANTED. Accordingly, the Decision dated July 9, 2013 and the Resolution dated December 16, 2013 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 123233 are ANNULLED and SET ASIDE.

"G.R. No. 238545, September 07, 2022","UNITRA MARITIME MANILA, INC., VT MARITIME INC., AND/OR CAPT. VICTOR M. VILLANUEVA, PETITIONERS, VS. GIOVANNIE B. CAMPANERO, RESPONDENT.","On April 22, 2014, Unitra hired Campanero as Second (2nd) Officer for its foreign principal, VT Maritime. The contract was consistent with the provisions of the POEA-Standard Employment Contract (POEA-SEC) and All Japan Seaman's Union Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). On May 29, 2014, Campanero departed from the Philippines and boarded the vessel, M/V Mount Akaboshi.[4] A month after the vessel left the shores of Manila, Campanero suddenly felt weakness on his lower extremities while lifting heavy provisions. The following day, he began experiencing sharp pains on his lower back with numbness on his right leg. His condition, however, did not stop him from doing the rounds of work. When his condition kept on, Campanero requested for an on-shore medical assessment in Japan, during which time, he was diagnosed with disc hernia and was immediately repatriated. Upon arrival, he was immediately referred to the company designated physicians at Manila Doctors Hospital (MDH). While undergoing medical procedures, Campanero's condition further deteriorated such that he could no longer stand by himself. Accordingly, Campanero went through a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) where he was found to have arteriovenous malformation, ruptured intramedullary with difficulty in bowel movement.[5] Subsequently, Campanero underwent surgery. After his discharge, he was scheduled for rehabilitation treatment for his lumbar spine injury until April 2015 when Unitra withheld further medical aid. No disability grading was ever issued by the company-designated physician after the lapse of 240 days.[6] Given his condition, Campanero sought an independent physician, Dr. Francis Pimentel (Dr. Pimentel), a Specialist in Physical Medicine, who found that he was suffering from the following: 1. positive paraplegia on the lower extremities graded as 1-2/5 in manual muscle testing; 2. positive 90 percent sensory deficits in the lower extremities; and 3. positive bowel and bladder incontinence.[7] In the Medical Report[8] dated August 3, 2015 issued by Dr. Pimentel, he pointed out that Campanero's illness was caused by his working conditions and that he still suffered from sensory motor problems even after his rehabilitation therapy with the MDH. The pertinent portion of the Medical Report reads: Based on the MRC tests, the patient has spinal cord pathology. Upon confirmation of the spinal cord pathology with the biopsy test done at Manila Doctors Hospital, the result revealed arteriovenous malformation with recent and old hemorrhage. On the discharge summary issued by Manila Doctors Hospital[,] it states that the discharge diagnosis as Arteriovenous malformation; ruptured intramedullary s/p laminectomy T3, T4, T5, excision of arteriovenous malformation. To summarize the test results and intraoperative findings, the patient has a diagnosis of complete spinal cord injury secondary to a ruptured arteriovenous malformation. The bending and lifting activities that the patient engaged in during the lashing operations has brought about the arteriovenous malformation to rupture and cause [hemorrhages]. These led to the spinal cord injury of the patient manifesting as paraplegia with severe weakness and numbness in both lower extremities with absent bowel and bladder control. Although surgery was attempted to address the spinal cord, injury, the attempt was unsuccessful. Even if the patient had regular physical therapy sessions after the spine surgery until August of 2015[,] no improvement in motor and sensory recovery were obtained. At present, the patient cannot stand on his own and could not walk without assistance; he also has no control with (sic) his bowel movements and has urinary incontinence. With his present medical condition[,] he is unfit for work with permanent disability.[9] Campanero also consulted Dr. Rogelio Catapang, Jr. (Dr. Catapang), an orthopedic surgeon who outlined the nature of his condition and concurred with the findings and recommendations of Dr. Pimentel.[10] Noting Campanero's heavy work demands, Dr. Catapang opined that Campanero's spinal arteriovenous malformation was a rare abnormal tangle of blood vessels on, or near the spinal cord and if left untreated, the spinal arteriovenous malformation could permanently damage the spinal cord. Accordingly, Campanero sought assistance from Unitra and VT Maritime but his plea fell on deaf ears, forcing him to litigate.[11]","After due proceedings, the Labor Arbiter (LA) issued a Decision dated March 21, 2016, the decretal portion of which reads: ""WHEREFORE, premises considered, respondents Unitra Maritime Manila, Inc. and VT Maritime, Inc. are hereby ordered, jointly and solidarily, to pay complainant Giovanni B. Campanero permanent and total disability compensation in the amount of USD127,932.00 or its equivalent in Philippine Currency at the time of payment. Respondents are further ordered to pay complainant his sickness allowance in the amount of USD4,181.67 or its equivalent in Philippine Currency at the time of payment. Finally, respondents are assessed attorney's fees equivalent to ten percent of the total award or the amount of USD13,211.36 or its equivalent in Philippine Currency at the time of payment. All other claims are denied. The complaint against individual respondent Capt. Victor M. Villanueva is dismissed with prejudice. SO ORDERED."" [12] On appeal, the NLRC reversed the LA's disposition and declared that Campanero is not entitled to permanent total disability compensation. The NLRC noted that Campanero failed to obtain a second opinion from his doctors before lodging a labor complaint, which negates any cause of action against Unitra and VT Maritime. He also did not ask for the opinion of a third doctor, thereby making his complaint premature. As regards Campanero's illness, the NLRC upheld the findings of the company designated physician that his illness was not work-related. The NLRC dismissed Campanero's claim that his work as 2nd Officer contributed to the development of his illness. The dispositive portion of the May 31, 2016 Decision of the NLRC reads as follows: ""WHEREFORE, the Respondents' appeal is GRANTED. The assailed Decision dated March 21, 2016 of Labor Arbiter Fe S. Cellan is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE, and a new one is rendered DISMISSING the complaint. SO ORDERED."" [13] Aggrieved by the setback, Campanero went to the CA via a Petition for Certiorari[14] claiming that the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion in denying his disability claim. On September 18, 2017, the CA rendered its assailed Decision,[15] granting Campanero's Petition for Certiorari and setting aside the May 31, 2016 Decision and June 30, 2016 Resolution of the NLRC. The decretal portion of the aforesaid decision states: WHEREFORE, premises considered, the assailed Decision and Resolution of the National Labor Relations Commission dated [M]ay 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016 respectively, are NULLIFIED and SET ASIDE. Accordingly, the Decision of the Labor Arbiter dated March 21, 2016 is REINSTATED. SO ORDERED.[16] In reversing the NLRC's decision, the CA explained that the courts are not bound by the assessment of the company-designated physician and the seafarer is given the freedom of choosing his/her own medical specialist. In case of conflict, the determination of which diagnosis should prevail would primarily depend on the attendant facts and expertise of the physicians and the courts are not precluded from awarding disability benefits on the basis of the medical opinion of the seafarer's physician.[17] The CA added that while Campanero was found to be suffering from hematomyelia, a disorder which is commonly associated with spinal vascular malformations and often congenital, the said illness can also be traced to trauma or injury to the spinal cord. Considering that Campanero suffered spinal trauma after lifting heavy objects on board the vessel, there is a probable connection between his injury and his work. As opined by the CA, it is not a coincidence that Campanero's spinal trauma simply emerged at the same time (and spot) as the hemorrhaging of his spine.[18] As a result, the CA ordered the payment of Campanero's disability compensation. The CA subsequently denied Unitra and VT Maritime's Motion for Reconsideration.[19]","This Court is not convinced. Records disclosed that respondent was able to show a reasonable connection between the nature of his work on board the vessel and the illness that befell him. As briefly discussed by the CA: x x x petitioner's final diagnosis is hematomyelia or spinal cord hematoma/hemorrhage. Medical journals refer to it as hemorrhage into the substance of the spinal cord. This disorder is commonly associated with spinal vascular malformations such as intradura1 arteriovenous malformations and intramedullary cavernomas, also known as cavernous malformation or angioma or cavernous hemagioma (as indicated in the same medical report). Cavernous angiomas are vascular lesions comprised of clusters of abnormally dilated blood vessels. It is often congenital (genetics) appearing mostly in people with Hispanic-American-heritage but, in some cases, the angioma is traced to radiation, trauma[,] or other injury to the spinal cord. In the present instance, it is not disputed that petitioner suffered spinal trauma while performing his job on board the vessel, which the attending physician himself diagnosed as disc bulge in agreement to petitioner's initial diagnosis in Japan (i.e, disc bulge is used interchangeably with disc hernia or herniated di[s]c). The term ""disc bulge"" is, in, fact, mentioned in the same line as hematomyelia and cavernous hemagioma in the physician's (sic) medical report. Thus, while the private respondents would later vehemently repudiate the connection, it is not denied that there exists a pathological relation between petitioner's herniated disc and the hemorrhaging of his spine. It is not a coincidence that the latter simply emerged at the same time (and the same spot) as the disc hernia. One is clearly consistent with the other.[39] Meanwhile, the LA's ruling highlighted the possibility that respondent's working conditions aggravated his illness, viz.: It has not escaped the attention of this Arbitration Office that only the illness of hematomyelia was considered by the company-designated physician to be not work-related as can be gleaned from his medical report dated 26 August 2014. In their attempt to expand its coverage, the respondents reasoned out that complainant's hematomyelia resulted from its Arterovenous Malformation. This Office has reviewed all the medical reports appended by the respondents to their Position paper and there is nothing stated in the said reports which would even suggest that complainant's hematomyelia was caused by or related to his arteriovenous malformation. Hematomyelia or Intramedullary Spinal Cord Hemorrhage can be caused by traumatic events such as spinal cord injury. Complainant's duties involved lifting of heavy objects during cargo operations subjected his back and spine to constant strain. This most likely caused the development of his illness. The company-designated physician's bare allegation that hematomyelia is not work-related without explanation to support this, cannot be given any evidentiary weight. Anent complainant's arteriovenous malformation, the record is bereft of any proof that the same is not work-related. In fact, medical literature would claim that its cause is not yet known. Nonetheless, Section 20(A)(4) of the POEA Standard Employment Contract provides that illnesses not listed in Section 32 thereof like the complainant's arteriovenous malformation, are disput/*/*ably presumed as work-related. x x x Hence, unless contract evidence is presented by the seafarer's employer/s[,] this disputable presumption stands. In this controversy, the respondents never presented any contrary evidence to overcome the said presumption. It is for this reason that the same should be considered as work-related, hence, compensable.[40] ... To reiterate, it is enough that the seafarer's employment contributed, even in a small degree, to the development of the disease.[41] Only reasonable proof of work connection is required, and not direct causation. In resolving compensability, this Court only looks for probability, not the ultimate degree of certainty.[42] Neither is respondent's complaint for disability compensation rendered premature by his failure to refer the matter to a third doctor pursuant to Section 20(A)(3) of the 2010 POEA-SEC. It bears stressing that a seafarer's compliance with the conflict resolution procedure under the said provision presupposes that the company-designated physician came up with an assessment as to his/her fitness or unfitness to work before the expiration of the 120-day treatment period or 240-day extended period.[43] In the present case, while the company-designated physician, Dr. Nicomedes G. Cruz (Dr. Cruz), issued a Medical Report[44] dated August 26, 2014 or 11 days on treatment, stating that respondent's illness of hematomyelia is not work-related, the said report can only be regarded as interim assessment considering that Dr. Cruz subsequently recommended him to undergo surgery and physical therapy. The same holds true for the last Medical Report which Dr. Cruz issued on April 17, 2015 or 242 days on treatment, merely noting respondent's current medical status as follows: Report: 21st Patient was discharged today from the hospital. Diagnosis: AV Malformation, T4 S/P Laminectomy, Excision of AV Malformation (December 7, 2014)[45] Further, there was no definite statement of fitness to return to work or final disability rating given by Dr. Cruz. Observably, either medical assessments offered no explanation as to the cause of respondent's illness and the reason why it was considered not work-related. The responsibility of the company-designated physician to arrive at a definite assessment within the prescribed periods necessitates that the perceived disability rating has been properly established and inscribed in a valid and timely medical report. ... Clearly, the failure of the company-designated physician to make a definite assessment on the condition of respondent within the timeframe provided by law cannot leave respondent in limbo. Hence, although respondent did consult an independent physician regarding his ailment, the lack of a conclusive and definite assessment from Dr. Cruz left him nothing to properly contest and as such, negates the need for him to comply with the third doctor referral provision under the 2010 POEA-SEC.[47] Accordingly, the law automatically stepped in to consider respondent's disability as total and permanent.[48] With the declaration that respondent is totally and permanently disabled by operation of law, in view of the company-designated physician's failure to issue a final assessment within the given period, the other matter to be considered is the amount of benefits due him under the 2010 POEA-SEC or the CBA,[49] of which he is a member. ... Here, since the company-designated physician failed to arrive at a final and definitive assessment of respondent's disability within the given periods, the law considered him to be totally and permanently disabled, which is classified as Grade 1[53] under the POEA-SEC. As such, its equivalent rate under the CBA is 100% rating, and the amount of compensation for respondent's position as 2nd Officer or 2nd Mate, which is for ""Junior Officers""[54] for the year 2014, is in the amount of US$127,932.00, or its equivalent in Philippine Currency. We are also constrained to affirm the LA and CA's grant of sickness allowance to respondent in the absence of evidence that the same has been paid by petitioners. The sickness allowance should be at the rate of US$965.00 per month for a period of 130 days pursuant to Article 11 of the CBA or a total amount of US$4,181.67, or its equivalent in Philippine Currency. Further, respondent's claim being an action for employer's liability, he is also entitled to receive attorney's fees.","ACCORDINGLY, the petition is DENIED. The Decision dated September 18, 2017 and the Resolution dated March 26, 2018 of the Court of Appeals in CA-GR SP No. 147288 are hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION entitling respondent GIOVANNIE B. CAMPANERO to receive solidarily from petitioners Unitra Maritime Manila, Inc. and VT Maritime Inc., the following: 1. Total and Permanent Disability benefit in the amount of US$127,932.00, or its equivalent in Philippine Currency; 2. Sickness Allowance in the amount of US$4,181.67, or its equivalent in Philippine Currency; 3. Attorney's fees equivalent to ten percent (10%) of the total monetary award; and 4.

CATHARINA BROUWER, REPRESENTED HEREIN BY ATTORNEY-IN-FACT MANFRED DE KONING, RESPONDENT.","Respondent is the registered owner of two condominium units (subject units), described as Unit Nos. 16-I and 16-J, at the LPL Greenhills Condominium located in San Juan City. She failed to settle her monthly association dues and other assessments, inclusive of penalties and interests. [5] On October 23, 2007, LPL issued notices of assessment amounting to P181,241.10 per unit to respondent. The notices were also annotated on the respective CCTs of the subject units on November 21, 2007. Nonetheless, respondent still failed to pay her obligation, which amounted to P252,983.19 for Unit 16-I and P227,168.58 for Unit 16-J as of August 31, 2008. [6] Consequently, on August 20, 2008, LPL filed separate petitions to sell in extrajudicial foreclosure the subject units pursuant to Section 20 [7] of Republic Act No. (RA) 4726, otherwise known as the Condominium Act, and Part II, Section 4(c)(e)(f) of LPL's Master Deed of Restrictions. The required notices of sale were posted for at least 20 days in at least three public places in San Juan City and published in the September 10, 17 and 24, 2008 issues of the Star Forum Newspaper for Unit 16-I and The Manila Times for Unit 16-J. [8] Sheriffs Elmer B. David and Bienvenido V. Calindas, Jr., conducted the extrajudicial foreclosure sales at San Juan City Hall, [9] thus: Unit [10] CCT Nos. [11] Successful bidder [12] Bid [13] Unit 16-I CCT No. 11113-R Salazar and Leviste P500,000.00 Unit 16-J CCT No. 11114-R Sps. Arboleda P500,000.00 The corresponding certificates of sale, both dated November 12, 2008, were issued to the buyers and registered with the Registry of Deeds on November 28, 2008. [14] Respondent, through her attorney-in-fact, Manfred De Koning (Manfred), filed a Complaint for declaration of nullity of foreclosure proceedings including certificates of sale, quieting of title, and damages against petitioners. She argued that the extrajudicial foreclosure sales of the subject units were null and void for the following reasons: (1) LPL's Master Deed of Restrictions and By-Laws did not authorize the extrajudicial foreclosure of the units in favor of LPL, as required by Act No. 3135, [15] as amended by Act No. 4118; [16] (2) there was no board resolution from LPL authorizing the extrajudicial foreclosure; and (3) the extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings were void for lack of proper notice. [17] Citing the case of Chateau de Baie Condominium Corp. v. Spouses Moreno [18] ( Chateau de Baie ), petitioners countered that a special authority from the unit owner is not required before a condominium corporation can initiate foreclosure proceedings for unpaid membership dues. [19] In an Order dated May 2, 2012, Branch 264, RTC of Pasig City limited the issue as to whether the extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings and auction sales were valid, considering that no document exists and that the Master Deed of Restrictions contains no provision designating LPL as respondent's attorney-in-fact to extra-judicially foreclose and sell at public auction the subject units. [20] On September 30, 2015, the RTC declared that pursuant to the parties' agreement, the case was deemed submitted for decision based on the parties' respective position papers. [21]","In the Decision [24] dated March 29, 2019, the CA affirmed the RTC with the modification that the award of attorney's fees be deleted, thus: WHEREFORE, the appeal is PARTLY GRANTED. The decision of the Regional Trial Court of Pasig City (stationed in San Juan City), Branch 264 dated December 8, 2015 in Civil Case No. 72286-SJ is AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATION that the award of attorney's fees is DELETED. IT IS SO ORDERED. [25] (Emphasis omitted) Although the CA agreed with petitioners that extrajudicial foreclosure sales are not exclusive to mortgages in view of Section 20 of the Condominium Act, the CA agreed with the RTC that LPL must still provide evidence of its special authority to cause the extrajudicial foreclosure of a condominium. It agreed with the RTC ruling that such requirement is lacking in the case. [26] Petitioners moved for reconsideration of the above decision, but the CA denied the motion in a Resolution [27] dated August 1, 2019.","Evidence of a condominium corporation's special authority to sell is a pre-condition to the enforcement of its lien for unpaid dues via extrajudicial foreclosure. Petitioners' reliance on Chateau de Baie is erroneous. A careful reading of Chateau de Baie shows that petitioners' contention — that the Condominium Act does not require a special authority or power to sell from the condominium unit owner before a condominium corporation can initiate a foreclosure proceeding — is not the dictum of the case... Evidently, nowhere in Chateau de Baie did the Court abandon the doctrine set forth in First Marbella Condominium Association, Inc. v. Gatmaytan. In First Marbella , the Court ruled that it is mandatory that a petition for extrajudicial foreclosure be supported by evidence that petitioner holds a special authority or power to foreclose... Without the required authority, LPL cannot initiate extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings under Act No. 3135. It may only enforce its lien through an ordinary collection suit or judicial foreclosure proceedings as provided under Rule 68 of the Rules of Court. From the foregoing, it is apparent that a special power or authority to sell designating LPL as respondent's attorney-in-fact or agent is required prior to the conduct of the extra-judicial foreclosure proceedings. The grant of such authority may be inserted as a provision in the condominium's deed of restrictions or by-laws. However, as found by the RTC, neither LPL's Master Deed of Restrictions or By-Laws contain any provision to that effect. Petitioners are barred by laches from raising the factual issue as to whether LPL's Master Deed of Restrictions and By-Laws contain a special authority... Anent the contention that Manfred's death extinguishes the legal personality of Gutierrez, Cortez & Partners to represent respondent, the Court rules in the negative. As aptly stated by the CA, it is settled that an attorney-in-fact is not the real party-in-interest. ... Manfred's death does not ipso facto cause the withdrawal of Gutierrez, Cortez & Partner as respondent's counsel of record. ... In fine, the CA did not err in ruling that the extrajudicial foreclosure sales of the subject units were null and void for want of special authority or power to sell.","WHEREFORE, the petition is hereby DENIED.

Governor Tallado issued a Notice of Preventive Suspension on December 19, 2018. Mayor Jalgalado filed a Petition for Certiorari, Prohibition, and Mandamus with Restraining Order and Injunction and Urgent Prayer for Ex-Parte 72-Hour Temporary Restraining Order, docketed as Special Civil Case No. 8374, which was raffled to Respondent Judge Arniel A. Dating (Respondent). Respondent issued a Writ of Preliminary Injunction (WPI) on January 9, 2019, and a Resolution on January 24, 2019, granting the petition and declaring the preventive suspension order issued with grave abuse of discretion, based on the perceived weakness of evidence and consideration for the constituents (sabidura del Corazon). Appalled, Complainants filed their first Verified Complaint for Gross Ignorance of the Law against Respondent, alleging lack of jurisdiction and failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Meanwhile, the SP found Mayor Jalgalado guilty and meted a penalty of six months suspension. Mayor Jalgalado filed a second Petition for Certiorari, docketed as Civil Case No. 8403, also raffled to Respondent. Complainants filed a Motion for Voluntary Inhibition. On April 8, 2019, Respondent temporarily set aside the inhibition issue and granted Mayor Jalgalado a 20-day TRO. Two days later (April 10, 2019), Respondent inhibited himself. Complainants then filed their second Verified Complaint for Gross Ignorance of the Law and Gross Misconduct against Respondent. The OCA recommended finding Respondent GUILTY of Gross Ignorance of the Law and fining him P40,000.00.","The Court finds that Complainants are not guilty of forum shopping. However, after a judicious review of the records of the case, the Court dismisses the complaints filed against Respondent for insufficiency of evidence and lack of merit. Respondent is absolved from the charges of Gross Ignorance of Law and Gross Misconduct.","The charges filed by Complainants were judicial in nature and pertained to Respondent's exercise of his adjudicative duties. The official acts of a magistrate done in the course of judicial function cannot be subject to disciplinary action unless tainted with bad faith, fraud, malice, or dishonesty. Complainants failed to resort to available judicial remedies (motion for reconsideration, appeal, or certiorari) before filing both Verified Complaints, rendering the administrative complaints premature. The Court found Respondent's deviation from the requirement to exhaust administrative remedies (in Special Civil Case No. 8374) justifiable due to the urgent political nature of the case and the public interest involved. Furthermore, there was no substantial evidence proving bad faith or ill motive on the part of Respondent. Regarding Civil Case No. 8403, the allegations were premature as Respondent inhibited himself two days after issuing the TRO and before ruling on the case's propriety. The Court also inferred that the complaints were filed for the purpose of harassing, threatening, or vexing Respondent, noting Complainants’ highly influential positions and propensity for filing administrative cases against members of the bench (citing Tallado v. Judge Racoma).","WHEREFORE, the Verified Complaints against respondent Judge Arniel A. Dating, Presiding Judge, Branch 41, Regional Trial Court of Daet, Camarines Norte, are DISMISSED.

"G.R. No. 248997, September 05, 2022","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. EDUARDO CERICOS, JR. Y OBIASCA A.K.A. ""JR,"" ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","This case stemmed from five (5) Informations filed before the RTC, charging Cericos of four (4) counts of Rape and one (1) count of Forcible Abduction with Rape, against AAA[248997], a 15-year-old minor. The prosecution alleged that AAA248997 met Cericos on social media, surreptitiously left her house on August 18, 2016, to meet him in Tanay, Rizal, and was subsequently brought to his house in Manila. There, Cericos forcibly undressed AAA248997 and had carnal knowledge of her despite her active resistance and protestations (Criminal Case No. 16-328295). Further incidents of sexual intercourse against her will occurred on the evening of August 18, 2016 (Criminal Case No. 16-328296), in the morning of August 19, 2016 (Criminal Case No. 16-328297), and on or about August 20, 2016, while she was inebriated (Criminal Case No. 16-328299). AAA248997's guardian and sister found her missing, located her through social media, and convinced Cericos to bring her to the barangay hall where she pointed to him as the rapist. Medico-Legal Officer findings indicated ""laceration with surrounding bruise at 8 o'clock position. Anogenital findings are indicative of blunt force or penetrating trauma. Intellectual disability versus Learning disorder."" A development pediatrician later confirmed AAA248997 suffers from ""Intellectual Disability from mild to moderate"" with a mental age of a two (2)-year old person. In defense, Cericos invoked denial and the ""sweetheart theory,"" claiming AAA248997 was his girlfriend, asked him to fetch her, and that they had consensual sexual intercourse multiple times, which she allegedly instigated. He maintained the rape charges were instigated by her guardian because the latter disapproved of his low income.","The Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila, Branch 5, in a Decision dated May 15, 2017, found Cericos guilty beyond reasonable doubt of four (4) counts of Rape (Criminal Case Nos. 16-328295, 16-328296, 16-328297, and 16-328299), sentencing him to reclusion perpetua for each count, plus damages. He was acquitted in Criminal Case No. 16-328298 on the ground of insufficiency of evidence. The RTC rejected the ""sweetheart theory,"" noting the victim's positive testimony of resistance and her status as a mental retardate, negating valid consent. The Court of Appeals (CA), in a Decision dated May 29, 2019, affirmed the RTC ruling in toto, holding that the prosecution established guilt beyond reasonable doubt on four separate occasions through force and rejecting the ""sweetheart theory.""","The appeal is denied. The Court found that both the RTC and the CA correctly ruled that through AAA248997's straightforward, credible, and trustworthy testimony, it was established beyond reasonable doubt that Cericos had carnal knowledge of her on four (4) different occasions without her consent, employing force, violence, and/or intimidation under Article 266-A(l)(a) of the RPC. The Court also noted that the victim's intellectual disability (mental age of a two-year-old) further buttressed the finding of lack of consent. The Court rejected Cericos' ""sweetheart theory"" as unsubstantiated. While the victim's mental incapacity was proven, the Court clarified that Cericos could not be convicted of Statutory Rape under Article 266-A(1)(d) because the victim's intellectual disability was not alleged in the Informations, thus precluding a conviction based on that ground to uphold his constitutional right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him. The conviction rests on Rape through force, violence, and/or intimidation.","The appeal is DENIED. The Decision dated May 29, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 09455 is hereby AFFIRMED. Hence, accused-appellant Eduardo Cericos, Jr. y Obiasca a.k.a. ""JR"" is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of four (4) counts of Rape, as defined and penalized under Article 266-A(l)(a), in relation to Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code, as amended. For each count, he is sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua, and to pay AAA248997 the amounts of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages, and P75,000.00 as exemplary damages, all with legal interest at the rate of six percent (6%) from the date of finality of this Decision until full payment, and to pay the cost of suit."
"G.R. No. 243768, September 05, 2022","G & S TRANSPORT CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. REYNALDO A. MEDINA, RESPONDENT.","G & S Transport Corporation (G & S), more popularly known as ""Avis Rent-A-Car,"" hired Reynaldo A. Medina (Medina) as a driver on September 15, 2008. On the night of February 12, 2015, Medina returned to G & S premises at around 10:00 p.m. to retrieve his personal belongings. He chanced upon co-employee Felix Pogoy (Pogoy), and a heated argument with shoving then ensued, which was broken up by another employee, Jose Viggayan (Viggayan). G & S, however, countered that Medina was drunk when he assaulted Pogoy to the point of boxing and strangling the latter. G & S concluded that Medina violated the Code of Discipline by fighting with a co-employee inside the work premises and terminated his employment on March 20, 2015. Medina filed a Complaint for illegal dismissal. The Labor Arbiter and the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) affirmed the dismissal, finding that fighting within work premises constituted serious misconduct. The Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the labor tribunals, finding that Medina was illegally dismissed, as the incident was merely a ""petty quarrel that merely involved shoving or slight pushing"" and the penalty of dismissal was too harsh. G & S appealed this Decision to the Supreme Court.",The petition is without merit. The appellate court did not commit grave abuse of discretion nor did it exceed its jurisdiction when it concluded that Medina was illegally dismissed from employment by G & S.,"The Supreme Court found that the appellate court did not commit grave abuse of discretion in reviewing the factual findings of the NLRC, as it is within the CA’s power of judicial review under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court to evaluate evidence alleged to have been capriciously, whimsically, and arbitrarily relied upon or disregarded by the NLRC. The Court agreed with the CA that there was no serious misconduct to warrant the dismissal of Medina under Article 297 of the Labor Code, as the incident was a petty quarrel involving shoving or slight pushing, which did not cause bodily harm (except a minor scratch) or interfere with business operations. The misconduct was not serious or of such grave and aggravated character as to show Medina became unfit to continue working. The Court further ruled that the penalty of dismissal was too harsh and not commensurate with the act committed, especially since Medina had seven years of employment with no prior derogatory record. Thus, the dismissal was illegal due to the absence of just cause, notwithstanding compliance with procedural due process. However, the Court affirmed that there was no basis to award Medina moral and exemplary damages, as G & S was not motivated by bad faith.","The Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED. The April 27, 2018 Decision and the December 17, 2018 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 149247 holding that respondent Reynaldo A. Medina was illegally dismissed and entitled, to full backwages, inclusive of allowances, and to other benefits or their monetary equivalent from the time his compensation was withheld from him up to the time of his actual reinstatement is AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATION that petitioner G & S Transport Corporation is ORDERED to PAY respondent Reynaldo A. Medina legal interest on the total monetary award at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the date of finality of this Decision until fully paid. Accordingly, the case is REMANDED to the Labor Arbiter for the re-computation of respondent's backwages."
"G.R. Nos. 251270 and 251291-301, September 05, 2022","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PETITIONER, VS. COURT OF TAX APPEALS – THIRD DIVISION, L.M. CAMUS ENGINEERING CORPORATION, AND LINO D. MENDOZA, RESPONDENTS.","The case draws its origin in the following Amended Informations filed before the CTA against the respondent corporation L.M. Camus Engineering Corporation (L.M. Camus), and Luis M. Camus (Camus) and respondent Lino D. Mendoza (Mendoza) in their capacity as President and Comptroller of the respondent corporation, respectively, for several violations of Sections 254 and 255 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) with respect to deficiency income tax and value-added tax (VAT) for taxable years 1997 to 1999 (CTA Criminal Case Nos. O-395 to O-406). After determining the existence of probable cause, the various criminal cases were consolidated. Mendoza pled not guilty, while Camus' arraignment was deferred until further orders given he was medically indisposed. Trial ensued, and the prosecution presented its lone witness, Atty. Sixto C. Dy, Jr., whose testimony was presented to prove that L.M. Camus was liable to pay income tax and VAT for taxable years 1997, 1998, and 1999 but it evaded such payment by willfully supplying incorrect information. The CTA denied admission of several key prosecution exhibits, including L.M. Camus' quarterly VAT returns for taxable year 1999, and its annual ITRs for taxable years 1997 and 1998. Instead of presenting evidence, respondents filed a Demurrer to Evidence, contending the prosecution failed to adduce proof beyond reasonable doubt to indict them, specifically failing to establish the amounts of tax, under-declared amounts, computation of tax fraud, and that the *corpus delicti* was non-existent due to the absence of the tax returns. In the first challenged Resolution, the CTA granted the Demurrer to Evidence, thereby acquitting L.M. Camus and Mendoza, holding that the absence of the tax returns was fatal as it prevented the court from determining whether L.M. Camus derived undeclared income or failed to supply correct information. The CTA also found that the prosecution's sole witness, Atty. Dy, had no personal knowledge of the transactions. Consequently, the CTA adjudged that the prosecution failed to present sufficient evidence to establish the essential elements for violations of Sections 254 and 255 of the NIRC, but directed the parties to present evidence on the civil aspect. The prosecution's motion for reconsideration was denied by the CTA, leading the BIR to institute the present Petition for Certiorari, alleging grave abuse of discretion on the part of the CTA.","The Court ruled that the Petition for Certiorari, filed by the Prosecution Division of the BIR without the OSG's representation or a favorable endorsement from the DOJ for appellate proceedings before the Supreme Court, lacked proper legal personality and could be dismissed on procedural grounds. Moreover, even addressing the substantive merits, the Court found no grave abuse of discretion committed by the CTA, Third Division, in issuing the questioned Resolutions. The Court noted that the BIR merely anchored its Petition on the CTA's purported misappreciation of its evidence, which is not a ground for a writ of *certiorari* to reverse an acquittal.","The Court found that the grant of the Demurrer to Evidence amounted to an acquittal, and any attempt to reverse it would violate the constitutional proscription against double jeopardy, as the CTA did not commit grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction or a denial of due process. Grave abuse of discretion requires patent and gross abuse, not merely alleged misapplication of facts and evidence. Therefore, the acquittal must stand. However, the Court reiterated that the acquittal of the crimes charged based on reasonable doubt does not result in the extinguishment of the accused's civil liability for the collection of taxes, as expressly provided in Section 254 of the NIRC.","GIVEN THE FOREGOING DISCOURSE, the Petition for Certiorari is hereby DISMISSED. The Resolutions dated 7 August 2019 and 29 November 2019 of the Court of Tax Appeals, Third Division in CTA Criminal Case Nos. O-395 to O-406 are AFFIRMED. Accordingly, respondents L.M. Camus Engineering Corporation and Lino D. Mendoza are ACQUITTED of the crimes charged for failure of the prosecution to prove their guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The case, including the entirety of their records, are ORDERED REMANDED to the Court of Tax Appeals, Third Division to determine the civil liability of respondents, if any."

VIKINGS COMMISSARY, AND/OR JACKSON GO, AND HARDWORKERS MANPOWER SERVICES, INC.,* AND/OR AIME BOLONGAITA,** RESPONDENTS.","Elba J. Caballero (Caballero) filed a Complaint for illegal dismissal and non-payment of overtime pay, 13th month pay, separation pay, and service charges, with claims for moral and exemplary damages and attorney's fees against Vikings Commissary (Vikings) and Hardworkers Manpower Services, Inc. (Hardworkers). Caballero alleged she was interviewed by Vikings, hired as a packer/dim sum maker (work necessary to Vikings' business), but was coursed through Hardworkers for signing fixed-term contracts (Jan 2015 to July 2016, repeatedly renewed). She claimed Vikings imposed strict attendance, dictated work procedure, and recommended dismissal. On April 5, 2016, Vikings Executive Chef Sung Haw Law (Chef Law) allegedly informed her he was terminating her services, confirmed by a staff member who told her: ""Pinapasabi ni boss bakit hindi ka pa raw umuuwi eh tanggal ka na nga sa trabaho effective ngayon?! Hindi ka na raw nya gusto makita dito."" Caballero verbally requested an explanation but received none. Hardworkers claimed it was a legitimate contractor and Caballero was a fixed-term employee. It alleged Caballero was merely reprimanded by Chef Law for lying about a co-worker's absence and subsequently abandoned her work by failing to report back. Vikings did not file a Position Paper. The Labor Arbiter dismissed the complaint, finding Caballero was a per-project employee of Hardworkers and failed to substantiate illegal dismissal. The NLRC affirmed the dismissal finding but modified it by deeming Caballero a regular employee of Hardworkers due to repeated short-term hiring, awarding separation pay in lieu of reinstatement. The Court of Appeals upheld the finding of no illegal dismissal but deleted the award of separation pay. Caballero subsequently filed this Petition.","The Petition is GRANTED. The November 28, 2017 Decision and March 27, 2018 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP. No. 150470 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE.","The Supreme Court ruled that Hardworkers Manpower Services, Inc. was engaged in labor-only contracting, despite its Certificate of Registration, because the totality of circumstances showed it merely supplied labor, lacked sufficient tools/equipment (Caballero used Vikings' equipment on Vikings' premises), and Vikings exercised control and the power to dismiss. Consequently, Vikings Commissary is deemed the direct employer of Caballero. Furthermore, Caballero is a regular employee entitled to security of tenure because her work as a dim sum maker was necessary and desirable to Vikings' business, and the repeated renewal of short-term contracts sought to circumvent her tenurial rights. The Court found that Caballero was illegally dismissed, as the verbal termination by Vikings' staff was clear and unequivocal, and she was deprived of due process. Hardworkers' theory of abandonment was rejected since Caballero immediately inquired about her status and filed a labor complaint. Since Caballero opted not to be reinstated, she is entitled to backwages, separation pay, moral and exemplary damages due to the bad faith and oppressive nature of her dismissal through a labor-only contracting scheme, and attorney's fees. Vikings and Hardworkers are held jointly and severally liable for the monetary awards.","Respondents are ordered to pay petitioner the following:
(1) Backwages computed from April 5, 2016 up to the finality of this decision;
(2) Separation pay of P12,766.00 as determined by the National Labor Relations Commission;
(3) Moral damages of P10,000.00;

CENTRAL AZUCARERA DE LA CARLOTA, INC., RESPONDENT.","Central Azucarera is a sugar mill in La Carlota City, Negros Occidental. Inside its compound are buildings and facilities used to mill sugar, and guest houses to accommodate select employees. Morales et al. were among the employees of Central Azucarera assigned to basic housekeeping, utility maintenance, and cooking functions in the guest houses. They were classified as rank-and-file employees by Central Azucarera's Human Resource Department and enjoyed the protection of Central Azucarera's rank-and-file union. In 2006, they were transferred to the Office of the Resident Manager as confidential employees, and thus removed from the union. On August 21, 2007, the head of the Human Resource Department, Jose Parcon (Parcon) announced that the positions of the guest house workers were redundant and said that Morales et al.'s employment would be terminated effective September 21, 2007. They were told that they would receive separation pay equivalent to one month of their pay for every year of service rendered, plus 20% thereof. Central Azucarera distributed letters to its employees, including Morales et al. and Fermin Suringa, Jr. (Suringa) informing them of their eventual termination from the company due to the downsizing program it is implementing because of business losses. They were then informed that after termination, they would be re-hired by Central La Carlota Multi-Purpose Cooperative for a lower salary. Morales et al. refused to sign the documents. On September 22, 2007, Morales et al. reported for work, but the biometric Bundy clock no longer recognized them, preventing them from entering the mill. On March 30, 2009, Morales et al. filed a complaint before the Regional Arbitration Branch VI of the National Labor Relations Commission in Bacolod City for illegal dismissal, nonpayment of overtime pay, moral and exemplary damages, and attorney's fees. The Labor Arbiter ruled in favor of Morales et al. and ordered Central Azucarera to reinstate them. However, the Labor Arbiter did not award them backwages due to their delay in filing the complaint for illegal dismissal. Both parties elevated the case before the National Labor Relations Commission which modified the ruling and ordered Central Azucarera to pay Morales et al. backwages amounting to P1,377,251.25. Central Azucarera moved for reconsideration, which was granted by the National Labor Relations Commission. The Commission reversed its earlier decision and held that Central Azucarera was experiencing business losses as seen in their audited financial statements and found that Morales et al. were dismissed for an authorized ground of redundancy. Nevertheless, it awarded them separation pay and nominal damages in the aggregate amount of P253,286.56. Morales et al. filed a motion for reconsideration but was denied. Thus, they filed a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court before the Court of Appeals. In its Decision, the Court of Appeals affirmed the ruling of the National Labor Relations Commission. It held that the Commission did not issue its Resolution with grave abuse of discretion, considering that it was supported by substantial evidence and is devoid of any unfairness and arbitrariness. The dispositive portion of the Court of Appeals' Decision reads: WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant petition is hereby DENIED. The Resolution dated 28 October 2010 of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) – Seventh Division, Cebu City in NLRC Case No. VAC-04-000214-2010 is hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION in that the award of nominal damages to each of the petitioners in the amount of P10,000.00 is DELETED.","The Petition is DENIED. The September 30, 2014 Decision and January 28, 2016 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA G.R. SP No. 05985 are AFFIRMED.","The Court finds no reversible error in the Court of Appeals' Decision as it was based on its appreciation of the evidence presented by the parties. The termination of petitioners due to redundancy was proved by respondent by substantial evidence of the company's business losses and its right-sizing program to avert further dropping of its financial standing. Petitioners' positions were deemed redundant as the task of maintaining the guest house was in no way essential to the business of respondent and such function has since been delegated to those residing in the guest house. The Court of Appeals did not commit grave abuse of discretion when it upheld the validity of respondent's redundancy program. As for the procedural due process requirements of a dismissal due to redundancy, respondent's attempts to serve the written notice multiple times, personally and through registered mail, are substantial compliance with the requirement. Respondent cannot be faulted for petitioners' consistent refusal to accept their letter of termination. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals was correct in ruling that petitioners are not entitled to nominal damages as there was no violation of procedural due process. Nevertheless, petitioners are entitled to separation pay equivalent to at least one month pay of the affected employee, or at least one month pay for every year of service, whichever is higher.","FOR THESE REASONS, the Petition is DENIED. The September 30, 2014 Decision and January 28, 2016 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA G.R. SP No. 05985 are AFFIRMED. Respondent Central Azucarera de La Carlota, Inc. is DIRECTED to pay petitioners Marcos Antonio Morales, Georgina D. Tribujenia, Cicero A. Cajurao and Noli A. Dejan the separation pay due them.

"G.R. No. 237369, October 19, 2022","LANDBANK OF THE PHILIPPINES, PETITIONER, VS. ALBRANDO R. ABELLANA, RESPONDENT.","Respondent Albrando R. Abellana (Abellana) was the registered owner of a parcel of land (21,887 sqms.) in Puerto Princesa City. On June 28, 2000, Abellana and Ernesto V. Villaos (Villaos) executed a Real Estate Mortgage (REM) over the property in favor of petitioner Landbank of the Philippines (Landbank) to secure Villaos' loan worth P2,000,000.00. Abellana and Villaos defaulted, prompting Landbank to extrajudicially foreclose the REM. Landbank was the winning bidder on February 25, 2004, and the title was eventually consolidated in Landbank's name under TCT 174178 after the lapse of the redemption period.

Proceedings in Civil Case No. 4586 (repurchase case): On January 26, 2010, Abellana filed a Complaint for repurchase against Landbank, alleging he was a mere accommodation mortgagor and was willing to buy the property back at a 'fair price.' The RTC, CA, and Supreme Court (G.R. No. 205145) affirmed the dismissal of the complaint, ruling that Abellana's status as a 'former owner' was insufficient to obligate Landbank to sell the property back to him. This ruling became final on June 6, 2013.

Proceedings in Civil Case No. 5144 (the instant case): On November 26, 2014, after Landbank had sold the property to a third party (Arzaga), Abellana filed the instant declaration of nullity case before the RTC, seeking to declare null and void the extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings, the final deed of sale, consolidation of ownership, and TCT 174178, alleging he was not informed of the foreclosure. Landbank filed an Answer raising laches, prescription, and res judicata. The RTC denied Landbank's motion to dismiss but declared Abellana estopped from contesting Landbank's ownership. Landbank elevated the matter to the CA via Petition for Certiorari. The CA dismissed Landbank's petition and affirmed the orders of the RTC.","On October 12, 2017, the CA rendered the assailed Decision dismissing Landbank's petition and affirming the orders of the RTC: 'WHEREFORE, the petition for certiorari is DISMISSED. Accordingly, the assailed October 16, 2015 and July 19, 2016 Orders of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 52, Puerto Princesa City in Civil Case No. 5144 are hereby AFFIRMED.'","The Supreme Court found the petition meritorious. It ruled that Abellana's present action for declaration of nullity is not barred by prescription because actions to declare the nullity or inexistence of contracts are imprescriptible. Furthermore, the doctrine of res judicata (bar by former judgment and conclusiveness of judgment) is inapplicable as the causes of action and issues are different from the prior repurchase case (Civil Case No. 4586). However, the Court ruled that Abellana is estopped from challenging the validity or regularity of the foreclosure proceedings and Landbank’s ownership due to his judicial admissions made in the prior repurchase case. Since Abellana already recognized and admitted the validity of the subject foreclosure proceedings and Landbank's ownership over the property in the previous litigation, he has no cause of action to institute the present complaint for the declaration of nullity of the same. Consequently, the instant action should be dismissed outright for lack of cause of action.","WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED. The October 12, 2017 Decision and the February 7, 2018 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA­-G.R. SP No. 147827 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 255258, October 19, 2022","HEIRS OF ARTURO E. BANDOY AND HEIRS OF ANGELITA E. BANDOY, PETITIONERS, VS. ALEXANDER E. BANDOY, RESPONDENT.","Spouses Ambrocio Bandoy (Ambrocio) and Matilde Estal Bandoy (Matilde) begot three children, namely: Arturo Bandoy (Arturo), Angelita Bandoy (Angelita), and Alexander Bandoy (Alexander). Ambrocio and Matilde acquired several properties, including Lot No. 3516, Cad-392-D, located in Tandag City, Surigao del Sur. It contains an area of 14,765 square meters and was originally covered by Original Certificate of Title No. FP-10897 registered in the name of Ambrocio. After the death of Ambrocio in 1981, Matilde waived her interest in the Estate of Ambrocio in favor of their children. The heirs executed a document captioned as ""Extrajudicial Settlement of the Estate of the Deceased Ambrocio Bandoy with Absolute Deed of Sale"" (extrajudicial settlement of the estate with sale). The document included a sale of 9,329 square meter portion of Lot No. 3516 in favor of Florencio Benitez (Benitez). The remainder of the property became Lot No. 3516-B, covered by Tax Declaration No. 08-01-14-01014. Arturo died on May 27, 1993, and was succeeded by his four children, namely: Alvin, Edwin, Dante, and Robert (the heirs of Arturo). On the other hand, Angelita died on September 4, 2014, leaving behind her two children, namely: Joan B. Alcover and Jason B. Albano (the heirs of Angelita). Subsequently, the heirs of Arturo and Angelita asked Alexander to partition the remaining 5,436 square meters of Lot No. 3516-B. However, despite several pleas, the latter refused to partition the remaining portion and claimed sole ownership over it. As a result, they instituted a suit against Alexander for partition. In his answer, Alexander asserted that the remaining 5,436 square meters designated as Lot No. 3516-B were exclusively his. He insisted that while the extrajudicial settlement of the estate with sale indicated that Lot No. 3516 was transferred pro indiviso in favor of himself and his siblings, the sale of the 9,329 square meter portion of the property to Benitez only involved the shares of Angelita and Arturo, even if his signature appear therein. Alexander contended that there was a verbal agreement between the siblings that his share would not be included in the sale. In support of this claim, he presented the handwritten note (handwritten note) Angelita executed on May 29, 2013 where she declared that it was only her share and that of Arturo's that were sold to Benitez. In her Affidavit dated March 30, 2014, she reiterated the statement she made in her handwritten note, viz.:.... 3. That as one of the heirs, I sold my One-Third (1/3) share of the aforesaid parcel of land (4,921.66, more or less) to spouses Florencio and Victoria Benitez; 4. That I know that my brother, Alexander Bandoy has not sold his share of the above-mentioned parcel of land although I was aware that my brother Arturo Bandoy has sold a portion of his share to spouses Benitez;...","On October 26, 2017, Branch 40, Regional Trial Court, Tandag City, Surigao del Sur rendered its Decision, the dispositive portion of which states: WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court orders partition of Parcel 1 (Lot No. 3516-B) as follows: Plaintiff Heirs of Arturo E. Bandoy – Two Thousand Three Hundred Ninety (2,390) square meters. Plaintiff Heirs of Angelita E. Bandoy – Two Thousand Three Hundred Ninety (2,390) square meters. Defendant Alexander E. Bandoy – Six Hundred Fifty Six (656) square meters. Defendant is hereby ordered to fully and unconditionally deliver the share of his co-heirs and actively participate in the partition of Lot No. 3516-B. Before partition, defendant shall submit a formal accounting of the fruits and proceeds of the subject land to his co-heirs and thereafter remit to them their respective share from the time he took exclusive possession of the parcel of land until the present. The claim for damages is hereby DENIED. SO ORDERED. In the assailed Decision, the Court of Appeals reversed the ruling of the Regional Trial Court. It found that Arturo, Angelita, and Alexander divided the property via an oral partition. As a consequence, it also held that the Regional Trial Court should not have disregarded Angelita's handwritten note and affidavit simply on the basis that it was executed after the extrajudicial settlement of the estate with sale. For the Court of Appeals, it was improper for the Regional Trial Court to partition the remainder of Lot No. 3516-B in favor of Alexander, the heirs of Angelita, and the heirs of Arturo as it solely belonged to Alexander.","The Petition is meritorious. . . An oral partition may be valid. It is settled that an oral partition may be valid and binding upon the heirs. There is no law requiring partition among heirs to be in writing to be valid. . . Having settled that an oral partition may be valid, this Court shall now resolve whether the purported oral partition entered into by respondent, Angelita, and Arturo, was duly proven by preponderance of evidence. This Court must necessarily address the admissibility of the Handwritten Note and Affidavit of Angelita that respondent presented to substantiate his claim of sole ownership of the remaining portion of Lot No. 3516. The handwritten note and affidavit of Angelita may be appreciated only against Angelita's share in Lot No. 3516 as an admission against interest, and not as an exception to the parol evidence rule. . . There is no ambiguity or obscurity in the agreement of the parties. It is clear from the quoted portion of the extrajudicial settlement of the estate with sale that Angelita, Arturo, and Alexander sold a total of 9,329 square meters of their pro indiviso share in the 14,765. square meters property they inherited. . . The admission against interest of Angelita, based on her handwritten note and affidavit, may only be admitted against her own interest. . . Be that as it may, paragraph no. 4, which pertains to Angelita's statement on the share of Arturo in Lot No. 3516, cannot be made binding to his successors-in-interest such as the petitioners in this case. As a rule, the ""rights of a party cannot be prejudiced by an act declaration, or omission of another."" This is known as the res inter alios acta rule... Hence, contrary to the assertion of Alexander, the 9,329-square-meter portion of Lot No. 3516 sold in favor of Benitez comprised of Angelita's entire share equivalent to 4,921 square meters, and the remaining 4,408 square meters should be deducted equally from the pro indiviso share of Arturo and respondent, or 2,204 square meters each. Accordingly, only 5,436 square meters were left in Lot No. 3516 and this area shall be divided equally by Alexander and Arturo equivalent to 2,718 square meters each. The dispositions made by Alexander and Arturo should be deducted from the 2,718 square meters of aliquot share each of them is entitled to receive. After deducting the 600 square meters sold to Lucita F. Elizalde, 556 square meters sold to Spouses Hayag, 200 sqµare meters sold to Silverio Bautista, and 440 square meters sold to Vicente Bangoy, the remaining share of Alexander in Lot No. 3516 is 922 square meters. Likewise, the sale made by Arturo in favor of Silverio Bautista for a portion equivalent to 200 square meters of the subject property should be deducted from the share he is entitled to receive. This disposition leaves him with 2,518 square meters of share in the subject property.","ACCORDINGLY, the Decision dated June 27, 2019 and the Resolution dated October 8, 2020 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 04878 are SET ASIDE. This Court finds that the heirs of Arturo E. Bandoy are entitled to a 2,518 square meter portion of Lot No. 3516. His respective heirs shall inherit their corresponding share through a right of representation, in accordance with Article 974 of the Civil Code. The heirs of Angelita E. Bandoy are not entitled to any share in the subject property. Taking into consideration the previous dispositions respondent Alexander E. Bandoy made in favor of third persons, he is entitled to receive a 922 square meter portion of the subject property. The case is REMANDED to Branch 40, Regional Trial Court, Tandag City, Surigao del Sur for purposes of partitioning the subject property in accordance with Rule 69 of the Rules of Court. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 249754, October 19, 2022","THE HEIRS OF TEODORO* RIBAC (DECEASED), REPRESENTED BY HIS HEIRS AND ISSUES: AUGUSTINA, MARIANO, VICTOR, REYNANTE,** DAYLA, AND ROSALIE, ALL SURNAMED RIBAC, PETITIONERS, VS. NARCISA RIBAC-PUTOLAN AND ANTONINA RIBAC-BLANCO, RESPONDENTS.","Teodoro Ribac (Teodoro) was the registered owner of a parcel of agricultural land containing an area of 9.405 hectares (subject property) covered by Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. P-10565, located in Poblacion, Magsaysay, Davao del Sur. The heirs of Teodoro claimed that they acquired it by virtue of a homestead patent and were issued the corresponding certificate of title. Teodoro predeceased his parents, Spouses Bartolome and Lucresia Ribac (Spouses Ribac), on December 2, 1977. On October 18, 1994, the heirs of Teodoro, led by Conrado Manigque, husband of one of Teodoro's daughters, occupied one-half portion of the property and began constructing their houses. Thereafter, the heirs of Teodoro caused the cancellation of OCT No. P-10565 under the name of Teodoro, and another title was issued in their names. On November 24, 1994, the sisters of Teodoro, Narcisa Ribac-Putolan (Narcisa) and Antonina Ribac-Blanco (Antonina) filed a Complaint for Partition, Conveyance, Cancellation of Existing Title and Issuance of a New Title in Lieu thereof, and Damages with Preliminary Mandatory Injunction against the heirs of Teodoro with Branch 21, Regional Trial Court, Bansalan, Davao del Sur. Narcisa and Antonina argued that Teodoro was merely holding the subject property in trust for the true owners, Spouses Ribac. The heirs of Teodoro contended that the property was owned by their deceased father, Teodoro, as evidenced by the certificate of title registered in his name. Incidentally, the heirs of Teodoro claimed that Atty. Suario failed thrice to comply with the orders of the Regional Trial Court instructing him to submit the formal offer of exhibits for the heirs of Teodoro. As a result, the Regional Trial Court issued an Order declaring the heirs of Teodoro to have waived their right to submit their formal offer of exhibits. On July 30, 2013, the Regional Trial Court rendered its Judgment... In its ruling, the Regional Trial Court was convinced that the subject property was merely held in trust by Teodoro for the other heirs of Spouses Ribac, especially his sisters. On March 29, 2019, the Court of Appeals rendered its Decision denying the appeal of the heirs of Teodoro. The Court of Appeals found that Narcisa and Antonina were able to prove by preponderance of evidence that there existed an implied trust relative to the subject property. In the assailed Resolution dated November 27, 2019, this Court denied the petition of the heirs of Teodoro for failure to sufficiently show any reversible error in the assailed judgment to warrant the exercise of this Court's discretionary appellate jurisdiction. In the present Motion for Reconsideration, the heirs of Teodoro maintained that since the subject property was acquired by homestead patent, the awardee is required by law to occupy and cultivate the land for their benefit. Thus, no trust could be created as it would constitute a violation of the law granting homestead patents.","The heirs of Teodoro filed a Motion for Reconsideration assailing this Court's Resolution dated November 27, 2019, which denied their petition for review on certiorari for failure to show any reversible error in the Decision and the Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 03548-MIN to warrant the exercise of this Court's discretionary appellate jurisdiction.","The Motion for Reconsideration of petitioners is meritorious. ... The purported gross negligence of petitioners' former counsel is not a sufficient ground to grant a new trial... Petitioners are now barred from belatedly invoking the Dead Person's Statute to disqualify the testimonies of Narcisa and Antonina on matters concerning Teodoro that occurred prior to his death... However, it has been held that a trust will not be created when, for the purpose of evading the law prohibiting one from taking or holding real property, he takes a conveyance thereof in the name of a third person. ... If the argument of respondents that an implied trust was created between Teodoro and respondents were to be sustained, this Court would be condoning an outright circumvention of the Public Land Act. ... Therefore, no implied trust could have been created by the purported arrangement between Teodoro and respondents.","ACCORDINGLY, this Court SETS ASIDE the Resolution dated November 27, 2019. The case is REMANDED to Branch 21, Regional Trial Court, Bansalan, Davao del Sur for the reception of evidence and adjudication of the claim of petitioners heirs of Teodoro Ribac, namely: Augustina, Mariano, Victor, Reynante, Dayla, and Rosalie, all surnamed Ribac, that no implied trust could have been created because Teodoro Ribac acquired the subject property through a homestead patent."
"G.R. No. 258187, October 19, 2022","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. RAYMUND CAMARSE Y GIMOTEA, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","On July 19, 2011 at 8:51 a.m., Raymund Camarse (Raymund) and Regine Fernandez (Regine) arrived at the Country Lodge Motel onboard a black Mitsubishi Super Saloon car with plate number CPR 255. Raymund and Regine checked in at Garage Room No. 30. At around 2:15 p.m., motel personnel Eliseo Briones, Jr. (Eliseo) noticed black smoke coming out of the window of Garage Room No. 30. Raymund then ran out shouting. ""Sunog, sunog!"" and uttering that his companion was still inside the room. Eliseo went inside the room but Raymund hurriedly boarded his vehicle. Eliseo became suspicious and tried to prevent Raymund from leaving. However, Raymund rammed the vehicle into the barricade and drove away. Eliseo asked help from the motel's operations manager Eduardo Dapetillo (Eduardo) who, in turn, called the City Fire Station. Eduardo rushed into the burning room and saw Regine's naked body lying facing down on the bed. The firefighters arrived at the motel and put out the fire. Meanwhile, the barangay officials and several motel personnel intercepted Raymund and brought him to the police station. The authorities recovered a 13 centimeter kitchen knife from the backseat of Raymund's vehicle. At the motel, the fire officers observed that Regine's body has multiple stab wounds on the neck, breast, and abdomen. The examining physician reported that Regine died of severe multiple traumatic injuries of the head with multiple stab wounds in the trunk. Moreover, the firefighters noted that highly combustible materials such as crumpled papers, bedsheets, clothing, sandals, and wooden chairs were piled on top of Regine's body. The bed also emitted strong smell of kerosene, which led the operatives to conclude that the fire was intentionally set. Later, the Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP) confirmed that the debris and samples taken from the crime scene were positive for kerosene.","On October 5, 2017, the CA affirmed the RTC's findings with modification. The CA held that Raymund committed destructive arson and murder because burning Regine's body constitutes an act of outraging or scoffing her corpse, viz.: Now then, in downgrading the killing to Homicide (from the original charge of Murder), the trial court opined that there was no direct evidence to prove the qualifying aggravating circumstances of treachery, evident premeditation and abuse of superior strength. While We hesitatingly agree with this observation, (notwithstanding the physical and object evidence - like the naked state of the victim lying on the bed; the severe multiple traumatic injuries on the victim's head; the fatal stab wounds on the breast, neck and abdomen; the fact that accused-appellant brought along a knife and kerosene, plus the fact that accused-appellant was as clean as a cat without any abrasion or contusion whatsoever that may have been sustained if the victim was able to defend herself - are abundantly indicative of evident premeditation, treachery and use of superior strength), We nonetheless hold that under the extant circumstances, accused- appellant should be convicted for Murder, qualified by the additional modifying circumstance of outraging or scoffing at the victim's corpse. x x x x WHEREFORE, foregoing considered, the appealed Decision dated 16 June 2016 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 71, Pasig City, is MODIFIED as follows: Accused-appellant Raymund Camarse y Gimotea is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of: (1) the crime of Murder, defined and penalized under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, and he is sentenced to suffer the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua. In addition, accused-appellant is ordered to pay the heirs of the victim Regine A. Fernandez the sums of Seventy-Five Thousand Pesos (P75,000.00) as civil indemnity, Seventy-Five Thousand Pesos (P75,000.00) as moral damages; and Seventy-Five Thousand Pesos (P75,000.00) as exemplary damages; (2) the crime of Destructive Arson, defined and penalized under Article 320 of the Revised Penal Code, and he is sentenced to suffer the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua. SO ORDERED.","The Petition is unmeritorious. In the prosecution of criminal offenses, conviction is not always based on direct evidence. The Rules of Court allows resort to circumstantial evidence provided the following conditions are satisfied, to wit: (a) there is more than one circumstance; (b) the facts from which the inferences are derived are proven; and (c) the combination of all the circumstances is such as to produce a conviction beyond reasonable doubt. Here, none of the prosecution witnesses testified having seen Raymund kill Regine and bum the motel room. Yet, the corpus of circumstantial evidence constitutes an unbroken chain of events pointing to Raymund's guilt. ... To the unprejudiced mind, these proven facts, when weaved together, lead to no other conclusion but of Raymund's culpability for the crime. ... More importantly, the prosecution sufficiently alleged and proved the aggravating circumstance of outraging or scoffing the victim's corpse. The Information for murder explicitly stated that Raymund ""attack[ed], assault[ed] and stab[bed] one Regine A. Fernandez, hitting the latter in her chin and different parts of her body and thereafter set the body on fire."" In People v. Brodett, the Court affirmed the appreciation of the aggravating circumstance of outraging or scoffing the victim's corpse because the accused burned the victim's body and left it in the spillway to conceal the crime. Inarguably, Raymund burned Regine's body which constitutes an act of outraging or scoffing at her corpse. Similarly, the Court finds that there is circumstantial evidence that Raymund is guilty of destructive arson. ... The burning of a building for the purpose of concealing or destroying evidence of another violation of law likewise constitutes destructive arson. ... Corollarily, Raymund's defense of denial cannot prevail over the positive declaration of the prosecution witnesses.","ACCORDINGLY, the appeal is DENIED. The Court of Appeal's Decision dated October 5, 2017 in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 08510 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. In Criminal Case No. 145883, accused-appellant Raymund Camarse y Gimotea is found guilty of murder and is sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua. The accused-appellant is also DIRECTED to pay the heirs of the victim the amounts of PHP 75,000.00 civil indemnity, PHP 75,000.00 moral damages, PHP 75,000.00 exemplary damages, and PHP 50,000.00 temperate damages, all with legal interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the finality of judgment until full payment.

CORCEGA, AUDIT TEAM LEADER, AND WILHELMINA R. CABUHAT, SUPERVISING AUDITOR, AUDIT TEAM 20, GROUP F-LAGUNA PROVINCE, RESPONDENTS.","The petitioners are all officials of Pagsanjan Water District, a government-owned and controlled corporation, and a local water utility operating in the Municipality of Pagsanjan, Laguna. Paguio is the General Manager and Aguilar is the Administrative Division Manager. Meanwhile, petitioners Abarquez, Pabilonia, Velasco, Capistrano, and Bombay are members of Pagsanjan Water District's Board of Directors (Board). On January 25, 2005, Pagsanjan Water District's Interim Board issued Board Resolution No. 04, series of 2005, authorizing the payment of Extraordinary and Miscellaneous Expenses to its General Manager in the amount of PHP 13,000.00 per month effective January 1, 2005. Subsequently, under Board Resolution No. 136, series of 2006, the said allowance was increased to PHP 18,000.00 per month, which the General Manager regularly received. On June 2, 2011, Audit Observation Memorandum No. 2011-100-005 (09 & 10) was issued by respondents Mario A. Corcega and Wilhelmina R. Cabuhat. It was observed that an allowance of PHP 18,000.00 per month, amounting to PHP 432,000.00, was paid to Paguio during the said period and charged to Extraordinary and Miscellaneous Expenses, violating Section 25 of the 2009 General Appropriations Act and Section 28 of the 2010 General Appropriations Act. Additionally, instead of being paid through reimbursements, the payments of the said allowance were made on a commutable basis and supported by certifications, contravening Circular No. 2006-01 dated January 3, 2006 issued by the Commission. On May 10, 2012, the subject Notice of Disallowance was issued by Corcega and Cabuhat. It disallowed in audit the 2009 and 2010 payments of Extraordinary and Miscellaneous Expenses to Paguio in the total amount of PHP 432,000.00 and reiterated the findings on the previously issued Audit Observation Memorandum. Those held liable in the subject Notice of Disallowance were: (1) Paguio for being the claimant and the agency head who approved the payments; (2) Aguilar as the head of the division responsible for the pre-audit of the disbursement and certifying that the supporting documents were complete and proper; and (3) Abarquez, Pabilonia, Velasco, Capistrano, and Bombay in their capacities as members of the Board of Directors that approved the payments of the Extraordinary and Miscellaneous Expenses to Paguio through board resolutions and inclusion in the corporate budget. Aggrieved, Paguio, et al. appealed before the Commission's Regional Office No. IV-A, arguing that the grant was based on the Board's authority to fix compensation under Republic Act No. 9286 and Paguio's position as head of an agency. In her Decision No. 2013-30 dated October 21, 2013, respondent Regional Director Nilda M. Blanco denied Paguio, et al.'s appeal. Advancing the same arguments, Paguio, et al. subsequently sought relief before the Commission Proper via a petition for review. However, in the assailed Decision dated January 29, 2018, the petition was denied when the Commission Proper held that the Board was still required to seek DBM approval under Section 6 of Presidential Decree No. 1597 and Section 59 of the 2010 GAA, that Paguio's SG 24 was below the minimum SG 26 required for the allowance under the GAAs, and that Paguio, et al. violated Circular No. 2006-01 by failing to submit required receipts. Affirming the liability of Paguio, et al., the Commission Proper held that Paguio must return the amount based on solutio indebiti, and the authorizing officials are jointly and solidarily liable for illegal disbursement.","WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant petition is hereby DISMISSED.","This Court finds that the Commission Proper did not gravely abuse its discretion in affirming the disallowance of the grant of Extraordinary and Miscellaneous Expenses, the same having been made on the basis of cogent legal grounds. While a local water district's board of directors maintains the power to fix the compensation of its general manager, provided that such compensation is in accordance with the provisions of the Salary Standardization Law. Notably, the Extraordinary and Miscellaneous Expenses granted by the Board of Pagsanjan Water District is not among the listed exemptions to the integrated allowances under the Salary Standardization Law. Neither is there any showing that the said allowance was determined by the DBM as one which may be granted to the General Manager of Pagsanjan Water District. The grant of the Extraordinary and Miscellaneous Expenses in question is provided for under Section 25 of the 2009 General Appropriations Act and Section 28 of the 2010 General Appropriations Act. It is evident that a general manager of a local water district is not among those public officers mentioned. Paguio, et al. likewise failed to prove that the said position has been authorized by the DBM as an officer equivalent in rank with the officials listed. Thus, there is no legal basis for the grant of Extraordinary and Miscellaneous Expenses to Paguio and he is not entitled to the same. The distinction in salary grade classification is neither unreasonable nor unjustified. Assuming arguendo that the subject position is entitled to receive such an allowance, the payment of the same on the basis of certifications and through commutation cannot be countenanced. Items No. 2 and 3, Part Ill of the said circular requires that the payment of Extraordinary and Miscellaneous Expenses shall be strictly on a reimbursable or non-commutable basis and that a claim for reimbursement shall be supported by receipts and/ or other documents evidencing disbursements. The reimbursement mandated by Circular No. 2006-01 also requires the submission of receipts and/or other documents evidencing reimbursements, which petitioners likewise failed to observe. Circular No. 89-300 is not applicable in the instant case, as it expressly covers appropriations under the General Appropriations Act for National Government Agencies. Applying Rule 2(b) of the Rules on Return [Madera], this Court affirms Paguio, et al.'s solidary liability to return the disallowed amounts. Paguio, Abarquez, Pabilonia, Velasco, Capistrano, and Bombay violated the provisions of the 2009 and 2010 General Appropriations Acts when they granted and approved the payment of Extraordinary and Miscellaneous Expenses. Aguilar is likewise solidarily liable as head of the division responsible for the pre-audit of the disbursement and certifying that the supporting documents in relation to the payments of Extraordinary and Miscellaneous Expenses were complete and proper. Taking into account the palpable contravention of prevailing laws as well as the Commission on Audit rules and regulations, no badge of good faith may be considered to mitigate or condone Paguio, et al.'s liability. Paguio, as payee-recipient, is bound to return the amount disallowed in audit and received by him based on the principle of solutio indebiti, regardless of good faith. Paguio cannot invoke the exception for services rendered because the payments of Extraordinary and Miscellaneous Expenses to Paguio had no clear basis in law and were not disallowed due to mere irregularities. Paguio, et al. were sufficiently notified within the three-year period from the payments of the questioned allowance of the illegality and irregularity of the same via Audit Observation Memorandum No. 2011-100-005 (09 & 10) issued on June 2, 2011. Consequently, the return of the disallowed payments cannot be excused.","WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant petition is hereby DISMISSED. The Commission on Audit Decision No. 2018-187, dated January 29, 2018 is AFFIRMED. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 234766, October 18, 2022","ROSITA P. SINICLANG, PETITIONER, VS. THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS, THE HONORABLE OMBUDSMAN FOR LUZON AND ERNESTO A. LUCIANO, JR., RESPONDENTS. [G.R. No. 239855] ROSITA P. SINICLANG, PETITIONER, VS. ERNESTO A. LUCIANO, JR., RESPONDENT. [G.R. No. 247366] ROSITA P. SINICLANG, PETITIONER, VS. OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSMAN, AND ERNESTO A. LUCIANO, JR., RESPONDENTS. [G.R.No. 256013] ROSITA P. SINICLANG, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON AUDIT, RESPONDENT.","Rosita is the former Municipal Treasurer of the local government of San Emilio, Ilocos Sur. On 23 December 2013, she encashed checks for the payment of the Productivity Enhancement Incentive (PEI bonus) of municipal officials and employees and personally distributed the same to them. Some of the employees, however, were unable to claim theirs at the end of office hours that day. Since the vault in her office was defective and no longer being used, she placed the unclaimed money in four cloth bags, keeping three of them inside the central drawer of her office table while the fourth bag inside another drawer. She padlocked the center drawer and secured the other drawer with its built-in lock. Before going home, she locked the sliding windows and the door of her office. [17] Upon returning for work on 26 December 2013 after the holidays, Rosita noticed that the sliding window of her office was derailed and the grills were pried open. She immediately checked her office table and to her dismay, she discovered that the padlock latch of the center drawer was already destroyed and two of the money bags kept inside were emptied. She wasted no time and reported the incident to the San Emilio Police Station. During the investigation, the police officers determined that the perpetrator/s gained entry to Rosita's office after forcibly opening the southern steel grill and sliding window, and carted away cash amounting to P693,960.00, [18] which included the uncollected PEI bonuses of some municipal employees. [19] Thereafter, Rosita filed with the Commission on Audit Regional Office No. I a Notice of Loss [20] and Request From Relief From Accountability [21] for the loss of P693,960.00 and two booklets of blank checks. In its Decision No. 2015-009 [22] dated 29 April 2015, the Commission on Audit Regional Office No. I denied Rosita's request and held her liable for the loss of the PEI bonuses funds in the amount of P350,400.00 for her contributory negligence in storing the money and checkbooks in her office drawer instead of the vault. [23] Aggrieved by the said ruling, Rosita sought recourse [24] before the Commission on Audit Commission Proper, which denied her appeal in COA Decision No. 2018-089 dated 25 January 2018 for having been filed out of time. [25] The Commission on Audit Commission Proper also sustained the findings of the Commission on Audit Regional Office No. I that Rosita failed to exercise the diligence required of her position as custodian of government funds. Her Manifestation and Motion for Reconsideration [26] having been denied by the Commission on Audit Commission Proper, Rosita turned to this Court via a Petition for Certiorari [27] under Rule 64 of the Rules of Court, docketed as G.R. No. 256013. She adamantly maintains that her acts were not tainted with negligence or recklessness as to justify the denial of her request for relief from accountability for.the stolen money. Meanwhile, as an offshoot of the robbery incident, several employees of the municipal Government of San Emilio, Ilocos Sur instituted an administrative complaint against Rosita with the Civil Service Commission for her failure to distribute their respective PEI bonuses despite demand. In a Decisjon [28] promulgated on 19 January 2015, Director Nelson G. Sarmiento (Director Sarmiento) dismissed the complaint and found no evidence showing that petitioner unreasonably withheld the payment of the PEI bonuses, or that she appropriated the money for her personal use. In arriving at such conclusion, Director Sarmiento zeroed in on the police report that the unclaimed PEI bonuses were stolen from the municipal treasurer's office in which Rosita had no participation. The motion for reconsideration of the 19 January 2015 Decision was subsequently denied by the Civil Service Commission in a Resolution [29] dated 27 May 2015. On 11 September 2015, respondent Ernesto A. Luciano Jr. (Luciano), in his capacity as Secretary of the Sangguniang Bayan and as one of those affected by the lost PEI bonuses, filed a complaint against Rosita before the Office of the Ombudsman for 'Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service, Grave Misconduct, and Gross Neglect of Duty' with prayer for preventive suspension. The case was docketed as OMB-L-A-15-0499. [30] In the Order [31] dated 8 January 2016, the Office of the Ombudsman placed her under preventive suspension for a period not exceeding three months without pay. In issuing the said order, the Office of the Ombudsman relied on the 29 April 2015 Decision [32] of the Commission on Audit Regional Office No. I denying Rosita's request for relief from money accountability. After finding strong evidence of guilt that she was 'remiss in her duty as Municipal Treasurer' and in protecting the public funds in her custody, the Office of the Ombudsman ruled that 'a preventive suspension order is warranted to prevent [Rosita] from using her office to influence potential witnesses or tamper with records that may be vital in the prosecution of the present case.' [33] Thus, the Office of the Ombudsman ordained: WHEREFORE, in accordance with Section 24 of R.A. No. 6770 and Section 8, Rule III of Administrative Order No. 07, as amended, respondent Rosita Siniclang, Municipal Treasurer of San Emilio, Ilocos Sur is hereby placed under preventive suspension for a period not exceeding three (3) months without pay, which shall be immediately executory pursuant to Section 27, paragraph 1 of R.A. No. 6770. . . . The Honorable Secretary of the Department of Finance, or his duly authorized representative, is hereby directed to implement this Order immediately upon receipt hereof, and to notify this Office within five (5) days from said receipt of the status of said implementation. SO ORDERED. [34] Rosita subsequently filed a manifestation with the Office of the Ombudsman requesting that she be allowed to voluntarily comply with the preventive suspension order starting 15 February 2016 instead inasmuch as 'the character thereof' was immediately executory. . . . On 22 November 2018, the Court of Appeals rendered a Decision [40] on the consolidated cases finding no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Office of the Ombudsman in placing Rosita under preventive suspension. Likewise, the Court of Appeals held that the refusal of the Office of the Ombudsman to recognize petitioner's purported 'voluntary compliance' with the preventive suspension order was not tainted with grave abuse of discretion. . . Meanwhile, in the Decision [44] dated 5 September 2016, the Office of the Ombudsman found Rosita administratively liable for simple neglect of duty and meted upon her the penalty of suspension from office for one month and one day without pay.","The Court DENIED all four consolidated petitions filed by Rosita P. Siniclang and AFFIRMED the separate issuances of the Court of Appeals and the Commission on Audit, which held Siniclang administratively liable for simple neglect of duty and denied her request for relief from money accountability.","The Court ruled that the Office of the Ombudsman may intervene in the proceedings where its decision is subject of review, citing Office of the Ombudsman v. Samaniego. Furthermore, the previous decision of the Civil Service Commission did not bar the filing of a subsequent administrative complaint before the Office of the Ombudsman, and respondent Luciano was not guilty of forum shopping as the causes of action were not identical. Substantively, the Court found that the Office of the Ombudsman did not gravely abuse its discretion in placing petitioner Rosita under preventive suspension as evidence of guilt was strong and the charges warranted removal from service. The Court affirmed Rosita's liability for simple neglect of duty, noting that as municipal treasurer, she failed to exercise proper diligence by storing government funds in an easily compromised wooden cabinet instead of securing a serviceable vault, thus demonstrating contributory negligence. Finally, the Court held that the Commission on Audit Commission Proper did not gravely abuse its discretion in affirming the denial of Rosita's request for relief from money accountability, as its findings of negligence were supported by substantial evidence, consistent with Section 105 of P.D. No. 1445.","THE FOREGOING DISQUISITIONS CONSIDERED, the consolidated Petitions are hereby DENIED and the following are AFFIRMED: (1) Resolutions dated 21 March 2017 and 18 July 2017 of the Court of Appeals in CA-9.R.

SP No. 90547 and reinstated, albeit with modifications, the Decision of Regional Trial Court, Naga City, Branch 26 (RTC). The RTC reversed and set aside the Decision of Municipal Trial Court, Naga City, Branch I, which dismissed petitioners' Complaint for Unlawful Detainer. Au fond, the Court poked holes in the validity of the Deed of Donation purportedly executed by the registered owners of the subject realty, Macario Mariano (Mariano) and Jose A. Gimenez (Gimenez), in favor of respondent after discerning that: 1) the Deed contained a defective Acknowledgment as it was made neither by Mariano, Gimenez, their respective spouses, nor respondent through its then mayor, Monico Imperial (Mayor Imperial); and 2) Mayor Imperial's signature was affixed thereon on August 21, 1954, or four days after the Deed was notarized. Consequently, the instrument was stripped of public character and thus, a void contract. This Court likewise perceived respondent's passivity in failing to secure title over the contentious land despite the lapse of more than 50 years since the supposed execution of the Deed. Conversely, laches or prescription cannot be considered to have set in to effectively bar petitioners' claims given that: one, Mariano prodded respondent to act on Mayor Imperial's proposal to purchase the property; two, petitioners were entangled in a legal dispute to establish their right to inherit from Mariano and his spouse, Irene Mariano (Irene); and three, the disputed property was discovered only in 1997, when an administrator over Irene's estate was appointed, thereby prompting petitioners to demand respondent to vacate its premises. Respondent was ultimately adjudged to be in bad faith when it introduced improvements on the subject realty notwithstanding the failure to satisfy the condition inextricably attached to the donation, i.e., that the construction of the City Hall be awarded to City Heights Subdivision. Respondent filed a motion for reconsideration and then a Second Motion for Reconsideration, arguing that laches barred petitioners' claim and seeking referral En Banc, which was granted.","Respondent's Second Motion for Reconsideration is partly meritorious. Accordingly, the Decision dated March 12, 2018 and the Resolution dated July 23, 2018 rendered by the First Division of this Court are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATIONS in that:","The first prong of the aforementioned threshold, i.e., that the assailed decision is legally erroneous, obtains not because the First Division Decision incorrectly found against the applicability of laches to bar recovery of the disputatious property, but because it failed to consider the doctrinal rulings of the Court as to what constitutes the act of taking in relation to the State's eminent domain powers, as well as the remedies available to the landowner in instances where there is taking by the government of a private property for public purpose without first acquiring title thereto. To be sure, petitioners' claim to recover possession over the disputed land is not barred by laches. All the same, the Court finds and so rules that the First Division Decision erringly reinstated the portion of the trial court which essentially directed respondent and all government instrumentalities, agencies, and offices claiming right of possession through and under it to peacefully surrender and deliver the physical possession of the subject realty to petitioners. Considering that the physical return of the subject property on which respondent's seat of government and offices of several other government agencies and instrumentalities are currently erected is no longer feasible, the second prong of the ""higher interest of justice"" threshold is likewise satisfied as the unwarranted and irremediable injury or damage of forfeiting the established structures in favor of petitioners and directing respondent to vacate the contentious land looms large on the horizon. There can be no quibbling that here, there was ""taking"" when respondent, endowed with the power of eminent domain, occupied petitioners' land in 1954, which it then used as a government center. The taking of the property took place on August 16, 1954, when respondent admitted having entered, possessed, and started improving the property after the purported execution of the contentious Deed of Donation. Whence, in fealty to Secretary of DPWH, the Court rules and so holds that respondent must pay petitioners just compensation as of the time of taking of the contested land on August 16, 1954, computed in accordance with the formula laid down in Spouses Nocom. Withal, in order to scourge respondent's deplorable act of establishing the now-entrenched public offices on petitioners' property despite the irrefragable invalidity of the donation, the Court hereby orders the former to pay the latter P1,000,000.00 by way of exemplary damages. The Court is aware of the jurisdictional conundrum besetting the remand of the instant case to RTC for purposes of determining just compensation considering that the court of origin is, in point of fact, Branch I of the Municipal Trial Court of Naga City. This notwithstanding, compelling considerations of equity behoove this Court to overlook pro hac vice such procedural hurdle.","THE FOREGOING DISQUISITIONS CONSIDERED, respondent City of Naga's Second Motion for Reconsideration is hereby PARTLY GRANTED. Accordingly, the Decision dated March 12, 2018 and the Resolution dated July 23, 2018 rendered by the First Division of this Court are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATIONS in that: 1) The order for respondent and all government instrumentalities, agencies, and offices claiming right of possession through and under it to peacefully surrender and deliver to petitioners the physical possession of the land covered by Transfer of Certificate Title No. 671, including all improvements and structures erected thereon, is hereby DELETED; 2) The award of monthly rental in favor of petitioners is likewise DELETED; 3) Respondent City of Naga is ORDERED to pay petitioners just compensation in accordance with this ruling, with legal interest of six percent (6%) per annum on the value of the property at the time of taking, i.e., August 16, 1954, until full payment is made; and 4) Respondent City of Naga is ORDERED to pay petitioners exemplary damages in the amount of P1,000,000.00. The case is REMANDED to Branch 26, Regional Trial Court of Naga City for the determination of just compensation. The said court is DIRECTED to resolve the instant case with dispatch. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 232168, October 17, 2022","CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION, PETITIONER, VS. JEJOMAR ERWIN S. BINAY, JR. AND GERARDO KANGLEON SAN GABRIEL, RESPONDENTS.","On October 1, 2012, Makati City Mayor Jejomar Erwin Binay, Jr. (Mayor Binay) appointed Gerardo Kangleon San Gabriel (San Gabriel) as Makati City Government Department Head II at the General Services Department. In a Letter dated February 25, 2013, the Civil Service Commission-National Capital Region (CSC-NCR) invalidated the appointment because San Gabriel is a resident of Quezon City at the time of his appointment and failed to meet the minimum educational requirements under Republic Act (RA) No. 7160. Makati City Personnel Officer Vissia Marie Aldon (Aldon) filed a motion for reconsideration, which the CSC-NCR treated as an appeal and referred to the CSC proper. On January 13, 2015, the CSC dismissed the appeal because Aldon has no legal personality to challenge the disapproval of the appointment. Mayor Binay sought reconsideration, arguing that he authorized Aldon to question the disapproval (submitting an Indorsement dated February 10, 2015), and averring that San Gabriel met the residency requirement (living in Makati City) and satisfied the education requirement through experience. On April 10, 2015, the CSC denied the motion. Dissatisfied, Mayor Binay and San Gabriel elevated the case to the CA through a Petition for Review docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 140570. On November 29, 2016, the CA granted the Petition, reversed the CSC's findings, held that Aldon acted on behalf of Mayor Binay, affirmed that San Gabriel was a resident of Makati City, and found that his experience offset any lack of pointed academic training, thus affirming San Gabriel's appointment. The CSC sought reconsideration but was denied, hence the Petition before the Supreme Court.","The Petition is meritorious. The Supreme Court found that Aldon is not a real party in interest as she is neither the appointee nor the appointing authority. The Indorsement dated February 10, 2015, issued long after the appeal was filed, was a mere afterthought and did not ratify or acknowledge Aldon's act. Absent a proper and timely appeal, the CSC-NCR's Letter dated February 25, 2013 disapproving San Gabriel's appointment became final and executory. In any event, the Court found that the CSC correctly invalidated the appointment of San Gabriel because he failed to satisfy the residency requirement for the position. His Personal Data Sheet at the time of his appointment in 2012 indicated that he was a resident of Quezon City, and the documents presented to prove residency in Makati City (phone bills, statements, voter certification) were all issued in 2014, subsequent to the appointment.","The CSC is the central personnel agency of the government mandated to ensure that appointments in the civil service are generally made on the basis of merit and fitness. Either the appointing authority or the appointee may assail the invalidation or disapproval of an appointment. Aldon, the City Personnel Officer, is not a real party in interest. The Indorsement issued by Mayor Binay was a belated attempt to clothe Aldon with authority and did not ratify her earlier appeal. Corollarily, absent a proper and timely appeal, the CSC-NCR's Letter dated February 25, 2013 disapproving San Gabriel's appointment became final and executory. Further, San Gabriel failed to satisfy the residency requirement prescribed under Section 490(a) of RA 7160 because his PDS in 2012 stated Quezon City residency, and the evidence supporting Makati residency post-dated the appointment. The CSC was well within its right and responsibility to disapprove the appointment as the appointee did not satisfy the minimum qualifications for the position.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is GRANTED. The Decision of the Court of Appeals dated November 29, 2016 in CA-G.R. SP No. 140570 is REVERSED. The Decision dated January 13, 2015 of the Civil Service Commission is REINSTATED. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 222259, October 17, 2022","LOWELLA YAP, PETITIONER, VS. ALMEDA YAP, HEARTY YAP-DYBONGCO AND DIOSDADO YAP, JR., RESPONDENTS.","On March 12, 1996, Lowella and Josie May Yap (Josie) filed before the Regional Trial Court a Complaint for partition and accounting with prayer for receivership and preliminary injunction against Almeda Yap (Almeda), Hearty Yap-Dybongco (Hearty), and Diosdado Yap, Jr. (Diosdado, Jr.). They alleged that Diosdado, Sr. died in January 1995 and left as heirs his wife Almeda, their marital children Josie, Hearty, and Diosdado, Jr., and an acknowledged nonmarital child, Lowella. Later, Lowella and Josie discovered that a portion of the decedent's estate had been extrajudicially partitioned among Almeda, Hearty, and Diosdado, Jr. This prompted Lowella and Josie to file a complaint for partition before the Regional Trial Court. In their answer, Almeda, Hearty, and Diosdado, Jr. denied that Lowella and Josie are heirs of the decedent. They likewise claimed that Lowella's father is not Diosdado, Sr., but a certain Bernardo Lumahang (Lumahang), to whom her mother Matilde Lusterio was married on January 15, 1953. Trial proceeded with Lowella testifying and presenting evidence, including a Certification issued by the Civil Registrar of the Municipality of Bacolod relating to the registration of Nelie Rosterio Yap's birth to Diosdado Yap and Matilde Rosterio/Lusterio, a Special Power of Attorney executed by Diosdado, Sr. referring to Lowella as his daughter, and Diosdado, Sr.'s Affidavit identifying Lowella Yap or Nelie Yap as one and the same person and his natural daughter. For the defense, Almeda presented Lusterio and Lumahang's marriage contract and birth certificates of their other children, arguing Lowella was Lumahang’s marital child. In its March 28, 2012 Decision, the Regional Trial Court ruled in favor of Lowella, finding her status as Diosdado, Sr.'s nonmarital daughter established because, though born during Lusterio's marriage to Lumahang, Lowella's unrefuted testimony showed Lusterio and Lumahang had separated during the period of conception. The RTC ordered partition. Almeda, Hearty, and Diosdado, Jr. appealed. In its assailed Decision, the Court of Appeals set aside the portion of the Regional Trial Court's ruling decreeing Lowella to be Diosdado, Sr.'s acknowledged nonmarital child. It likewise dismissed Lowella's Complaint for partition and accounting with prayer for receivership for being devoid of merit.","In its assailed Decision, the Court of Appeals set aside the portion of the Regional Trial Court's ruling decreeing Lowella to be Diosdado, Sr.'s acknowledged nonmarital child. It ruled that since Lowella was born during the subsistence of Lusterio and Lumahang's marriage, she enjoys the presumption of legitimacy provided under Article 164 of the Family Code. It decreed that a child's legitimate status can only be impugned in an action instituted for that purpose, and not through a mere action for partition, thus: The factual basis for the presumption of legitimacy has been sufficiently established in this case. As earlier discussed, the evidence on record readily shows that at the time plaintiff-appellee was born, her mother, Matilde Lusterio was legally married to one Bernardo Lumahang, Sr. Thus, having been born inside the valid marriage between mother and Bernardo Lumahang, Sr. plaintiff-appellee cannot validly claim her status as an illegitimate daughter of the decedent without first having her status as a legitimate daughter of Bernardo Lumahang, Sr. impugned in an action instituted for that purpose in accordance with Articles 170 and 171 of the Family Code. Accordingly the trial court could not validly declare plaintiff-appellee to be an illegitimate daughter of Bernardo Lumahang, Sr. in the present case for partition as the same would have the effect of collaterally impugning plaintiff-appellee's legitimate status.","The Petition is meritorious. The Supreme Court held that while a child born during marriage is presumed legitimate (Article 164), this presumption may be refuted using grounds under Article 166, including biological or scientific reasons. Citing Santiago v. Jornacion, the Court noted that an unbending application of Articles 170 and 171, which restrict the action to impugn legitimacy only to the husband or his heirs, is illogical if it prevents a child from establishing his or her true (illegitimate) filiation, especially in light of scientific proof, as the best interest of the child is to allow petitioner to prove and establish her true filiation. However, the SC found that the RTC's conclusion that Lumahang and Lusterio had separated, which was the basis for overturning the presumption of legitimacy, was grounded entirely on speculation, relying only on Lowella's uncorroborated testimony, and separation alone is insufficient without proof of impossibility of sexual union. Since complete resolution requires additional evidence, and the Court is not a trier of facts, the prudent recourse is for the case to be remanded to the court of origin for the reception of additional evidence, including DNA evidence, which is allowed under the Rule on DNA Evidence even after the death of the putative father (Diosdado, Sr.) as long as appropriate biological samples exist.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is GRANTED. The April 30, 2015 Decision and November 13, 2015 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV NO. 03083-MIN are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The case is REMANDED to the Regional Trial Court of Ozamiz City, Branch 15 for the resolution of the issue on Lowella Yap's filiation, including the reception of DNA evidence. The Regional Trial Court is directed to proceed with dispatch in the disposition of the case and to report to this Court the result of the proceedings below within 60 days from the receipt of this Decision."

DIAZ, AND CARMELITA B. VELARDE, PETITIONERS, VS. HEIRS OF CONCEPCION CANDARI, RESPONDENTS.","Adolfo B. Velarde (Adolfo), married to Antonina T. Velarde; Romulo B. Velarde (Romulo), married to Jean T. Velarde; Bella B. Velarde; Benedicto B. Velarde (Benedicto); Isabelle V. Diaz; and Carmelita B. Velarde (Carmelita) (collectively, petitioners) are the legal heirs of Isagani S. Velarde (Isagani). In a notarized Deed of Sale with Right of Repurchase dated April 20, 1978, respondent Concepcion Candari (Concepcion) sold seven parcels of land located in Aklan to Isagani with the right to repurchase within five years. Concepcion failed to redeem the lots. Thus, in a notarized Deed of Quitclaim and Waiver of Rights dated February 11, 1986, Concepcion relinquished absolute ownership of the lots in favor of Isagani and petitioners. Notably, in 1982, certain lots were registered under Original Certificate of Title (OCT) Nos. P-17480, P-17483, and P-17481 under the names of Adolfo, Romulo, and Carmelita, respectively. Petitioners averred that after Isagani's death on February 22, 1987, Concepcion began to represent herself as the owner of the parcels of land by instituting tenants, collecting rentals, and appropriating the lands' produce. Petitioners filed a complaint for quieting of title and damages. Concepcion denied having sold or relinquished ownership, claimed Isagani was merely her lessee, and accused Isagani and petitioners of obtaining the deeds of conveyances, OCTs, and TDs by fraudulent means, asking for damages and reconveyance. In a Decision dated July 5, 2001, the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Culasi, Antique, Branch 13, granted the complaint for quieting of title, declaring petitioners as the true and rightful owners.","However, on appeal, the CA sustained Concepcion's allegations of fraud, and consequently, ordered the cancellation of petitioners' OCTs and TDs, and the reconveyance of all the properties subject of the pacto de retro sale to Concepcion. As regards the parcel acquired from Rizalina, the CA held that it was not the proper subject of the action for quieting of title. In the assailed Decision dated October 30, 2008, the CA disposed: WHEREFORE, the present appeal is GRANTED. The DECISION of the [RTC] in Civil Case No. C-031 is hereby REVERSED AND SET ASIDE. The Deed of Sale with Right of Repurchase and Deed of Quitclaim and Waiver of Rights are both declared NULL AND VOID. [Petitioners] are HEREBY ORDERED TO RECONVEY to [Concepcion] the five parcels of land subject of the Deed of Absolute Sale with Right of Repurchase, within fifteen (15) days from the finality of this Decision, and to surrender to her, within the same period, the owner's duplicate copy of [OCT] No. P-17480, P-17481[,] and P-17483 of the Registry of Deeds of the Province of Antique. In the event that [petitioners] fail or refuse to execute the necessary deed of reconveyance as herein directed, the Clerk of Court of the [RTC] is HEREBY ORDERED TO EXECUTE THE SAME at the expense of [petitioners]. Finally, the Municipal Assessor of Pandan, Antique is also ORDERED TO CANCEL the Tax Declarations in the names of [petitioners] over Lots No. 287, 290, 428, 6111 and the unirrigated riceland situated in Guia, Pandan, Antique with an area of 12,000 square meters and in lieu thereof, ISSUE the tax declarations of these properties to [Concepcion].","The Supreme Court found that the Petition for Review on Certiorari substantially complied with the rules on Verification and Certification Against Forum Shopping, as petitioners share a common interest. The Court reclassified the action as an accion reivindicatoria, a suit to recover full possession as an element of ownership, rather than merely quieting of title. The Court held that Concepcion failed to prove fraud. Mere non-compliance with Article 1607 of the NCC (judicial order for consolidation of ownership in pacto de retro sale) is not proof of fraud, and the purpose of judicial determination under Article 1607 was served in these proceedings. Fraud must be proven by clear and convincing evidence, which Concepcion failed to do, relying instead on bare denials against notarized documents which enjoy a presumption of regularity. Since Concepcion failed to repurchase the properties within the stipulated five years (1978-1983), absolute ownership was automatically vested upon Isagani (petitioners' predecessor-in-interest) by operation of law, regardless of the premature registration of OCTs or the subsequent Deed of Quitclaim and Waiver of Rights. Petitioners, as Isagani’s heirs, therefore hold irrevocable title over the disputed properties.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is GRANTED. The Decision dated October 30, 2008 and the Resolution dated September 29, 2009 of the Court of Appeals-Cebu City in CA-G.R. CV No. 72998 are REVERSED. The Decision dated July 5, 2001 of the Regional Trial Court of Culasi, Antique, Branch 13, in Civil Case No. C-031 is REINSTATED. Petitioners Spouses Adolfo B. Velarde and Antonina T. Velarde, Spouses Romulo B. Velarde and Jean T. Velarde, Bella B. Velarde, Benedicto B. Velarde, Isabelle V. Diaz, and Carmelita B.

"G.R. No. 238308, October 12, 2022","REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, PETITIONER, VS. TERESITA I. SALINAS, RESPONDENT.","This case stemmed from a Petition for Declaration of Nullity of Marriage[5] filed by respondent Teresita I. Salinas (Salinas) on the ground of psychological incapacity, raffled to the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 48 (RTC). The petition was granted in a Decision[6] dated May 13, 2015. The Republic filed a motion for reconsideration (MR), but was denied in an Order[7] dated July 27, 2015, which it received on August 4, 2015. It, thus, had until August 19, 2015 to file an appeal.[8] However, the RTC received a Notice of Appeal[9] via registered mail, contained in an envelope rubber stamped with the date ""October 5, 2015,""[10] which it found to be imprinted by the postmaster. Thus, in an Order[11] dated October 15, 2015, the RTC denied the Republic's Notice of Appeal for being filed late. The Republic moved for reconsideration, positing that its Notice of Appeal was seasonably filed. To support its claim, the Republic attached a photocopy of the OSG Inner Registered Sack Bill[12] dated August 18, 2015, which includes entry numbers ""18"" and ""19""[13] or registry numbers ""3495"" and ""3496,""[14] pertaining to a Notice of Appeal purportedly sent to ""RTC Br 48""[15] and Salinas' counsel, Atty. Pacianito B. Cabaron.[16] The OSG bill bears a rubber stamp, stating ""ERMITA POST OFFICE Registered Mail AUG 18 2015.""[17] The Republic also filed a supplement to the MR, attaching a Certification[18] dated January 6, 2016 issued by Evelyn B. Jacala, Postmaster of the Ermita Post Office, stating that the registered letters with numbers 3495 and 3496 from the OSG were posted on August 18, 2015. Just the same, the MR was denied by the RTC in an Order[19] dated December 22, 2015.[20] The Republic challenged the RTC Orders disallowing its Notice of Appeal through certiorari proceedings before the CA. In its Decision[21] dated October 24, 2017, the CA found no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the RTC in denying the Notice of Appeal for being filed beyond the 15-day reglementary period. The CA considered the OSG Inner Registered Sack Bill akin to a registry receipt as it contains the following information: 'Entry Number ""18"" and ""19,""[22] pertaining to a Notice of Appeal with Registry Numbers ""3495"" and ""3496,""[23] sent to ""RTC Br 48""[24] and Salinas' counsel, Atty. Pacianito B. Cabaron,[25] rubber stamped with ""ERMITA POST OFFICE Registered Mail AUG 18 2015.""[26] However, the CA observed that the Republic failed to present an affidavit of the person who purportedly mailed the Notice of Appeal as required under Section 12,[27] Rule 13 of the Rules. Under the Rules, a pleading filed via registered mail is proved by presenting the: (1) registry receipt; and (2) the affidavit of the person who did the mailing, stating the date of mailing and the particular post office where the mail matter was posted. The CA concluded that absent one of the two proofs of filing, it cannot be concluded that the Republic filed a Notice of Appeal on or before August 19, 2015.[28] The CA disposed: Accordingly, we DISMISS the Petition for Certiorari. IT IS SO ORDERED.[29] (Italics supplied and emphases in the original) The Republic filed an MR, which was likewise denied in the assailed CA Resolution[30] dated March 21, 2018. Hence, this Petition.[31]","In its Decision[21] dated October 24, 2017, the CA found no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the RTC in denying the Notice of Appeal for being filed beyond the 15-day reglementary period. [...] The CA disposed: Accordingly, we DISMISS the Petition for Certiorari. IT IS SO ORDERED.","We emphasize, at the outset, the need to rectify the erroneous reliance of the parties and the CA in Section 12, now Section 16, Rule 13 of the Rules, which states: [...] Gleaned from its unequivocal wordings, the provision applies only when a pleading or any other court submission is claimed to have been filed, but for some reason, such document cannot be found in the records;[37] hence, the need for proof of its filing. That is not the case here. [...] In that respect, Section 3, Rule 13 of the Rules[38] is apropos, viz.: [...] Plainly, the pleading's filing date can be proved either by: (1) the post stamp on the envelope, which is considered part of the records; or (2) the registry receipt. Thus, no grave abuse of discretion can be imputed to the RTC in considering the date stamped on the envelope of the Republic's Notice of Appeal, which was October 5, 2015, as the date of the pleading's filing. Contrary to the CA's ruling, the photocopy of the OSG Inner Registered Sack Bill cannot be equated to a registry receipt nor given probative value. Unlike a registry receipt, the OSG's Inner Registered Sack Bill was not issued or signed by the postmaster or any authorized receiving personnel of the concerned post office; hence, unverified to be authentic. [...] The Republic attempted to bolster its claim of timely filing by presenting a Certification issued by the Ermita Post Office postmaster, which states: [...] Contrary to the Republic's argument, this Certification does not suffice to prove that it filed its Notice of Appeal on August 18, 2015 given that a different date appears on the envelope containing such pleading. We iterate, under Section 3, Rule 13 of the Rules, the date of the filing is shown either in the post office stamp on the envelope or the registry receipt. Thus, while the postmaster's certification is usually sufficient proof of mailing, its evidentiary value is different in this case as it is not merely intended to prove the fact of mailing, but to prove that the date stamped on the pleading's envelope was either incorrect due to the post office's inadvertence or not stamped by the post office.[45] We stress, the envelope and the date appearing on it is made part of the records; hence, it carries the presumption that the date stamped on it was done in the course of the official duties that have been regularly performed, unless proven otherwise.[46] Starkly, the Certification is bereft of any explanation as to the discrepancy between the date appearing on the envelope and the date stated in the Certification.[47] [...] Furthermore, the Republic could have conveniently presented the registry receipt corresponding to its Notice of Appeal, which would have constituted the best evidence of its claim that it filed its Notice of Appeal on August 18, 2015, even if a different date appears on the envelope.[49] Unfortunately, the Republic failed to present such original receipt nor has it offered any explanation for its failure to do so, which only leads to a conclusion that such evidence would operate to its prejudice and support the case of the adversary.[50] Verily, we find no reason to deviate from the CA's conclusion that the RTC is not guilty of grave abuse of discretion in denying the Republic's Notice of Appeal for being filed late. The Republic likewise failed to convince us that it is entitled to the Court's liberality in applying the Rules.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED. The Decision dated October 24, 2017 and the Resolution dated March 21, 2018 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 144681 are AFFIRMED insofar as it upheld the denial of the Notice of Appeal.

"G.R. No. 254125, October 12, 2022","ROGELIM A. CABRALES AND NOE CABRIDO GOZALO, PETITIONERS, VS. THE OMBUDSMAN, NAHUM E. DOSDOS, PASCUAL R. PONGASE II, AND RAUL P. LLAGAS,*** RESPONDENTS.","Sometime between November 2010 and May 2011, the Municipality of Tukuran, Zamboanga del Sur (the Municipality), conducted a procurement process for a motor grader. The purchase request, signed by then Mayor Francisvic S. Villamero (Villamero), specified one unit of Chenggong MG1320C Motor Grader. The records show that two (2) entities participated in the bidding: Eagle Equipment Company, Inc. (Eagle) and Ivan Carr Industrial Supply and Construction Inc. (Ivan Carr). Ivan Carr's bid was calculated by the Municipal Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) as the Lowest Calculated and Responsive Bid; and said bid cleared the post-qualification phase. Accordingly, the BAC recommended the award of the procurement to Ivan Carr; and the Municipality proceeded to buy the motor grader from Ivan Carr for the price of P9,450,000.00. Claiming that the transaction was attended by irregularities, private respondents Nahum E. Dosdos, Pascual R. Pongase II, and Raul P. Llagas, filed a complaint with the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) against various officials of the Municipality, including Municipal Planning and Development Coordinator/BAC Member Rogelim A. Cabrales (Cabrales), and Sangguniang Bayan Member/Alternate BAC Chairperson Noe C. Gozalo (Gozalo). The NBI investigation found that the motor grader was overpriced, and that the aforementioned public officers rigged the bidding process therefor. The NBI further found the following irregularities in the procurement of the motor grader: 1) Villamero specified the brand Chenggong in the Purchase Request; 2) the Municipality could not have possibly posted the Invitation to Bid (ITB) and other pertinent bidding documents in the Philippine Government Electronic Procurement System (PhilGEPS) website because it was not registered therewith; 3) one of the bidders, Eagle, is not registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC); 4) the winning bidder, Ivan Carr, uses a residential house as its business address; and 5) the President/Chief Executive Officer of Ivan Carr is an agent of the other bidder, Eagle. On June 22, 2016, the NBI referred the findings of its investigation to the OMB. The administrative aspect of the case was docketed as OMB-M-A-16-0262.","The OMB found Cabrales and Gozalo, among others, guilty of grave misconduct. They were ordered dismissed from government service, with the accessory penalties of cancellation of civil service eligibility, forfeiture of retirement benefits, and perpetual disqualification from government service. The OMB also found probable cause to charge Cabrales, Gozalo, and their correspondents with violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019. The CA dismissed Cabrales' and Gozalo's appeal and affirmed the OMB ruling. The CA sustained the OMB's finding of grave misconduct, citing violations including specifying a brand name, favoring Ivan Carr despite eligibility failures, non-publication of the ITB in a newspaper of nationwide general circulation, and conducting procurement despite the Municipality's non-registration with the PhilGEPS.","The Supreme Court ruled that the grader procurement in question violated procurement regulations (specification of brand name, lack of PhilGEPS registration, inadequate ITB publication). The Court found that the condonation doctrine does not apply to Gozalo, as he was an appointive public official when the offense was committed. The Court also held that Cabrales' nonconcurrence with the final recommendation to award the contract to Ivan Carr does not shield him from liability, as the functions of BAC members are not merely ceremonial. However, the Court ruled that violations of the procurement law or regulations, without proof of corruption, willful intent to violate the law, or to disregard established rules, amount only to simple misconduct. Since neither the OMB nor the CA was able to prove the qualifying elements of grave misconduct, the petitioners are guilty only of simple misconduct.","WHEREFORE, the present petition is PARTIALLY GRANTED. The August 30, 2019 Decision and the August 10, 2020 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 08750-MIN are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE insofar as these affirmed the dismissal of petitioners Rogelim A. Cabrales and Noe Cabrido Gozalo from the government service, together with its accessory penalties. Rogelim A. Cabrales and Noe Cabrido Gozalo are hereby found GUILTY of Simple Misconduct and PENALIZED with suspension for three (3) months without pay, or a fine equivalent to three (3) months' salary deductible from whatever benefits may be due them, whichever is applicable under the Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service.

"A.C. No. 13372 [Formerly CBD Case No. 19-5931], October 12, 2022","JUANITO V. PARAS, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. JONATHAN J. DE PAZ, RESPONDENT.","Paras alleged that Atty. De Paz notarized the Last Will and Testament (Last Will)[2] of Sergio Antonio Paras, Jr. (Sergio), wherein the latter instituted the twins, James Gabriel and John Michael, as his heirs, without including his mother, Arlinda Paras, which act in itself constitutes preterition. Upon further inquiry, Paras found out that Atty. De Paz likewise notarized an Affidavit of Admission of Paternity and Consent to Use Surname of the Father (Affidavit of Admission of Paternity),[3] allegedly signed by Sergio, recognizing the paternity of James Gabriel and John Michael.[4] Paras averred that the Last Will under Doc. No. 202, Page No. 40, Book No. VI, Series of 201.5,[5] and the Affidavit of Admission of Paternity of the twins under Doc. No. 128, Page No. 26, Book No. VI, Series of 2015,[6] were falsities and forgeries, and that Atty. De Paz did not record said documents in his notarial book nor submit their duplicate original copies to the Notarial Section, Office of the Clerk of Court (OCC), Regional Trial Court (RTC)-Cebu City.[7] He likewise alleged that the documents were both indicated in the same notarial book with very close page and document numbers, and that Atty. De Paz failed to comply with Section 2, Rule VI of the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice,[8] as the entry appearing on Doc. No. 202, Page .No. 40, Book No. VI, Series of 2015 does not pertain to the Last Will but a judicial affidavit dated June 13, 2015 of a certain ""Fe P. Canada.""[9] Moreover, he claimed that per Questioned Document Report No. 09-2017-43[10] by Five R Forensic Examination and Consultancy, the signature of Sergio on the Last Will, as compared to his signatures appearing on his senior citizen's identification card, 11 checks from Equicom Savings Bank, and one check from Eastwest Bank, were written by two different persons.[11] He further averred that they instituted a case for correction of entries of birth certificates of James Gabriel and John Michael to correct the illegally entered Affidavit of Admission of Paternity and the use of the twins of the surname ""Paras,"" which constituted the crime of simulation of birth.[12] For his part, Atty. De Paz admitted the existence of the Last Will and the Affidavit of Admission of Paternity, as well as the fact that he notarized the same. However, he maintained that both documents were not forged, as they were duly executed by Sergio himself. He claimed that there can be no preterition as the Last Will was not about the disposition of Sergio's properties but more on the appointment of a guardian for his minor children. He then admitted the non-entry of the Last Will and the Affidavit of Admission of Paternity in his notarial registry but claimed that the same was attributable to the inadvertence on the part of his office clerk, who was in charge of the recording of the entries therein.[13] He likewise averred that the said non-entry does not mean that the subject documents were forgeries. He further claimed that he was not duty-bound to submit the subject documents to the Notarial Section, OCC, RTC-Cebu City, much less retain copies thereof. Finally, he claimed that the allegation as to the forgery of the Last Will was utterly self-­serving as when Sergio signed the same in 2015, there were three witnesses present, namely: Valentino C. Bacalso, Jr., Neil John Ryan Baruc, and Gela P. Durango.[14]",The Court affirms the findings and adopts the recommendation of the IBP with modification as to the imposable penalty.,"The Court affirms the findings and adopts the recommendation of the IBP with modification as to the imposable penalty. Atty. De Paz violated the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice when: (a) he admitted the inadvertence caused by his office clerk as to the nonregistration in his notarial registry of the Last Will and the Affidavit of Admission of Paternity executed by Sergio; and (b) he claimed that he was not duty-bound to submit to the Notarial Section, OCC, RTC-Cebu City a duplicate original copy of the Last Will, much less retain a copy thereof. This constitutes a violation of Rule 1.01, Canon 1 (unlawful, dishonest, immoral or deceitful conduct) and Rule 9.01, Canon 9 (unlawful delegation of task) of the Code of Professional Responsibility. The Court held that the notarial commission is a license held personally by the notary public and cannot be delegated.","ACCORDINGLY, respondent Atty. Jonathan J. De Paz is found GUILTY of violating the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice and Canon 1, Rule 1.01 and Canon 9, Rule 9.01 the Code of Professional Responsibility. Accordingly, he is SUSPENDED from the practice of law for a period of three months effective immediately. His notarial commission is likewise REVOKED, and he is DISQUALIFIED to be reappointed as a notary public for a period of one year. Moreover, he is STERNLY WARNED that a repetition of the same offense or similar act shall be dealt with more severely. The suspension from the practice of law, the prohibition from being commissioned as a notary public, and the revocation of his notarial commission, if any, shall take effect immediately upon receipt of this Decision by respondent. He is DIRECTED to immediately file a manifestation to the Court that his suspension has started, copy furnished all courts and quasi-judicial bodies where he has entered his appearance as counsel. Let a copy of this Decision be furnished to the Office of the Bar Confidant, to be attached to his personal record as a member of the Bar.

"G.R. No. 232755, October 12, 2022","MERLITA JANEO RAMOS, PETITIONER, VS. EMELITA JANEO SOL, RESPONDENT.","Deogracias Janeo (Deogracias) was declared a farmer-beneficiary of a 2.5-hectare land in Iloilo and was issued Certificate of Land Transfer (CLT) No. 077984. Upon his death in 1976, respondent Emelita Janeo Sol (Emelita) cultivated the land and was initially confirmed and designated by the Regional Director as the sole owner-cultivator, leading to the issuance of Emancipation Patent (EP) No. A-119356 and Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. EP-5840 in her name. However, petitioner Merlita Janeo Ramos (Merlita) and other siblings alleged fraud in the execution of the Waiver of Rights favoring Emelita. The DAR Secretary, after reinvestigation, revoked the earlier order and directed the issuance of an EP in favor of Merlita (Order dated May 31, 1996), finding Merlita to be the rightful successor based on the priority rules under Memorandum Circular No. 19, Series of 1978. The Office of the President (OP) affirmed the DAR Secretary's decision, ruling that the Waiver of Rights in favor of Emelita was attended by fraud. Emelita filed a Petition for Review with the Court of Appeals (CA). The CA reversed the OP and DAR rulings, holding that the DAR Secretary lacked jurisdiction to order the issuance of a new EP for Merlita over a property already covered by a registered TCT (TCT No. EP-5840), arguing that the matter fell under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB) or required a direct attack on the title.","WHEREFORE, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is GRANTED. The assailed Decision dated November 29, 2016 and the Resolution dated June 23, 2017 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 05935 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

Case No. 02-17-88-134, are REINSTATED.","The Supreme Court ruled that the identification and selection of agrarian reform beneficiaries involve the administrative implementation of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program, which is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the DAR Secretary. The instant case, being a dispute between heirs of a deceased CARP beneficiary concerning who should succeed him, is not an 'agrarian dispute' cognizable by the DARAB. Thus, the CA erred in finding that the DAR Secretary lacked jurisdiction. Furthermore, the Court held that the DAR Secretary's order to issue an EP in favor of Merlita does not constitute a collateral attack on TCT No. EP-5840 issued in Emelita’s name, as Merlita is questioning Emelita’s qualification to succeed as allocatee, not the title itself. The DAR Secretary's order merely directs the issuance of an EP to Merlita and does not automatically cancel Emelita's registered title; it will serve as a basis for Merlita to file a subsequent petition for cancellation. The Court reinstated the findings of the DAR Secretary, which were affirmed by the OP, due to the DAR's technical expertise in such administrative matters.","The Petition for Review on Certiorari is GRANTED. The Court of Appeals decision is REVERSED and SET ASIDE, and the rulings of the Office of the President and the Department of Agrarian Reform designating Merlita Janeo Ramos as the legitimate farmer-beneficiary are REINSTATED."
"G.R. No. 237815, October 12, 2022","ORLANDO A. FUA, JR., PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","The instant case stemmed from the Affidavit-Complaint executed by Police Inspector Reynaldo Espina Valmoria (P/Insp. Valmoria) against petitioner before the Office of the Ombudsman (Ombudsman). A buy-bust operation was conducted around midnight on November 24, 2010 against James Alaya-ay Largo @ ""Aloy"" (Largo). A Search Warrant was served upon Largo for violation of Republic Act No. (RA) 9165. During the search, petitioner, then Provincial Governor of Siquijor, arrived at the scene and looked for P/Insp. Valmoria, who was the leader of the raiding team. He questioned the legality of the operation, demanded to see the warrant, and inquired into the grounds for its issuance. P/Insp. Valmoria testified that when the team was about to depart from the scene together with Largo, petitioner tried to prevent them from taking Largo into custody. Petitioner threatened P/Insp. Valmoria, saying: ""(i)f you will bring Largo, you will be sued in court. I guess you haven't tried facing any charge against you before, bay."" The Information was filed in the Sandiganbayan charging petitioner with willfully, unlawfully and criminally obstructing, impeding, frustrate and delaying the apprehension of a criminal offender by means of delaying the prosecution of criminal cases when he obstructed the service of Search Warrant No. 2010-07. Petitioner, in defense, insisted that he did not obstruct the service of the search warrant as he merely asked for justification for the irregularities in the manner of its service and even offered to act as one of the government witnesses by signing the inventory receipt of the seized items.","On January 19, 2017, the Sandiganbayan rendered the assailed Decision that found petitioner guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 1(e) of PD 1829, the decretal portion of which provides: WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court finds accused Orlando Anoos Fua, Jr. GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of obstruction of justice in violation of Sec. 1(e) of Presidential Decree No. 1829. He is hereby sentenced to pay a fine of Six Thousand Pesos (P6,000) and, in case of insolvency, shall be required to undergo subsidiary imprisonment. Accused Fua, Jr. shall also suffer the penalty of perpetual disqualification from holding any public office and to pay the costs. SO ORDERED.","The Court grants the petition. The Court ruled that the Sandiganbayan has jurisdiction over the case because the offense was committed before the effectivity of RA 10660 and the acts were committed in relation to petitioner's office. However, the Court held that the acts of petitioner in questioning the regularity and manner of implementation of the search warrant were not tantamount to Obstruction of Justice contemplated by PD 1829. The Court viewed petitioner's questioning the legality of the search and its implementation at midnight as a valid exercise by Largo, through petitioner, of his Constitutional right to be secure against unreasonable searches and seizures. The Court noted that prosecution witnesses confirmed the search was conducted in an orderly manner and that petitioner only asked questions regarding the regularity of the operation. Furthermore, petitioner signed the Receipt/Inventory of Property Seized as a witness, demonstrating submission to the process, contrary to the claim that he willfully delayed or obstructed the implementation. Thus, the prosecution miserably failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that petitioner committed acts in violation of Section 1(e) of PD 1829.","WHEREFORE, the Decision dated January 19, 2017 and the Resolution dated March 2, 2018 of the Sandiganbayan in SB-14-CRM­0001 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

"G.R. No. 252715, October 12, 2022","JOEL G. NOLASCO, PETITIONER, VS. PURENCE REALTY CORPORATION, RESPONDENT.","On February 2, 2017, Purence Realty Corporation (Purence) filed an action for recovery of posession and quieting of title with damages against Nolasco and Elizardo Francisco (Francisco) (collectively, defendants) in the RTC of Biñan, Laguna. Purence alleged that it is the absolute owner of the lots covered by Transfer Certificates of Title (TCT) Nos. 131670 and 131671 at Don Jose Zavalla Subdivision in Sta. Rosa, Laguna. Sometime in 1990, it discovered that the defendants illegally entered and occupied the properties through stealth and strategy and without its consent. Only Nolasco was successfully served with summons. However, he failed to file his answer to the complaint, prompting Purence to file a motion to declare him in default. Nolasco subsequently filed his answer. He claimed that his parents, Roberto and Flaviana, bought the properties from spouses Dichoso, who in tum, purchased them from Purence. In its Resolution dated May 8, 2018, the RTC declared Nolasco in default after finding that it took him more or less 87 days to file his answer. The RTC subsequently ruled in favor of Purence in its Decision dated November 12, 2018, ordering Nolasco to vacate the premises. Nolasco filed an appeal to the CA. In its Resolution dated August 30, 2019, the CA considered the appeal abandoned and dismissed the case for Nolasco's failure to file an appellant's brief under Section 1(e), Rule 50 of the Rules of Court. Nolasco filed a Motion for Reconsideration (With Motion to Admit Attached Brief for the Respondent-Appellant), which the CA denied in its Resolution dated June 10, 2020. Undaunted, Nolasco filed the present petition, arguing that the CA erred in declaring his appeal abandoned despite the excusable circumstances surrounding its belated filing and asserting that his appeal is meritorious, questioning the RTC's jurisdiction and Purence's proof of possession.",The petition is partly meritorious.,"Pursuant to Section 1 (e), Rule 50 of the Rules of Court, the CA has the discretionary authority to dismiss an appeal for non-filing of an appellant's brief. The use of the permissive 'may' in the wording of the above-stated provision meant that the dismissal of the appeal by the CA is directory and not mandatory. The appellate court has the power to allow the appeal notwithstanding the delay in the filing of the appellant's brief, especially where the application of the rule will result in outright deprivation of property or where the interests of justice so require. The second and third exceptions obtain in this case. Nolasco was the possessor of the properties in question. With his appeal before the CA considered abandoned due to his failure to timely file an appellant's brief, he is set to lose his home on a mere technicality. The issue of whether Roberto, Nolasco's predecessor, had fully paid the property to Purence is crucial to the just determination of the case. Nolasco was not able to present his defense of payment and ownership in the RTC because he was declared in default, and in the CA because his appeal was dismissed. Time and again, We rule that technical rules must not suppress substantial justice. We deem it appropriate to reinstate the appeal of Nolasco and afford him the fullest opportunity to establish the merits of his appeal, rather than to deprive him of his properties outright.","WHEREFORE , the petition is PARTLY GRANTED . The Resolutions dated August 30, 2019 and June 10, 2020 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 112755 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Petitioner's appeal is REINSTATED.

"G.R. No. 247868, October 12, 2022","LAND BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES, PETITIONER, VS. ARTURO L. RAMOS, JOSEPHINE R. CO, MARGARITA R. TERRENAL, ROSALINDA R. SAN MIGUEL, EVANGELINE R. ALARTE, HERMINIA L. RAMOS, AND PILAR L. RAMOS, RESPONDENTS.","Subject of the present controversy is a 500-square-meter parcel of land situated in the Barrio of Parada, Municipality of Valenzuela, Province of Bulacan (now Valenzuela City, Metro Manila) covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-194323[5] (subject property) in the name of the late Juan C. Ramos (Juan) and his spouse, Pilar L. Ramos (Pilar). In a Deed of Real Estate Mortgage[6] (REM) dated January 11, 1999, it appears that Juan and Pilar mortgaged the property, through Parada Consumer and Credit Cooperative, Inc. (PCCCI) as their purported attorney-in-fact, to secure PCCCI's loan obligations with petitioner Land Bank of the Philippines.[7] Questioning the due execution of the REM, Pilar and her children with Juan: Arturo L. Ramos, Josephine R. Co, Magarita R. Terrenal, Rosalinda R. San Miguel, Evangeline R. Alarte, and Herminia L. Ramos (collectively, respondents), filed a Complaint[8] for annulment of real estate mortgage and damages against petitioner and PCCCI. Respondents alleged that sometime in 1998, respondent Pilar was granted by PCCCI a loan in the amount of P200,000.00. They averred that PCCCI Manager Lilia Ching (Lilia) and General Manager Roberto Salazar (Roberto) induced respondent Pilar to sign several documents and to surrender the owner's copy of the title of the subject property as collateral for her loan. On January 22, 1999, respondent Pilar received the proceeds of her loan.[9] According to respondents, when Pilar demanded the return of her title following the full payment of her loan on November 12, 2001, PCCCI informed her that it could not release her title because the subject property was mortgaged in favor of petitioner. Upon their own investigation, respondents found out that one of the documents respondent Pilar previously signed was a Special Power of Attorney (SPA) dated December 5, 1998 that purportedly authorized PCCCI to lease, mortgage, sell, or otherwise dispose of the subject property. Notably, the SPA also contained the purported signature of Juan, who died in November 10, 1985.[10] Respondents alleged that PCCCI was able to mortgage the subject property to petitioner through the questioned REM using the SPA.[11] For its part, petitioner admitted that PCCCI executed the assailed REM covering the subject property to secure its (PCCCI) loan obligations to petitioner.[12] Petitioner averred the following: Before accepting the subject property as collateral for PCCCI's obligations, it referred the matter to its then LBP Central and Credit Liability Department (now known as LBP Credit Investigation and Appraisal Department) to appraise and inspect the subject property. After appraisal and inspection, it accepted the subject property as collateral for PCCCI's obligations, relying on the questioned SPA.[13] The REM dated January 11, 1999 was executed and signed by PCCCI officers Lilia and Roberto, together with respondent Pilar, to the exclusion of Juan. According to petitioner, the SPA and REM were presented to the Registry of Deeds and were annotated on the title of the subject property.[14] When PCCCI failed to settle its obligations, it requested petitioner to restructure its loan for at least two times, resulting in the execution of a Restructuring Agreement[15] dated December 19, 2000, as well as a second Restructuring Agreement[16] and a Comprehensive Surety Agreement,[17] both dated February 28, 2001. Notwithstanding the loan restructuring agreements, PCCCI still failed to pay its obligations to petitioner.[18] Meanwhile, the RTC declared PCCCI in default upon its failure to file an answer to the complaint.[19]","In the assailed Decision,[28] the CA denied petitioner's appeal and affirmed the RTC Decision with modification, further directing PCCCI and petitioner to pay respondents exemplary damages in the amount of P50,000.00.[29] The CA found no reason to depart from the RTC's findings that petitioner is a mortgagee in bad faith for its representative's failure: (1) to ask searching questions when he conducted an ocular inspection at the subject property, particularly regarding the whereabouts of Juan and respondent Pilar Ramos, the owners of the other houses and the identity of the person he interviewed;[30] (2) to verify the authenticity of the SPA, having simply relied on the representation of PCCCI that it had the authority to deal with the subject property;[31] and (3) to require Juan to sign the REM simply because respondent Pilar already signed it, even though both their names appeared on the REM.[32] As regards the award of damages, the CA modified the RTC's Decision and expressly awarded exemplary damages in favor of respondents. It noted that the RTC actually intended to award exemplary damages and only failed to include such award in its dispositive portion.[33] The CA further declared that petitioner was remiss in its obligation to properly inspect and verify the subject property causing injury to respondents which justifies the award of exemplary damages.[34]","The petition is unmeritorious. The general rule is that the issue of whether a mortgagee is in good faith cannot be entertained in a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court because the ascertainment of good faith or the lack thereof and the determination of negligence are factual issues which lie outside its scope. . . . At any rate, the Court finds that petitioner is not a mortgagee in good faith for its failure to exercise the diligence expected of it as a banking institution. . . . When the purchaser or the mortgagee is a bank, the rule on innocent purchasers or mortgagees for value is applied more strictly. . . . In the instant case, the authenticity of the SPA[52] upon which petitioner heavily relies on the supposed authority of PCCCI to deal in the subject property is on its face already questionable. As aptly observed by the RTC, the SPA clearly shows that there is only one community tax certificate presented before the notary public when there should have been two certificates, given that it was supposedly signed and acknowledged by both Juan and respondent Pilar. . . . Petitioner also admitted that upon being informed that respondent Pilar owns the subject property, it no longer bothered to look for her husband, Juan. Petitioner's lack of the required diligence is further highlighted by its admission that it no longer required Juan to appear and sign the REM simply because it found the signature of respondent Pilar alone to be already sufficient, notwithstanding that both the names of Juan and respondent Pilar are clearly indicated on the REM as 'MORTGAGOR.'[55] Had petitioner simply taken the extra step of looking into the whereabouts of Juan, it would have discovered that Juan could not have possibly signed the questioned SPA. The foregoing circumstances are evident signs that petitioner is not a mortgagee in good faith. . . . The foregoing considered, by reason of petitioner's bad faith, the Court is led to affirm the award of moral damages, exemplary damages, and attorney's fees in favor of respondents.","WHEREFORE, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED.

CONTRARY TO LAW. Criminal Case No. 20216 (For violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165) That on or about October 23, 2019, in Balanga City, Bataan, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the accused, not being authorized by law, did then and there willfully sell, distribute and give away to another one (1) heat-sealed transparent sachet containing methamphetamine hydrochloride commonly known as ""shabu"", a dangerous drug, weighing ZERO POINT ZERO SIX SIX (0.066) GRAM. CONTRARY TO LAW. Upon arraignment, respondent pleaded ""not guilty"" to the charges. Trial ensued. During the hearing on November 15, 2019, respondent moved in open court that he be allowed to plead guilty to a lesser offense in Criminal Case No. 20216, i.e. , from violation of Section 5 (illegal sale) to Section 12 (illegal possession of drug paraphernalia), Article II of RA 9165. The prosecution objected to respondent's motion on the ground that the proposed plea does not fall within the conditions set forth in Department of Justice (DOJ) Circular No. 027.","In an Order dated November 15, 2019, the RTC granted respondent's motion to plea to a lesser offense in Criminal Case No. 20216 and convicted him of violation of Section 12, Article II of RA 9165, sentencing him to imprisonment and fine, but specifically declaring: ""Make it of record that accused is ineligible to apply for probation in this case."" Respondent filed a motion for reconsideration of the declaration of ineligibility for probation, which the RTC denied in its Order dated November 26, 2019. Undaunted, respondent filed a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court before the CA. In the assailed Decision dated June 28, 2021, the CA granted respondent's petition and annulled the RTC Order dated November 26, 2019. It deleted the portion of the RTC Order that disqualified respondent to apply for probation, thus: ACCORDINGLY , the instant petition is GRANTED . The Order dated November 26, 2019 of the Regional Trial Court of Balanga City, Bataan, Branch 1 in Criminal Case No. 20215 (sic) is ANNULLED and SET ASIDE . On the other hand, the Order dated November 15, 2019 is hereby MODIFIED , in that the sentence: ""Make it of record that accused is ineligible to apply for probation in this case"" is DELETED . Petitioner Darwin C. Reyes is hereby given a period of fifteen (15) days from notice of this Decision within which to file his application for probation before the court a quo.","The Court denied the petition. Petitioner maintained that respondent's conviction of the lesser offense under Section 12, Article II of RA 9165 is void because the plea bargain is not in accordance with the conditions stated in DOJ Circular No. 027, thus making the CA ruling erroneous. The Court rejected this argument, finding that the CA correctly declared respondent eligible to apply for probation after having been convicted of the lesser offense of illegal possession of drug paraphernalia, notwithstanding the fact that he was originally charged with illegal sale of dangerous drugs. Citing Pascua v. People, the Court reiterated that what is essential for applying for probation is the offense to which the accused is ultimately found guilty of, not the offense charged in the Information. Since respondent was convicted of violation of Section 12, Article II of RA 9165, his case was removed from the prohibition in Section 24, Article II of RA 9165 (which prohibits probation for drug trafficking or pushing under Section 5). The Court also noted that the illegal sale quantity (0.066 gram of shabu) fell within the acceptable plea bargaining framework under A.M. No. 18-03-16-SC and the subsequent DOJ Circular No. 018. Regarding the procedural defect that respondent's offer for plea bargaining was made through an oral motion instead of a formal written motion, the Court applied liberality pro hac vice, noting that the prosecutor waived the objection by failing to timely raise the formal defect and only objecting based on DOJ Circular No. 027's provisions on allowable pleas.","WHEREFORE , the petition is DENIED . The Decision dated June 28, 2021 and the Resolution dated March 10, 2022 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 164335 are AFFIRMED in toto .

"G.R. No. 250830, October 12, 2022","MUNICIPALITY OF TIWI, PROVINCE OF ALBAY, PETITIONER, VS. ANTONIO B. BETITO, RESPONDENT.","This case stemmed from respondent's Complaint for Sum of Money against Tiwi. Respondent sought the enforcement of the Contract of Legal Services (the Contract) entered into by him, Atty. Alberto Lawenko (Atty. Lawenko), and Tiwi. The Contract provided, among others, that respondent and Atty. Lawenko would receive a 10% contingent fee on whatever amount of realty taxes that would be recovered by Tiwi through the efforts of respondent and Atty. Lawenko. The dispute arose because Tiwi refused to remit Tiwi's share in the payments made by NPC. In the Complaint, respondent claimed he was entitled to 10% of the recovered amount. Tiwi denied that Mayor Corral was authorized to enter into the Contract providing for a 10% contingent fee, arguing the fee was unreasonable and the recovery was due to the OP opinion, not respondent's efforts. The RTC rendered a Partial Judgment ordering Tiwi to pay P14,657,966.18 (10% of P146,579,661.84). The Supreme Court, in the 2010 Tiwi Case (G.R. No. 171873, July 9, 2010), reversed the CA and RTC, ruling that the compensable services were limited to those contributing to the recovery of Tiwi's share in the realty taxes, and remanded the case for further proceedings to determine the reasonable amount of attorney's fees. Post-remand, the RTC (December 27, 2013) again ordered Tiwi to pay 10% as contingency fee. The CA affirmed the RTC Decision but deleted the legal interest imposed by the RTC Order dated June 5, 2014, and paradoxically ordered the case REMANDED to the Regional Trial Court for the determination of the reasonable amount of attorney's fees to which appellee is entitled, in accordance with the guidelines set forth in the Decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Municipality of Tiwi, represented by Hon. Mayor Jaime C. Villanueva, et al. vs. Antonio Betito, G.R. No. 171873, July 9, 2010. Hence, the instant petition by Tiwi.","WHEREFORE, in light of all the foregoing, the appeal is DENIED for lack of merit. The Decision dated December 27, 2013 and Order June 5, 2014 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 96, in Civil Case No. Q-99-39370 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION in that the legal interest rate imposed on the total monetary award in favor of appellee is hereby DELETED. Let this case be REMANDED to the Regional Trial Court for the determination of the reasonable amount of attorney's fees to which appellee is entitled, in accordance with the guidelines set forth in the Decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Municipality of Tiwi, represented by Hon. Mayor Jaime C. Villanueva, et al. vs. Antonio Betito, G.R. No. 171873, July 9, 2010. Appellee's ""Urgent Motion to Implement Writ of Execution Pending Appeal with Prayer to Resume Proceedings"" is now deemed MOOT and ACADEMIC. SO ORDERED.","After a careful study of the assailed Decision, the Court finds that there is yet an undetermined amount constituting respondent's reasonable attorney's fee. In other words, when the case was remanded to the RTC for further proceedings to determine the reasonable amount of attorney's fees in favor of respondent, following the guidelines set forth in the 2010 Tiwi Case, there is yet no amount that has been sufficiently established by the RTC. On appeal to the CA, the CA erroneously affirmed the RTC Decision in ruling that the 10% contingent fee is conscionable or reasonable considering that respondent rendered legal services for Tiwi. However, the CA ordered that the case be remanded again to the RTC for the determination of the reasonable amount of attorney's fees. The Court disagrees. For the complete resolution of this case and for the guidance of the RTC, it is necessary to revisit the guidelines set forth by the Court in the 2010 Tiwi Case. The Court in the 2010 Tiwi Case ruled that the provisions of paragraph 4 of the Contract, which is the basis of respondent's attorney's fees, should be limited to the services which respondent Betito rendered that reasonably contributed to the recovery of Tiwi's share in the subject realty taxes. ... It is therefore erroneous for the CA to affirm the RTC Decision in ruling that the 10% contingent fee stipulated in the Contract is conscionable or reasonable without discussing further the nature, extent of legal work, and the significance of the cases allegedly handled by respondent that reasonably contributed, directly or indirectly, to the recovery of Tiwi's share, and the relative benefit actually derived by Tiwi from respondent's legal services. Verily, the RTC failed to observe the Court's guidelines laid down in the 2010 Tiwi Case.","WHEREFORE, the Petition for Review is GRANTED. Accordingly, the Decision dated March 1, 2019 and Resolution dated November 4, 2019 of the Court of Appeals, Special Former 7th Division, in CA-G.R. CV No. 104098 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. This case is REMANDED to the RTC for further proceedings to determine the reasonable amount of attorney's fees which respondent is entitled to in accordance with the guidelines set in the 2010 Tiwi Case.

"G.R. No. 256611, October 12, 2022","XXX256611, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","Under Information dated October 31, 2014, XXX256611 was charged with violation of Section 5(i) of RA 9262, viz.: That on or about the year 2009 and continuously up to the present, in Quezon City, Philippines, the above-named accused, did then and there willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously cause psychological and emotional anguish upon the person of one [AAA256611], his common law wife, with whom he has two children by then and there depriving her and their children financial support, thereby causing complainant emotional and psychological anguish, which acts debase, demean[,] and degrade her dignity and human right as a woman, to the damage and prejudice of the said offended party. AAA256611 testified that XXX256611 was her live-in partner from 1999 to 2002. They had two (2) children namely BBB256611 and CCC256611. She testified that ever since her children started going to school (2005 and 2009), XXX256611 failed to give them financial support, which made her 'felt mad.' An August 28, 2008 agreement for a monthly allowance of P1,000.00 was not consistently complied with, and in 2010, he totally stopped giving any financial support. In 2014, XXX256611 received a lump-sum of P761,206.68 as retirement benefits and P953,685.99 as commutation of his leave credits, and had been receiving a monthly pension of P21,144.63, but did not give them 'even a single centavo.' In his defense, XXX256611 claimed he was financially supporting the children until 2012. On August 3, 2012, a truck hit him, causing him to lose one leg and rendering his left hand non-functional. He incurred P1,400,000.00 in medical expenses. He used his retirement and leave credits (totaling over P1.7 million) to pay off loans (P700,000.00) and debts (P300,000.00 mortgage). He stated his P21,000.00 monthly pension is used for his maintenance, food, and travel expenses from Mindanao to Manila for hearings, and that he was diagnosed with stage three (3) prostate cancer in 2017. The RTC found XXX256611 guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 5(i) of RA 9262 and sentenced him to an indeterminate penalty of Two (2) years, Four (4) months and One (1) day of prision correccional as minimum, to Six (6) years and One (1) day of prision mayor as maximum and to pay a fine or One Hundred Thousand Pesos (P100,000.00). On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed with modification, finding XXX256611 guilty of violation of Section 5(e)(2) of RA 9262 (deprivation or denial of support without the element of psychological violence), sentencing him to six (6) months of arresto mayor, as minimum, to four (4) years and two (2) months of prision correccional, as maximum and ordered to pay a P300,000.00 fine.","We acquit. The Decision dated June 8, 2020 and Resolution dated February 23, 2021 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 41696 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE.","The Court applied the recent ruling in Acharon v. People, which decreed that mere denial of financial support is not enough for a prosecution of violation of Section 5(e) of RA 9262, abandoning previous rulings in Melgar v. People and Reyes v. People. Acharon emphasized that for Section 5(e), the willful deprivation of financial support (actus reus) must be done with the intention to control or restrict the woman's or her children's conduct (mens rea). For Section 5(i), the willful denial must be for the purpose of inflicting mental or emotional anguish. The Court found that XXX256611 did not deliberately choose not to give support to his children, but rather, his failure was due to the serious accident he figured in that has totally hindered his capacity to do so, leading to amputation, significant debt (P1.4 million in medical expenses), and subsequent cancer diagnosis. His use of retirement benefits to pay off loans was unrefuted. Thus, XXX256611 is cleared of any malicious intent, negating the element of willfulness required under Section 5(e)(2) and Section 5(i). Furthermore, the prosecution failed to prove the requisite mens rea under Section 5(e) (intent to control) or Section 5(i) (intent to inflict mental or emotional anguish). AAA256611's allegation that she 'felt mad' was insufficient, and the purported letter from the children was unauthenticated and inadmissible.",ACQUITTED in Criminal Case No. R-QZN-15-03541-CR.

OCP-San Pablo City found probable cause and recommended filing seven Informations for estafa against private respondents. Private respondents appealed to the Office of the Regional Prosecutor (ORP) for Region IV, which reversed the indictment, finding private respondents were in good faith and lacked clear evidence of fraud. Petitioners filed a Joint Petition for Certiorari before the Court of Appeals (CA). The CA dismissed the Joint Petitions outright in its Resolution dated November 20, 2020 due to multiple procedural deficiencies (including failure to pay docket fees, missing verification/certification against forum-shopping, and failure to indicate actual addresses). Petitioners filed a Joint Motion for Reconsideration. The CA denied the motion, affirming the dismissal, and additionally noted that the petition was substantially flawed because petitioners failed to exhaust the administrative remedy of appealing to the Secretary of Justice (SOJ).","The instant Petition is DENIED.

However, the Court found that the CA committed grave error when it ruled that petitioners failed to exhaust administrative remedies. Citing DOJ Department Circular No. 70-A and R.A. No. 10951 (which revised the penalties for Estafa, placing this specific case within the jurisdiction of first-level trial courts), the Court held that the resolution of the Office of the Regional Prosecutor (ORP) in this matter was promulgated with finality and was no longer appealable to the Secretary of Justice. Thus, petitioners were correct in resorting to the CA via certiorari. Nonetheless, despite the CA's error on the exhaustion doctrine, the dismissal of the petition must be sustained due to the incurable procedural and jurisdictional defects noted in the CA’s first resolution.",The instant Petition is DENIED.

Among those accused were Chingkoe (corporate secretary of Filstar) and Andutan (deputy executive director). Andutan allegedly gave unwarranted benefit or preference to Filstar, Petron, and Shell. Chingkoe allegedly used and submitted spurious and falsified documents. On February 23, 2009, the Office of the Ombudsman found probable cause, and Informations were filed on March 26, 2009.

"G.R. No. 235033, October 12, 2022","KRISTINE CALUBAQUIB-DIAZ, PETITIONER, VS. DINO LOPEZ DIAZ AND REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENTS.","Kristine claimed that she and Dino became lovers when they met in 2009. Soon, the two began living together at Dino's Angono, Rizal residence, with Kristine shouldering most of the household expenses and even paying for the house amortizations of Dino's relatives. [7] When Kristine discovered that she was pregnant with their son, she did not immediately inform Dino as he was having an affair. However, when she finally told him of the pregnancy through text, Dino did not immediately respond. He only showed up after a month. [8] During Kristine's pregnancy, Dino continued having affairs with different women. Each time Kristine found out about the affairs, Dino would beg for her forgiveness and promise to change his ways. [9] Kristine and Dino eventually got married on June 28, 2010. Kristine's parents paid for the wedding expenses. On their wedding night, Dino only dropped Kristine off at the condominium, left her alone, and went out with his friends. After their wedding, Kristine and Dino lived with Kristine's parents at Filinvest I, Quezon City. [10] On November 21, 2010, Kristine gave birth to their son, Duke Kaiser Calubaquib-Diaz (Duke). [11] Dino neither brought her to the hospital, nor checked up on her after her caesarian operation. He only arrived after she gave birth and left immediately. [12] Despite getting married, Dino did not exert any effort to find work to support the needs of their family. Instead, he would wake up in the afternoon, go out with his friends, and come home late, intoxicated. He depended on Kristine and even abused the generosity of her parents to support his extravagant lifestyle. [13] Kristine and her parents took care of Duke and spent for Kristine's hospital bills, Duke's baptism, and his other needs. Dino did not help in caring for Duke nor did he spend any quality time with him. As such, Duke had no understanding of the real concept of a father, referring to any man as his ""daddy."" [14] In 2012, Kristine successfully persuaded Dino to finish college and even provided him financial support. However, Dino took this opportunity to ""fuel his arrogance and philandering ways."" [15] He acted as if he was a bachelor, flirting with women and having illicit relations. [16] By July 2012, Kristine told Dino that she wanted to end their relationship since Dino refused to change his ways. Dino pleaded with her and promised to reform, saying, "" wag muna, wala pa akong titirhan ."" [17] In the latter part of October 2012, Dino left their house, allegedly for a vacation. He had yet to return by November 2012, prompting Kristine to text him to go home. He returned in late November 2012 only to get his belongings while Kristine was not home. Dino did not even say goodbye to either Kristine or Duke. [18] After they separated, Dino admitted to Kristine that he only married her for money. Such reasoning explained his lack of sympathy and drive to perform the essential marital obligations. [19] Kristine discovered, through social media, that Dino would continue his extramarital affairs. He even lived with another woman in his father's house at Casa Milan Subdivision in Quezon City. [20] In December 2012, Kristine underwent psychiatric evaluation with Dr. Valentina Del Fonso Garcia (Dr. Garcia) to determine the root cause of their problems. [21] On May 2, 2013, Kristine filed a Petition for Declaration of Nullity of Marriage against Dino due to his psychological incapacity. [22] Summons was issued to Dino but was returned unserved. [23] The Process Server's Report [24] stated that service was attempted on May 24, 2013 and June 10, 2013 at the address indicated in the summons, to no avail. The security guard on duty stated that Dino only visited the address occasionally and that he was residing in Antipolo City. On July 26, 2013, Kristine filed a Motion for Issuance of Alias Summons (with Motion for Leave to Serve Summons by Publication). [26] In an August 8, 2013 Order, [27] the Regional Trial Court granted the motion and issued an Order of Summons by Publication [28] on the same day. The Regional Trial Court rendered its August 12, 2015 Decision [39] declaring the marriage between petitioner KRISTINE B. CALUBAQUIB-DIAZ and respondent DINO LOPEZ DIAZ solemnized on June 28, 2010... NULL AND VOID on the ground of psychological incapacity of the respondent... The Office of the Solicitor General moved for reconsideration, [43] which was denied by the Regional Trial Court in a January 5, 2016 Order. [44] On appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed and set aside the Regional Trial Court's ruling. The dispositive portion of its July 27, 2017 Decision [45] reads: WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the instant appeal is hereby GRANTED. The assailed Decision dated August 12, 2015 and the Order dated January 5, 2016 of the Quezon City Regional Trial Court – Branch 102 in Civil Case No. R-QZN-13-00005-SP for Declaration of Nullity of Marriage are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE for being NULL AND VOID. [46] The Court of Appeals held that the Regional Trial Court did not acquire jurisdiction over Dino, making its judgment null and void. Kristine moved for reconsideration, which was denied by the Court of Appeals in its October 25, 2017 Resolution. [48] Dissatisfied with the ruling, Kristine filed a Petition for Review [49] before this Court.","This Court resolves a Petition for Review on Certiorari [3] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the Decision [4] and Resolution [5] of the Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals reversed and set aside the Decision [6] of the Regional Trial Court, which declared the marriage of Kristine Calubaquib-Diaz (Kristine) and Dino Lopez Diaz (Dino) as null and void. The Supreme Court DENIED the Petition, affirming the Court of Appeals' findings.","It is undisputed that courts may only exercise their powers with binding effect if they acquire jurisdiction over: (a) the cause of action or the subject matter of the case; (b) the thing or the res ; (c) the parties; and (d) the remedy. [70] ... In the absence of service or when the service of summons upon a party is defective, the court acquires no jurisdiction over their person, and a judgment rendered against them is null and void. [78] ... In serving summons, personal service is the preferred mode. [81] ... The Process Server's Report indicates that only two attempts were made to personally serve respondent with summons at the address provided. The security guard with whom the process server spoke revealed that respondent would frequent the house and even divulged the city where respondent resides. These pieces of information were vital details that would have likely led to respondent and to the success of personal service of summons upon him. If the process server had only exercised the duty zealously, then summons would have been personally served upon respondent and his due process rights would be protected in the proceedings. In this light, it cannot be concluded that personal service was impossible or could not be made within a reasonable time. Even assuming that the attempts made to personally serve summons upon respondent met the necessary threshold, petitioner's immediate resort to service of summons through publication instead of substituted summons violates the diligence requirement. [100] Petitioner did not explain why substituted service was not attempted. The Process Server's Report is bereft of any statement regarding whether substituted service was availed of or any explanation as to why such mode would be infeasible. [101] ... As such, the process server cannot be said to have exerted diligent efforts to locate respondent and that personal service of summons, including substituted service, was impossible. Petitioner's immediate resort to service by publication, therefore, cannot be upheld. As the service of summons by publication upon respondent deviated from the rigid requirements imposed by the Court, the Regional Trial Court failed to acquire jurisdiction over his person and failed to protect his due process rights. Therefore, the resultant proceedings and the decision rendered therein are null and void and cannot be binding upon him. Having established that the Regional Trial Court failed to acquire jurisdiction over the person of respondent, it must be determined if such issue is subject to estoppel, as claimed by petitioner. Jurisprudence is consistent that objections to a court's jurisdiction over the person of the respondent must be raised at the earliest possible opportunity; otherwise, objections to the court's jurisdiction over the person are deemed waived. [103] Even at this stage in the proceedings and despite the lapse of nine years since the filing of the petition, respondent has neither been notified nor heard. Viewed in light of the failure to properly serve summons upon him, it can be concluded that he is still unaware of the proceedings undertaken to annul his marriage with petitioner. Evidently, such ""earliest possible opportunity"" has yet to occur. As estoppel can only set in due to respondent's inaction despite the opportunity, which is absent in this case, the failure of the Office of the Solicitor General to raise the court's lack of jurisdiction is irrelevant.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DENIED, there being no reversible error in the assailed Decision. The July 27, 2017 Decision and the October 25, 2017 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 106329 are AFFIRMED. The August 12, 2015 Decision and January 5, 2016 Order of the Regional Trial Court in Civil Case No. R-QZN-13-00005-SP declaring the marriage of petitioner Kristine Calubaquib-Diaz and respondent Dino Lopez Diaz null and void are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE due to trial court's lack of jurisdiction over respondent Dino Lopez Diaz.

"G.R. No. 255802, October 12, 2022","ONE SHIPPING CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. HEIRS OF THE LATE RICARDO R. ABARRIENTOS AS REPRESENTED BY ROMANA R. ABARRIENTOS, RESPONDENTS.","One Shipping Corporation (petitioner) is a domestic corporation engaged in the business of crewing and recruitment of Filipino seafarers. On August 24, 2013, petitioner hired Ricardo R. Abarrientos (Ricardo) as Chief Officer aboard M/V ""Dyna Crane"" for a period of nine (9) months, but was repatriated earlier on February 20, 2014. Accordingly, Ricardo received his corresponding final salary and benefits as evidenced by an Affidavit of Receipt, Release, Waiver, and Quitclaim that Ricardo executed on April 14, 2014. Six (6) months after his arrival or on August 19, 2014, Ricardo was hospitalized in his hometown in Cagayan de Oro. He was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, which eventually metastasized to his liver and lungs. On September 3, 2014, he succumbed to death due to liver cirrhosis. On March 2, 2018, respondents initiated a complaint against petitioner, claiming entitlement to death benefits under the IBF JSU/AMOSUP – IMMAJ Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). Respondents claimed that Ricardo's death was work-related considering that he was declared fit to work before embarkation, and was thereafter exposed to the harsh conditions and perils of the sea at work. Respondents cited ""severe stress of being away from his family"" and the ""long hours of duties"" as factors that caused Ricardo's illness, which eventually led to his death. To support their claim, respondents narrated an incident in December 2013, wherein Ricardo complained of dizziness and an upset stomach as he manned the vessel in the middle of an inclement weather and the rough seas for two days without rest. He requested the Master for a medical check-up at the nearest port, but was denied and merely advised to take pain relievers. The excruciating pain in his stomach allegedly recurred on February 10, 2014, but he was allowed to disembark only on February 18, 2014. Upon Ricardo's arrival, respondents alleged that petitioner refused to refer him to the company-designated physician for a post-employment medical examination because his principal has not yet approved his medical treatment. Respondents averred that Ricardo was forced to seek treatment from his personal doctor in Cagayan de Oro to relieve him of the intolerable pain that caused his repatriation. Respondents further alleged that they claimed death benefits from petitioner two months after Ricardo's death, but to no avail. The demand was purportedly repeated through a letter sent to petitioner on February 25, 2015, which remained unanswered. On September 3, 2015, respondents allegedly demanded payment of benefits from petitioner again, but was rejected. Grievance proceedings were then lodged before the Associated Marine Officers and Seamen's Union of the Philippines (AMOSUP) on January 25, 2018. As no settlement was reached, respondents finally filed this complaint before the Panel of Voluntary Arbitrators (Panel). For its part, petitioner vehemently denied that Ricardo was medically repatriated. They asseverated that Ricardo's repatriation was due to the valid pre-termination of the contract when his principal sold the vessel as noted in Ricardo's service record. Petitioner emphasized that Ricardo finished the contract without record of any medical issue on-board the vessel. In fact, according to petitioner, Ricardo did not submit himself to post-medical examination upon his arrival. Rather, two months after his arrival or on April 14, 2014, Ricardo reported to petitioner to receive his final salary and benefits as evidenced by an Affidavit of Receipt, Release, Waiver, and Quitclaim. In view of these circumstances, petitioner claimed to be taken aback when, four (4) years after Ricardo's repatriation, they received a Letter from AMOSUP dated February 22, 2018, asking it to address respondents' grievance complaint. Petitioner argued that it has no liability for the claimed death benefits because: (1) Ricardo's death neither occurred during his employment, nor was it work-related; (2) he did not submit himself to the mandatory post-employment examination; and (3) in any case, the claim had already prescribed, it being filed more than three years after Ricardo's death.","With a 2-1 vote in a Decision dated June 21, 2019, the Panel granted respondents' claim as follows: WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered ORDERING [petitioner] to, jointly and severally, pay [respondents] US DOLLAR NINETY FIVE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FORTY NINE (US$95,949.00) as his full death benefit compensation, burial expenses of US DOLLAR ONE THOUSAND FIFTY SIX (US$1,056.00), US DOLLAR FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY (US$5,570.00) representing Minor Child's Benefit, all based from 2014 CBA and attorney's fees equivalent to ten percent (10%) of the total monetary award or in their Philippine peso equivalent in the prevailing exchange rate on the actual date of payment. SO ORDERED. (Emphases in the original) . . . In its assailed Decision dated October 30, 2020, the CA simply affirmed the Panel's ruling in its entirety.","The Supreme Court found that the conclusions of the Panel and the CA were grounded on mere surmises and not supported by the evidence on record. First, the respondents' claim was barred by prescription. The cause of action accrued upon Ricardo’s death on September 3, 2014. Since the complaint was filed only on March 2, 2018, it was beyond the three-year prescriptive period, and respondents failed to prove any written extrajudicial demands that would interrupt the running of prescription. Second, Ricardo’s death was not compensable under the CBA and the POEA-SEC. His death occurred 195 days post-repatriation, exceeding the 130-day coverage provided by the CBA for sickness-related repatriation, and there was no evidence that Ricardo was medically repatriated or sought treatment within 130 days. Furthermore, respondents failed to discharge the burden of proving by substantial evidence that Ricardo’s illness (pancreatic cancer/liver cirrhosis) was work-related or aggravated by his working conditions, having relied merely on unsubstantiated assertions of stress and general perils of the sea.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is GRANTED. The Decision dated October 30, 2020 and Resolution dated February 5, 2021 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 161918 are REVERSED. The claim for Ricardo Abarrientos' death benefits is DISMISSED for lack of merit. But the amount of One Hundred Thousand Pesos (P100,000.00) is AWARDED to respondents Heirs of Ricardo Abarrientos as financial assistance. SO ORDERED."

Complainants are relatives of the journalists ambushed while on their way to cover the filing of the certificate of candidacy for governor of Maguindanao of then Buluan Vice Mayor Esmael Mangudadatu in 2009. [10] Cayton was then the Commanding General of the 6th Infantry Division that has jurisdiction over Maguindanao and the 601st Infantry Brigade, where Geslani was the brigade commander. [11] In their Joint-Complaint Affidavit, complainants alleged that Vice Mayor Mangudadatu requested security escorts from Geslani, who declined, citing the matter was a police concern and troop shortage. Cayton allegedly assured journalists accompanying the convoy (relatives of complainants) of safe travel due to purported security deployment. The convoy was intercepted on November 23, 2009, resulting in 57 deaths (Maguindanao massacre). Complainants alleged that Cayton and Geslani violated RA 3019, Section 3(e) and (f), and RA 6713 by causing undue injury and neglecting duty through evident bad faith and gross inexcusable negligence for failing to provide security.

Cayton and Geslani denied the accusations. Cayton claimed he advised referral to the Philippine National Police (PNP) because the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) is barred from providing security to election candidates under prevailing operational guidelines (MOA between DND and COMELEC). He also cited serious personnel shortage. Geslani reiterated these points, adding that the security detail previously provided to Mayor Andal Ampatuan, Jr. (the alleged perpetrator) was for Internal Security Operations (ISO) against threat groups and was not election-related, thus justifying the differentiation. He also noted that the detail to Ampatuan was authorized by a prior commanding officer, Colonel Godofredo B. Labitan, before he and Cayton assumed their posts, and that the Mangudadatu request was informal and election-related.

The Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for the Military and Other Law Enforcement Offices issued a Joint Resolution [65] recommending the dismissal of the criminal and administrative complaints against Cayton and Geslani. [66] It found that complainants failed to prove manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable neglect (Section 3(e) of RA 3019), and that Cayton and Geslani had legal basis for their inability to grant the request. The Office of the Deputy Ombudsman denied the Motion for Reconsideration, stating that the certification regarding Ampatuan's security detail confirmed respondents had no intention to discriminate, as the assignment predated their tenure, and the security provision to Ampatuans was justified as non-politically motivated ISO work.",The Office of the Ombudsman did not gravely abuse its discretion in not finding probable cause to charge private respondents for violation of Section 3(e) and (f) of Republic Act No. 3019.,"This Court generally does not interfere with the Office of the Ombudsman's determination of probable cause unless there is a clear showing of grave abuse of discretion, defined as a capricious or whimsical exercise of judgment amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. Petitioners failed to discharge the burden of proving the presence of grave abuse of discretion.

Regarding Section 3(e) of RA 3019, the Court upheld the Ombudsman's finding that the element of manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable neglect was wanting. The refusal to provide security escorts was based on the legal prohibition contained in the Memorandum of Agreement between the Department of National Defense (DND) and the Commission on Elections (COMELEC), which bars the AFP from providing security detail to election candidates.

Regarding the claim of manifest partiality based on the security detail provided to Mayor Ampatuan, Jr., the Court noted that the detail was already in existence before respondents Cayton and Geslani assumed command, and was intended for Internal Security Operation (ISO) against lawless elements, not for political considerations. Thus, the military officers had sufficient legal justification for referring Vice Mayor Mangudadatu's election-related request to the PNP, thereby negating manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable neglect.

As to Section 3(f) of RA 3019 (Neglecting or refusing to act without sufficient justification for the purpose of discrimination), the petitioners merely raised similar arguments relative to Section 3(e), and failed to prima facie show that the elements of Section 3(f) exist.

Finding no grave abuse of discretion, the Supreme Court deferred to the Ombudsman's findings.","ACCORDINGLY, this Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition is DISMISSED. The Office of the Ombudsman's June 22, 2011 Joint Resolution and October 4, 2012 Joint Order in relation to OMB-P-C-10-0249-B are AFFIRMED. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 224945, October 11, 2022","GIRLIE J. LINGAD, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","Lingad was employed in the Olongapo City Branch of United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB) from January 1, 1994 until April 19, 2004. Before she left UCPB, she was a marketing associate and branch marketing officer trainee. She handled the opening, terminating, and withdrawing of client accounts and placements. Her position gave her access to the bank's computer system, with User ID ""oloma01"" and Teller ID No. 2840. On April 19, 2004, Lingad went on absence without official leave. Later, UCPB requested the Anti-Money Laundering Council to conduct a fact-finding investigation on her transactions. The Council discovered that Lingad had processed four anomalous transactions and left for the United States on April 20, 2004 with her children. The anomalous transactions consisted of unauthorized withdrawals and preterminations of money market placements with the money transferred to accounts in the names of MV2 Telecoms and Lingad's brother. On October 5, 2006, an Information was filed against Lingad charging her with a violation of Section 4(a) of Republic Act No. 9160, or the Anti-Money Laundering Act, alleging she transacted Php83,335,628.97, knowing it involved proceeds of qualified theft and violation of Section 33(a) of R.A. 8792. Lingad was extradited from the United States and pleaded not guilty. The prosecution detailed four major anomalous transactions processed by Lingad using her IDs, involving unauthorized preterminations of client placements (Chieng and Tanjuakio) and using those funds to cover or fund other placements or manager's checks, resulting in substantial damage to UCPB (P83,698,208.81 total unfunded transactions). In her defense, Lingad denied processing the transactions or could not recall them. She claimed all transactions were supervised and approved by bank officers, her functions were limited, and her User/Teller IDs could have been used by others. She also pointed out that her flight to the US was due to migration plans and retirement, and not an evasion of investigation.","In an August 8, 2013 Decision, the Regional Trial Court found Lingad guilty of violating Section 4(a) of R.A. 9160, otherwise known as the Anti-Money Laundering [Act], as amended by R.A. 9194, by committing qualified theft and transacting some of its proceeds to make them appear to have come from legitimate sources. The trial court found overwhelming evidence that Lingad processed all the anomalous transactions, noted that her denials were self-serving, and her unjustified flight to the United States without proper clearance or turnover of documents was deemed a strong indication of guilt. In its December 11, 2015 Decision, the Court of Appeals affirmed the Regional Trial Court's Decision. It likewise denied Lingad's Motion for Reconsideration in a June 2, 2016 Resolution.","The Court affirmed the conviction. It ruled that money laundering is committed when the proceeds of an unlawful activity expressly listed under the Anti-Money Laundering Act are transacted, transferred, or moved, and are made to appear as though they originated from legitimate sources. The predicate offense in this case was qualified theft. Lingad committed qualified theft with grave abuse of confidence by taking advantage of her position to withdraw money and preterminate accounts without authority. She then committed money laundering when she transacted the proceeds of the qualified theft through manager's checks or transferred them to other money market placements to give the appearance that the money markets were still subsisting.

The Court clarified that while the prosecution for the money laundering offense can proceed independently of the prosecution of the related unlawful activity, it must still be proven beyond reasonable doubt that the money or property constitutes proceeds from an unlawful activity, which entails proving beyond reasonable doubt particular elements of that unlawful activity. The Court found that the prosecution successfully proved the elements of qualified theft (taking with intent to gain by grave abuse of confidence) and that petitioner, knowing the nature of the amounts as proceeds from qualified theft, transacted it to give the appearance that the money markets were still subsisting. Petitioner failed to raise any reversible error against the concurrent findings of the lower courts.","WHEREFORE, the Petition is DENIED. The December 11, 2015 Decision and June 2, 2016 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 36600 are AFFIRMED. Petitioner Girlie J. Lingad is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of violating Section 4(a) of Republic Act No. 9160, or the Anti-Money Laundering Act, as amended by Republic Act No. 9194. She is correctly sentenced to serve an indeterminate penalty of imprisonment of seven (7) years as minimum to thirteen (13) years as maximum, to pay a fine of P34,099,195.85, to suffer all the accessory penalties provided for by law, and to pay the costs. Nonetheless, since petitioner has fully served the maximum penalty of the sentence imposed on her, she is ordered immediately RELEASED from detention, unless she is confined for any other lawful cause."

Aquino III signed into law Republic Act No. 10717,2 or the 2016 GAA. Under this law the amount of P587,497,000.00 was appropriated for the 2016 DLC Project,' under the item of ""Issuance of Driver's License and Permits,"" thus: ... The LTO, through Asec. Galvante, initiated proceedings for the bidding of the contract for the 2016 DLC Project. However, procurement was halted due to the filing of a case, which prevented the LTO from issuing driver's license cards to the public. [4] In the meantime, to address the backlog in the issuance of driver's license cards, the Bids and Awards Committee of the LTO (LTO-BAC) recommended a change in the mode of procurement [5] from Public Bidding to Agency to Agency/Negotiated mode of Procurement, an alternative mode of procurement, for the 2016 DLC Project. Eventually, a contract to procure 3,000,000 pieces of driver's license cards through . Direct Contracting was awarded to AllCard Plastics Philippines, Inc. (AllCard), a private printer who submitted the lowest bid at P62.36 per card. [6] The total price for the contract was P187,080,000.00, [7] which left a balance of P341,713,000.00 from the 2016 DLC Project's allotment under the 2016 GAA. On 11 August 2016, the DOTr submitted its budget proposal through the National Expenditure Program (2017 NEP). It included the project to procure driver's license cards with five year validity (2017 DLC Project) in the amount of P528,793,000.00. On 22 December 2016, President Rodrigo Duterte signed into law Republic Act No-. 10924, [8] or the 2017 GAA. Under this law, the amount of P573,450,000.00 was appropriated-for the 2017 DLC Project. [9] Meanwhile, the LTO-BAC, on 17 November 2016, conducted a Pre­ Procurement Conference for the 2017 DLC Project. Using the balance of P341,713,000.00 from the 2016 GAA and its proposed budget of P528,793,000.00 [10] in the 2017 NEP, the LTO-BAC pegged the Approved Budget for the Contract (ABC) at P836,000,000.00. [11] In its posted Invitation to Bid, the LTO indicated General Fund 101 as the source of funding for this project. [12] On 31 January 2017, the LTO-BAC conducted the opening of bids. Five private printers participated in the bidding: (i) Banner Plasticard, Inc. (""Banner""); (ii) Kolonwel Training and P.T. Pura Barutama Joint Venture (""Kolonwel""); (iii) SMS Global Technologies, Inc. and Supercom, Joint Venture (""SMS Global""); (iv) Dermalog, CFP and Nextix, Inc., Joint Venture (""Dermalog"") and (v) PCCW Solutions Phils., Inc. (""PCCW Solutions""). SMS Global and PCCW Solutions were subsequently disqualified. [13] Out of the three bidders who participated in the post-qualification proceedings, only Dermalog, was allegedly able to comply with the post­ qualification requirements. On 03 April 2017, a Notice of Award was issued in favor of Dermalog, for the total contract price of P829,668,053.55. [14] On 07 April 2017, LTO and Dermalog, signed the Contract of Agreement and Special Conditions of Contract. Thereafter, Asec. Galvante issued a Notice to Proceed. [15] Petitioner assails the implementation of the 2017 DLC Project and claims: The [2017 DLC Project] was publicly bidded out notwithstanding the fact there was an absence of funds legally appropriated for [the] purpose under the General Fund 101 or the [2016 GAA]. Indelibly, there was a clear intent coupled with overt and deliberate acts of unlawful misrepresentation and deception committed against the Philippine government and its people resulting in excess of jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. [16] Likewise, petitioner avers that the LTO-BAC conducted a ""rigged and manipulated"" bidding, which resulted in the award of the contract to Dermalog: During the post qualification, [Banner, and Kolonwel et al.,] the first and second lowest bidders[,] were disqualified on blatantly flimsy and unlawful grow1ds. Thereafter, the [2017 DLC Project] was awarded to [Dermalog] the third lowest bidder[,] by the LTO-BAC on 31 March 2017[.] [T]he contract was consequently entered into on 07 April 2017 by and between [Dermalog] and [Asec. Galvante] in his capacity as Assistant Secretary of the [LTO]. ... The Petitioner assails the application of the appropriation and the implementation of the [LTO-DLC Project 2017] under the General Fund 101 or under the GAA 2016 as causing and partaking of the nature of a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction on the parts of the [public respondents] since it is violative of the provisions of Section 29(1) of Article VI of the Philippine Constitution. [17]",We DISMISS the case for petitioner's failure to show that the LTO committed grave abuse of discretion.,"Section 65 of the 2016 GAA explicitly authorized and prescribed the limits on the use of appropriations in 2016 for 2017. This provision reads: ... Following the clear terms of Section 65 of the 2016 GAA, any unspent balance from this appropriation can be released and obligated ""for the purpose specified, and under the same special provisions applicable thereto,"" for a period extending to one fiscal year after 2016, that is, until the end of 2017. The LTO therefore was acting well within the bounds of law when it supplemented the appropriation for its 2017 DLC Project with the balance of its 2016 appropriation for the same purpose. ... Considering the grant of authority for continuing appropriations under Section 65 of the 2016 GAA, the appropriation of P528,793,000.00 for the 2017 DLC Project, as supplemented by the balance of P341,713,000.00 from the 2016 DLC Project, is more than sufficient to cover the ABC of P836,000,000.00 in the 2017 DLC Project's published Invitation to Bid. ... We do not find the LTO's error so grievous as to constitute grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack, or excess, of jurisdiction. In fact, and anent petitioner's issue with the LTO's failure to indicate the period or year of the General Fund from which the 2017 DLC Project was to be funded, he has not shown, by any evidence on record, that funds for the 2017 DLC Project was actually paid out of the General Fund and not from the appropriation under the 2017 GAA, as supplemented by the balance for the same purpose from the previous year.","the petition is DISMISSED. The use of the Land Transportation Office of the amount appropriated under ""Issuance of driver's license and permits"" in the General Appropriations Act of 2016 to supplement the amount appropriated under ""Issuance of driver's license and permits"" in the General Appropriations Act of 2017 is not unconstitutional."
"G.R. No. 235863, October 10, 2022","VANESSA LAURA ARCILLA, PETITIONER, VS. SAN SEBASTIAN COLLEGE-RECOLETOS, MANILA, RESPONDENT.","Vanessa Laura Arcilla (Arcilla) was appointed by San Sebastian College-Recoletos, Manila (San Sebastian) as a full-time probationary faculty member for the second semester of School Year 2014 to 2015 (November 21, 2014 to March 31, 2015). She was reappointed on April 24, 2015, for the first semester of School Year 2015 to 2016 (June 1, 2015 until October 31, 2015). On October 9, 2015, the college dean told her that she could not be given a teaching load purportedly due to a low turnout of enrollees. In an October 21, 2015 letter, Arcilla was informed that her probationary contract would not be renewed. Arcilla filed a Complaint for illegal dismissal, which the Labor Arbiter dismissed, finding that her employment contract merely expired. The National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) reversed the Labor Arbiter, declaring Arcilla illegally dismissed and ordering San Sebastian to pay backwages and separation pay. San Sebastian filed a Petition for Certiorari before the Court of Appeals (CA), which granted San Sebastian's Petition and reinstated the Labor Arbiter's Decision, finding that Arcilla completed her second semester, or one year of service, when she received the notice of nonrenewal, and there was no illegal dismissal since she was still under probation and the fixed period of her probationary contract had expired. Arcilla filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari before the Supreme Court.","The Court of Appeals granted San Sebastian's Petition for Certiorari and reinstated the Labor Arbiter's Decision, nullifying the Decision and Resolution of the National Labor Relations Commission. The CA found that since Arcilla's employment was probationary, her appointment could be validly terminated upon the expiration of the fixed period of her probationary contract, noting that she was still under probation and had completed only one year of service.","The Supreme Court found that the Court of Appeals erred in finding that the National Labor Relations Commission gravely abused its discretion. Applying the doctrine in Mercado v. AMA Computer College-Parañaque City, Inc., the Court ruled that when a full-time employee's probationary status overlaps with a fixed-term contract not specifically used for the fixed term it offers, the probationary nature of the employment prevails. The employment 'may only be terminated for a just or authorized cause or due to the employee's failure to meet the reasonable standards made known to the employee at the time of the engagement.' Since respondent San Sebastian merely invoked the expiration of the fixed term to terminate petitioner's employment, and there was no allegation or proof that the nonrenewal was due to her failure to meet standards, respondent illegally dismissed petitioner.","The Petition for Review on Certiorari is GRANTED. The Court of Appeals' November 29, 2017 Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 150537 is REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The National Labor Relations Commission's November 15, 2016 Decision is REINSTATED. Petitioner Vanessa Laura Arcilla is entitled to backwages from the time of her illegal dismissal on October 31, 2015 up to October 30, 2017; her three months' salary as her separation pay; and attorney's fees equivalent to 10% of the monetary award. All monetary awards shall be subject to 6% interest per annum from the finality of this Decision until fully paid."

HAY, REPRESENTED BY HIS ATTORNEY-IN-FACT GOMERCINDO* LITONG, RESPONDENT.","The present controversy finds its roots from the Complaint for Quieting of Title filed by Myrna L. Hay against petitioners. Myrna averred that petitioners' father, Pio, sold the disputed parcel of land to Haru Gen Beach Resort and Hotel Corporation on November 12, 1988, which later found its way to her. She also presented another Deed of Absolute Sale, purporting to show that Pio sold the same property to her on May 28, 1997. Petitioners filed an Answer dated August 26, 2016, seeking dismissal on the ground that their father's signature on the deeds of sale was forged. Pre-trial ensued on June 28, 2017, and a Pre-Trial Order was issued on even date. On July 6, 2018, petitioners, through counsel, filed a Motion for Leave and to Admit Attached Amended Answer with Counterclaim for the purpose of clarifying allegations and asserting compulsory counterclaims (nullification of deeds, declaration of ownership, and damages). In an Order dated August 17, 2018, the RTC denied the Motion for Leave because the case had already gone through preliminary and pre-trial conference, contrary to petitioners' claim. Petitioners’ Motion for Reconsideration was subsequently denied. On grounds of grave abuse of discretion, petitioners challenged the denial before the CA through a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65.","In a Decision dated August 7, 2019, the CA found no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the RTC in denying petitioners' Motion for Leave considering that the records show that the case had, indeed, already gone through the preliminary conference/pre-trial stage. Besides, according to the CA, the Amended Answer is not necessary since all the material elements of petitioners' defense, i.e., the deeds of absolute sale that respondent Garry B. Hay, in substitution of Myrna (respondent), invoked were falsified, had already been stated in their original Answer. The CA disposed, thus: WHEREFORE, the Petition is DISMISSED. The Orders dated 17 August 2018 and 3 December 2018 of the Regional Trial Court of Virac, Catanduanes, Branch 43, in Civil Case No. 2471 are hereby AFFIRMED.","The Supreme Court found the petition meritorious. The Court stressed that bona fide amendments to pleadings are allowed at any stage of the proceedings, and motions for leave must be treated with liberality, provided they are not made with intent to delay. The RTC Orders and the CA Decision omitted determining whether the Motion for Leave was interposed only to delay the proceedings. The filing of the Motion for Leave after the issuance of the Pre-Trial Order is not reason enough to deny it. The Court noted that the Amended Answer was warranted as it specifies with particularity which allegations are admitted and denied, and specifies special affirmative defenses and counterclaims (nullification of the deeds and grant of damages), which are crucial for the complete and proper disposition of the case and to prevent multiplicity of suits. The RTC gravely abused its discretion in denying the Motion for Leave solely on the ground that the case had already gone through preliminary/pre-trial conference.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is GRANTED. The Decision dated August 7, 2019 and the Resolution dated November 20, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 159049 are REVERSED. The Regional Trial Court of Virac, Catanduanes, Branch 43, is DIRECTED to admit the Amended Answer and continue with the proceedings with utmost dispatch. SO ORDERED."

It was alleged that petitioner was engaged in the business of selling textiles and other clothing materials while respondents were ready-to-wear garments contractors and hat makers.

However, upon deposit, the checks were dishonored for the reason ""Account Closed.""
[17]
Subsequently, or on July 8, 1997, respondents executed a promissory note
[18]
in favor of petitioner, wherein they asked the latter to give them: (a) until end of July to study the possible terms of payment for their P1,500,000.00 debt; and (b) until December 1997 to pay said obligation.
[19]
However, despite said promises, respondents still failed to settle their obligation. Thereafter, or on April 2, 2001, respondents wrote another promissory note
[20]
in favor of petitioner, stating that: (a) they will pay him the amount or P5,000.00 to P10,000.00 a month until the debt is paid; and (b) in case of default, the latter can hold them liable for estafa. On May 1, 2001, respondents wrote a letter
[21]
reiterating their promises based on the April 2, 2001 promissory note. However, respondents still failed to pay their outstanding obligation or to replace the dishonored checks.
[22]
This prompted petitioner to send a formal demand letter
[23]
dated March 17, 2004 to respondents, which was left unheeded, which then prompted the filing of the instant complaint against respondents, praying that: (a) a writ of preliminary attachment be issued against them for the satisfaction of the P420,000.00 debt from the latter's P1,500,000.00; and (b) upon hearing, a decision be made ordering them to pay petitioner the amount of P420,000.00 with legal interest of six percent (6%) per annum from March 2004 until full payment, and P50,000.00 as attorney's fees and cost of litigation.
[24]
In his complaint, petitioner revealed that the amount of P1,080,000.00 from respondents' P1,500,000.00 obligation was the subject of a separate case for violation of Batas Pambansa Bilang 22
[25]
filed before the Metropolitan Trial Court of Manila, Branch 16 in Criminal Case Nos. 377637-43-CR.
[26]
In their defense, respondents denied petitioner's allegations, maintaining that whatever financial obligation they had or may have incurred had already been paid or was being paid. Further, respondents insisted that the complaint stated no cause of action and that the same was barred by statute of limitations and statute of frauds. Lastly, respondents imposed the defense of estoppel and that the court had no jurisdiction over the complaint because they never received the written demand letter.
[27]","ACCORDINGLY, the instant petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated December 5, 2019 and the Resolution dated January 15, 2021 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

The Decision dated August 20, 2018 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 219 in Civil Case No. Q-04-54398 is REINSTATED with MODIFICATION as follows: (a) the amount of P420,000.00 representing the principal obligation shall earn legal interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum from the date of extra-judicial demand, or on March 17, 2004, until June 30, 2013, and six percent (6%) per annum from July 1, 2013 until full payment; and (b) the award of attorney's fees shall earn legal interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the date of finality of this Decision until full payment. The rest of the Regional Trial Court ruling STANDS.","The Court finds that the evidence on record preponderates in petitioner's favor. ... Here, the following facts are undisputed: (1) respondents purchased from petitioner assorted textiles and clothing materials; (2) as payment, respondents issued several postdated checks in favor of petitioner; (3) the said checks were dishonored; (4) respondents executed a promissory note acknowledging their debt and committing to settle the same until December 1997; (5) respondents failed to honor the same; (6) respondents again executed another promissory note to settle the debt with staggered payments of P5,000.00 to P10,000.00 until the same is fully paid: and (7) respondents again failed to settle the same.[44] The fact that petitioner failed to provide a copy of the contract of sale is of no moment. Verily, petitioner was able to prove the existence of the sale transaction between him and respondents and the latter's existing obligation to pay, through his presentation of testimonial and documentary evidence, i.e., the subject checks, promissory notes, and the letter dated May 1, 2001. . . . Applying the foregoing in this case, respondents are thus required to overcome the said presumption and present evidence to prove the fact of payment. Notably, petitioner, being the holder of the checks, has presented, identified, and authenticated such checks. Petitioner may then rely on the same as proof of respondents' personal obligation to him. On the other hand, respondents failed to refute and deny the authenticity and genuineness of the checks. Further, respondents never denied their signatures provided therein. . . . Given the foregoing, it may be reasonably concluded that aside from mere allegations, respondents failed to provide proof as to their defense of payment. Thus, absent any clear indication that their obligation to petitioner has been paid, the Court finds the same to still be unsettled. All things considered, the RTC correctly ruled that petitioner has sufficiently, through preponderance of evidence, proven his claim against respondents. Contrary to the findings of the CA, this Court found sufficient basis for petitioner to arrive at the amount of P420,000.00 for his total claim originating from several PCIB Checks with Nos. 325430, 325427, 325431, and 325432 in the amount of P25,000.00 each, Metro bank Checks with Nos. 059444, 059407, 059442, and 059443 in the amount of P25,000.00 each, Metrobank Check No. 059445 amounting to P20,000.00, and UCPB Checks with Nos. 0116291 and 0116290, both in the amount of P100,000.00. This is part of the P1,500,000.00 debt respondents owed to petitioner, considering that a separate criminal case was filed for the remaining P1,080,000.00 of the subject obligation. Moreover, petitioner being the seller and after delivering the purchased textiles and clothing materials, has the right to enforce payment upon respondents, the buyers in this case. Absent any proof of payment, the obligation still stands.","The Decision dated August 20, 2018 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 219 in Civil Case No. Q-04-54398 is REINSTATED with MODIFICATION as follows: (a) the amount of P420,000.00 representing the principal obligation shall earn legal interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum from the date of extra-judicial demand, or on March 17, 2004, until June 30, 2013, and six percent (6%) per annum from July 1, 2013 until full payment; and (b) the award of attorney's fees [P50,000.00] shall earn legal interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the date of finality of this Decision until full payment. The rest of the Regional Trial Court ruling [ordering payment of P1,000.00 as Sheriff's fees; and P1,715.00 as cost of suit] STANDS."
"G.R. No. 228350, October 10, 2022","REGIDOR R. TOLEDO, RONALDO TOLEDO,* JOEFFREY TOLEDO, AND GLADDYS TOLEDO, PETITIONERS, VS. JERRY R. TOLEDO AND JELLY R. TOLEDO, RESPONDENTS.","The crux of the controversy is an agricultural land with an area of 18,681-square meter lots situated in the Barangay Poblacion Norte, Municipality of San Clemente, Province of Tarlac, covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 125017, registered in the name of the late Florencia Toledo (Florencia) in the Registry of Deeds of Tarlac. Florencia had three sons: Rodrigo Toledo (Rodrigo), father of respondents Jerry Toledo (Jerry) and Jelly Toledo-Magnaye (Jelly); Romualdo Toledo (Romualdo), father of petitioners Ronaldo, Joeffrey, and Gladdys; and petitioner Regidor (collectively referred to as ""petitioners""). Rodrigo and Romualdo predeceased their mother, Florencia. [6] In a Deed of Absolute Sale dated January 17, 2002, Florencia sold 10,000 square meters of the subject property to her grandson, Jerry, for P60,000,00. In another Deed of Absolute Sale dated October 10, 2002, Florencia sold 3,000-square meter of the property to her granddaughter, Jelly, for P50,000.00. [7] On December 14, 2002, Florencia passed away. [8] On September 8, 2003, Jerry wrote a letter to petitioners informing them that Florencia sold to him and to Jelly portions of the subject property, furnishing them the copies of the two deeds of absolute sale (the Deeds), and prohibiting them from selling said portions. [9] On September 14, 2003, Ronaldo sent him a reply stating that petitioners do not recognize the validity of the Deeds because a week before Florencia died, she executed a Sinumpaang Salaysay (the Salaysay) dated December 7, 2002, which stated that: Ako si FLORENCIA R. TOLEDO, ay nagsasabing na ang natitirang bahagi ng aking lupain na matatagpuan sa San Clemente, Tarlac, na may natitirang 15,681 metro kuadrado ay lubos kong pag-aari. Na kung ano mang kasulatan ngayon ako na napirmaha[n] ay hindi paglilipat ng nasabing lupain o pagmamana. Natatandaan ko na may pinapirmahan sa akin si Rodrigo na aking panganay na anak, subalit di niya ipinakita o pinabasa sa akin dahil nakatupi ang papel. Para matapos lang ay pinirmahan ko na lang ng di ko alam ang nilalaman. Wala na akong sasabihin. SA KATUNAYAN NG LAHAT NG ITO, ako ay lumagda ngayong December 7, 2002 dito sa Baclaran, Parañaque City. Sgd. FLORENCIA R. TOLEDO [10] Thus, petitioners filed a complaint for annulment of the Deeds with prayer for moral and exemplary damages and attorney's fees with the RTC. They claimed that: (1) since Florencia was weak, ill, and bedridden, there was a reason to believe that she was manipulated by her son Rodrigo to affix her name on the Deeds without knowing what she was signing; (2) Florencia could not have walked to appear before the notary public; and (3) the Deeds are fake, falsified, and fabricated for they were printed in like manner, with date and place of execution left in blank, with supplied handwritten date, with almost the same consideration and notarized far apart on dates to avoid the suspicion of wrongdoing. [11]","In its Decision [12] dated December 2, 2010, however, the RTC dismissed the complaint finding no merit in petitioners' allegations of fraud and undue influence. The RTC further denied their Motion for Reconsideration in its Order dated June 27, 2011. [13] On August 20, 2015, the CA rendered its Decision [14] affirming the ruling of the RTC. It similarly rejected petitioners' claims for their failure to prove that Florencia was subjected to fraud and undue influence when signing the Deeds. The CA noted that, while the notarization of the Deeds was irregular for Florencia's failure to personally appear before the notary public, such fact only reduces the evidentiary value of the same to that of a private document, the due execution and authenticity of which was duly proven by respondents. [15] In its Resolution [16] dated November 11, 2016, the CA further denied petitioners' motion for reconsideration and supplemental motion for reconsideration.","The Petition is denied. Prefatorily, it must be emphasized that the issue on the genuineness of a deed of sale is essentially a question of fact. Settled is the rule, however, that this Court is not a trier of facts, our jurisdiction being limited to reviewing errors of law. As such, this Court do not normally undertake a reexamination of the evidence presented by the contending parties during the trial of the case. This is especially true where the trial court's findings of fact are affirmed by the appellate court. While there are recognized exceptions [20] to the rule, and even if we make our own examination of the records of the case, this Court find that none of the said exceptions are obtaining herein. [21] Petitioners assailed the authenticity of the Deeds by drawing attention to certain irregularities in their notarization. They argue that since it was shown that Florencia did not sign in the presence of the notary public, it follows that she did not sign any of the Deeds. In light of the circumstances of the present case, however, this Court cannot sustain the argument. x x x This notwithstanding, even if this Court assumes an absence of notarization, the same shall not necessarily render the invalidity of the Deeds. Instructive on this matter is this Court's ruling in Camcam v. Court of Appeals, [23] where we held that: [A]n irregular notarization merely reduces the evidentiary value of a document to that of a private document, which requires proof of its due execution and authenticity to be admissible as evidence. The irregular notarization — or, for that matter, the lack of notarization — - does not thus necessarily affect the validity of the contract reflected in the document. Tigno v. Aquino enlightens: . . . [F]rom a civil law perspective, the absence of notarization of the Deed of Sale would not necessarily invalidate the transaction evidenced therein. Article 1358 of the Civil Code requires that the form of a contract that transmits or extinguishes real rights over immovable property should be in a public document, yet it is also an accepted rule that the failure to observe the proper form does not render the transaction invalid. Thus, it has been uniformly held that the form required in Article 1358 is not essential to the validity or enforceability of the transaction, but required merely for convenience. We have even affirmed that a sale of real property though not consigned in a public instrument or formal writing, is nevertheless valid and binding among the parties, for the time-honored rule is that even a verbal contract of sale or real estate produces effects between the parties. [24] (Emphasis supplied) x x x Time and again, this Court has held that ""one who alleges defect or lack of valid consent to a contract by reason of fraud or undue influence must establish by clear and convincing evidence such specific acts that vitiated a party's consent, otherwise, the latter's presumed consent to the contract prevails."" [26] After a judicious review of the case records, this Court find no cogent reason to deviate from the findings of the RTC and CA that petitioners failed to discharge this burden of proving fraud by clear and convincing evidence. To recall, they offered the Salaysay in evidence and .maintained that the statements therein sufficiently prove that Florencia was fraudulently made to sign the Deeds. Unfortunately, not only is the Salaysay intrinsically ambiguous, there are simply too many inconsistencies between said document and petitioners' allegations that this Court cannot ignore. x x x In view of the foregoing, this Court finds that the elusive Salaysay cannot prevail over or nullify the clear and express provisions of the Deeds. The statements therein are simply too ambiguous to state with certainty the subject matter it speaks of. It is unclear not only as to Florencia's sales of portions thereof, but also which between the two Deeds Florencia allegedly signed without knowing its contents. Hence, the issuance of the Salaysay, standing alone, cannot be appreciated as clear and convincing proof that Florencia was, indeed, fraudulently induced to sign the Deeds. x x x All told, there exists no cogent reason to reverse the ruling of the RTC that was affirmed in toto by the CA dismissing petitioners' complaint to annul the subject Deeds. As correctly found during the proceedings below, petitioners failed to discharge their burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence, the fraud, and undue influence, which they claim to have attended Florencia's signing thereof.","ACCORDINGLY, the instant petition is DENIED. The Decision dated August 20, 2015 and the Resolution dated November 11, 2016 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 97800, are AFFIRMED. The dismissal of the complaint for annulment of deeds by the Regional Trial Court, Branch 257, Parañaque City, is sustained."
"G.R. No. 248821, October 10, 2022","PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK, PETITIONER, VS. SPS. PEDRO CAGUIMBAL AND VIVIAN CAGUIMBAL, RESPONDENTS.","Respondent Vivian is a sub-contractor of logs for SAMMILIA Federation of People's Forest Development Cooperative (SAMMILIA)[6] in Diatagon, Lianga, Surigao del Sur. SAMMILIA, in turn, sells the logs to Baganga Plywood Corporation (Baganga Ply). Sometime in 2010, Vivian delivered logs to Baganga Ply and the latter issued six (6) PNB-Mati checks to Vivian in the total amount of P3,494,129.50 described as follows: a. Check No. 42439 in the amount of P1,319,085.00; b. Check No. 42400 in the amount of P1,000,000.00; c. Check No. 42438 in the amount of P98,075.00; d. Check No. 42399 in the amount of P1,000,000.00; e. Check No. 42437 in the amount of P39,011.00; and f. Check No. 42445 in the amount of P37,958.50.[7] On August 9, 2010, Faith Caguimbal (Faith), Vivian's daughter, went to PNB-Butuan Branch to verify if the checks were good. She approached PNB-Butuan Branch Sales and Service Officer, Grace Besa (Grace) to make such inquiry. Upon verification, Grace informed Faith that a Stop Payment Order (SPO) was issued by Baganga Ply on the said checks.[8] On August 12, 2010, the checks were again presented to PNB-Butuan Branch. This time, it was presented for deposit by Jill Martirez, cousin of Faith, to the branch's Sales and Service Head, Carlos S. Lim, Jr. (Carlos). Carlos, not knowing that the checks were previously inquired for verification, accepted all six (6) checks for deposit and sent them for clearing.[9] On August 16, 2010, five (5) out of the six (6) checks were returned with stamp marks ""SPO-funded"" and accordingly, the amounts corresponding the five (5) checks earlier deposited to the joint account of Vivian and Faith were debited. Meanwhile, the other check in the amount of P1,000,000.00 (Check No. 42399) was not returned by the bank. When Vivian and Faith inquired as to its status, they were informed by Grace that the check ""might be delayed for a day"".[10] In the meantime, Vivian sent a letter to Baganga Ply asking the latter to lift the SPO at least on the subject check.[11] On August 19, 2010, Faith went to PNB-Butuan Branch to update their passbook and saw that the amount of P1,000,000.00 was still intact and remained credited prompting respondents to assume that Baganga Ply had lifted the SPO on the subject check.[12] For the period of August 18, 2010 to August 31, 2010, Faith deposited and withdrew from the joint account and during the duration of which the amount of P1,000,000.00 remained intact in the balance of the joint account.[13] On September 1, 2010, after Faith withdrew P25,000.00 from the joint account, she was shocked to see that the remaining balance left in the account was only P10,518.61. When Faith inquired from the branch manager, she was informed that the amount of P1,000,000.00 was debited from the account in order to implement the SPO made in relation to the subject check.[14] The following day, September 2, 2010, PNB-Butuan Branch contacted Vivian and informed her about the SPO of the last check. When Vivian demanded for an explanation, she was eventually informed that it was only on August 27, 2010 that PNB learned that the subject check was only cleared through mistake after PNB received a complaint from Baganga Ply. However, Vivian refused to accept the explanation contending that the check was already cleared considering that the SPO came only 15 days after it was deposited when the clearing period was only 7 days. Meanwhile, Vivian was forced to borrow money from friends and associates to pay for her obligations which she was supposedly going to pay using the P1,000,000.00 from her account.[15] When PNB refused to return the P1,000,000.00 despite demands of Vivian, she filed the present complaint.[16] In its Answer,[17] PNB alleged, among others, that respondents have no cause of action against it because it merely implemented the SPO of its client. It further averred that the actual knowledge of respondents of the existence of the SPO makes them not holders in due course of the subject check negating their right to sue nor demand for the payment of the check under the Negotiable Instruments Law. PNB further claimed for moral damages, exemplary damages, and attorney's fees by way of counterclaim.[18]","The CA rendered a Decision[21] dated February 19, 2019, the dispositive portion of which states: WHEREFORE, the appeal is partly GRANTED. The April 27, 2017 Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Agusan del Norte, Branch 5, Butuan City, in Civil Case No. 6090 is SET ASIDE and a new one is entered ordering PNB to pay plaintiffs-appellants (herein respondents) P100,000.00 as moral damages, P100,000.00 as exemplary damages, and P50,000.00 as attorney's fees and costs of litigation. SO ORDERED.[22] The CA decreed that while PNB has the right to debit the amount erroneously credited to respondents' account, especially when respondents can hardly be considered as holders in due course of the check because they were fully aware that the check was previously subject to a SPO, PNB was nevertheless grossly negligent in attending to its business when it abruptly debited the account of respondents without prior notice rendering it liable for damages.[23] Petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration[24] which the CA denied in a Resolution[25] dated July 1, 2019.","The petition is unmeritorious. The crux of the controversy revolves around the determination of whether PNB observed the due diligence expected of it as a banking institution when it handled the account of respondents. The Court reiterates that its jurisdiction in a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court is generally limited only to errors involving questions of law. However, one of the recognized exceptions[30] is when the findings of the RTC and the CA are conflicting or contradictory as in the present case. Thus, the Court is constrained to review and reevaluate the evidence of the parties in order to resolve the issues raised.[31] Time and again, the Court has consistently emphasized that the degree of diligence required of banks is more than that of a good father of a family.[32] The banking industry is impressed with public interest and as such, banks are expected to exercise the highest degree of diligence as well as high standards, and integrity and performance in all its transactions. By the nature of its functions, a bank is under obligation to treat the accounts of its depositors with meticulous care and always to have in mind the fiduciary nature of its relationship with them.[33] In fact, as early as 1990, the Court in the landmark case of Simex International (Manila), Inc. v. Court of Appeals[34] has already stressed the fiduciary duty of banks towards their clients: [Omitted lengthy quote] Thus, the fiduciary nature of the banking business requires banks to comply with two essential and fundamental obligations - to treat their clients' accounts with utmost fidelity and meticulous care, and to record all transactions accurately and promptly.[36] In the case at bar, PNB clearly failed to meet these two essential and fundamental obligations. First, PNB admitted having cleared and credited the subject check to respondents' account by mistake despite the SPO of Baganga Ply. Its defense that it did not act with fraud or bad faith does not alter the fact that it was negligent in handling its affairs. For one thing, banks, an industry where the general public's trust and confidence in the system is of paramount importance,[37] cannot afford to commit any mistake in handling their affairs no matter how slight. Second, PNB's negligence in handling the account of respondents was further exemplified by the actions it took from the time the check was deposited on August 12, 2010 until it discovered its mistake on August 27, 2010. While PNB consistently asserted that respondents were fully informed that the subject check will eventually be dishonored and that the return of the actual check ""might be delayed for a day"", thereby implying that it was also expecting its return, its admission that it was only on August 27, 2010 or fifteen (15) days after the subject check was deposited that it discovered its mistake and only after Baganga Ply had called its attention contradicts its position. If what PNB claims is true, it should have actively monitored the status and whereabouts of the subject check in order to maintain the accuracy of its records, especially the accounts of Baganga Ply and respondents. Moreover, instead of promptly contacting respondents on August 27, 2010 to discuss its intention of debiting their account due to the discovery of the error, PNB chose the opposite. It waited until September 1, 2010 before informing respondents of the dishonor and only after it had debited their account. PNB's explanation that it could not have informed respondents on August 27, 2010 about the dishonor because its Butuan Branch only received the e-mail instructions to reverse the P1,000,000.00 from respondents' account on August 31, 2010 from its Mati Branch at the closing hours of August 27, 2010, making it appear that it has no control over the operating procedures of its branches, deserves scant consideration. In the case, considering that the dishonor of the subject check transpired in 2010 when cellular phones and internet connections were already very much accessible, the manager or any responsible officer of Mati Branch could have simply called its counterpart at Butuan to immediately relay and explain the situation to respondents. PNB, owing to its fiduciary duty to its depositors, should have taken the extra steps of finding a way to immediately apprise respondents of the situation even if it would mean that its officers would have to work beyond the official banking hours of August 27, 2010 to rectify or at least deescalate the situation. Incidentally, when Faith withdrew from the account on August 31, 2010, PNB still did not inform Faith or respondents about the possible recall of the P1,000,000.00 from their account. To make things worse, on September 1, 2010, the entries in respondents' passbook show that after Faith withdrew P25,000.00, the initial balance of P1,035,518.61 suddenly fell to P10,518.61. It was only after Faith complained about the loss of the P1,000,000.00 that PNB corrected the entries in the passbook by adding a new debit entry of P1,000,000.00 with remarks ""vs SPO"" and explained its reason to her. Otherwise stated, had Faith not noticed the loss of the P1,000,000.00 from the balance of the account, PNB would not even bother itself to take the initiative of informing respondents regarding the debit of the subject amount. Furthermore, PNB's argument that respondents should have expected the reversal of the P1,000,000.00 from their account by reason of their knowledge of the SPO on the subject check does not obliterate PNB's negligence. Respondents should not be faulted for assuming that the SPO on the subject check was eventually lifted by Baganga Ply because the P1,000,000.00 remained in their account for at least thirteen (13) days from August 19, 2010, the day they sent a letter request to Baganga Ply to allow the payment of the subject check. Certainly, PNB's lackadaisical attitude in dealing with the account of respondents falls short even of the slightest degree of diligence required of it. The business of a bank is imbued with public interest; thus, it requires due diligence and meticulousness in giving irreproachable service. For this reason, the bank should guard against injury attributable to negligence or bad faith on its part. The banking sector must at all times maintain a high level of meticulousness.[38] Thus, the Court is compelled to sustain the moral damages, exemplary damages, attorney's fees and costs of litigation awarded by the CA in favor of respondents.","WHEREFORE, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED. The Decision dated February 19, 2019 and Resolution dated July 1, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 04755-MIN are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION.

HOLIDAY HILLS STOCK & BREEDING FARM CORPORATION AND DOMINO FARMS, INC., RESPONDENTS.","On November 24, 2004, the Municipal Council of Biñan, Laguna, issued Municipal Resolution No. 284 (2004), which passed and approved Municipal Ordinance No. 06, an ordinance regulating the use of urban control zones for agricultural use, gradually phasing out large piggery, fowl, and other livestock farms located within the Municipality of Biñan, providing penalties, and for other purposes. On April 6, 2005, the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of the Province of Laguna passed and approved Municipal Ordinance No. 06. On February 7, 2006, respondents Holiday Hills Stock & Breeding Farm Corporation (Holiday Hills) and Domino Farms, Inc. (Domino Farms) filed a Petition for Certiorari, Declaratory Relief, and Prohibition before the RTC, assailing the validity of Municipal Ordinance No. 06 for violating the due process clause. Petitioners Municipality of Biñan, Laguna, Rogelio V. Lee, Antonio P. Aguilar, and Roberto Hernandez maintained that the issuance of Municipal Ordinance No. 06 was a valid exercise of police power. On October 30, 2008, the RTC dismissed the petition upholding the validity of Municipal Ordinance No. 06. Holiday Hills and Domino Farms appealed before the CA, which rendered the assailed Decision dated August 22, 2011 reversing the RTC, finding that the ordinance violated Holiday Hills' and Domino Farms' right to substantial due process because their hog farms are not a nuisance per se but a nuisance per accidens, which cannot be abated via an ordinance. The Municipality of Biñan et al. filed the Petition for Review on Certiorari before the Supreme Court.","WHEREFORE, the Appeal is GRANTED.

The Court rules that the respondents' hog farms must be considered a nuisance per se because the fact that they emit an unfavorable stench immediately interferes with the safety of the residents of Biñan, justifying summary abatement through a local ordinance. The means adopted (regulation and gradual phase out) are not unduly oppressive upon individuals as the ordinance only seeks to reduce the level of livestock to a manageable level and does not totally prohibit the conduct of business.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is GRANTED.

"G.R. No. 227775, October 10, 2022","ELEANOR REYNO AND ELSA DE VERA, PETITIONERS, VS. GEORGE BALTAZAR AND JOEL BALTAZAR, RESPONDENTS.","George Baltazar (George) and Joel Baltazar (Joel) are the husband and son, respectively, of Teresita Laurena Baltazar (Teresita). Teresita was a diabetic patient of Dr. Jade P. Malvar (Dr. Malvar), a physician holding clinic hours at Callang's General Hospital (CGH). [5] Teresita was referred to Dr. Malvar for a wound on her left foot. Upon examination, Dr. Malvar advised that she undergo debridement, a minor and superficial procedure to thoroughly clean the wound. [6] Due to financial constraints, Dr. Malvar suggested that Teresita transfer to a government hospital, Echague District Hospital (EDH). Following Dr. Malvar's advice and upon his written orders, Teresita was transferred to the EDH on June 9, 2009, between 8:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m., in time for her scheduled surgery the following day. [7] As part of Teresita's treatment being a diabetic patient, Dr. Malvar consulted a specialist, Dr. Cabucana De Guzman (Dr. De Guzman), [8] who instructed, among others, that Teresita be administered insulin during certain times of the day, particularly at 6:00 a.m., 12:00 n.n., 6:00 p.m., and 12:00 m.n., [9] to manage her diabetes during the course of the procedure. Further, Dr. De Guzman required that a Random Blood Sugar (RBS) test be done prior to each insulin injections. [10] The aforesaid instructions were specifically left to the nurses on ward duty, namely, Gigi Tomas (Tomas), designated as the ward nurse on duty from 12 m.n. to 8:90 a.m.; [11] De Vera, on duty from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.; [12] and Reyno, on duty from 4:00 p.m. to 12:00 m.n. [13] On June 10, 2009, at 10:30 a.m., George and Joel visited Teresita, who seemed to be in high spirits. At 11:15 a.m., Tomas endorsed Teresita to De Vera, [14] who administered insulin to Teresita at 11:30 a.m. [15] Thereafter, Dr. Malvar, along with anesthesiologist Dr. Baby Delfin L. Cabansag (Dr. Cabansag), performed the debridement, which ended at 12:20 n.n. without any complications. [16] After the operation, Teresita was assigned to recover in the ward while De Vera was still on duty. When De Vera's shift ended at 4:00 p.m., she endorsed Teresita to the care of the incoming nurse, Reyno. [17] At 5:00 p.m., Joel visited his mother. At 5:20 p.m., Reyno, as the ward nurse on duty, administered insulin to Teresita. [18] After about an hour, Reyno came by the room and proceeded to remove the oxygen mask attached to Teresita. [19] Despite Joel's protestations, Reyno informed him that the hospital was short of oxygen masks and that another patient also needed it. Considering Teresita's stable condition, she sought permission from Dr. Cabansag to remove her oxygen mask. [20] Moments later, Teresita's health took a turn for the worse, as Joel noticed that she was having difficulty breathing. He rushed to find Reyno to inform her of Teresita's condition, and to inquire as to the removal of his mother's oxygen mask. Reyno retorted in a defensive manner, saying ""wala akong kinakatakutan ... kahit magsumbong ka sa mga taga hospital."" [21] Despite her reaction, Reyno immediately returned the oxygen mask and attached it to Teresita. [22] After a while, Reyno observed that Teresita's difficulty in breathing persisted, and worse, she was beginning to salivate. Alarmed, she immediately called Dr. Malvar regarding the status of his patient. Dr. Malvar instructed that she administer a ""fifty-fifty intravenous"" to Teresita. [23] When Teresita's blood pressure began to fluctuate, Reyno called Dr. Malvar a second time and sought the help of the resident physician on duty, Dr. Honorio I. Caramancion (Dr. Caramancion), to attend to Teresita in the interim. [24] As an emergency measure, Dr. Caramancion administered epinephrine to stimulate cardiac activity. [25] Upon checking Teresita's heartbeat and pulse rate, Dr. Caramancion noticed that she was already unresponsive, causing him to declare her dead. Shortly thereafter, Dr. Malvar arrived and attempted to resuscitate her, but to no avail. Teresita was pronounced dead at 7:00 p.m. [26] Believing that Teresita's death was caused by the negligent and erroneous acts of the EDH and its staff, George and Joel instituted an action for damages against the local government of the province of Isabela (Isabela) as employer of the EDH personnel, Dr. Ma. Cristina A. Ventura (Dr. Ventura) as the officer-in-charge of the EDH, Dr. Caramancion, and nurses Reyno and De Vera before the RTC. [27] In a Decision [28] dated April 29, 2015, the RTC dismissed the instant complaint for lack of merit, the decretal part of which states: WHEREFORE, for lack of merit, the instant case is hereby DISMISSED. No other pronouncement. SO ORDERED. [29] In dismissing the complaint, the RTC held that the cause of Teresita's death was not clearly established, as there was no autopsy conducted to conclusively identify the exact cause of her death. [30] More, it was convinced that there was no negligence on the part of the EDH and it staff in attending to Teresita. The RTC ruled that Dr. Caramancion could not be held liable as he was merely the physician on duty and was not even Teresita's attending physician. He was also not involved in the debridement procedure earlier that day. Thus, the RTC assessed that he was only responsible for responding to an emergency situation, during which he acted promptly and with necessary due care. [31] It also ruled that Reyno and De Vera cannot be faulted in the performance of their duties. The RTC acknowledged that prior to removing the oxygen mask from Teresita, Reyno ensured that her vital signs were stable and that there was prior clearance from one of her doctors, Dr. Cabansag. Moreover, upon noticing Teresita's difficulty in breathing, she acted with haste and attached the oxygen immediately. Further, during Dr. Caramancion's attempt to revive Teresita, she exerted due efforts in keeping Dr. Malvar abreast as to the status of his patient, and thereafter, asked him to rush to the hospital. [32] With regard to De Vera, the RTC observed that she had properly endorsed Teresita to Reyno after her shift had ended. Assuming that she had failed to endorse the conduct of a random blood sugar test (RBS test) prior to the administration of insulin as instructed, there was no showing that such failure caused Teresita's untimely death. [33] As to Dr. Ventura, the RTC exculpated her from liability as she was away on official business at the time of the incident. Moreso, there was nothing irregular in the exercise of her duties as she immediately conducted an investigation surrounding the death of Teresita. [34] Finally, the RTC was not persuaded with regard to the liability of the province of Isabela. Having adjudged that the cause of Teresita's death was not established, the presumption of fault or negligence on the part of Isabela, as employer, did not even arise. Hence, the RTC felt no need to delve into its defense that it had exercised due diligence in the selection and supervision of its employees. [35] Aggrieved, George and Joel sought reconsideration, [36] which was denied in an Order [37] dated July 30, 2015. Thus, they interposed an appeal [38] before the CA. In its Decision [39] dated June 28, 2016, the CA partially granted the appeal. While it relieved Isabela, Dr. Ventura, and Dr. Caramancion from liability, it held both Reyno and De Vera jointly and severally liable for damages. The CA disposed in this wise: WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant appeal is partly GRANTED. The assailed Decision dated April 29, 2015 and Order dated July 30, 2015 of the RTC, Branch 35, Santiago City, Isabela in Civil Case No. 35-3595 are hereby AFFIRMED insofar as defendants-appellees LGU, Isabela, Maria Christina A. Ventura, Dr. Honorio Caramancion are concerned. However, defendants-appellees Eleanor Reyno and Elsa De Vera are hereby declared JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY LIABLE to pay plaintiffs-appellants George and Joel Baltazar the amount of P28,690.00 as actual damages, P50,000.00 as civil indemnity, P200,000.00 as moral damages, P100,000.00 as exemplary damages, and P50,000.00 as attorney's fees. SO ORDERED. [40] The CA applied the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur in finding Reyno and De Vera liable for Teresita's death due to their negligence in the performance of their duties. [41] First, it was admitted that Teresita died on June 10, 2009, less than 24 hours after being admitted at the EDH, and subsequent to undergoing a very simple operation. Second, as death could not have resulted from the minor operation, Reyno and De Vera's intervening negligent acts ultimately caused her death. [42] Hospital records prove that Teresita was injected with insulin without an RBS test as required by the doctors' preoperation orders, thus, exposing the patient to the risk of contracting hypoglycemia, which could cause death. [43] To compound this oversight, Teresita was not given any food since the day before her operation until the time of her death, contrary to the doctors' instructions. [44] Third, based on the totality of circumstances, the untimely death of Teresita could have been caused by hypoglycemia which appears to be linked to the cause of death as indicated in Teresita's certificate of death. Finally, the doctors' orders were clear, straightforward, and were under the exclusive control of Reyno and De Vera. As the nurses charged with Teresita's care, it was incumbent upon them to abide by such instructions. For failure to do so, they must be held liable for damages.","ACCORDINGLY, premises considered, the instant Petition is DENIED.","This Court sustains the CA ruling on the first issue. The CA did not err in its finding that the motion for reconsideration filed by respondents in the RTC substantially complied with the requirements of procedural due process, even absent notice of hearing. ... The foregoing disquisitions apply squarely to the facts of the instant case. Predicated on these rulings, respondents' misstep is excusable in the interest of justice. Records prove that petitioners were given the opportunity to file a comment/opposition [67] on the motion for reconsideration lodged by respondents in the RTC. If that was not enough, they were afforded the chance to file another comment/opposition, [68] this time, on the notice of appeal lodged by respondents. ... Withal, the purpose behind the required notice of hearing — ""to provide the time to study the motion for reconsideration and give an opportunity to be heard"" [70] — was satisfied in this case. . . On the merits, this Court likewise sustains the CA in its application of the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur to hold petitioners jointly and severally liable for the death of Teresita. ... Upon careful consideration, what is at once evident in the instant case is the presence of all the elements for the application of the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. ... Indubitably, the death of a patient is one that does not occur under normal circumstances following the process of a debridement. Elsewise stated, the success of the operation, which involved a mere superficial cleaning of a foot wound, [96] and her supposed recovery, thereafter, could not have led to the death of Teresita, unless negligence had set in somewhere. Similarly apparent in this case was the stark deterioration of Teresita's health during the time that she was turned over to the exclusive care and control of petitioners as a patient in their ward. ... As all the elements for recourse to the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur are present, this Court now turns to whether petitioners were negligent in the care of Teresita, and if in the affirmative, whether such alleged negligence was the proximate cause of her eventual death. This Court rules in the affirmative. ... Documentary evidence proves that Teresita was injected with insulin twice on different times, or at 11:30 a.m. by De Vera, and at 5:20 p.m. by Reyno. [111] Worse, petitioners injected insulin into Teresita's system without the required RBS test. [112] Consequently, as testified by Dr. Malvar, it would not be farfetched to conclude that such haphazard introduction of insulin twice placed Teresita at risk of contracting hypoglycemia, which most likely caused her death. ... In the final analysis, this Court finds the application of res ipsa loquitur appropriate. Through their tortious conduct, petitioners endangered the life of Teresita, in contravention to the ethical code and standards of practice held dear by those in the medical profession.","ACCORDINGLY, premises considered, the instant Petition is DENIED. The Decision dated June 28, 2016 and the Resolution dated September 20, 2016 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 105915, finding petitioners Eleanor Reyno and Elsa De Vera jointly and severally liable to pay respondents George Baltazar and Joel Baltazar the amount of P28,690.00 as actual damages, P50,000.00 as civil indemnity, P200,000.00 as moral damages, P100,000.00 as exemplary damages, and P50,000.00 as attorney's fees, are AFFIRMED."

SUAREZ, PRESIDING JUDGE, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT OF PARAÑAQUE CITY, BRANCH 259, AND PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENTS.","Cereza, et al. were charged in an Information for violation of Section 13, in relation to Section 11 of Article II of R.A. No. 9165, which reads as follows:
That on or about the 13th day of October 2015, in the City or Parañaque, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring, confederating together and all of them mutually helping and aiding one another each being in the approximate company of [five] (5) persons and having a social gathering, party or meeting, not being lawfully authorized to possess and/or use any dangerous drug, did then and there willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously possess or have under their control one (1) heat sealed transparent plastic sachet containing white crystalline substance marked as 'FB 10/13/15' weighing 0.07 gram, which when tested were found positive for Methamphetamine hydrochloride, a dangerous drug.
CONTRARY TO LAW.
On November 6, 2015, Cereza, et al. were arraigned, and they all entered a plea of ""NOT GUILTY"" to the charge against them. Thereafter, on July 5, 2018, Cereza, et al. filed a Motion to Withdraw Plea pursuant to this Court's ruling in Estipona v. Hon. Lobrigo (Estipona). In their motion, Cereza, et al. argued that this Court did not limit the offenses under R.A. No. 9165 which may be subject to plea bargaining. They also claimed that even the offense of Sale, Trading, Administration of Dangerous Drugs, which is punishable with life imprisonment to death, may be the subject of plea bargaining. As such, plea bargaining should likewise be allowed for a violation of Section 13, Article II of R.A. No. 9165, which is punishable by life imprisonment. Cereza, et al., thus prayed that they be allowed to enter a plea of guilty for violation of Section 12, Article II of R.A. No. 9165 in accordance with A.M. No. 18-03-16-SC or the Adoption of the Plea Bargaining Framework in Drugs Cases dated April 10, 2018. On August 7, 2018, the public prosecutor filed a Comment/Opposition thereto, which was responded to by a Reply that was filed by Cereza, et al. on August 9, 2018. Then, on August 15, 2018, the RTC, Branch 259, of Parañaque City issued an Order, the dispositive portion of which reads: WHEREFORE, premises considered, upon a thorough evaluation of the pieces of evidence so far presented in this case the Motion to Withdraw Plea dated 04 July 2018 filed by accused through counsel. Atty. Isser Josef V. Gatdula of the Public Attorney's Office (PAO) is hereby GRANTED. Accordingly and applying DOJ Circular No. 027 which allows for plea-bargaining for the offense of violation of Section 13, Art. II of [R.A. No.] 9165 to the lesser offense of Section 11, par 3 of [R.A. No.] 9165, the herein accused are hereby allowed to withdraw their earlier plea of NOT GUILTY to violation of Section 13, Art. II of [R.A. No.] 9165 and plead guilty to the lesser offense of Section 11, par 3 of [R.A. No.] 9165 with the possible penalty of imprisonment of twelve (12) years and one (1) day to twenty (20) years and a fine ranging from [P]300,000.00 to [P]400,000.00. In issuing the assailed Order, the RTC ratiocinated that an accused charged with, violation of Sec. 13 is explicitly excluded by A.M. No. 18-03-16-SC, considering that the imposable penalty is life imprisonment or life imprisonment to death. Nonetheless, with the issuance of DOJ Circular No. 027, which was released after A.M. No. 18-03-16-SC, and which took into account the framework of this Court, a plea bargaining for violation of Section 13 of R.A. No. 9165 may be allowed. Under the DOJ Circular, the penalties to be applied for violation of Section 13, being in relation to that of Section 11, would be based on the amount of drugs that was recovered from the accused. On August 22, 2018, Cereza, et al. filed a Partial Motion for Reconsideration, which was denied in an Order dated September 11, 2018. Undeterred, Cereza, et al. now come before this Court as a direct resort to challenge the above Orders.","The Court held that the petition serves as an exception to the rule of hierarchy of courts due to the public policy questions involved regarding plea bargaining rules. The Court disagreed that DOJ Circular No. 027 encroached upon its rule-making power, reiterating that plea bargaining requires prosecutorial consent and DOJ Circular No. 027 serves as internal guidelines for prosecutors. However, the Court noted that its own A.M. No. 18-03-16-SC, as subsequently amended, now includes violation of Section 13, allowing an acceptable plea bargain to the lesser offense of Section 12, which is favorable to the accused, and which applies retroactively as a procedural rule. The Court found that the trial court erred by simply allowing petitioners to enter a plea of guilty to violation of Section 11, par. 3 of R.A. No. 9165 solely based on DOJ Circular No. 027 without a proper assessment of the qualifications of the accused and the evidence on record, violating the established *Montierro* guidelines. The Court also affirmed that drug dependency assessment, as required by the latest guidelines, is valid and does not violate the right against self-incrimination, as it aids the court in evaluating the plea bargain proposal.","ACCORDINGLY , the Orders dated August 15, 2018 and September 11, 2018 rendered by the Regional Trial Court, Branch 259, of Parañaque City are SET ASIDE. The cases against Carlos Cereza, Roger Estolonillo, Raymundo Lopez, Yolanda Pascual, Merly Ann Montes, and May Ann Villa are REMANDED to the court of origin to determine their qualifications and the evidence pertaining to their cases in accordance with Montierro guidelines for evaluation of their plea bargaining proposal. SO ORDERED.",Orders SET ASIDE; Case REMANDED.
"G.R. No. 250852, October 10, 2022","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. JOHN FRANCIS SUALOG, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","John Francis Sualog (John Francis) was charged with three counts of murder committed against Amado Chavez Maglantay (Amado), Eppie U. Maglantay (Eppie), and Jessa Amie U. Maglantay (Jessa) before the Regional Trial Court of Culasi, Antique, Branch 13 (RTC), docketed as Criminal Case Nos. L-505, L-506, and L-507. Upon arraignment, John Francis pleaded guilty. The RTC initially convicted John Francis on June 10, 2004, and imposed the penalty of death for each case. The Court transferred the case to the CA, which subsequently remanded the case to the RTC on August 30, 2012, to prove John Francis' precise degree of culpability. The prosecution presented April Magsipoc (April), SPO2 Judy Lucas (SPO2 Lucas), and Dr. Teresita Escondo (Dr. Escondo) as witnesses. April testified that on October 12, 2003, at around 2:00 a.m., she heard her foster father and mother yell, and when she opened her bedroom door, she saw John Francis hacking her sister, Jessa, with a bolo. April hid until John Francis left. John Francis waived his right to present evidence. On January 5, 2016, the RTC found John Francis guilty of three counts of murder and sentenced him to Reclusion Perpetua for each count, appreciating treachery, evident premeditation, and unlawful entry. The CA affirmed John Francis's conviction for three counts of murder, holding that treachery qualified the killing to murder, but reduced the moral damages and corrected the name of the victim in Criminal Case No. L-507 to Jessa Amie Maglantay. John Francis appealed to the Supreme Court, reiterating that the prosecution failed to establish the elements of murder and its qualifying circumstances.","The Appeal is partly meritorious. The Court sustained April's positive identification of John Francis as the perpetrator. While the Informations were defective for failing to describe the ultimate facts constituting the qualifying circumstances, John Francis waived these defects by failing to file a motion to quash or motion for bill of particulars. However, the Court ruled out treachery because the prosecution failed to demonstrate how the accused commenced and executed the attack, noting that April only saw a momentary episode of the attack and hid thereafter. Evident premeditation was also correctly discounted by the CA due to the lack of evidence showing when the plan to kill was decided and how much time elapsed. The aggravating circumstances of nighttime, abuse of superior strength, cruelty, and ignominy were also not appreciated. Taken together, John Francis is liable only for three counts of homicide for failure of the prosecution to prove the alleged qualifying circumstances.","John Francis is liable for three counts of homicide, qualified by the mitigating circumstance of plea of guilt which he entered upon arraignment before the presentation of evidence. Under Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code, the penalty for homicide is reclusion temporal. Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law and considering the mitigating circumstance, the Court imposed the indeterminate sentence of six (6) years and one (1) day of prision mayor, as minimum, to twelve (12) years and one (1) day of reclusion temporal, as maximum, for each count. The Court modified the civil liability, awarding P50,000.00 civil indemnity, P50,000.00 moral damages, and P50,000.00 temperate damages for each count. The grant of exemplary damages was deleted in the absence of any aggravating circumstance. All damages shall earn interest at the rate of 6% per annum from finality of this Decision until fully paid.","ACCORDINGLY, the Appeal is DISMISSED. The Court of Appeals' Decision dated May 31, 2019 in CA-G.R. CEB-CR HC No. 02515 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. Accused-appellant John Francis Sualog is GUILTY of three counts of homicide and is sentenced to suffer the indeterminate penalty of six (6) years and one (1) day of prision mayor, as minimum, to twelve (12) years and one (1) day of reclusion temporal, as maximum, for each count. Accused-appellant John Francis Sualog is likewise DIRECTED to pay the heirs of the victims P50,000.00 civil indemnity, P50,000.00 moral damages, and P50,000.00 temperate damages for each count, all with legal interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the finality of this Decision until full payment. Lastly, the grant of exemplary damages is deleted for lack of factual and legal bases. SO ORDERED."

PRESIDENTIAL COMMISSION ON GOOD GOVERNMENT AND MID-PASIG LAND DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION, RESPONDENTS.","Ortigas claimed that, sometime in 1968, then President Ferdinand E. Marcos (Marcos) and his wife, Imelda (collectively, the Marcos Spouses), expressed their interest over a 16-hectare portion of Ortigas’s land. When Ortigas's Board of Directors rejected the proposal to donate the property, Marcos allegedly threatened to ""use his vast powers to harass [Ortigas] and its officers"" if they did not abide by his wishes. Out of fear, the Board acceded. A Deed of Conditional Sale was executed in favor of Marcos's nominee, Maharlika Estate Corporation, later transferred to Mid-Pasig Land Development Corporation (Mid-Pasig), for P40.00 per square meter, totaling P6,400,000.00. A final Deed of Sale and a Supplementary Agreement for an adjacent 2.4-hectare strip were subsequently executed. After the 1986 EDSA Revolution, Jose Y. Campos (president of Anchor Estate/Mid-Pasig) voluntarily surrendered the titles and possession of the properties to the government, placing them under the Presidential Commission on Good Government's (PCGG) control. Ortigas filed a Letter-Complaint seeking retrieval, which was dismissed. Subsequently, two Complaints were filed and consolidated before the Sandiganbayan: Ortigas’s Complaint (Civil Case No. 0093, 1990) sought to annul the deeds and titles, claiming the sale was void due to Marcos's threats and intimidation; and Ricardo C. Silverio’s Complaint (Civil Case No. 0147, 1992) claimed ownership (as a 30% shareholder of Anchor Estate) and assailed the fraudulent transfer to Mid-Pasig and subsequently to the PCGG. Several Motions followed, including BLEMP Commercial of the Philippines, Inc.'s (BLEMP) Motion for Leave to Intervene (claiming ownership via Mid-Pasig sale), Ortigas’s Application for Injunction and Receivership, motions for summary judgment from both Ortigas and PCGG/Mid-Pasig, and Ortigas’s Urgent Motion to Hold the Sale of the Subject Properties in Abeyance. All seven Petitions before the Supreme Court assailed the Sandiganbayan’s Resolutions on these motions and its eventual Decision dismissing Ortigas's main complaint.","The Sandiganbayan rendered nine Resolutions and one Decision that were assailed, including: (1) the April 18, 2011 and August 26, 2011 Resolutions denying BLEMP Commercial of the Philippines, Inc.'s (BLEMP) Motion for Leave to Intervene and Ortigas & Company Limited Partnership's (Ortigas) Application for Injunction and Receivership; (2) the March 26, 2012 Partial Summary Judgment partially granting the Presidential Commission on Good Government's Motion for Summary Judgment (dismissing Silverio’s complaint but denying it as to Ortigas’s complaint); (3) the April 25, 2014 and August 26, 2014 Resolutions denying Ortigas's Motion for Summary Judgment; (4) the July 20, 2015 and October 12, 2015 Resolutions regarding Ortigas's Urgent Motion to Hold the Sale of the Subject Properties in Abeyance; and (5) the March 13, 2020 Decision dismissing Ortigas's main Complaint (Civil Case No. 0093) for Annulment/Declaration of Nullity of Documents, Deeds, and Titles, and Recovery of Possession with Preliminary Injunction, after finding Ortigas's evidence insufficient to annul the contracts for lack of clear and convincing proof of threats or intimidation.","The Supreme Court held that the Sandiganbayan did not gravely abuse its discretion in denying BLEMP's Motion for Leave to Intervene because its legal interest was not direct and immediate but merely contingent on Mid-Pasig's disputed ownership. The Court affirmed the denial of Ortigas's application for injunction and receivership as Ortigas failed to establish a clear, existing legal right or grave and irreparable injury, noting that the Republic owns the properties by virtue of Jose Y. Campos's voluntary surrender (a form of forfeiture) and is not merely a conservator, enabling it to dispose of the lots. The Court affirmed the denial of motions for summary judgment concerning Ortigas’s complaint (Civil Case No. 0093) because genuine issues of vitiated consent required a full-blown trial, and affirmed the summary judgment dismissing Silverio’s complaint (Civil Case No. 0147) because Silverio failed to prove ownership of the shares and was barred by laches. Finally, the Court affirmed the dismissal of Ortigas’s main complaint (Civil Case No. 0093), ruling that Ortigas failed to discharge its burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the contracts of sale were void due to coercion or intimidation, as Atty. Francisco’s affidavit was inadmissible hearsay and other evidence supported the regularity of the transactions.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petitions are DISMISSED. The following issuances of the Sandiganbayan are AFFIRMED: (1) April 18, 2011 and August 26, 2011 Resolutions denying BLEMP Commercial of the Philippines, Inc.'s Motion for Leave to Intervene and Ortigas & Company Limited Partnership's application for injunction and receivership; (2) March 26, 2012 Partial Summary Judgment and September 10, 2012 Resolution partially granting the Presidential Commission on Good Government's Motion for Summary Judgment; (3) April 25, 2014 and August 26, 2014 Resolutions denying Ortigas & Company Limited Partnership's Motion for Summary Judgment; (4) July 20, 2015 and October 12, 2015 Resolutions denying Ortigas & Company Limited Partnership's Urgent Motion to Hold the Sale of the Subject Properties in Abeyance; and (5) March 13, 2020 Decision and October 6, 2020 Resolution in Civil Case No. 0093, dismissing Ortigas & Company Limited Partnership's Complaint for Annulment/Declaration of Nullity of Documents, Deeds and Titles and Recovery of Possession with Preliminary Injunction.

"G.R. No. 198083, October 10, 2022","BAI SANDRA SINSUAT A. SEMA, PETITIONER, VS. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES REPRESENTED BY THE ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING COUNCIL (AMLC), RESPONDENT.","Bai Sandra Sinsuat A. Sema (Sema) filed a Petition for Review assailing the Resolutions of the Court of Appeals that denied her Urgent Motion to Lift Freeze Order. The Court of Appeals earlier issued a Freeze Order covering, among others, the various bank accounts and properties of a certain ""Bai Sandra Ampatuan"" and ""Bai Sandra S. Ampatuan,"" and others, after granting the Urgent Ex Parte Petition filed by the Republic of the Philippines through the Anti-Money Laundering Council (the Council). The Urgent Ex Parte Petition was based on an investigation conducted by the Council, and attached to it were the following: Special Audit Report No. 2010 for the Office of the Regional Governor of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao by the Commission on Audit; Evaluation Report on the lifestyle check conducted by the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Mindanao on Datu Andal S. Ampatuan, Sr. and Datu Zaldy U. Ampatuan; Sinumpaang Salaysay of Lakmodin Alamada Saliao (Saliao); and Joint Complaint-Affidavit and Supplemental Joint Complaint-Affidavit furnished to the Council and executed by the widows of the [Maguindanao] massacre's victims. The CA found probable cause and issued the Freeze Order, which included thirty accounts belonging to Sema and her husband. Sema filed an Urgent Motion to Lift Freeze Order, alleging mistaken identity. She claimed she is the daughter of the late Datu Mantato Sumagka Ampatuan, Sr., of the Ampatuans of Kabuntalan, and is not related by blood to the Ampatuans of Shariff Aguak. She claimed that the name, Bai Sandra Ampatuan/Bai Sandra S. Ampatuan, one of the respondents in the Freeze Order, refers instead to Bai Zandria Sinsuat Ampatuan, wife of Sajid Islam Uy Ampatuan. The Republic, in its Consolidated Comment, averred that Sema's claims hardly justify the volume of transactions on the 30 identified accounts and moved to extend the validity of the Freeze Order to six months. The Court of Appeals denied the various Motions to lift Freeze Order, including Sema’s, and extended the Freeze Order up to December 2, 2011, noting that the diverse purported facts, matters and arguments, i.e. (lineage, pedigree, mistaken identity . . . ) raised by respondents in their motions cannot be resolved in the instant AMLC case for issuance of freeze order which is purely summary in nature. Sema filed the present Petition, arguing that the case fell under exceptions to the rule on mootness despite the expiration of the Freeze Order, and that no probable cause existed because her bank accounts were not related to the alleged unlawful activities of the Ampatuan clan, asserting that she was included only because of her surname which led to a mistake of identity.",We grant the Petition.,"We find that while the Freeze Order has indeed expired, a resolution on the issues raised in this case is still in order because it falls under exceptions to the rule on mootness (grave constitutional violations, paramount public interest, capable of repetition yet evading review). On the procedural issue, we rule that the Petition cannot be denied for merely raising questions of fact, as petitioner has sufficiently proved that exceptions to the general rule under Rule 45 apply, such as the finding being 'grounded entirely on speculation, surmises, or conjectures.' We find that there was no probable cause for the Court of Appeals to issue the Freeze Order against petitioner's and that of her husband's bank accounts and properties. Probable cause must be established before a freeze order is issued by the Court of Appeals, shown through 'facts and circumstances [that] would lead a reasonably discreet, prudent[,] or cautious [person] to believe that an unlawful activity and/or a money laundering offense is about to be, is being[,] or has been committed and that the account or monetary instrument or property subject thereof sought to be frozen is in any way related to said unlawful activity and/or money laundering offense.' A review of the documents used by the CA (Urgent Ex Parte Petition, AMLC Resolution, audit reports, affidavits) shows that probable cause against petitioner was never established, as they failed to mention how petitioner was related to the spurious transactions, and the investigation merely included her because of the surname 'Ampatuan' which was categorized in the database as a 'might be.' A person having a similar surname with another is not sufficient to prove their relationship, much less their participation in unlawful activities. A person's identity should be ascertained even in—or especially in—the determination of probable cause for the issuance of a freeze order.

"G.R. No. 190980, October 10, 2022","STRADCOM CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. MARIO TEODORO FAILON ETONG A.K.A. TED FAILON, RESPONDENT.","This Court resolves a Petition for Indirect Contempt[2] filed by Stradcom Corporation (Stradcom) against Mario Teodoro Failon Etong (Failon) for statements made in his radio program allegedly criticizing past decisions of this Court, and for discussing the merits of an ongoing case where Stradcom is a party. This is an offshoot of Bayan Muna Party-List Representative Satur C. Ocampo et al. v. DOTC Secretary Mendoza et al.,[3] where petitioners in that case sought to nullify the Department of Transportation and Communications and the Land Transportation Office's Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) project on claims, among others, that it failed to undergo competitive public bidding and it lacked the required approval from the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA). Petitioners, in that case, also applied for a Temporary Restraining Order to enjoin the implementation of the RFID project.[4] Stradcom is the private respondent in Bayan Muna. On February 8, 2010, while Bayan Muna was still pending, it filed this contempt petition before the Court against Failon for his statements on the RFID project, which aired over the DZMM TeleRadyo program ""Tambalang Failon and Sanchez"" on January 12, 2010.[5] The statements complained of were transcribed as follows:
At ano nga ba your Honors ang kagandahan ng public bidding? Pag public bidding mga kaibigan, pababaan po ng presyo. Ayon po [s]a pagsasaliksik ng grupo ng Failon ngayon mga kaibigan, palakpakan natin si Grace, si Winnie at si Apple. Sa ibang mga bansa, ang sticker po ng RFID na yan ay nagkakahalaga lamang ng hindi tataas hindi sosobra sa halagang One US Dollar equivalent to about [f]orty-five pesos or less ang isang RFID sticker na [y]an. At ang reader nito mga kaibigan ay hindi lalagpas sa pitong daang dolyar bawat isa o katumbas mga kaibigan na mga [tatlumpu't] tatlong libong piso. Ang LTO po ay umaamin na wala pa silang reader. Ni hindi po natin alam mga kaibigan kung papaano po ang deployment ng reader at kung anong reader ang bibilhin, saan po ilalagay, kung yan po ay fixed na reader o kung sino po ang may hawak nito at gaano po karami ang may hawak nito at kung [i]to po ba ay nationwide. Samakatuwid mga kaibigan hindi dapat tayo ipinagbabayad sa hindi mo alam na programa. Ilan ba ang readers na bibilhin ninyo. Sa buong Pilipinas ba ay magkakaroon ng reader. Papaano nga ba ire. Kasi nga wala pong bidding mga kaibigan. So ngayon [p]o mga kapamilya, tayo po ay magbabayad in advance, sampung taon advance ano po sa isang bagay na hindi man lamang po mga kaibigan na hindi dumaan sa public bidding. Isang bagay na hindi ka nakakasiguro sa lifespan nito. Dumaan sa NEDA, ayaw ng NEDA. Ang NTC nagsabi nung una pa na hindi pupwede yan dahil hindi yan dumaan sa amin dahil ang pinaguusapan nito radio frequency. Dapat dumaan sa kanila. Wala sa NTC mga kaibigan. Ano nga ba ire. So [kumbaga], talaga pong ipinipilit sa atin mga kaibigan ang proyektong ito. Ngayon, ito po mga kaibigan ay dadaan ha sa suppose[d] to be na tila matang lawin na pagsusuri po ng kataastaasang kagalanggalangang hukuman. Pero tayo po ay nangangamba mga kaibigan sa posibleng kahahantungan ng TRO petition na ito [sa] Supreme Court. Alam nyo po kung bakit? Dahil kung atin pong oobserbahan lately po with all due respect sa atin pong mga mahistrado. Hindi naman po [i]to botohan ng 15-0, hati lagi ang boto, dikit ang boto ibig sabihin meron pa din po dyang naninindigan para sa tama, ha, naninindigan para sa bayan.. pero sila po ay natatalo ng mayorya. Example, [iyon] pong desisyon ng Supreme Court mga kapamilya tungkol sa mga City hindi ho ba[.] Yun pung isyu kung sino po ang dapat maging lungsod or hindi. If you will remember [,] mga kaibigan tayo po ay magbalik tanaw.. tayo [po ay] magrewind ng panandalia[n], ops. Nagkaroon po ng demandahan dyan nagreklamo ang mga lehitimong lungsod laban sa mga nag-aa[p]ply bilang lungsod. Ang pinaguusapan dito bayan ay pera .. Tandaan po natin bottomline dyan ang Internal Revenue Allotment, pera, malaki ang share mo kapag ikaw ay lungsod, yan po ang bottomline dyan mga kaibigan kaya marami po ang gustong maging lungsod. Ngayon, nagkaroon na po ng desisyon mga kaibigan ang Supreme Court na sinasabi na ito ang panuntunan before ka maging lungsod. May mga natalo dalawang motion. Ano ang sabi ng Supreme Court? Hindi na pupwede. Hindi na kami mageentertain pa ng kahit ano pang hirit di[t]o. Sarado na ang kasong ito.. Case closed. Ano ang nangyayari nagkaroon ng mga pagbabago sa loob ng kataastaasang hukuman. Mayroo[n] pong mga nagretiro na mahistrado.. Nagkaroon po ng pagpapalit ng mga mahistrado. Kinalaunan sa isang hindi maipaliwana[g] na pagkakataon.. mismo ang [S]upreme [C]ourt ang kumain sa kanilang mga salita na wala na silang tatanggapin na petition tungkol sa saradong isyu na ito. At tila ba isang malaking himala.. Tila baga isang hindi maipaliwanag na pangyayari biglang nagbukas ang pintuan ng Supreme Court at tinanggap ang panibangong motion ng mga gustong maging syudad at pinagbigyan ang kanilang kahilingan na maging lungsod sa gitna ng pagsasabi ng Supreme Court na wala na kaming tatanggaping petition tungkol sa isyung ito. Mga kaibigan yan po ang mga palatandaan ng pagbabago ng ating panahon. Ito ba ay kabahagi ng Climate Change? Hindi ko masasabi. Hindi pa dyan mga kaibigan magtatapos. Kung inyo pong magugunita mga kaibigan, alam naman po nating lahat na ang isang appointed official ng pamahalaan ... Ikaw ay miyembro ng gabinete, ikaw ay isang bureau director, ikaw ay isang pinuno ng isang ahensya ng pamahalaan na kung saan ikaw ay naluklok sa pwesto sa bisa lamang ng papel at ballpen na hawak ng appointing power. Ikaw ay naa[p]point...nanungkulan. At ng ikaw ay magdesisyon para tumakbo sa isang elected na posisyon, hindi ho ba kinakailangan na magresign ka na? Dahil iba ang elected, iba ang appointed. Mga kaibigan, sa mga kadahilanang hindi natin maipaliwanag, ang Supreme Court, sa botong dikit, sa botong hati, pero nakakalamang pa rin ang mga pabor. Ano ang naging hatol ng mga mahistrado? Kahit na sino ang nag-file ng certificate of candidacy, whether halal ng bayan o appointed ay hindi na kinakailangan pang mag-resign hanggang sa kahulihuliang araw nya ng panunungkulan sa gobyerno, yan poy Enero, yan poy Hunyo a-trenta ng taong kasalukuyan.

Commission on Elections, et al.[7] and Quinto v. Commission on Elections,[8] respondent Failon allegedly mocked and depicted this Court as ""fickle minded, lacking firmness and resoluteness in its decisions""[9] creating doubt on the result of the application for Temporary Restraining Order in Bayan Muna.[10] Respondent's words, as to petitioner Stradcom, tend to erode the people's faith in this Court, effectively impeding, obstructing, and degrading the dispensation of justice in Bayan Muna. Citing an excerpt of respondent's January 4, 2010 interview with Bayan Muna Party-List Representative Congressman Teodoro Casiño (Congressman Casiño), petitioner also argues that respondent allegedly allowed his radio program to be used as a means to discuss the arguments of petitioners in Bayan Muna:[11] [Congressman Casiño's arguments regarding the illegality of the RFID contract, lack of public bidding/NEDA approval, usurpation of Congress' power, and threat to privacy are quoted]. In repeatedly discoursing on the merits of Bayan Muna, petitioner submits that respondent blatantly violated the sub judice rule and elated himself above this Court. His endless tirades were purportedly made to influence the opinion of the people for the public clamor to sway this Court into ruling against the project. For these reasons, petitioner prays for respondent to be cited in contempt with a fine and for this Court to issue a cease-and-desist order to restrain him from further discussing the merits of the petition in Bayan Muna in his radio program while the case is pending.[13] In his Comment,[14] respondent insists on merely expressing his opinions and informing his listeners on public issues.[15] Believing that the contempt imputed against him is criminal in nature, he stresses on intent as a necessary element[16] of the charge to which petitioner allegedly fell short of proving.[17] He explains that his statements relative to League of Cities and Quinto were within the permissible bounds of fair criticisms. While he may have been passionate in expressing his disagreement on the rulings of these cases, he nevertheless did so in good faith, bereft of abuse or misrepresentation of facts.[18] To reinforce that his statements were fair criticisms and thus noncontemptuous, respondent asserts that he only discussed court decisions that the public should know. He did not malign any particular person or attribute discreditable motives to this Court or its members, and he did not also take pleasure in using spiteful or malicious words. Allegedly, it was not his intention to disrespect this Court. He is merely doing his job as a journalist and radio commentator to provide information to the public on this Court decisions.[19] Respondent counters that petitioner also failed to establish how his comments in the cited cases cast doubt on the application for Temporary Restraining Order. Given that the Petition for Contempt was filed after this Court had already issued a status quo ante order effectively restraining the Land Transportation Office from implementing the project as early as January 12, 2010, the issue regarding this matter is purportedly moot.[20] Respondent further explains that since the status quo ante order was issued on the same day, his January 12, 2010 statements could not have influenced this Court. By filing a Petition for Contempt, petitioner is seemingly implicating that the Justices listened to him and considered his opinions in their deliberation and eventual issuance of the order. Respondent then calls for the dismissal of the Petition because in contending that this Court can be swayed by his statements, it is allegedly petitioner and not him who is attacking this Court's independence.[21] In addition, respondent argues that petitioner has no, or if at all, only ""little-interest"" in this contempt proceeding. Allegedly, this Court did not even moto propio take action on his statements showing that the uproar was only on the part of petitioner.[22] Assuming that petitioner may have minimal interest in this case, still, it allegedly failed to prove how his criticisms could affect the dispensation of justice in Bayan Muna. Failon attacks petitioner's mere presentation of a compact disk and transcripts of his assailed statements without establishing how it supposedly cast doubt on the result of the application for the restraining order.[23] On his alleged violation of the sub judice rule, respondent argues that the cited interview was only a rehash of the arguments raised by petitioners in Bayan Muna, which were already made public.[24] In balancing judicial independence with freedom of expression, respondent claims that his remarks were only ""advocacies of his thoughts and opinions""[25] pursuant to the clear and present danger test. He also stresses that petitioner's prayer for a cease-and-desist order is an impermissible prior restraint.[26] In its Reply,[27] petitioner reiterated its arguments in the Petition and insisted that respondent's remarks neither espouse the respect and dignity owing to this Court nor encourage confidence in it.[28] Respondent later filed a Motion to Admit[29] his attached Rejoinder[30] but was eventually denied by this Court for being a prohibited pleading.[31] For this Court's resolution is whether or not respondent Mario Teodoro Failon Etong is guilty of indirect contempt for the statements he made in his radio program.",We dismiss the Petition.,"The contempt charge is criminal in nature, punishable under Rule 71, Section 3(d) of the Rules of Civil Procedure as ""[a]ny improper conduct tending, directly or indirectly, to impede, obstruct, or degrade the administration of justice."" In criminal contempt proceedings, the contemnor enjoys the presumption of innocence, and the prosecution must prove the charge beyond reasonable doubt, showing that the respondent ""acted willfully or for an illegitimate purpose."" Petitioner failed to meet this standard of proof, relying only on general allegations and transcripts of the remarks without proving that respondent deliberately stated the remarks to ""impede, obstruct or degrade the administration of justice in Bayan Muna[.]"" The Court also held that respondent's assailed utterances are not contemptuous. Recognizing the constitutional guarantee of free speech and the duty of the press to criticize public officers, the Court found that Failon's remarks expressed reasonable concerns about the RFID project, a matter of public interest. His statements regarding past decisions (League of Cities and Quinto) merely reinforced his fears about the outcome in Bayan Muna; he did not insinuate disreputable motives or use intemperate language to demean the Court's dignity. The Court must apply the contempt power judiciously and sparingly, tolerating even sarcastic intimations, so long as they do not violate the required standard of proof for criminal contempt. Finally, regarding the alleged violation of the sub judice rule, the Court applied the ""clear and present danger"" rule. For a remark to be punished, the consequent evil must be ""extremely serious and the degree of imminence extremely high."" There was no showing that respondent's remarks, including the interview with Congressman Casiño, which was merely a reiteration of publicly known arguments in Bayan Muna, posed a serious and imminent threat to the dispensation of justice. A public utterance concerning an ongoing judicial proceeding is not automatically deprived of free speech protection simply because of the assumption that it tends to impede the orderly dispensation of justice.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DISMISSED. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 242837, October 05, 2022","EUFROCINA RIVERA, PETITIONER, VS. ROLANDO G. VELASCO, RESPONDENT.","At the heart of the instant controversy are three parcels of land located in Rio Chico, General Tinio, Nueva Ecija, containing an aggregate area of 27,076 square meters, more or less, and registered in the name of petitioner under Original Certificates of Title (OCT) Nos. P-27012, P-27013, and P-27014. Petitioner claimed that she acquired the properties through Free Patent Applications. In her Complaint before the MTC dated October 21, 2014, petitioner asseverated that on June 21, 2014, she discovered that respondent, by means of strategy and stealth, possessed and occupied a portion of her titled lands, to the extent of 6,397 square meters, by constructing a house thereon without her consent or permission. Respondent countermanded that he is the lawful owner of the portion of the subject property, having occupied the same since 1995, and lodged a Protest against petitioner before the DENR, alleging that petitioner acquired her titles through fraud.","The Municipal Trial Court (MTC) of General Tinio rendered a Decision in petitioner's favor, finding her prior physical possession and rejecting respondent's defense as a collateral attack on Torrens titles. The Regional Trial Court (RTC) dismissed respondent's appeal and affirmed the MTC judgment in toto. However, the Court of Appeals (CA) reversed and set aside the RTC and MTC decisions and ordered the dismissal of petitioner's complaint, arguing that the case involved a complex ownership issue that must be settled in an accion reivindicatoria due to respondent's pending Protest before the CENRO and a civil case for Reconveyance of Title.","The Supreme Court found the petition impressed with merit. It held that petitioner successfully made out a case for forcible entry, alleging prior physical possession and unlawful deprivation by means of strategy and stealth. The CA erred in allowing respondent’s collateral attack on petitioner's three Torrens titles, noting that a Torrens certificate of title is indefeasible and immune from collateral attacks. The Court reiterated that in ejectment cases, the only issue is physical possession (de facto), and since the titleholder is entitled to all the attributes of ownership, including possession, the MTC correctly ruled in favor of petitioner.","The petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated February 15, 2018 and the Resolution dated September 17, 2018 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 151231 are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The Decision dated July 6, 2015 of the Municipal Trial Court of General Tinio, Nueva Ecija in Civil Case No. 1017 is hereby REINSTATED with MODIFICATION in that legal interest of six percent (6%) per annum is imposed on the total monetary award due petitioner Eufrocina Rivera, reckoned from the time of finality of this Decision until its full satisfaction."

CAIDIC,[2] RESPONDENTS.","On September 15, 2014, petitioner signed a seven-month employment contract under the POEA-SEC with respondent C.F. Sharp Crew Management, Inc., for and on behalf of its principal, Prestige Cruise Services, LLC/Prestige Cruise Holdings, Inc., as Chief Fireman for the vessel M/V Regatta. [8] His duties and responsibilities were as follows: Report to the Safety Officer and to the Staff Captain Be a [firefighting] team leader Be [r]esponsible for the maintenance and proper functioning of all firefighting equipment aboard the vessel Respond also to medical emergencies and [provide] first aid until arrival of a dedicated medical officer Prepare the fire drill and training of ship's firefighting parties and[,] in conjunction with the Safety Officer[, prepare] the weekly familiarization and safety meetings for all sign on crew Conduct the fire prevention and firefighting familiarization training of all joining crew members Enter fire training and drills into the logbook Ensure that all fire-extinguishing appliances (both stationary or portable) are in accordance with the regulations and available for immediate use Ensure that the maintenance of all deck equipment is in accordance with the safety regulations in [regard] to fire hazards including the ship's tenders, lifeboats and rescue boats Evaluate and prevent potential fire hazards in order to improve the ship's fire prevention and control standards Conduct crew cabin inspections (crew rounds) as required by the Staff Captain[.] [9] Before his deployment, petitioner underwent a pre-employment medical examination and was declared fit for sea duty by the company­-designated physician. On September 17, 2014, petitioner boarded the vessel. [10] Sometime in March 2015, petitioner experienced drowsiness, lightheadedness, easy fatigability, shortness of breath, clogged nose, and sore throat. His crewmates also informed him that he was snoring loudly while sleeping. Upon consulting with the ship doctor, he was diagnosed to be suffering from obstructive sleep apnea, hypertension, and probable congestive heart failure and was given the corresponding medications. [11] Upon reaching a port in South Miami, Florida in the United States on April 7, 2015, petitioner was sent to South Miami Hospital. After medical evaluation and conduct of laboratory tests, he was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus and was prescribed with medications. He was then repatriated due to medical reason. [12] Upon his arrival in the Philippines on April 13, 2015, petitioner immediately reported to the company-designated physician, Dr. Esther G. Go ( Dr. Go ) of Marine Medical Services, for medical evaluation and treatment. Since he was found to have diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and chronic tonsillitis with features of obstructive sleep apnea, petitioner was recommended for S/P tonsillectomy, bilateral and was also prescribed with several medications. He was endorsed to another company-designated physician at Cardinal Santos Medical Center, where he underwent S/P tonsillectomy, bilateral via Ellman radiofrequency and closure of pillars and oropharynx. [13] After undergoing sleep study for further evaluation of his sleep apnea, petitioner was confirmed to have obstructive sleep apnea-hypoapnea syndrome, severe; rapid eye movement ( REM )-related parasomnia. He was recommended to undergo continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) therapy, a non-surgical and non-invasive treatment that utilizes a machine to help him breathe easier during sleep, decrease daytime sleepiness, and help lower blood pressure. He was also provided with a CPAP machine and was advised to continue his medications, to exercise regularly, and to avoid caffeine, tobacco, alcohol, and eating big meals close to bedtime. [14] On July 31, 2015, Dr. Go issued a Final Medical Report [15] clearing petitioner from diabetologic standpoint, with the advice to continue taking his maintenance medications. Petitioner was also advised to continue using the CPAP machine to manage his sleep apnea. The medical report likewise contained the following opinion: The specialist opines that patient had already reached maximum medical improvement and patient is not unfit for further sea duties due to risk of apneic episode and cardiac arrhythmia for his Obstructive Sleep Apnea. If patient is entitled to a disability, his suggested disability grading is Grade 12 – slight residual or disorder. [16] On August 6, 2015, Dr. Go issued another Medical Report [17] stating that diabetes mellitus is usually familial or hereditary, being a metabolic disorder where an individual gains weight even to the point of obesity leading to insulin resistance and inability of the body to utilize blood sugar available for cell or organ metabolism. She added that obstructive sleep apnea is caused by airway destruction with pauses in breathing during sleep, the risk factors of which include overweight/obesity, small receding jaw, and short neck. She also stated that chronic tonsillitis is a recurrent infection of the tonsils leading to hypertrophic tonsils and can aggravate obstructive sleep apnea. She opined that the said conditions are neither work-related nor work-aggravated, and that while there are several causes of hypertension, such as genetic predisposition, poor lifestyle, high salt intake, smoking, diabetes mellitus, age, and increased sympathetic activity, the said causes are also not work-related. [18] Dissatisfied with the findings, petitioner opted to see a private cardiologist, Dr. May S. Donato-Tan ( Dr. Donato-Tan ). On September 10, 2015, Dr. Donato-Tan issued a Medical Certificate [19] indicating that petitioner still felt drowsy even after waking up and had shortness of breath, somnolence, loud snoring, and erratic blood pressure even while taking Amlodipine 5 mg. She, thus, declared him permanently disabled as he would not be able to perform his job effectively, efficiently, and productively as a seaman. [20] On September 15, 2015, petitioner's counsel, Atty. Simplicio B. Bermejo, Jr., ( Atty. Bermejo ) wrote respondent C.F. Sharp Crew Management, Inc. a letter, [21] informing that an independent medical expert declared his client to be totally and permanently unfit for sea duties, and inviting them for a third medical opinion for purposes of determining his disability benefits. He also requested for a copy of petitioner's final medical assessment and copies of his medical records in accordance with Sec. 20(F) [22] of the POEA-SEC. As the demand letter went unheeded, petitioner filed a complaint against C.F. Sharp Crew Management, Inc., Prestige Cruise Services, LLC/Prestige Cruise Holdings, Inc. and Geronimo F. Caidic (collectively, respondents ) before the PVA for payment of total and permanent disability compensation, moral and exemplary damages, and attorney's fees. [23] Mandatory conferences were held, but no amicable settlement was reached by the parties. Hence, the filing of their respective Position Papers, [24] Reply, [25] and Rejoinder. [26]","WHEREFORE , the petition for review is GRANTED . The assailed dispositions of majority of the PYA are REVERSED and SET ASIDE . Accordingly, the Respondent's [Ledesma's] complaint, in MVA­100-RCMB-NCR-043-03-03-2016, before the PVA is DISMISSED . No costs. SO ORDERED.","The petition lacks merit. Whether or not a seafarer's illness is compensable is essentially a factual issue.

[41] Be that as it may, among the recognized exceptions to said rule, is when the factual findings of the CA are inconsistent with that of the labor tribunals. [42] Due to the conflicting findings of the CA and the PVA as to petitioner's entitlement to disability benefits, the Court deems it proper to tackle the factual issues to resolve the dispute with finality. Petitioner failed to prove by substantial evidence, that his illnesses are work-related or work-aggravated. ... Here, the company-designated physician issued a Medical Certificate [55] dated August 6, 2015 on the 113th day of petitioner's treatment, stating that his medical conditions are not work-related nor work-aggravated... Compared to the thorough medical findings of the company-designated physician which were supported by procedures conducted by specialists, the unsubstantiated medical certificate of petitioner's chosen physician fails to persuade the Court. ... The Court finds no substantial evidence to prove that petitioner's illnesses were caused by unhealthy diet while on board the vessel. ... Petitioner's chronic tonsillitis is not compensable as an 'infection resulting in complications necessitating repatriation' under Sec. 32-A of the POEA-SEC. ... In sum, for failure of petitioner to prove by substantial evidence that his illnesses are work-related or work-aggravated, his complaint for permanent total disability benefits should be dismissed.","WHEREFORE , the appeal by certiorari is DENIED .

"G.R. No. 205641, October 05, 2022","SUPERIOR GENERAL OF THE RELIGIOUS OF THE VIRGIN MARY (R.V.M.), PETITIONER , VS. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT .","The Religious of the Virgin Mary (RVM) is a religious congregation which is principally engaged in the education of Filipino youth in the Catholic faith. Prior to 1987, it was organized as a religious corporation aggregate; but it reorganized as a corporation sole with its Superior General as incorporator. On October 25, 1999, the RVM filed an application for registration of a 4,539-square meter parcel of land (Lot 3618, Cad. 434-D) located at Libertad Street, Taboc, Borongan, Eastern Samar. The application alleged that: 1) the RVM obtained the property through a series of sales and a donation from five individuals; 2) the land was occupied by St. Joseph's College; and 3) the RVM has been in open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession of the land under a bona fide claim of ownership for more than thirty (30) years. The Republic opposed the RVM's application on the grounds that RVM and its predecessors-in-interest have not been in open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession since June 12, 1945 or prior thereto, and that the parcel is part of the public domain and therefore not subject to private appropriation. On June 3, 2002, the trial court granted the RVM's application, finding that the RVM was able to prove ownership of the claimed parcel since 1946. The Republic filed an appeal. In a decision dated July 30, 2010, the CA granted the Republic's appeal and denied the RVM's application, ruling that the RVM failed to establish the provenance and the duration of the titles of its predecessors-in-interest and that the 1973 and 1987 Constitutions prohibit private corporations from acquiring lands of the public domain, thus RVM's possession cannot be counted for purposes of acquiring title.","ACCORDINGLY, the present petition is GRANTED. The July 30, 2010 Decision and the January 15, 2013 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 82917 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The case is remanded to the Court of Appeals, which is hereby DIRECTED to [follow instructions].","The Supreme Court held that applications for judicial confirmation of title are governed by the Property Registration Decree (PRD) and the Public Land Act (PLA), as recently amended by R.A. No. 11573, which applies retroactively and requires possession for at least twenty (20) years immediately preceding the filing of the application. The Court upheld the doctrine that the constitutional ban on corporate holding of alienable public domain lands applies to all private corporations, including religious corporations (aggregate or sole), as mandated by Article XII, Section 3 of the Constitution. The RVM's argument that its members' rights as Filipino citizens should prevail was rejected, as assuming the veil of corporate fiction subjects the entity to its legal effects. However, the Court noted that possession of public land of the required character and duration converts it into private land by operation of law. Since the RVM began possession of most portions of the land between 1946 and 1952, its own possession satisfied the twenty-year requirement before the 1973 constitutional ban took effect (January 17, 1973), except for the portion acquired on July 6, 1953. Because the CENRO certification provided by RVM was insufficient proof of the alienable and disposable status under R.A. No. 11573, and RVM should be given the chance to tack the possession of its predecessors-in-interest, the case must be remanded to the CA for reception of additional evidence.","The case is remanded to the Court of Appeals, which is hereby DIRECTED to: 1) Order a resurvey of the claimed parcel, denominated as Lot 3618, C-4, Cad. 434-D of the Borongan Cadastre, located in Barangay Taboc, Borongan, Eastern Samar, in accordance with this Decision; 2) Receive evidence on the following matters: a. The land classification status of the aforementioned parcel of land, in accordance with Section 7 of Republic Act No. 11573; and b. The nature, period and circumstances of the possession and occupation of the predecessors-in-interest of petitioner Superior General of the Religious of Virgin Mary, with respect to the corresponding portions of Lot 3618, C-4, Cad. 434-D of the Borongan Cadastre, located in Barangay Taboc, Borongan, Eastern Samar; and 3) Resolve the case thereafter, in accordance with this Decision."

In 2004, Dumlao, et al. entered into a Joint Venture Agreement with Burgundy Asset Development Corporation (Burgundy Asset), through its president Rogelio Serafica (Serafica)The agreement involved the development of the parcel of land into a residential and commercial condominium. Burgundy Asset committed to complete the project on or before November 11, 2009. However, Burgundy Asset failed to finish the project. Dumlao, et al. repeatedly demanded from Burgundy Asset the performance of its obligation but to no avail. In 2010, Burgundy Asset engaged the services of Atty. Yolando F. Lim (Atty. Lim) to handle the legal concerns involving the condominium project. On November 6, 2012, Dumlao, et al. demanded from Burgundy Asset to submit their concern to arbitration. In response, Atty. Lim recommended to hold off the arbitration and to exhaust all avenues of amicable settlement. On February 6, 2013, Burgundy Asset authorized Atty. Lim to negotiate with Dumlao, et al. or their lawyer Atty. George Cabebe (Atty. Cabebe). Atty. Lim then met with Dumlao, et al. where they verbally agreed to give Burgundy Asset sufficient time to complete the project and pay its obligations. On June 7, 2013, Dumlao, et al. and Burgundy Asset, through Serafica, entered into a compromise agreement. Dumlao, et al. gave Burgundy Asset until July 30, 2015 to finish the project. Burgundy Asset promised to pay liquidated damages to Dumlao, et al. on or before September 1, 2013. From July to December 2013, Dumlao, et al. sent billing letters to Burgundy Asset pursuant to their compromise agreement. In the Billing Letter dated November 4, 2013, Dumlao, et al. quoted Article III(2) of the compromise agreement regarding the commitment of Burgundy Asset to pay liquidated damages. On November 20, 2013, Atty. Lim apologized to Dumlao, et al. for the delay and disclosed a possible source of funds to cover Burgundy Asset's financial obligation. In February 2014, Atty. Lim requested for an extension of time to pay the.damages and to complete the project until May 2014. Yet, Burgundy Asset failed to perform its obligation and could no longer be contacted. In 2017, Dumlao, et.al. filed against Burgundy Asset a complaint for specific performance, sum of money, and damages with prayer for injunctive relief before the Regional Trial Court, Branch 49, Manila (RTC) docketed as Civil Case No. 17-138020. Burgundy Asset moved to dismiss the case on the ground of lack of jurisdiction for non-referral of the case to arbitration. On November 17, 2017, the RTC dismissed the complaint for prematurity and lack of cause of action. Meantime, Victoria filed a disbarment complaint against Atty. Lim before the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP). Victoria alleged that Atty. Lim made untruthful statement during the proceedings in Civil Case No. 17- 138020 when he denied knowledge of the Compromise Agreement dated June 7, 2013 between Dumlao, et al. and Burgundy Asset. The misrepresentation misled the RTC and gave Burgundy Asset more time to evade its obligations. On the other hand, Atty. Lim contended that the disbarment case is a retaliatory action for the dismissal of the complaint before the RTC. Atty. Lim insisted that he was unaware of the compromise agreement because he was not present when Serafica signed the settlement. Atty. Lim also explained that there was a misunderstanding and that he was referring to the oral settlement he negotiated with Dumlao, et al. when he testified in open court. Atty. Lim came to lmow of the existence of the Compromise Agreement dated June 7, 2013 only in 2017 when he received Dumlao, et al.'s complaint in Civil Case No. 17-138020.","On March 3, 2020, the IBP Commission on Bar Discipline found Atty. Lim guilty of violation of the Lawyer's Oath and Canons 1 and 10 of the Code of Professional Responsibility for making untruthful testimony in court proceedings. The Commission held that Atty. Lim cannot feign ignorance of the compromise agreement after he responded to Dumlao, et al.'s billing letter. Atty. Lim's theory that he was absent when Serafica signed the settlement is incompatible with the normal course of affairs where the corporate counsel assists the company president when signing official documents. The Commission recommended the penalty of two months suspension from the practice of law. On February 25, 2022, the IBP Board of Governors affirmed the Commission's recommendation.","The Court adopts the IBP's findings with modification as to the penalty. It is imperative that all lawyers live by the law. Any lawyer who engages in deceitful conduct deserves administrative sanctions. Specifically, the Lawyer's Oath mandates every member of the legal profession to 'do no falsehood, nor consent to doing of any in court.' Similarly, the Code of Professional Responsibility expects lawyers to observe candor and practice honesty when they appear and submit pleadings before the courts. Atty. Lim exhibited dishonesty in feigning ignorance of the Compromise Agreement dated June 7, 2013. Atty. Lim stood by his false statement not only in the related civil case but also throughout this administrative proceeding until he was caught in that sticky web of mendacity of his own making. Upon a second look at the circumstances of the case vis-a-vis the commensurate penalty imposed in parallel cases, this Court holds that a one-month suspension is sufficient, considering that this is Atty. Lim's first offense.","ACCORDINGLY, the Court AFFIRMS the Resolution dated February 25, 2022 of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines Board of Governors with MODIFICATION in that respondent Atty. Yolando F. Lim is SUSPENDED for one month from the practice of law effective upon-receipt of this Resolution, with a stem warning that' a repetition of the same or similar acts will be dealt with more severely. The respondent is DIRECTED to immediately file a Manifestation to the Court that his suspension_has started, copy furnished all courts and quasi-judicial bodies where he has entered his appearance as counsel. Let copies of this Resolution be furnished to the Office of the Bar Confidant to be appended to respondent's record as member of the Bar; the Integrated Bar of the Philippines for its information and guidance; and the Office of the Court Administrator for circulation to all courts of the country. After completing his one (1) month suspension, Atty. Yolando F. Lim shall file with the Office of the Bar Confidant a Sworn Statement pursuant to Section 45 of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 248049, October 04, 2022","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. EFREN AGAO Y AÑONUEVO, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","This appeal[1] arose from two Informations[2] dated October 27, 2014, which charged accused-appellant Efren Agao y Añonuevo (appellant) with two counts of statutory rape, under Article 266-A, paragraph 1 and Article 266-B of the Revisec. Penal Code (RPC) as amended by Republic Act No. (R.A.) 8353[3] in conjunction with R.A. 7610,[4] docketed as Criminal Case Nos. 1453-V-14 and 1454-V-14 lodged with Branch 172, Regional Trial Court of Valenzuela City (RTC). The accusatory portions of the Informations read: Crim. Case No. 1453-V-14 That sometime in July 2010, in Valenzuela [C]ity, Metro Manila, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, being the step-father of herein minor victim AAA,[5] who was then 10 years old, DOB: (December 6, 1999), by means of force and intimidation, did then and there [willfully], unlawfully and feloniously have sexual intercourse with said minor victim, against her will and without her consent, thereby subjecting the said victim to sexual abuse, which debased, degraded and demeaned her intrinsic [worth] and dignity as a human being. CONTRARY TO LAW. Crim. Case No. 1454-V-14 That sometime in January 2012, in Valenzuela City, Metro Manila and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, being the step-father of herein minor victim AAA, who was then 13 years old DOB: (December 6, 1999), by means of force and intimidation, did then and there [willfully], unlawfully and feloniously have sexual intercourse with the said minor victim, against her will and without her consent, thereby subjecting the said minor to sexual abuse, which debased, degraded and demeaned her intrinsic worth and dignity as a human being. CONTRARY TO LAW.[6] Upon arraignment, appellant pleaded not guilty.[7] During the trial, private complainant AAA recounted the protracted abuse she was subjected to, and positively identified appellant in open court as the man who repeatedly raped her.[8] The prosecution's collective evidence showed that AAA was born on December 6, 1999 to BBB[9] and CCC,[10] her mother and father, respectively. AAA's parents were not married,[11] and separated when she was still a baby. AAA added that her mother BBB later on lived with appellant, whom AAA identified as her stepfather.[12] AAA alleged that she first fell victim to appellant's abuse sometime in 2009, when she was 10 years old, during an incident when appellant started touching her private parts while he was bathing her.[13] AAA thereafter chose not to tell her mother because she was afraid the latter would not believe her.[14] AAA further testified that appellant first raped her in July 2010, at around 7:00 in the morning. During her direct examination, she recalled that while she was sleeping, she woke up to find appellant touching her breasts and vagina,[15] and later on trying to insert his penis into her vagina. AAA specifically testified that appellant undressed her and then mounted her.[16] She said that she both felt and saw appellant's penis hard against her, as the appellant kept trying[17] to insert it into her vagina, thereafter managing to introduce the same into the outer fold, also called the labia majora of AAA's vagina.[18] Appellant was allegedly unable to fully penetrate AAA's vagina because she kept fighting back.[19] She further testified that appellant continued to molest her, including another time in January 2012, when appellant raped her while she was sleeping. AAA testified that during the latter incident, she woke up to find appellant touching her breast and then, later, trying to insert his penis into her vagina.[20] She added that similar to the incident in 2010, appellant was also unable to fully penetrate her vagina as she also put up a fight.[21] Throughout all this time, despite the repeated assaults, she continued not to tell anyone, not even her own mother BBB, for fear that BBB would not believe her, and that she would only be humiliated. On cross-examination, it was further established that AAA chose not to tell anyone about appellant's abuse because she was afraid that appellant might harm her and BBB.[22] It was also shown that up until the beginning of appellant's chronic abuse of AAA, the latter did not harbor any ill feelings towards appellant.[23] Only after AAA and her mother BBB left appellant in June 2014, or over two years since the last assault on her took place, did AAA muster the courage to tell her aunt about the harrowing assaults she repeatedly experienced at the hands of appellant.[24] Her aunt, in turn, told her friend who was a police officer. When AAA told her father, CCC about it, the latter accompanied her to the police station, where she finally lodged a complaint against appellant.[25] Upon physical and genital examination on AAA by Police Chief Inspector Jocelyn P. Cruz (PCI Cruz), it was found that there was no evident injury at the time of examination.[26] PCI Cruz opined that an erect penis, if it merely touches the labia, would not cause hymenal laceration. She added that even if there was penetration, if the same happened sometime in July 2010 and January 2012, it was medically possible that there were injuries and lacerations sustained then, but the same may have already healed at the time of the physical examination.[27] In his defense, appellant denied the allegations levelled against him, and countered that he never molested AAA, but instead treated her like his own daughter.[28] He added that the allegations were triggered by CCC who signified that he wanted to get AAA, and that AAA was only coached by CCC into spinning false accusations against him.[29] Adding proof that the accusations were baseless and that AAA did not harbor any ill feelings against him, appellant testified that AAA even visited him several times during his detention, until she was taken by the City Social Welfare Development Office.[30]","In its Joint Decision dated March 15, 2017, the RTC found appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of two counts of Statutory Rape, sentenced him to suffer the penalty of imprisonment of reclusion perpetua for each count, and ordered him to pay AAA the amount of P50,000.00 as moral damages, P50,000.00 as civil indemnity, and P25,000.00 as exemplary damages, all subject to interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the finality of decision until full payment. The CA affirmed the RTC's conviction, but modified the award of damages. Particularly, the awards of moral damages, civil indemnity, and exemplary damages for each count were all increased to P75,000.00, with legal interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from finality of decision until full satisfaction.","The appeal is without merit. The Court finds, as correctly discerned by the lower courts, that the prosecution sufficiently established, through the primary and positive testimony of the wronged child herself, that appellant gained carnal knowledge of her, and is therefore guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape in the consummated stage. The Court also holds that the straightforward, candid and consistent testimony of AAA of the rape sufficiently established that appellant's erect penis did touch the labia of her vagina which, under prevailing jurisprudence, falls within the operative definition of consummated rape. The Court clarifies the physical threshold for consummated rape through penile penetration: rape of a female victim by a male person through penile penetration reaches the consummated stage as soon as the penis penetrates the cleft of the labia majora, also known as the vulval or pudendal cleft, or the fleshy outer lip of the vulva, in even the slightest degree. Simply put, mere introduction, however slight, into the cleft of the labia majora by a penis that is capable of penetration, regardless of whether such penile penetration is thereafter fully achieved, consummates the crime of rape. Application of this frame of analysis to the instant appeal finds that the lower courts correctly found herein appellant guilty of consummated rape, on both accounts, as AAA’s account in open court vividly described how appellant's erect penis succeeded to introduce itself on the vulval cleft of her vagina. The Court, however, finds that the CA erred in appreciating both incidents of rape as statutory. On the contrary, only the rape as charged under Criminal Case No. 1453-V-14 is statutory in nature (AAA aged 10), while the rape as charged under Criminal Case No. 1454-V-14 is simple rape (AAA aged 13).","WHEREFORE, the Court DISMISSES the appeal and ADOPTS with MODIFICATION the findings of fact of Branch 172, Regional Trial Court of Valenzuela City, as affirmed by the Court of Appeals in its Decision dated January 15, 2019 in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 09405, and AFFIRMS said Decision with MODIFICATION, and hereby finds appellant Efren Agao y Afionuevo GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of one (1) count of Statutory Rape in Criminal Case No. 1453-V-14, and one (1) count of Simple Rape in Criminal Case No. 1454-V-l 4 through sexual intercourse, for which he is sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua for each count. The Court further AFFIRMS the award of damages pursuant to prevailing jurisprudence."
"A.C. No. 13475 [Formerly CBD 16-5224], October 04, 2022","JUDY GABAWAN DELA CRUZ, RODOLF JOHN G. DELA CRUZ, AND RODOLF JAMES DELA CRUZ, COMPLAINANTS, VS. ATTY. GLEN ERIC PERALTA, RESPONDENT.","Complainants filed a criminal complaint for Reckless Imprudence Resulting in Homicide against one Lito Gitalan, Jr. (Gitalan) for the death of their loved one Rodolfo Dela Cruz. After trial on the merits, the court rendered a Judgment against Gitalan, finding him guilty as charged and ordering him to pay complainants damages in the amount of P213,750.00. After Gitalan successfully applied for probation, the said Judgment became final and executory on June 28, 2011. On October 2, 2014, complainants filed an omnibus motion, seeking the execution of the money judgment against Gitalan, among other things. During the hearing on October 10, 2014, respondent tendered payment in the amount of P100,000.00 in cash and the P30,000.00 cash bond posted by Gitalan. He also manifested that he would settle the balance of P83,750.00 within a period of one month. Subsequently, respondent approached the presiding judge and falsely claimed to the latter that he had already fully paid the damages awarded by the court to complainants. He presented the falsified acknowledgment receipt as proof. Upon learning of the matter, complainants raised the issue to the presiding judge. They denied receipt of payment and the issuance of the acknowledgment receipt. Gitalan testified that on June 20, 2012, he handed respondent a manager's check in the name of Rodolf James Dela Cruz, representing payment of the monetary judgment in complainants' favor. Respondent, in turn, gave Gitalan an acknowledgment receipt. The document was notarized by respondent and purportedly signed by Judy Gabawan Dela Cruz. Despite Gitalan's testimony, respondent vehemently denied the charges against him. He claimed that he never received any check from Gitalan, did not notarize the falsified acknowledgment receipt, and was only alerted of its existence when complainants filed the motion. He confronted his secretary, Era S. Vidal, who executed an Affidavit, where she admitted receiving the check from Gitalan, encashing the same, and then issuing the subject receipt. On January 22, 2015, respondent tendered the remainder of the monetary award to complainants. Nevertheless, complainants still filed the instant case for disbarment against respondent on December 5, 2016.","The Court adopts the findings of the Investigating Commissioner, as affirmed by the IBP Board of Governors. Furthermore, the Court sustains the IBP Board of Governor's recommendation of imposing the penalty of disbarment against respondent. Complainants substantially proved respondent's violations of his Lawyer's Oath and the CPR. In this case, the Court is fully convinced that substantial evidence exists to prove respondent's violation of his Lawyer's Oath and the CPR through deceit and gross misconduct.","The respondent egregiously violated Rule 1.01 of Canon 1, Rule 7.03 of Canon 7, Rule 10.01 of Canon 10, and Canon 11 of the CPR (Rule 1.01: A lawyer shall not engage in unlawful, dishonest, immoral or deceitful conduct. Rule 7.03: A lawyer shall not engage in conduct that adversely reflects on his [or her] fitness to practice law, nor shall he [or she] whether in public or private life, behave in a scandalous manner to the discredit of the legal profession. Rule 10.01: A lawyer shall not do any falsehood, nor consent to the doing of any in Court; nor shall he [or she] mislead or allow the Court to be misled by any artifice. Canon 11: A lawyer shall observe and maintain the respect due to the courts and to judicial officers and should insist on similar conduct by others). Furthermore, for the lies he so brazenly committed to his client, and by failing to properly account for the proceeds of the manager's check entrusted to him, respondent also transgressed Canons 15, 16, and 17 of the CPR (Canon 15: A lawyer shall observe candor, fairness, and loyalty in all his [or her] dealings and transactions within his [or her] clients. Canon 16: A lawyer shall hold in trust all moneys and properties of his [or her] client that may come into his [or her] possession. Canon 17: A lawyer owes fidelity to the case of his [or her] client and he [or she] shall be mindful of the trust and confidence reposed on him [or her]). Respondent also violated Rule 12.04, Canon 12 of the CPR (Rule 12.04: A lawyer shall not unduly delay a case, impede the execution of a judgment or misuse Court process). Finally, respondent violated his Lawyer's Oath to do no falsehood, nor consent to the doing of any in court, delay no man for money or malice, and conduct himself as a lawyer with all good fidelity, as well to the courts as to his client.","The Court finds respondent Atty. Glen Eric Peralta GUILTY of violating the Lawyer's Oath, and committing multiple violations of the Code of Professional Responsibility through his deceitful, unlawful, and grossly reprehensible conduct. Accordingly, he is hereby DISBARRED from the practice of law and his name is ordered STRICKEN from the Roll of Attorneys, effective immediately."
"A.C. No. 13453 (Formerly CBD Case No. 19-5956), October 04, 2022","JACKIYA A. LAO, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. BERTENI C. CAUSING, RESPONDENT.","In the complaint, Lao alleged that on January 18, 2019, Atty. Causing published in his Facebook account a draft and yet to be filed copy of his Complaint-Affidavit for Plunder,[2] accusing Lao and other persons of the crime of Plunder.[3] Atty. Causing allegedly resorted to the use of social media to make his sister, Lyndale Causing, one of the candidates for Representative of the 2nd District of South Cotabato, known to the public. Atty. Causing's publication in his Facebook account of such defamatory accusation of Plunder subjected Lao to public hate, contempt and ridicule. The publication besmirched Lao's good name and reputation in the eyes of Facebook users at the time that no such complaint was filed or pending before the Office of the Ombudsman.[4] Atty. Causing named and referred to Lao as the ""Chairperson of the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) of the DSWD Regional Office No. XII and the one that handled the bidding that ended up in the awarding of these food packs to Tacurong Fit Mart, Inc.,"" [5] which allegation, per Lao's submission in her complaint, is completely and absolutely wrong.[6] Atty. Causing allegedly repeated his false imputation against Lao and other individuals on January 31, 2019, when he again published his complaint-affidavit in his social media account.[7] On that occasion, he announced on social media that he already filed his complaint for Plunder before the Office of the Ombudsman. In her complaint, Lao insisted that Atty. Causing made false imputations against her in the final copy of the complaint-affidavit he filed before the Office of the Ombudsman.[8] In his Answer-Affidavit,[9] dated June 10, 2019, Atty. Causing did not deny that he is the author of the questioned Facebook posts. He admitted that his main basis in filing the Plunder case was the investigative reports from the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism (PCIJ). The fact that the instant complaint for Plunder is supported by evidence, as cited in his Answer-Affidavit, was already a sufficient justification to dismiss the administrative complaint. He submitted that the Facebook posts are an exercise of the freedom of the press and freedom of expression.[10]","After a judicious perusal of the records of the case, the Court adopts the findings of the IBP, but modifies the penalty to be imposed upon Atty. Causing. Lao charged Atty. Causing with violation of Rules 1.01 and 7.03 of the CPR, which provide: Rule 1.01 – A lawyer shall not engage in unlawful, dishonest, immoral or deceitful conduct. Rule 7.03 – A lawyer shall not engage in conduct that adversely reflects on his fitness to practice law, nor shall he whether in public or private life, behave in a scandalous manner to the discredit of the legal profession. As a rule, only substantial evidence is required to warrant disciplinary sanctions in administrative proceedings.[18] Substantial evidence is defined as that amount of relevant evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion.[19] In this case, both Commissioner Macatangay and the IBP Board of Governors found that Lao was able to establish her allegations through substantial evidence and that Atty. Causing had indeed violated the CPR. However, they diverged on the penalty to be imposed. Commissioner Macatangay imposed the penalty of suspension from the practice of law for a period of six (6) months, which was subsequently modified by the Board of Governors to the penalty of reprimand. In the Extended Resolution issued by the Commission of Bar Discipline, the Board of Governors ratiocinated that the penalty of reprimand was in order because the complaint for Plunder posted on Facebook by Atty. Causing was ultimately filed before the Office of the Ombudsman. Atty. Causing admitted in his Answer-Affidavit that he posted the complaint for Plunder on his Facebook account. In his defense, he invokes his rights to freedom of expression and of the press. However, We find that such defenses are untenable. Atty. Causing cannot justify his infractions by hiding behind the rights to freedom of the press and freedom of expression under the Constitution as such are not absolute. In Belo-Henares vs. Atty. Guevarra,[20] We ruled that: Time and again, it has been held that the freedom of speech and of expression, like all constitutional freedoms, is not absolute. While the freedom of expression and the right of speech and of the press are among the most zealously protected rights in the Constitution, every person exercising them, as the Civil Code stresses, is obliged to act with justice, give everyone his due, and observe honesty and good faith. As such, the constitutional right of freedom of expression may not be availed of to broadcast lies or half-truths, insult others, destroy their name or reputation or bring them into disrepute.[21] (Emphases supplied) As a member of the Bar, Atty. Causing ought to know that Facebook—or any other social medium, for that matter—is not the proper forum to air out his grievances, for a lawyer who uses extra-legal fora is a lawyer who weakens the rule of law. In this case, Atty. Causing knew that the proper forum for his complaint is the Office of the Ombudsman. Atty. Causing's posting of the complaint for Plunder on his Facebook account was motivated by the desire to damage the reputation of the respondents therein. In fact, it was posted precisely to elicit negative reactions, comments and public opinions against Lao and her fellow respondents. The fact that Atty. Causing subsequently filed the complaint for Plunder before the Office of the Ombudsman is of no moment as the damage to the reputation of therein respondents had already been done. The documentary evidence presented by Lao, which consists of screenshots of Atty. Causing's post,[22] show that she was subjected to public hate, contempt and ridicule, as several people have commented on the said post. The respondents in the complaint for Plunder, including Lao, were called several names including ""nangungurakot"" and ""corrupt na official.""[23] Based on the foregoing, Atty. Causing also violated Rule 8.01 of the CPR when he accused Lao and the other respondents of stealing around P226 Million intended for evacuees.[24] Rule 8.01 provides: Rule 8.01 — A lawyer shall not, in his professional dealings, use language which is abusive, offensive or otherwise improper. In addition, the Lawyer's Oath provides that— I, do solemnly swear that I will maintain allegiance to the Republic of the Philippines, I will support the Constitution and obey the laws as well as the legal orders of the duly constituted authorities therein; I will do no falsehood, nor consent to the doing of any in court; I will not wittingly or willingly promote or sue any groundless, false or unlawful suit, or give aid nor consent to the same; I will delay no man for money or malice, and will conduct myself as a lawyer according to the best of my knowledge and discretion, with all good fidelity as well to the courts as to my clients; and I impose upon myself these voluntary obligations without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion. So help me God. Such oath mandates lawyers to conduct themselves in a manner which would keep the integrity of the legal profession intact. In Ong vs. Atty. Unto,[25] the Court enjoined lawyers to conduct themselves in a manner that would promote public confidence in the legal profession, to wit: The ethics of the legal profession rightly enjoin lawyers to act with the highest standards of truthfulness, fair play and nobility in the course of his practice of law. A lawyer may be disciplined or suspended for any misconduct, whether in his professional or private capacity. Public confidence in law and lawyers may be eroded by the irresponsible and improper conduct of a member of the Bar. Thus, every lawyer should act and comport himself in such a manner that would promote public confidence in the integrity of the legal profession.[26] Lastly, We note that this is not the first time that Atty. Causing has been sanctioned by the Court. In Velasco vs. Atty. Causing,[27] the Supreme Court en banc, voting unanimously, suspended Atty. Causing from the practice of law for a period of one (1) year for violating the confidentiality of an ongoing family court proceeding. The relevant portions of the decision are quoted below: The records show that Atty. Causing had already admitted that he indeed published the subject post with photographs of complainant's petition in the nullity case in Facebook and thereafter sent a link of the post to complainant's son. In his defense, Atty. Causing invokes his rights to freedom of expression and of the press and argues that he was merely acting as a ""spokesman-lawyer"" and a ""journalist-blogger"" when he published the subject post. The defense, however, is untenable. First, a lawyer is not allowed to divide his personality as an attorney at one time and a mere citizen at another. Regardless of whether a lawyer is representing his client in court, acting as a supposed spokesperson outside of it, or is merely practicing his right to press freedom as a ""journalist-blogger,"" his duties to the society and his ethical obligations as a member of the bar remain unchanged. x x x x In addition, Atty. Causing likewise violated Rule 8.01 of the CPR when he used the words ""polygamous,"" ""criminal,"" ""dishonest,"" ""arrogance,"" ""disgusting,"" and ""cheater"" in the subject post and in his pleadings in direct reference to complainant. Indeed, a lawyer's language, though forceful and emphatic, must always be dignified and respectful, befitting the dignity of the legal profession. ""The use of intemperate language and unkind ascriptions has no place in the dignity of judicial forum. Language abounds with countless possibilities for one to be emphatic but respectful, convincing but not derogatory, and illuminating but not offensive."" Though it is true that Atty. Causing is, by all means, given the liberty to defend his client's cause with utmost zeal, this is not without reasonable limitations. In this case, it appears that Atty. Causing's post in Facebook was so designed to elicit, at the very least, a negative public opinion against complainant. Such act, however, is proscribed under Rule 19.01 of the CPR which, among others, mandates lawyers to ""employ only fair and honest means to attain the lawful objectives of his client."" And second, it is settled that the freedom of speech, of expression, and of the press, like all constitutional freedoms, are not absolute.[28] The aforesaid case and the case at hand show that Atty. Causing has the propensity to divulge sensitive information in online platforms, such as Facebook, to the detriment of the people involved in the said cases. Thus, considering that Atty. Causing was already suspended for one (1) year with a stern warning that a repetition of the same or similar acts will be dealt with more severely, We believe that the appropriate penalty to be imposed herein is the ultimate penalty of disbarment. In Francisco vs. Atty. Real,[29] We did not hesitate to impose the penalty of disbarment when the guilty party has become a repeat offender, to wit: In imposing the appropriate penalty in administrative cases, it is the duty of the Court to exercise its sound judicial discretion based on the surrounding facts of the case. Well-settled is the rule in our jurisdiction that disbarment ought to be meted out only in clear cases of misconduct that seriously affect the standing and character of the lawyer as an officer of the court and that the Court will not disbar a lawyer where a lesser penalty will suffice to accomplish the desired end. The Court, however, does not hesitate to impose the penalty of disbarment when the guilty party has become a repeat offender. ... Here, the Court takes note of the fact that Atty. Causing had just recently served his one-year suspension pursuant to the ruling in the Velasco case, which was promulgated on March 2, 2021. We likewise note that the acts complained of therein occurred in April 2016 and the corresponding disbarment complaint was filed thereafter. The filing of the disbarment complaint against Atty. Causing in the Velasco case should have served as a deterrent. However, it appears that the same had no effect. Thus, the penalty of disbarment is warranted.","WHEREFORE, the Court finds Atty. Berteni C. Causing GUILTY of violating the Lawyer's Oath and the Code of Professional Responsibility. He is hereby DISBARRED from the practice of law.

On January 28, 2010, Memorandum Referral No. 031-0006-10 was issued, reassigning the July 2009 LOA to RO Cecille D. Dy (RO Dy) under GS Jessica O. Bernales, with notice to Robiegie. Said LOA, together with the First Notice for Presentation of Books of Accounts and other accounting records, was served upon and duly received by Robiegie at its business address. On August 18, 2011, Regional Director Alfredo V. Misajon of the BIR Revenue Region No. 6-Manila issued a Preliminary Assessment Notice (PAN) to Robiegie, to inform the latter of the findings of the investigation conducted by RO Dy pursuant to the July 2009 LOA. On September 19, 2011, the BIR Revenue Region No. 6-Manila issued a Formal Letter of Demand (FLD) and Final Assessment Notices (FANs), assessing Robiegie with a total tax deficiency of P10,804,991.21 for the taxable year 2008, comprised of the following amounts: P315,680.28 in deficiency income tax; P10,397,181.78 in deficiency value added tax (VAT); P20,129.15 in deficiency expanded withholding tax (EWT); and P72,000.00 as compromise penalty. On June 23, 2017, after failing to find any leviable or garnishable property of Robiegie, the Republic, through the BIR, filed a complaint before the CTA to collect the claimed deficiency taxes.","The CTA en banc affirmed the ruling of its Second Division and upheld the necessity of an LOA in order for an RO to conduct a valid investigation into taxpayer accounts. Memorandum Referral No. 031-0006-10 is invalid, as it was not issued and signed by a BIR official empowered by law or regulation to issue LOAs or to authorize taxpayer examinations.","The power of a BIR revenue officer to conduct taxpayer investigations flows from a validly issued LOA, which is the statutorily defined modality for the delegation of the investigatory powers vested in the CIR by law. Thus, the reassignment of a taxpayer investigation to a different revenue officer must also be made pursuant to a LOA, the one­LOA-per-taxpayer rule notwithstanding. When a taxpayer investigation is transferred from one revenue officer to another, the responsible BIR official with authority to issue LOAs shall issue a new LOA to the new revenue officer assigned to the investigation. The old LOA in favor of the reassigned revenue officer shall be deemed cancelled, and the new LOA issued to the subsequently designated revenue officer shall prevail, in accordance with the provisions of RMO No. 8-2006, issued on February 1, 2006.","WHEREFORE, the present petition is DENIED. The December 2, 2021 Decision and the April 8, 2022 Resolution of the Court of Tax Appeals in CTA EB No. 2339 (CTA OC No. 023) are hereby AFFIRMED."
"G.R. No. 212971, November 29, 2022","REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, PETITIONER, VS. JOHN ARNEL H. AMATA, RESPONDENT.","John Arnel H. Amata (respondent) and Haydee N. Amata (Haydee) met at the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila, and eventually became sweethearts. They decided to get married and blessed with three children.[4] The marriage was blissful at the incipient but eventually turned sour. Respondent complained that Haydee was too direct, outspoken, and domineering. Their sexual relationship was no longer satisfying because Haydee always wants it quick and as if devoid of feelings. The couple talked about it and Haydee purportedly promised to improve her attitude. But not more than two months have passed, Haydee reverted to her previous behavior.[5] Sometime in 2003, respondent attended a workshop in Iloilo City and developed a liking for a lady friend who lived there. His feelings was not reciprocated but they still remained as friends. When Haydee discovered the supposed affair, she became suspicious of respondent and started to secretly check his cellular phone. Feeling betrayed and angry about his spouse's action, respondent packed his things, left their abode, and stayed in a hotel. Because of this, Haydee accused respondent of cohabiting with his mistress.[6] Respondent eventually returned home. However, their relationship continued to deteriorate. Forcing respondent to leave the house again to spare their children from witnessing their fights.[7] Respondent consulted a clinical psychologist, Dr. Elena A. Del Rosario (Dr. Del Rosario) and instituted the instant petition for declaration of nullity of marriage on October 13, 2008 on the ground of psychological incapacity.[8] The psychological and marital evaluation conducted on respondent shows that he is suffering from a Passive-Aggressive Personality Disorder.[9] Dr. Del Rosario observed that he manifested the following behavior: (1) Covert obstructionism and stubborn behavior as he is predisposed to go ahead on with his plans and desires to be unconventional with [his] ways so that he is also highly impulsive when it comes to decision-making; (2) Complains of being misunderstood or unappreciated as he is always dissatisfied and disappointed with his wife's lack of concern for him as well as her domineering ways and empty promises that she is going to change for the better; (3) Complains of personal misfortunes as he has a lot of misgivings and sentiments about the unsuccessful outcome of his marriage mainly because of his abusive and domineering wife; and (4) Needs another source of care and support as he courted another woman when he was already too frustrated with his wife although said woman rejected him.[10] Dr. Del Rosario categorized the personality disorder of respondent as serious, permanent, incurable, and interferes with his ability to comply with marital obligations. She also noted that the personality disorder predates the marriage and only became apparent after. Dr. Del Rosario thus recommended that the couple's marriage be annulled.[11] In her Answer,[12] Haydee prayed for the denial of the petition claiming that it failed to specifically allege complete facts exhibiting the incapacity of either or both parties from complying with the essential obligations of marriage and such incapacity existed from the time of the celebration of the marriage and manifested only after its celebration.[13] Haydee posited that she is open to reconciliation because she still loves respondent and remained committed to their marriage.[14]","The appeal has merit. The Supreme Court found the evidence presented before the lower court insufficient to prove respondent's supposed psychological incapacity. The trial court's complete reliance on the Judicial Affidavit of the respondent and the psychological examination conducted by Dr. Del Rosario on him was not enough to hurdle the burden of proof required in the dissolution and declaration of nullity of a marriage. The totality of evidence, including respondent's own testimony that the couple had a normal relationship during courtship, as boyfriend-girlfriend, and even during the first 7 years of their 13-year marriage, negates any manifestation that respondent was indeed afflicted with psychological disorder that is so grave, permanent, incurable, and existed at the inception of the marriage which incapacitated him to perform his matrimonial duties and obligations. The evidence only reveals that respondent's refusal to cohabit with Haydee was because the marriage has become unsatisfactory. The Court held that there was no sufficient and convincing evidence to prove the alleged psychological incapacity of the respondent.","WHEREFORE, the Petition is GRANTED. The challenged May 29, 2014 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 98297 is REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The Petition for declaration of nullity of marriage is DISMISSED for lack of merit. SO ORDERED.",The Petition for declaration of nullity of marriage is DISMISSED for lack of merit.
"OCA IPI No. 20-5005-P, November 29, 2022","JOEL AGULTO SAGUM, COMPLAINANT, VS. JONELL C. CASTILLO,* CLERK, (LOCALLY FUNDED EMPLOYEE), BRANCH 89, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, BACOOR CITY, CAVITE, RESPONDENT.","Complainant Joel A. Sagum (Sagum), driver/assistant of Mary Ann B. Ramos-Castro (Castro), averred that sometime in June 2019, respondent Jonell C. Castillo (Castillo) invited Castro and him to join Castillo in one of the rooms. Sagum heard Castillo saying, ""Wag kang mag-alala, ako na ang bahala diyan. Mahahatulan na iyan."" He witnessed Castro handing money to Castillo as they stepped out of the room. Another incident occurred in July 2019 wherein Castillo told him, ""Nasan 'yung para sa akin? Paano 'yung pang-ayos natin sa mga piskal[?]"". Castillo, in his Kontra Salaysay, claimed that the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) had no jurisdiction over the complaint because he was a casual messenger of the local government unit of Bacoor City, and not an office clerk of the Regional Trial Court. He vehemently denied the allegations. The Judiciary Integrity Board (JIB) dismissed the complaint based on its assessment that it lacks jurisdiction over the person of Castillo, noting confirmation that Castillo had no approved detail order and was not an employee of the Judiciary.","The Court adopted the recommendation of the Judiciary Integrity Board (JIB) with modifications. The certifications clearly proved that Castillo is not an employee of the Judiciary particularly of the Bacoor City Regional Trial Court. Thus, the JIB correctly recommended the dismissal of the Complaint, as the Court lacked jurisdiction to discipline Castillo administratively under Rule III, Section 1 of the Internal Rules of the Judiciary Integrity Board.","Even if the Court had no jurisdiction to discipline the alleged infractions committed by Castillo, the Court deemed it proper to refer the investigation to the officials of the local government unit of Bacoor City. Further, this Court ordered the commencement of contempt proceedings against Castillo and a determination of being barred from future employment in the Judiciary, because Castillo's act of expressly giving representations of being able to influence a judge reflected on the manner of administering justice and could erode public confidence, despite him not being a court employee.","The Report and Recommendation of the Judicial Integrity Board dated April 20, 2022 is ADOPTED WITH MODIFICATIONS. This Court resolves to ADOPT and APPROVE the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations of the Acting Executive Director in its Report and Recommendation dated February 2, 2022, which the Judicial Integrity Board likewise adopted and approved. The administrative complaint against Jonell C. Castillo, also known as Jenel C. Castillo, is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction over the person of the respondent. Further, this Court ORDERS the Presiding Judge of Branch 89, Regional Trial Court, Bacoor City to REFER the administrative complaint filed by Joel Agulto Sagum to the proper office in the local government unit of Bacoor City. Furthermore, this Court COMMANDS the Presiding Judge of the Regional Trial Court Bacoor City to COMMENCE contempt proceedings or a determination of being barred from future employment in the Judiciary against Jenel C.

MANGUERRA, MAMERTO LUIS E. MANGUERRA, JUAN PAOLO E. MANGUERRA, AND GREGORIO CONSTANTINO E. MANGUERRA, RESPONDENTS.","On January 27, 2003, petitioner filed a Petition[6] for the probate of the Last Will and Testament[7] of decedent Concepcion A. Cuenco Vda. De Manguerra (decedent) before the RTC of Makati City, docketed as SP Proc. No. M-5599, where she prayed for the allowance of the decedent's will and for her appointment as executor[8] of the estate. In the will, the decedent expressly designated petitioner as the executor of her estate,[9] and disinherited all but one of her grandchildren from her late son, Mariano Jesus Manguerra, Jr. – the respondents, except Gregorio – from receiving any share of her estate.[10] The will likewise specified to whom the properties of the estate are to be bequeathed, thus: SEVENTH – To GREGORIO CONSTANTINO E. MANGUERRA, the remaining grandchild I have with my late son MARIANO JESUS C. MANGUERRA, JR., I give and bequeath, for him to have and to hold, the following: 7.1 Lot No. 903-A-6 of the Banilad Estate under TCT No. 113781 of the Registry of Deeds of Cebu City, 894 square meters, situated behind Redemptorist and Capital Parish Church, Cebu City x x x. 7.2 Cash in an amount equivalent to the balance of his legitime after deducting therefrom the prevailing market value at the time of my death of above property and the cash advances I made to his late father.

MANGUERRA.[11] On April 15, 2003, the RTC issued an Order,[12] which allowed the decedent's will, ordered the issuance of letters testamentary to petitioner, but invalidated the disinheritance provision contained in the will, to wit: WHEREFORE, finding that the subject Last Will and Testament was duly executed by the testatrix Concepcion A. Cuenco Vda. de Manguerra in accordance with the requirements and formalities prescribed by law, the petition is hereby granted. Accordingly, the said will is hereby declared duly proved and, consequently, hereby allowed. Likewise, finding the cause for disinheritance under the Sixth Clause of the Last Will and Testam[e]nt not to be one of those set forth in Article 918 of the Civil Code, the disinheritance is hereby deemed invalid, and therefore, oppositors Ma. Concepcion E. Manguerra-Aberasturi, et al[.] shall be entitled to their legitime as compulsory heirs in representation of their father Mariano Jesus C. Manguerra, Jr[.], who predeceased the testatrix. Accordingly, let letters testamentary be issued to Ana Maria C. Manguerra, who is named executrix in the will, to administer the estate of decedent Concepcion A. Cuenca Vda. de Manguerra, to serve without bond. However, her authority to sell or dispose of any property of said decedent shall only be for purposes of paying the taxes and debts due to creditors of the estate of the decedent, pending final disposition by this Court of the shares due the compulsory heirs and/or upon approval by this Court. SO ORDERED.[13] Petitioner filed a motion for partial reconsideration where she argued that the invalidation of the disinheritance provision was premature. Thereafter, the RTC issued its Order[14] dated July 16, 2003, which granted petitioner's motion and ruled that resolving the issue of disinheritance is premature as it pertains to the intrinsic validity of the will, to wit: In this case, inasmuch as the issue of disinheritance raised by oppositors-grandchildren in their opposition to the petition for probate of the will, pertains to the intrinsic validity or legality of the provisions thereon in the will, a determination of the same as passed upon in the Order allowing the Will is indeed premature. Thus, the Last Will and Testament of the decedent Dna. Concepcion A. Cuenco Vda. de Manguerra having been proved and allowed in the Order dated April 15, 2003, the determination of the validity of the disinheritance can now be ventilated in further proceedings. Wherefore, petitioner's motion (for partial reconsideration) is hereby granted. x x x[15] On February 15, 2005, petitioner filed a Motion,[16] praying for the distribution of the properties of the estate to the named devisees and legatees in the will.[17] After several years of litigation, the RTC finally rendered its Resolution[18] (Partial Distribution Order) dated October 21, 2013, which directed the partial distribution of the decedent's estate. Specifically, the Partial Distribution Order directed the distribution of the: (1) lots and shareholdings bequeathed in favor of petitioner; (2) the shareholdings bequeathed in favor of Melissa Montilla Gonzalez; and (3) the shareholdings bequeathed in favor of Monika Montilla Tawngdee.[19] In the Partial Distribution Order, the RTC also noted that the properties bequeathed in favor of Gregorio have not yet been accepted by him. The RTC thus directed him to submit within five days a Manifestation of his acceptance or rejection of the same.[20] Respondents filed a Motion for Reconsideration[21] of the Partial Distribution Order, but the same was denied by the RTC in its Order[22] dated February 13, 2014. Aggrieved, respondents filed their Notice of Appeal[23] and Record on Appeal[24] both dated April 2, 2014, challenging the Partial Distribution Order. On June 2, 2014, the RTC rendered its Order,[25] which approved the record on appeal and directed the submission of the records to the CA, thus: There being no objection to the Record on Appeal filed by the oppositors last 2 April 2014, and pursuant to Section 6, Rule 41 of the Rules of Court, said Record on Appeal is hereby APPROVED. The Branch Clerk of this Court is hereby directed to send the record on appeal to the Honorable Court of Appeals for appropriate disposition. SO ORDERED.[26] Notably, while the appeal of the Partial Distribution Order was pending, petitioner filed a Motion for Final Distribution of Remainder of the Estate[27] dated July 28, 2014, which was not opposed by the respondents despite ample opportunity to do so.[28] On September 17, 2014, the RTC rendered its Resolution[29] (Final Distribution Order), which granted petitioner's motion, to wit: For resolution is petitioner-Administratrix's Motion for Final Distribution of Remainder of the Estate filed on 30 July 2014. There being no Comment filed by Oppositors, despite having been given ample opportunity to do so, and that up to the present, there is no compliance on the part of Gregorio Constantino Manguerra or his heirs pursuant to the Order dated 21 October 2013, the present motion is hereby ordered GRANTED. The Court hereby DISTRIBUTES the following properties, by way of completion of the provisions set out in the Will of Testratrix Concepcion Cuenco Vda. De Manguerra, x x x.[30] (Underscoring supplied; emphases and italics in the original) In the Final Distribution Order, the RTC directed the distribution of all remaining assets in the decedent's estate, thereby completing all the provisions set out in the will. The Final Distribution Order likewise ordered that the property bequeathed to Gregorio be reverted back to the estate and distributed in favor of the petitioner, in view of Gregorio's failure to comply with the RTC's directive, which ordered him to manifest his acceptance or rejection of the same.[31] On September 30, 2014, respondents filed a Motion to Inhibit,[32] which was granted by the RTC. After the re-raffle of the case, respondents filed a Motion for Reconsideration[33] dated October 10, 2014. However, the said motion was denied by the RTC in its Order[34] dated September 7, 2015. Respondents received the RTC Order denying their motion for reconsideration on September 22, 2015. Thereafter, on October 21, 2015 or 29 days after their receipt of the order of the RTC, respondents filed their Notice of Appeal[35] with attached Record on Appeal,[36] challenging the Final Distribution Order. On April 5, 2017, the RTC issued its Order,[37] which disapproved respondents' record on appeal for being filed out of time, to wit: Upon careful evaluation of the record on appeal and the arguments of the parties, the Court is inclined to disapprove the record on appeal filed by Oppositors Manguerra-[Aberasturi], et al. Petitioner is correct that this case has already been finally disposed of and the proper remedy is an ordinary appeal. Considering that Oppositors Manguerra-[Aberasturi], et al., received the assailed Order dated 07 September 2015 on 22 September 2015, they had fifteen (15) days from said date to file a notice of appeal. However, no notice of appeal was filed within the period and instead a record on appeal was submitted on 21 October 2015. Clearly, the period to file an ordinary appeal has prescribed. The Court also notes the fact that Oppositors Manguerra-[Aberasturi], et al., are trying to raise the same issues in the previous record on appeal they have made. Accordingly, in view of the foregoing, the Notice of Appeal and Record on Appeal dated 21 October 2015 filed by Oppositors Manguerra­ [Aberasturi], et al. is hereby DISAPPROVED. SO ORDERED.[38] (Emphases and italics in the original) Respondents filed a motion for reconsideration, but the same was denied by the RTC in its Order[39] dated June 16, 2017. Significantly, in the same order, the RTC also granted petitioner's Motion for Issuance of Entry of Judgment,[40] to wit: It is significant to note, that while a multiple appeal is allowed on this kind of petition, the proceedings must end at some point. The Resolution dated 17 September 2014 involves the final distribution of the remainder of the Estate which ultimately disposes of the principal and core issue in this petition. Accordingly, let the Resolution dated 17 September 2014 and the Order dated 07 September 2015 be entered in the Book of Entries of Judgment.[41] (Italics in the original)",The Petition has no merit.,"At the outset, it must be emphasized that in special proceedings, multiple appeals are allowed. As explained in Aranas v. Mercado,[55] multiple appeals are allowed in special proceedings because material issues of the case may be determined at various stages thereof, thus: Multiple appeals are permitted in special proceedings as a practical recognition of the possibility that material issues may be finally determined at various stages of the special proceedings. x x x[56] (Emphasis supplied) Relatedly, Section 2(a), Rule 41 of the Rules of Court[57] provides that the proper mode of appealing judgments or final orders in special proceedings is by notice of appeal and record on appeal, thus: Section 2. Modes of appeal. – (a) Ordinary appeal. – The appeal to the Court of Appeals in cases decided by the Regional Trial Court in the exercise of its original jurisdiction shall be taken by filing a notice of appeal with the court which rendered the judgment or final order appealed from and serving a copy thereof upon the adverse party. No record on appeal shall be required except in special proceedings and other cases of multiple or separate appeals where the law or these Rules so require. In such cases, the record on appeal shall be filed and served in like manner. (Emphasis supplied) The purpose of requiring a record on appeal in cases where multiple appeals are allowed has been extensively discussed by the Court in Spouses Lebin v. Mirasol,[58] thus: As the foregoing rules further indicate, a judgment or final order in special proceedings is appealed by record on appeal. A judgment or final order determining and terminating a particular part is usually appealable, because it completely disposes of a particular matter in the proceeding, unless otherwise declared by the Rules of Court. The ostensible reason for requiring a record on appeal instead of only a notice of appeal is the multi-part nature of nearly all special proceedings, with each part susceptible of being finally determined and terminated independently of the other parts. An appeal by notice of appeal is a mode that envisions the elevation of the original records to the appellate court as to thereby obstruct the trial court in its further proceedings regarding the other parts of the case. In contrast, the record on appeal enables the trial court to continue with the rest of the case because the original records remain with the trial court even as it affords to the appellate court the full opportunity to review and decide the appealed matter.[59] (Emphasis supplied; citation omitted) From the foregoing, it is clear that the purpose of a record on appeal is to allow the lower court to continue with the rest of the case considering that the records, which do not pertain to the matter being appealed, remains with the lower court. This also allows the appellate court the full opportunity to review the records, and to resolve the appealed matter without hindrance. In this case, the RTC, in its Order dated April 5, 2017, stated that the case has been fully disposed of, and thus, the proper remedy is filing a notice of appeal. Indeed, the ratiocination behind such ruling appears to be sound because when the case is fully disposed of and resolved by the lower court, it seems that there is no need for a record on appeal because the lower court has nothing left to do and such record on appeal would serve no purpose. In fact, in Republic v. Nishina[60] (Nishina), the Court stated that 'the filing of a record on appeal was not necessary since no other matter remained to be heard and determined by the trial court x x x.'[61] Nevertheless, Nishina is not squarely applicable in this case because Nishina involves a petition for cancellation of birth records and change of name, and not a matter covered by Section 1, Rule 109 of the Rules of Court where multiple appeals are allowed. More compellingly, the current Rules do not specify that a record on appeal is only required when the whole case is not yet fully disposed of. In other words, while it is possible that there would be no need for a record on appeal when the case is fully disposed of, the requirements under the Rules of Court, specifically Section 2(a), Rule 41, still stand. Thus, in special proceedings, and in other cases of multiple and separate appeals, a record on appeal must be filed together with a notice of appeal. In Brual v. Contreras,[62] the Court declared that both a notice of appeal and a record on appeal are required in appealing final orders in special proceedings: Thus, the rules are clear. While it is not necessary that a notice of appeal and a record on appeal be filed simultaneously, the rule is unequivocal that the notice of appeal and record of appeal shall be filed within 30 days from notice of the judgment or final order. Here, considering that the respondents intended to appeal the final order of the denial of their motion for intervention in the special proceedings case, they should have filed both a notice of appeal and a record on appeal within the period prescribed by the rules. x x x x There is ample jurisprudence holding that both a notice of appeal and a record on appeal are required for appealing final orders in a special proceeding case. Here, respondents' long delayed filing of the record on appeal without any justifiable reason clearly violated the settled rules thereon.[63] (Underscoring supplied; emphasis in the original; citation omitted) Given all the foregoing, the respondents should not be faulted for relying on the express provisions of the Rules. To reiterate, Section 3, Rule 41 of the Rules of Court states, in no uncertain terms, that when a record on appeal is required, the same shall be filed within 30 days from notice of the judgment or final order being appealed. Thus, the CA correctly ordered the RTC to approve respondents' notice of appeal and record on appeal because respondents satisfied all the requirements under the Rules. On another note, a review of the records of the case reveals that the RTC's conclusion – that the case is fully disposed of – is doubtful. To recall, respondents' appeal of the Partial Distribution Order was still pending when the RTC issued the Final Distribution Order. Likewise, despite the issuance of the Final Distribution Order, respondents still had several remedies to enforce their shares in the estate. Indubitably, it cannot be said that there was nothing left to be done on the part of the RTC. Simply put, a record on appeal was certainly required to challenge the Final Distribution Order. All in all, the Court finds that the CA unerringly reversed the RTC's Order dated April 5, 2017, which disapproved respondents' notice of appeal and record on appeal because respondents aptly observed the proper procedure when they timely filed their notice of appeal and record on appeal.","the Petition for Review on Certiorari dated September 30, 2020 filed by Ana Maria C.

S-68301, S-68302, and S-68303 were issued in the name of Bellever Brothers, Inc. (BBI). Later, BBI contracted a loan in the total amount of P2,500,00.00 from Manotoc Securities Inc. (MSI), and mortgaged the subject three lots. On June 12, 1978, Dolores filed a complaint, docketed as Civil Case No. 29782, before the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Pasig, Branch 19, against BBI and MSI to rescind and/or declare the nullity of the sale of the subject three lots, and to cancel BBI's titles over them. On June 13, 1978, Dolores caused the annotation of a Notice of Lis Pendens on TCT Nos. S-68301, S-68302, and S-68303. During the pendency of Civil Case No. 29782, Dolores died and was substituted by her daughter, Carmen Egido (Carmen). Carmen later assigned all her rights over the subject three lots in favor of petitioner Florencia H. Duenas (Florencia).

They also filed a Complaint, docketed as Civil Case No. 92-2831, before the RTC of Makati City, Branch 61 to declare the nullity of Bernal's titles. Bernal subsequently executed an Absolute Deed of Sale dated April 23, 1993 in favor of respondent AF Realty Development, Inc. (AFRDI), leading to the issuance of TCT Nos. 185022, 185023, and 185024 in the name of AFRDI on April 28, 1993. On February 22, 1994, the spouses Duenas filed the herein Complaint before the RTC of Makati City, Branch 60, docketed as Civil Case No. 94-751, to declare the nullity of AFRDI's titles. On February 23, 1994, the spouses Duenas caused the annotation of a Notice of Lis Pendens under Entry No. 81678 on TCT Nos. 185022, 185023, and 185024 in the name of AFRDI. However, on January 31, 1994, AFRDI sold the subject three lots to respondent Metropolitan Bank & Trust Co. (MBTC) by virtue of an Absolute Deed of Sale. TCT Nos. 195231, 195232, and 195233 were issued in the name of MBTC on June 15, 1994. MBTC claimed to be a purchaser in good faith, arguing the titles were clean at the time of sale on January 31, 1994, prior to the February 23, 1994 annotation of Lis Pendens. The RTC (Branch 61) in Civil Case No. 92-2831 eventually declared Bernal's titles null and void. The RTC (Branch 60) in Civil Case No. 94-751 found fraud but held that MBTC was an innocent purchaser, requiring petitioners to seek indemnity from the fraudulent parties.","Challenged in this petition is the March 15, 2013 Decision and October 8, 2013 Resolution of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 77595, which affirmed in toto the January 15, 2002 Decision and the April 23, 2002 Order of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Makati City, Branch 60, in Civil Case No. 94-751. The CA found MBTC to be a purchaser in good faith. It ruled that even a forged or fraudulent document may become the root of a valid title, if the property has already been transferred from the name of the owner to that of the forger. Thus, a person who deals with a registered property in good faith will acquire a good title from a forger and be absolutely protected by a Torrens title. ... The CA held that during MBTC and AFRDI's negotiation, and the former's eventual purchase of the subject lots on January 31, 1994, the titles over the three lots were clean. ... The CA concluded that MBTC had no knowledge of any circumstance that would engender any doubt on the validity of the seller's title or any defect that would necessitate further investigation or inquiry as to its authenticity. ... The CA ruled that the subsequent annotation of the Notice of Lis Pendens cannot defeat MBTC's status as a buyer in good faith and for value.","After a careful reexamination of our land registration laws and jurisprudence, We agree with petitioners. The Court now holds that buyers of registered land must be continuing purchasers for value and in good faith until the registration of the conveyance. In the event a buyer of registered land who has yet to register the conveyance is made aware of any claim or interest of some other person in the property, or of any defect or restriction in the title of the seller or in his or her capacity to convey title, the buyer shall no longer be considered to be in good faith even if he or she subsequently registers the conveyance. It is only upon registration of the conveyance in good faith will the purchaser acquire such rights and interest as they appear in the certificate of title, unaffected by any prior lien or encumbrance not noted therein. ... In fine, AFRDI and MBTC may not be considered an innocent purchaser for value and in good faith. Consequently, MBTC cannot claim ownership over the subject property as against petitioners. ... Since MBTC registered the deed of absolute sale dated January 31, 1994 with knowledge of the pendency of Civil Case No. 94-751 as per Notice of Lis Pendens dated February 23, 1994 involving the nullification of AFRDI's titles, MBTC merely holds or possesses the 60% portion of the subject property in trust for its lawful owner. ... MBTC is considered a builder in bad faith. ... Consequently, MBTC is obliged to vacate and surrender the possession and ownership of 60% portion of the subject three lots to petitioners, and to remove or demolish what has been built on said portion of the subject three lots at MBTC's expense.","WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED. The May 15, 2013 Decision and October 8, 2013 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 77595 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE insofar as the rights of petitioners Florencia Duenas and Daphne Duenas-Montefalcon over the subject three lots are concerned. Accordingly, petitioners Florencia Duenas and Daphne Duenas-Montefalcon are entitled to the recovery and possession of 60% of the subject three lots. Thus, Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. 195231, 195232, and 195233 in the name of Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company, and Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. 185022, 185023, and 185024 in the name of AF Realty Development, Inc. are declared NULL and VOID. Respondent Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company and all persons claiming rights under it are hereby ORDERED, upon finality of this Decision without awaiting the resolution of the matter of necessary expenses by the trial court, to (a) immediately VACATE 60% of the subject property and DELIVER its peaceful possession to petitioners; and (b) to remove or demolish what has been built on 60% portion of the subject three lots at its expense. This case is REMANDED to the court of origin for the determination of the necessary expenses of preservation of the 60% portion of the land, if any, incurred by respondent Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company while it is in the possession of the subject property, which expenses shall be reimbursed to Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company by petitioners Florencia Duenas and Daphne Duenas-Montefalcon. The Register of Deeds, Makati City is ORDERED to cancel: (a) Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. 195231, 195232, and 195233 in the name of Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company; (b) Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. 185022, 185023, and 185024 in the name of AF Realty Development, Inc.; and (c) Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. S-68301, S-68302 and S-68303 in the name of Bellever Brothers, Inc. Accordingly, the Register of Deeds, Makati City shall issue new transfer certificates of titles in the names of petitioners Florencia Duenas and Daphne Duenas-Montefalcon, and Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company subject to the partition of 60% and 40%, respectively, agreed upon by petitioner Florencia Duenas and Manotoc Securities, Inc. and approved by the Regional Trial Court of Pasig City, Branch 158 in its September 22, 1995 Decision in Civil Case No. 29872. In addition, respondent Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company is ORDERED to pay petitioners Florencia Duenas and Daphne Duenas-Montefalcon the amount of PHP 5,000,000.00 as temperate damages. Respondents Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company, AF Realty Development, Inc., Penelope Ison, and Inocencio Domingo are ORDERED to jointly and severally pay petitioners Florencia Duenas and Daphne Duenas-Montefalcon PHP 200,000.00 as moral damages. Respondents Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company and AF Realty Development, Inc. are ORDERED to jointly and severally pay petitioners Florencia Duenas and Daphne Duenas-Montefalcon PHP 200,000.00 as exemplary damages; and PHP 150,000.00 as attorney's fees. The above monetary awards, i.e. temperate damages, moral damages, exemplary damages, and attorney's fees, shall earn interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the finality of this Decision until full payment thereof. Lastly, respondent AF Realty Development, Inc. is ORDERED to reimburse respondent Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company the amount of 60% of PHP 39,308,000.00, the purchase price paid, with legal interest of 12% per annum from the date of filing of cross claim on July 11, 1994 until June 30, 2013, and six percent (6%) per annum from July 1, 2013 until finality of this Decision. The total amount of the foregoing shall earn interest at the rate of six percent (6%) from date of finality of this Decision until full payment. SO ORDERED."

LABOR-UNION-FEDERATION OF DEMOCRATIC LABOR ORGANIZATION (MICTSILU-FDLO), JEFFREY L. CHAVEZ, LOURVEN E. LUCAGBO, ISAGANI L. LLANES, JORGE S. SALARDA, JERRY M. SALENTES, RIAN C. BANIEL, LYLE L. CAJOLES, SYLVESTER TUAREG V. DAGUS, ALLAN A. PABLO, AND TOMMY S. VACALARES REPRESENTED BY THEIR LEGAL COUNSEL AND FEDERATION PRESIDENT, ATTY. GREGORIO A. PIZARRO, RESPONDENTS.","MICTSI Labor Union-Federation of Democratic Labor Organization ( MICTSILU-FDLO ) is a legitimate labor organization, which serves as the exclusive bargaining representative of all the rank-and-file employees of MICTSI. Chavez, et al., on the other hand, are all members of the union and employees of petitioner. On March 20, 2015, petitioner and MICTSILU-FDLO entered into a Collective Bargaining Agreement ( CBA ) to take effect for a period of five years from March 20, 2015 to March 20, 2020. The relevant CBA provisions provided: ARTICLE 6 x x x x Section 2. With respect to Promotion, Lay-off, Transfer and Reduction of Personnel, the following criteria should be followed: Employee's competency Employee's attendance and physical fitness; and Length of Service x x x x Section 3. Promotion. Whenever a regular employee covered by this Agreement is promoted to a job that pays more than his former job; he shall receive the pay of the job to which he has been promoted. x x x x ARTICLE 7 Section 1. The Company agrees on the principle of equal pay for equal work and non-diminution of salary rate. Transfer to a lesser [rank-and-file] position shall be done in accordance with Law. However, a controversy arose regarding the proper interpretation of Section 3, Article 6 and Sec. 1, Art. 7 of the CBA in relation to the correct corresponding salaries of employees who were promoted by petitioner to other plantilla positions with higher pay, namely: Jeffrey L. Chavez Lourven E. Lucagbo Isagani L. Llanes Jorge S. Salarda Jerry M. Salentes Rian C. Baniel Lyle L. Cajoles Sylvester Tuareg V. Dagus Allan A. Pablo; Tommy S. Vacalares. Although Chavez, et al. were promoted to different higher positions, neither of them received the same salary rate as those received by other employees who had been occupying the same positions. For instance, Lyle Cajoles was promoted to QGC Operator on September 9, 2016, and was given a basic salary of P16,864.00, while Michael C. Maneja, who had been holding the same position of QGC Operator since August 1, 2008, had a higher basic salary of P20,095.67. Thus, MICTSILU-FDLO and Chavez, et al. averred before the AVA that promoted employees should be entitled to receive the highest rate of salary for the respective positions to which they were promoted pursuant to the principle of equal pay for equal work. They contended that allowing employees holding the same position to receive different salaries would violate the principle of equal pay for equal work as embodied under Sec. 3, Art. 6 and Sec. 1, Art. 7 of the CBA, and would create wage discrimination. In response, petitioner claimed that a promoted employee shall receive the entry/starting salary rate of the job to which he/she has been promoted, and not the highest salary rate given to an employee already holding the same position. Petitioner explained that some employees are entitled to a higher salary rate due to several factors, such as length of service, performance, and merit awarded to select employees who have performed outstandingly.","In its now assailed August 16, 2018 Decision, the CA reversed and set aside the April 25, 2017 Decision of the AVA, and ordered petitioner to pay the salary differentials of Chavez, et al., plus attorney's fees. The dispositive portion of the decision reads: ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review is GRANTED. The Decision dated 25 April 2017 of Atty. Leovigildo D. Tandog, Jr., Accredited Voluntary Arbitrator, Regional Arbitration Branch No. 10, Cagayan de Oro City, in VA Case No. AC-209-RB10-01-01-10-2017 and the undated Resolution, denying the petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration dated 5 May 2017, are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Respondent Mindanao International Container Terminal Services, Inc. is ORDERED to pay the petitioners their salary differentials, in the following amounts: Name Salary Reckoned From a. Jeffrey L. Chavez Php20,095.67 20 March 2015 b. Lourven E. Lucagbo Php20,095.67 20 March 2015 c. Isagani L. Llanes Php12,054.09 20 March 2015 d. Jorge S. Salarda Php16,753.67 20 March 2015 e. Jerry M.

SO ORDERED.","The petition is meritorious. ... The Court finds that petitioner was able to adduce evidence to show that the difference in the salaries of its employees occupying the same position was the result of several factors including, but not limited to seniority, length of service, performance, and implementation of wage orders. Petitioner was able to establish that the imposition of different rates in salary was the result of a valid exercise of management prerogative, giving salary increases or additional benefit to employees due to their seniority, experience, and other relevant factors. Petitioner did not impose the different salaries of Chavez, et al., arbitrarily or capriciously. Rather, it considered several factors in the imposition of the salaries of both the senior and promoted employees. ... Undeniably, there was basis to hold that the senior employees should not be classified together with the newly-promoted employees with the same position in terms of salary rates. To reiterate, there is a recognized distinction between senior employees and newly-promoted employees occupying the same position, based on competency, attendance, physical fitness, and length of service. This would help avoid an unfair situation where a senior employee, who has been holding a position for a relatively long period of time and with extensive skills, would receive the same salary as that of a newly-promoted employee, who has lesser experience, in the same position. Indeed, petitioner discharged its burden to establish that the difference in the salaries of its employees with the same position was due to reasonable exercise of its management prerogative.","WHEREFORE, the Petition is GRANTED. The August 16, 2018 Decision and the March 4, 2019 Resolution of the Court of Appeals, Cagayan de Oro City in CA-G.R. SP No. 08151-MIN are REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

"G.R. No. 214259, November 29, 2022","LEODEGARIO D. BOONGALING, PETITIONER, VS. BANCO SAN JUAN, REPRESENTED BY ITS PRESIDENT JOBEL CHUA, RESPONDENT.","On December 5, 2021, Boongaling and Diate filed a Complaint for sum of money and damages against Banco San Juan, alleging that they are depositors under Savings Account No. 011-24-000087-4 with a balance of P574,313.93 as of December 9, 2008. They learned their account only contained P16,000.00 and claimed that two former employees of the bank had stolen P580,000.00 (P80,000.00 on April 14, 2008, and P500,000.00 on April 30, 2008) by forging Boongaling's signature on withdrawal slips. They averred that the bank should have noticed the forgery and noted that the spurious transactions were never recorded in their passbook. The bank, in its Answer, admitted two employees made unauthorized withdrawals from some client accounts in 2009 but denied that Boongaling and Diate's account was affected, maintaining that the withdrawal slips and signatures in question were genuine and correct, and that their remaining balance was P15,807.49. The Regional Trial Court (RTC) granted Boongaling and Diate's motion for judgment on the pleadings, concluding the bank was negligent and in bad faith, and ordered the bank to pay P1,674,313.93. The bank appealed the case to the CA.","In its February 17, 2014 Decision, the appellate court reversed the Order granting the complaint based on the pleadings, and remanded the case records for trial on the merits: WHEREFORE, the Order, dated 19 April 2012, of the Regional Trial Court, Branch V, Baguio City in Civil Case No. 7521-R, for Sum of Money and Damages, granting Judgment on the Pleadings and ordering the payment of P1,674,313.93 is REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The records of the case are REMANDED to the court of origin for the trial on the merits and reception of both parties' evidence.","The Court denied the petition. It ruled that respondent bank's act of complying with the writ of execution did not render its appeal moot. It also ruled that the respondent did not commit forum shopping when it appealed the trial court's judgment on the pleadings and subsequently filed a petition for certiorari against the trial court's order allowing execution pending appeal, as the two actions questioned different orders and asserted different rights/reliefs. Finally, the Court agreed with the CA that the rendition of a judgment on the pleadings by the trial court was improper because the respondent's Answer tendered several genuine issues (whether Boongaling's and Diate's signatures were forged and whether the bank was negligent) by categorically denying that their account was affected by the fraud and asserting that the withdrawal slips were genuine. These issues of fact require a full-blown trial on the merits, and thus, judgment on the pleadings or summary judgment was unwarranted.","WHEREFORE, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED. The February 17, 2014 Decision and the August 20, 2014 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 99360 are AFFIRMED."
"G.R. No. 230352, November 29, 2022","CAREER PHILIPPINES SHIPMANAGEMENT INC., COLUMBIA SHIPMANAGEMENT AND/OR VERLOU R. CARMELINO, PETITIONERS, VS. ARDEL S. GARCIA, RESPONDENT.","On June 19, 2013, Garcia filed a complaint for the payment of total and permanent disability benefits as well as damages. The complaint was docketed as NLRC NCR Case No. OFW (M)-06-08883-13. In his Position Paper, Garcia averred that he had undergone a series of tests and was declared fit to work. Verlou Carmelino [Carmelino] of [Career Philippines Shipmanagement, Inc.] hired Garcia as a bosun for the vessel Cape Bastia for its foreign employer, Columbia Shipmanagement. His tour of duty was for a period of nine (9) months plus an additional one (1) month upon mutual consent of the parties, starting February 19, 2011. Garcia alleged various strenuous duties as bosun, working 8 to 16 hours a day and being exposed to harsh conditions. On November 19, 2011, while the vessel was in Lexum, Portugal, Garcia was struck by successive giant waves and thrust against the railings, causing him to plunge into the sea. He felt pain in his right chest. On November 23, 2011, he was sent to a hospital in Portugal where a chest x-ray revealed 'right side, pneumothorax and possible lung contusion of the lower lobe.' A chest tube was inserted and later removed, and he was recommended for immediate repatriation. On December 2, 2011, CPSI referred Garcia to the NGC Medical Clinic in Manila. Company-designated physician Dr. Nicomedes Cruz [Dr. Cruz] treated Garcia until April 2, 2012, when treatment was discontinued, although Garcia still suffered chest pains and difficulty breathing. Garcia consulted his personal physician, Dr. May S. Donato-Tan [Dr. Donato-Tan], who, after a year of treatment, concluded that the nature and extent of his illness permanently and totally prohibited him from working as a seafarer. Petitioners countered that Garcia was not entitled to disability benefits because the company-designated physician determined that he was fit to work on April 16, 2012, and Garcia was bound by this declaration under the POEA Contract. The Labor Arbiter (LA) dismissed the complaint for lack of merit, upholding the company-designated physician's fit-to-work declaration. The National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) reversed the LA Decision, awarded Garcia total permanent disability benefits (US$60,000.00), and held that the findings of Garcia's own physician could serve as basis, noting that Garcia's disability was permanent and total because he had not been hired since December 2, 2011. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed with modification the NLRC Decision, upholding the finding of total and permanent disability but absolving Carmelino, opining that 'the resort to a third doctor is merely discretionary' despite conflicting assessments.","The Court finds merit in the petition. The June 17, 2016 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 136369 is REVERSED and SET ASIDE.","The Supreme Court ruled that the extension of the 120-day treatment period was justified because the company-designated physician advised Garcia to continue physical therapy on the 120th day. However, the Court stressed that referral to a third doctor, as stipulated in the POEA-SEC, is a mandatory procedure in case of conflicting assessments between the company-designated physician and the seafarer's doctor of choice. Since Garcia failed to initiate this mandatory procedure, such failure constitutes a breach of the POEA-SEC, making the assessment of the company-designated physician final and binding. The Court held that the assessment issued by the company-designated physician (Dr. Cruz), who tracked Garcia's condition for months, was more credible than the medical certificate issued by Garcia's personal doctor (Dr. Tan), which was based primarily on Garcia's apprehensions and anxiety and was unsubstantiated by procedural citations. Hence, Garcia should be considered able and fit to work, and therefore not entitled to total and permanent disability benefits.","WHEREFORE, the instant appeal is GRANTED. The June 17, 2016 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 136369 is REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The Decision dated December 20, 2013 of the Labor Arbiter in NLRC NCR Case No. OFW(M)-06-08883-13 dismissing the complaint for lack of merit is REINSTATED. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 251824, November 29, 2022","PETER B. FAVILA, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON AUDIT, RESPONDENT.","During the period from 2008 to 2010, petitioner Peter B. Favila (Favila), who was then the Secretary of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), served as an ex-officio member of the Board of Directors (Board/BOD) of the Trade and Investment Development Corporation of the Philippines (TIDCORP). On various occasions from 2005 to 2007, TIDCORP's BOD approved eight Board Resolutions approving the grant of productivity enhancement pay, developmental contribution bonuses, corporate guaranty, grocery subsidy, and anniversary bonuses to its board members and their alternates. On July 13, 2012, COA Audit Team Leader Gloria O. Lacson (ATL Lacson) and Supervising Auditor Teodora M. Lacerna (SA Lacerna) issued Notice of Disallowance (ND) No. 2012-001, disallowing various disbursement vouchers and the corresponding checks in the total amount of PHP 4,539,835.02, pertaining to monetary benefits of TIDCORP's Board members for the period of January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2010, on the ground that the same were not in accordance with Section 8, Article IX-B of the 1987 Philippine Constitution, as the disallowed amount constitutes double compensation since the Board members received the same in an ex-officio capacity. One of the members held liable under the ND was petitioner Favila who allegedly received a total of PHP 454,598.28 in benefits from October 2008 to May 2010. TIDCORP, on behalf of its implicated officers, appealed the disallowance.","In a Decision dated October 8, 2015, the COA Corporate Government Sector (CGS) affirmed the ND and denied the appeal for lack of merit, holding that the members of the TIDCORP's Board who held their positions in ex-officio capacity had no right to receive additional compensation since their compensation were already paid by their respective principal offices. The COA-CGS noted that Sec. 13 of PD 1080 merely authorizes the grant of a per diem of P500.00 only and that the Board failed to comply with Memorandum Order No. (MO) 20, series of 2001, which requires the prior approval of the President before any increase in benefits could take effect. The Commission on Audit Proper (COA) denied the subsequent Petition for Review in its Decision No. 2019-001 dated January 13, 2019, upholding the finding of the COA-CGS and further noting that the petition was filed beyond the 180-day period to file an appeal. Favila's Motion for Reconsideration was likewise denied by the COA in its Resolution No. 2020-177 dated January 29, 2020.","The Court dismissed the petition, adhering to its prior ruling in the related case of Suratos, et. al. v. Commission on Audit (G.R. No. 253584). The Court upheld the finding of COA that Favila's right to compensation as member of the TIDCORP Board in an ex-officio capacity is limited only to per diem authorized by law (P500.00) and no other, as his position is in legal contemplation part of his principal office, making the allowances illegal and in contravention of the constitutional prohibitions against double compensation. The Court rejected Favila's contention that his right to due process was violated, finding that the repeated opportunity given to him to argue his case before the COA and this Court sufficiently satisfied the essence of due process. Lastly, the Court rejected Favila's good faith defense, noting that the existence of prevailing jurisprudence disallowing allowances of the same nature (citing Civil Liberties Union) militates against his claim of good faith, and that Favila, as an approving officer, participated in the approval of the benefits without the required Presidential approval (MO 20).","WHEREFORE, the petition is DISMISSED. The Decision No. 2019-001 dated January 30, 2019 and the Resolution No. 2020-177 dated January 29, 2020 of the Commission on Audit are hereby AFFIRMED. Peter B. Favila is held solidarity liable as approving officer and recipient of the disallowed amount, and is directed to settle the said amount of PHP 4,539,835.02 immediately. SO ORDERED."

Prior to the last quarter of 1989, both PPA and MIAA had been paying its officials and employees COLA and amelioration allowance. Thereafter, PPA and MIAA discontinued the payment of said allowances pursuant to the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) Corporate Compensation Circular (CCC) No. 10, series of 1989 (DBM CCC No. 10) prescribing the implementing rules and regulations of RA 6758, or the Compensation and Position Classification Act of 1989. However, in De Jesus v. Commission On Audit (De Jesus), We declared DBM-CCC No. 10 ineffective and unenforceable due to non-publication. Consequently, PPA and MIAA paid their employees their COLA and amelioration allowance backpay from the time the same were withheld. On 16 March 1999, the DBM caused the required publication of DBM-CCC No. 10. Hence, on 17 July 1999, PPA and MIAA again stopped paying their respective employees' COLA and amelioration allowance. Further, MIAA issued Board Resolution No. 2005-061 denying the request of its employees to continue paying COLA and amelioration allowance on the ground that these allowances are already deemed integrated into their employees' basic salaries, pursuant to law. This prompted Pantalan and SMPP to file their respective petitions for mandamus. Pantalan alleged that PPA failed to ""actually integrate"" the COLA and amelioration allowance into their basic salary. On the other hand, SMPP claimed that after the effectivity of DBM-CCC No. 10, their COLA and amelioration allowance ""simply disappeared."" Both Pantalan and SMPP claimed that from July 1999 to date, PPA and MIAA failed to pay the COLA and amelioration allowance on top of their basic salary. For their part, PPA and MIAA posited that with the enactment of DBM-CCC No. 10, the COLA and amelioration allowance were deemed integrated in the salaries of their employees pursuant to RA 6758, and as such, there is no need for ""any separate, independent and further act of integrating"" COLA and amelioration allowance.","Before this Court are the consolidated Petitions for Review on certiorari (petitions) under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, seeking to reverse and set aside the Decision dated 29 January 2010 and the Resolution dated 09 July 2010 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 107730, and the Decision dated 30 July 2010 and the Resolution dated 16 December 2010 of the CA in CA-G.R. SP No. 96571. The CA in CA-G.R. SP No. 107730 affirmed the RTC decision mandating PPA to actually integrate the COLA and amelioration allowance. The CA in CA-G.R. SP No. 96571 reversed the RTC decision and dismissed SMPP's case against MIAA.","The Court resolves to GRANT PPA's petition and DENY SMMP's petition. The COLA and amelioration allowance are already deemed factually integrated into the standardized salaries of PPA and SMPP employees from 01 July 1989. Under RA 6758, COLA and amelioration allowance are already integrated into the standardized salary rates of government workers. The integration of the COLA and amelioration allowance in the standardized salaries is not repugnant to the principle of non-diminution of benefits. Back payment of these allowances amounts to double compensation which is proscribed by Section 8, Article IX (B) of the Constitution.","WHEREFORE, premises considered: 1.

ATIENZA, ALL OF THE CITY GOVERNMENT OF PUERTO PRINCESA, PETITIONERS, VS. COMMISSION ON AUDIT, RESPONDENT.","On June 15, 2010, the Sangguniang Panlungsod of Puerto Princesa City, presided over by petitioner Lucilo R. Bayron, enacted Ordinance No. 438, which established the Early & Voluntary Separation Incentive Program (EVSIP) of the Puerto Princesa City Government (PPCG). The EVSIP provided specific benefits/incentives computed based on years of service (10 to 31+ years) and the basic monthly salary multiplied by factors (1.5, 1.8, or 2.0), in addition to other existing benefits. PPCG's EVSIP subsequently became the subject of respondent's review, leading to the issuance of Notice of Disallowance (ND) Nos. 13-057-100 (2011) to 13-130-100 (2011), all dated November 25, 2013, and ND Nos. 13-131-100 (2011) to 13-150-100 (2012), all dated December 2, 2013, concerning the payment of benefits totaling P89,672,400.74. Petitioners appealed, arguing that the EVSIP was an early retirement plan/separation pay and not a prohibited supplementary retirement package. Respondent COA Regional Office No. IV-B denied the appeal and affirmed the NDs, finding that the EVSIP was basically a supplementary retirement plan prohibited under Section 10 of R.A. No. 4968. This decision was subsequently affirmed by the COA proper in Decision No. 2020-100.","The Commission on Audit (COA) promulgated Decision No. 2020-100 dated January 16, 2020, which denied the Petition for Review of Mayor Lucilo R. Bayron, et al., and affirmed the Notice of Disallowance (ND) Nos. 13-057-100(2011) to 13-130-100(2011) and 13-131-100(2011) to 13-150-100(2012) on the payment of retirement benefits under the Early and Voluntary Separation Incentive Program, in the total amount of P89,672,400.74.","The Court ruled that Ordinance No. 438 and Resolution No. 850-2010 of the Sangguniang Panlungsod of Puerto Princesa City are ultra vires and contrary to national legislation, specifically Section 28(b) of Commonwealth Act No. 186, as amended by Republic Act No. 4968, which prohibits supplementary retirement or pension plans other than the GSIS. The EVSIP was deemed a supplementary retirement plan designed to augment benefits and reward loyalty due to its computation scheme based on length of service (using multipliers of 1.5, 1.8, and 2.0). Consequently, the legal basis for the PPCG's EVSIP was declared null and void. The Court affirmed COA's disallowance but applied the operative fact doctrine, reiterating that it only applies to recipients and implementors who acted in good faith, deferring findings of good faith concerning petitioners to the Office of the Ombudsman.","The present Petition for Certiorari is hereby DENIED for lack of merit, and respondent Commission on Audit's Decision No. 2020-100 dated January 16, 2020 is hereby AFFIRMED. Ordinance No. 438 dated June 15, 2010 and Resolution No. 850-2010 dated June 21, 2010 of the Sangguniang Panlungsod of Puerto Princesa City are both hereby DECLARED NULL AND VOID for being ultra vires and contrary to Section 28(b) of Commonwealth Act No. 186, as amended by Republic Act No. 4968."
"G.R. No. 258328, November 29, 2022","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. JOSE VASTINE Y GIBSON @ JIMMY, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","Accused-appellant Jose Vastine y Gibson (accused-appellant), Albert Joaquin Ong y Bugtas @ Albert (Ong), and Edilberto Ty y Tapon @ Edilberto (Ty) were charged with violation of Section 5, in relation to Sec. 26(5), Article II of Republic Act No. (RA) 9165 (Illegal Sale) for allegedly conspiring to deliver 2001.71 grams of cocaine to PO3 ERNESTO A. MABANGLO (Criminal Case No. 17637-D-TG). Accused-appellant and Ong were also charged with violation of Sec. 15, Art. II of RA 9165 (Illegal Use of Dangerous Drugs) in separate Informations (Criminal Case Nos. 17636-D-TG, 17634-D-TG, and 17635-D-TG). 

Version of the Prosecution: Based on information received on 31 July 2011 about the illegal drug activities of 'Jimmy' (accused-appellant), a buy-bust team was formed for 01 August 2011. PO3 Mabanglo was designated as poseur buyer to buy two kilos of cocaine worth P800,000.00, using boodle money. They agreed to meet at Market! Market! Mall, Taguig. At the meeting, PO3 Mabanglo met accused-appellant. After checking the merchandise (two bricks wrapped in brown packaging tape, handed over by Ong and Ty upon accused-appellant's direction), Mabanglo handed the buy-bust money and gave the pre-arranged signal. Accused-appellant, Ong, and Ty were arrested. PO3 Mabanglo marked the seized drugs with his initials and the date of seizure, 'EAM-08/01/2011.' Inventory was conducted by SPO1 Calva in the presence of the accused, the buy-bust team, Jacque Manabat of ABS-CBN, Kagawad Artemio G. Omana, and Barangay Tanod Juanito Brioso (Barangay Fort Bonifacio), but no Department of Justice (DOJ) representative arrived despite efforts. Forensic examination confirmed the substance was cocaine (2,000.71 grams). Urine tests showed accused-appellant was positive for marijuana, and Ong was positive for shabu and marijuana, while Ty was negative.

Version of the Defense: Accused-appellant Vastine claimed that on 01 August 2011, he went to Market! Market! to give P100,000.00 to his friend, Cris Matthews, who was being extorted by police officers for P300,000.00. After Vastine gave the money to Cris inside Cris's vehicle, two guys in civilian clothes grabbed him, pinned him, and handcuffed him. They introduced themselves as police officers and subsequently asked him for Five Hundred Thousand Pesos (Php 500,000.00) in exchange for his freedom. Vastine denied having committed any crime and claimed his wallet containing P65,000.00 went missing. He claimed the evidence was merely planted by arresting officers for a bogus entrapment and extortion.","The Regional Trial Court (RTC) found accused Jose Vastine y Gibson, Edilberto Ty y Tapon and Albert Joaquin Ong y Bugtas GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 5, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165 (Illegal Sale) and sentenced them to Life Imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.00. The RTC also found Ong and Vastine GUILTY of violation of Section 15 (Illegal Use) and ordered mandatory drug rehabilitation.

On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) sustained accused-appellant Vastine's conviction for Illegal Sale and Illegal Use of Dangerous Drugs, but acquitted Ong and Ty of Illegal Sale due to failure of the prosecution to show their unmistakable involvement. The CA affirmed Vastine's conviction and modified the fine for Illegal Sale, ordering him to pay Five Million Pesos (P5,000,000.00) instead. The CA maintained the trial court's disposition regarding the charges for Illegal Use against Vastine and Ong, directing mandatory rehabilitation.","The Supreme Court found the appeal without merit and affirmed the CA Decision. The Court held that the prosecution indubitably proved the guilt of the accused-appellant for illegal sale of cocaine, as he was caught in flagrante during a legitimate buy-bust operation, and the sale was consummated upon the exchange of cocaine and money. The Court also affirmed accused-appellant's guilt for illegal use of marijuana, supported by the initial and confirmatory tests.

Regarding the chain of custody, the Court upheld the common findings of the RTC and CA that there was compliance with Sec. 21, Art. II of RA 9165. The Court justified the lack of a representative from the Department of Justice (DOJ) by recognizing that the police officers provided an explanation (earnest efforts were made but futile) and considering the time-sensitive nature of the buy-bust operation. Furthermore, the Court noted that the seized quantity (2,000.71 grams or more than two kilos of cocaine) lessens the possibility of tampering and planting of evidence, thus preserving the integrity and evidentiary value of the drugs.

The Court rejected the defenses of denial and frame-up as they were unsubstantiated, noting that the sheer amount of seized drugs makes the claim for frame-up difficult to believe. Factual findings of the appellate court, affirming those of the trial court, were binding.","WHEREFORE, the appeal is DISMISSED. The Decision dated 15 July 2020 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 12043 is AFFIRMED. Accused-appellant Jose Vastine y Gibson @ ""Jimmy"" is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt for violation of Illegal Sale and Illegal Use of Dangerous Drugs as defined and penalized under Sections 5 and 15, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165 respectively, and accordingly, sentenced as follows: (a) in Criminal Case No. 17637-D-TG for Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs, accused-appellant is sentenced to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of P5,000,000.00; and (b) in Criminal Case No. 17636-D-TG for Illegal Use of Dangerous Drugs, accused-appellant is required to undergo drug rehabilitation for a minimum period of six months in a government center as required by law. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 250927, November 29, 2022","MARIO NISPEROS Y PADILLA, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","Petitioner was charged with violation of Sec. 5 of R.A. No. 9165 in an Information dated September 18, 2015, alleging that on June 30, 2015, he sold and distributed one (1) piece heat(-)sealed transparent plastic sachet containing METHAMPHETAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE, commonly known as 'shabu', weighing 0.7603 grams, to PO1 MICHAEL B. TURINGAN (poseur(-)buyer) for P3,000.00, leading to his immediate arrest. According to the prosecution, an inventory was subsequently conducted at the place of transaction in the presence of petitioner, Department of Justice (DOJ) representative Ferdinand Gangan and Barangay Captain Desiderio Taguinod. Gangan testified that the item was unmarked when first presented during the inventory, prompting PO1 Turingan to mark it in front of him. The specimen yielded a positive result for methamphetamine hydrochloride. The defense denied the allegations and claimed the chain of custody rule was not properly observed. The Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Tuguegarao City, Cagayan, Branch 1 convicted him for Violation of Section 5, Article II of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9165, sentencing him to suffer life imprisonment and to pay a fine of P500,000.00. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the conviction with the modification that he shall not be eligible for parole. Petitioner filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's decision, arguing failure to strictly follow the chain of custody rule, particularly regarding the belated presence of witnesses and immediate marking of evidence.","the appeal is GRANTED. The Decision dated August 5, 2019 and Resolution dated November 7, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 11472 are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE.","The Supreme Court ruled that in warrantless arrests on account of buy-bust operations, the required witnesses must be present 'at or near' the place of apprehension, i.e., within the vicinity, in order to comply with the statutory rule that the inventory should be conducted immediately after the seizure and confiscation. The buy-bust team unjustifiably deviated from the chain of custody rule when only one of the mandatory witnesses (Barangay Captain Taguinod) was readily available at the place of transaction, constraining the team to conduct the inventory only half an hour after the seizure due to the tardy arrival of DOJ representative Gangan. Furthermore, the poseur-buyer failed to mark the seized items immediately upon confiscating them, marking them only during the inventory itself, with no justifiable ground proffered for the belated marking. Since the first link of the chain was not established, the integrity and evidentiary value of the corpus delicti are seriously compromised and the acquittal of petitioner is warranted.","Petitioner Mario Nisperos y Padilla is ACQUITTED of the crime charged on the ground of reasonable doubt, and is ORDERED IMMEDIATELY RELEASED from detention unless he is being lawfully held for another cause. Further, petitioner is ORDERED TO PAY the docket fee deficiency of P80.00."

CAOIBES, JR., RESPONDENT.","Respondent filed a complaint for Estafa against complainant over the amount of P4,500.00 with the Municipal Trial Court (MTC) of Calaca, Batangas. Complainant agreed to pay respondent P200,000.00 for the dismissal of all cases he filed against her and her mother Luz Rubio, paying the full amount by April 10, 2018. However, respondent refused to sign the Affidavit of Desistance drafted by complainant's counsel, instead preparing his own document entitled Combined Affidavits of Admissions and Desistance (Combined Affidavits) which required complainant to admit her guilt. Respondent subsequently did not move for the dismissal of the pending cases and disparaged complainant in letters to her counsel. Complainant discovered that respondent used cruel and disrespectful words against judges, such as Judge Montes in the 2018 Manifestation and Motion, and attacked the integrity of Judge Rolando E. Silang in the 2015 Manifestation. Respondent indicated in his pleadings the statement, 'MCLE Compliance presently being updated,' but a Certification dated April 24, 2018 from the Mandatory Continuing Legal Education (MCLE) Office confirmed he was neither compliant with nor exempt from the MCLE requirement. Respondent also used various Roll of Attorneys numbers that did not belong to him. Furthermore, respondent was issued a notarial commission by the RTC of Lemery, Batangas, but he notarized documents in Calaca, Batangas, outside of his notarial commission's jurisdiction. The IBP required respondent to file an answer, which he did after multiple extensions, arguing: (1) complainant did not come to court with clean hands (being a convicted probationer); (2) he abandoned his legal practice because his MCLE was not up to date; and (3) his notarial commission covered the whole Province of Batangas per the Certification from the RTC of Lemery. Respondent subsequently failed to file his position paper as required by the IBP.","The Court adopts and approves the findings of the IBP, with modification as to the penalty imposed on respondent. The Court finds that respondent misled complainant with respect to the Compromise Agreement, notarized documents beyond his territorial jurisdiction in violation of the Notarial Rules and the CPR, used foul and derogatory language in his pleadings against judges in violation of Canons 8 and 11 of the CPR, failed to comply with the MCLE requirement (B.M. No. 850) and misrepresented his compliance in violation of Canons 1, 7, and 10 of the CPR, used different roll numbers in his pleadings in violation of B.M. No. 1132 and Canon 10, and failed to comply with the lawful order of the IBP. Considering the gravity of these infractions, coupled with his previous disciplinary record (including dismissal from service as a judge in Sison v. Judge Caoibes, Jr.), the Court found that the penalty of disbarment was warranted.","WHEREFORE, the Court finds respondent Atty. Jose F. Caoibes, Jr. GUILTY of violation of the Lawyer's Oath, the Code of Professional Responsibility, the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice, and Bar Matter No. 850. Accordingly, the Court hereby imposes upon him the penalty of DISBARMENT from practice of law and his name is ORDERED STRICKEN from the Roll of Attorneys, effective immediately.","DISBARMENT from practice of law and his name is ORDERED STRICKEN from the Roll of Attorneys, effective immediately."
"G.R. No. 253649, November 28, 2022","MARITES AYTONA, PETITIONER, VS. JAIME PAULE, RESPONDENT.","On the basis of complaints filed by respondent Jaime Paule (Paule), two Informations charging perjury were filed against Aytona. The charges were filed on February 15, 2010, docketed as Criminal Case Nos. M-PSY-10-11344-CR and M-PSY-10-11345-CR, and raffled to Branch 44, Metropolitan Trial Court of Pasay City (MeTC). Based on the records of the case, the proceedings in the cases did not even reach the conclusion of the presentation of the prosecution's first witness despite the lapse of more than five years. Records reveal that after the termination of the pre-trial in these cases, the initial trial was set on September 13, 2010 and eight (8) succeeding dates. All the said settings were reset and the initial presentation of prosecution's evidence proceeded on March 30, 2011. Subsequent hearings were repeatedly reset until 2015, with the prosecution continuously failing to submit the Judicial Affidavit of the private complainant and his witnesses despite repeated directives from the court starting December 10, 2013. The crux of the controversy revolves around the ""Motion to Dismiss (For Failure to Prosecute Case with a Reasonable Length of Time)"" which Aytona filed on June 24, 2015, and set for hearing on July 7, 2015. Ruling on the said Motion to Dismiss, the MeTC issued the Order dated August 1, 2016 dismissing the case due to the prosecution's failure to prosecute the case. The prosecution sought reconsideration, but the same was denied in an Order dated December 4, 2017. Aggrieved, Paule filed a petition for certiorari in the Regional Trial Court of Pasay City (RTC) docketed as SCA Case No. R-PSY-18-29643-CV. In a Decision dated January 27, 2019, the RTC granted the petition for certiorari, setting aside the MeTC orders and reinstating the cases, holding that Aytona's motion was a mere scrap of paper for violation of the notice of hearing rule, and that there was no violation of the right to speedy trial. Aytona sought reconsideration, but the RTC denied the motion for reconsideration in an Order dated April 29, 2019. Aytona then filed a Notice of Appeal signifying her intention to appeal to the CA. On June 17, 2019, the CA directed the parties to submit their respective memoranda, in lieu of briefs, within a non-extendible period of 30 days from notice. Both parties, however, failed to file their memoranda.","In a Resolution dated October 8, 2019, the CA dismissed Aytona's appeal, citing Section 1(e), Rule 50 of the Rules of Court, explicitly granting the CA the power to dismiss appeals for failure of the appellant to file the required memorandum within the time provided. Aytona sought reconsideration, but the CA denied the same in a Resolution dated September 14, 2020.","The Petition is impressed with merit. While the CA was justified in dismissing Aytona's petition for her failure to file the required memorandum, in the interest of substantive justice, the Court will rule on the merits of the case, considering that a constitutional right is implicated in this case. The Court declares that the RTC Decision [reinstating the criminal cases] was void ab initio for two reasons: (1) the petition filed before the RTC was filed by a person who did not have the legal personality to do so, as the party affected by the dismissal of the criminal action is the State and not the private complainant; and (2) the grant of the petition for certiorari constituted a violation of Aytona's right against double jeopardy. All the requisites of double jeopardy are present in this case, as the dismissal of the case by the MeTC was grounded on the violation of Aytona's right to speedy trial, which amounts to an acquittal. The MeTC did not commit grave abuse of discretion when it ruled that Aytona's right to speedy trial had been violated, given the five-year delay, the prosecution's inexcusable failure to submit judicial affidavits despite repeated orders, and Aytona's timely assertion of her right via the motion to dismiss.","WHEREFORE, premises considered, the petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated January 27, 2019 of Branch 111, Regional Trial Court of Pasay City in SCA Case No. R-PSY-18-29643-CV and the Resolutions dated October 28, 2019 and September 14, 2020 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

DEL ROSARIO-ZOLETA, RESPONDENTS.","Siblings Dionisio Deloy (Dionisio) and Isabel Deloy (Isabel) were the registered owners of Lot No. 4012, a six-hectare parcel of land located at the Sta. Cruz de Malabon Estate, City of Trece Martires, Province of Cavite, and covered under Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-13784. Dionisio sold portions of the lot he occupied, leading to the subdivision of Lot No. 4012 into 13 lots. The original TCT No. T-13784 was reconstituted as TCT No. (T-13784) RT 12612. Subsequently, various derivative titles were issued, including TCT Nos. T-19312, T-19313, and T-19314 in Dionisio's name, covering Lot Nos. 4012-J, 4012-K, and 4012-L, respectively.

Dionisio sold these three lots to the predecessors-in-interest of respondents Verna R. Basa-Joaquin (Verna), Heirs of Maxima Guevarra, and Heirs of Spouses Mariano and Macaria Del Rosario, resulting in the issuance of TCT Nos. (T-43159) T-8554, (T-25562) T-22749, and (T-29268) T-69602 in their names.

Earlier, Dionisio's heirs (Heirs of Spouses Deloy) filed an Annulment Case (Civil Case No. TM-695) against the Province of Cavite and the RD, which resulted in the cancellation of TCT Nos. T-19127 and T-19128 (in the Province of Cavite's name) and, critically, the cancellation of the reconstituted TCT No. (T-13784) RT 12612. Based on the implementation of this ruling, the RD for Trece Martires City cancelled the titles of the respondents (TCT Nos. T-8554, T-22749, and T-69602) and issued new TCTs (TCT Nos. T-81201, T-81202, and T-81203) in the name of Dionisio, which were later consolidated under TCT No. 82597 in the name of the Heirs of Spouses Deloy.

This prompted respondents to file their respective petitions for quieting of title or removal of the cloud thereof and damages with prayer for temporary restraining order and/or preliminary injunction before the RTC, docketed as Sp. Proc. Case Nos. TMSCA-005-08 and TMSCA-0008-07.","The RTC ruled in favor of respondents in its Joint Decision dated April 24, 2012, quieting the title over the subject properties. The RTC declared TCT No. (T-43159) T-8554-TMC-08-1212, TCT No. (29268) T-69602, and TCT No. (T-25562) T-22749 valid and subsisting, and ordered the cancellation of the derivative TCTs issued to the Heirs of Spouses Deloy (TCT Nos. T-82597, T-81202, and T-81203).

On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the RTC in its Decision dated March 12, 2018, ruling that the respondents were able to prove by preponderance of evidence that they have titles over Lot Nos. 4012-J, 4012-K, and 4012-L, and that the Heirs of Spouses Deloy failed to show that the titles issued to respondents were attended by fraud. The CA also upheld the RTC's denial of the Motion for New Trial filed by the Heirs of Spouses Deloy.","The Supreme Court GRANTED the petition. The Court found that while the respondents substantially complied with the requirement of a certificate of non-forum shopping and that the RTC was correct in denying the Heirs of Spouses Deloy’s motion for new trial due to lack of proof of fraud, accident, mistake, or excusable negligence, the respondents ultimately failed to prove that their petition to quiet title was meritorious.

The Court ruled that the certificates of title held by the respondents (TCT Nos. T-8554, T-22749, and T-69602) could not be relied upon to prove ownership because they were derived from a void reconstituted title (TCT No. (T-13784) RT-12612), which the CA in the Annulment Case had ordered cancelled. For the titles to be upheld, the respondents must prove they acquired the properties in good faith and for value. However, the Court found a dearth of evidence (such as copies of the Deeds of Absolute Sale, especially since Verna admitted there was no documentary proof of the sale) to substantiate that the predecessors-in-interest of the respondents validly purchased Lot Nos. 4012-J, 4012-K, and 4012-L from Dionisio. Since tax declarations alone do not prove ownership, and respondents failed to show a legal or equitable title based on a valid acquisition, the action to quiet title lacked basis.","WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED.

On September 6, 2005, the Board of Directors of BRB issued Board Resolution No. 05-67 authorizing the sale of the subject property to Avelino and petitioner (collectively, Spouses Batungbacal). A Deed of Absolute Sale (DOAS) was executed between BRB and Spouses Batungbacal for the purchase of the subject property for P1,100,000.00.[8] Thereafter, Spouses Batungbacal sold the subject property to Diosdado and Luvimin Vitug[9] (Luvimin) (collectively, Spouses Vitug) for P1,475,000.00. Spouses Batungbacal requested BRB to transfer the title of the subject property directly to Spouses Vitug to avoid payment of higher capital gains tax, in accordance with the common practice of BRB. Despite BRB's refusal, it later discovered two falsified documents: (1) Board Resolution No. 05-67 authorizing the sale of the subject property to Spouses Vitug for P500,000.00; and (2) DOAS between BRB and Spouses Vitug. BRB's corporate secretary Emiliano S. Pomer (Pomer) and bank manager Benedicta G. Balderia (Balderia) both denied executing the documents.[10] On June 22, 2007, Balderia filed a complaint­affidavit[11] against Spouses Batungbacal before the Office of the City Prosecutor of Balanga City (OCP). On July 30, 2010, the OCP issued a subpoena[12] to Spouses Batungbacal. Spouses Batungbacal filed their counter-affidavit[13] on August 26, 2010. The OCP finally issued its Resolution[14] on July 21, 2016 which provides: WHEREFORE, premises considered, let the corresponding Informations for falsification of Absolute Deed of Sale and Resolution No. 05-67 as defined under Article 172 (1) of the Revised Penal Code in relation to Article 171 of the same code be filed against Avelino R. Batungbacal, Estelita Batungbacal, Luzvimin [sic] Vitug and Diosdado Vitug, Jr. SO ORDERED.[15] Thus, two (2) Informations dated July 25, 2016 charging Spouses Batungbacal and Spouses Vitug with Falsification of Public Document under Article 172(1) in relation to Article 171 of Act No. 3815, or the Revised Penal Code, were filed before the MTCC.[16] Spouses Batungbacal filed an Omnibus Motion[21] in Criminal Case No. 10428 and a Motion to Quash Information in Criminal Case No. 10496 before the MTCC.[22] They prayed for: (1) the recall of the Warrant of Arrest; (2) the suspension of the proceedings pending the resolution of case by the DOJ; or (3) the dismissal of the case with prejudice.[23] The MTCC denied the motions, which was affirmed by the RTC and the CA.","The Court grants the petition. The Decision dated August 24, 2020 and the Resolution dated January 8, 2021 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 162808 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE.","The crimes have not prescribed. Falsification of Public Documents under Article 172(1)[52] in relation to Article 171[53] of the Revised Penal Code is punishable by prisión correccional in its medium and maximum periods and a fine of not more than P5,000.00. ... Balderia's filing of a complaint on June 22, 2007 was done within the prescriptive period, thereby interrupting its running. None of the circumstances mentioned in Article 91 are present in the case.[60] Therefore, the prescriptive period has not run again after the complaint was filed. Necessarily, the prosecution of the crimes charged against petitioner has not yet prescribed. Judge Ortiguera's voluntary inhibition was not warranted. This is clearly not one of the grounds for mandatory inhibition under Section 1, Rule 137 of the Rules of Court or Section 5, Canon 3 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct. ... Absent clear and convincing evidence of Judge Ortiguera's bias and partiality, the presumption that he will perform his duty of dispensing justice without fear or favor stands.[70] Petitioner's right to speedy disposition of cases was violated. ... Second, there was a delay in the resolution of the preliminary investigation. Balderia filed her complaint on June 22, 2007.[75] ... However, a subpoena was only issued to Spouses Batungbacal on July 30, 2010,[77] or almost three years after the complaint was filed. ... Here, the OCP issued its Resolution on July 21, 2016,[84] or almost six years after the filing of the counter-affidavit and more than nine years after the filing of the complaint. Clearly, the OCP incurred delay beyond the period provided under the law. ... Third, the prosecution was not able to offer sufficient justification for the delay. The courts a quo excused the delay incurred by the OCP on the ground that there was only one prosecutor in Balanga City from 2004 to 2014.[86] ... While it is understandable that the OCP would have found it difficult to strictly observe the period stated Section 3, Rule 112 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure and the 2008 Revised Manual for Prosecutors, the amount of time that it took to resolve the case is still unacceptable. The case does not involve complicated questions of law and fact or voluminous records that required a significant amount of time for the OCP to study. ... Moreover, the prosecution failed to establish that petitioner suffered no prejudice because of the delay. On the contrary, petitioner duly alleged that she could no longer accurately recall the events subject of the case considering her advanced age.[110] This is a consequence of the delay that is undoubtedly prejudicial to petitioner.[111] Fourth, petitioner timely assailed the violation of her right to speedy disposition of cases. ... The inordinate delay in the resolution of the case is inconsistent with this objective and is a violation of petitioner's right to speedy disposition of cases. No less than the dismissal of the cases against petitioner is warranted as a consequence of this violation.","The criminal charges for Falsification of Public Document under Article 172 (1) in relation to Article 171 of the Revised Penal Code against petitioner Estelita Q. Batungbacal in Criminal Case Nos. 10428 and 10496 pending before the Municipal Trial Court in Cities of Balanga City, Bataan are DISMISSED."
"G.R. No. 212717, November 23, 2022","REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, PETITIONER, V.S. ARIEL S. CALINGO AND CYNTHIA MARCELLANA­ CALINGO, RESPONDENTS","In 1978, Ariel and Cynthia met when the latter was still the girlfriend of the former's friend. After a while, Cynthia and his then boyfriend broke up. From the conclusion of such relationship, there sprung a new one. After developing a strong sense of sexual desire and physical attraction towards each other, Ariel and Cynthia became a couple. On February 5, 1980, Ariel and Cynthia decided to get married civilly. The couple initially lived in Paco, Manila; and later on transferred to several places because of the alleged aggressive behavior of Cynthia. As they lived together, Ariel narrated that Cynthia kept herself occupied by gossiping and reading comic books. Once, he asked Cynthia to limit her visitation to their neighbors to gossip, but Cynthia got mad and told him there was nothing much to do in their house. Despite their marital problems, Ariel and Cynthia had their church wedding on February 22, 1998. At the time of their church celebration, Cynthia was five months pregnant. Ariel claimed that Cynthia's behavior was no different even after their second rites. She continued to gossip and pick fights with their neighbors. According to Ariel, not only did Cynthia showed aggressive behavior during their union, but she likewise exhibited unfaithfulness. Ariel recalled that Cynthia's first instance of marital infidelity was with Noli, their neighbor, who became close to them. When Ariel found out about the affair, he forgave Cynthia, who allegedly showed no remorse. Noli later on revealed to him that their twin children were not really Ariel's children, but his own. Ariel then remembered one incident between him and Cynthia wherein the latter told him ""hindi mo anak ['yan,]"" as she got mad because Ariel spanked one of their children. Cynthia's second affair involved Louie, who was also their neighbor. Ariel testified that he discovered Louie hiding under their marital bed and wearing his pants only. Not long after, Ariel reached his peak and left their conjugal abode after Cynthia threw a knife at him, which fortunately hit the wall. Premised on Cynthia's irritable and irascible attitude, Ariel narrated that the same took place after he asked Cynthia to check the pressure cooker; and in the course thereof: the pressure cooker exploded. Surprised, Cynthia got so angry and started throwing curses at Ariel. Allegedly, Cynthia threw a knife against him which hit the wall. Ariel filed a petition for declaration of nullity of marriage. To support his petition, Ariel secured the psychological evaluation of Dr. Arnulfo Lopez (Dr. Lopez). The result thereof shows that Ariel possesses an emotionally disturbed personality, but not severe enough to constitute psychological incapacity. Dr. Lopez likewise conducted an assessment on Cynthia; and the same revealed that Cynthia is suffering from Borderline Personality Disorder with Histrionic Personality Disorder Features. [...] Ruling of the Regional Trial Court (RTC): Under Decision dated August 3, 2009, the RTC-Br. 107, Quezon City, denied the petition on the ground that the totality of evidence presented did not prove psychological incapacity. It opined that there [was] absolutely no showing that [Cynthia's] ""defects"" were already present at the inception of the marriage or that they are incurable. [...] Ruling of the Court of Appeals: By Decision dated September 9, 2013, the Court of Appeals reversed the foregoing dispositions and granted the petition for declaration of nullity of marriage in this wise: Sexual infidelity, by itself, is not sufficient proof that petitioner is suffering from psychological incapacity. It must be shown that the acts of unfaithfulness are manifestations of a disordered personality which make petitioner completely unable to discharge the essential obligations of marriage. [...] Ruling of the Court in the Main Ponencia: By Decision dated March 11, 2020, the ponencia reversed the foregoing dispositions of the appellate court, thus: However, this Court refuses to accept as credible the assessment of Dr. Lopez as there was no other evidence which established the juridical antecedence, gravity, and incurability of Cynthia's alleged incapacity. [...] The Present Motion for Reconsideration: Through the present motion for reconsideration, Ariel insists that he was able to present substantial facts and circumstances which would warrant the grant of his Petition for Annulment; reiterates the assessments of Dr. Lopez regarding Cynthia's personality disorders; and cites the Dissent to the main ponencia to support his motion for reconsideration.",We grant the motion for reconsideration.,"We grant the motion for reconsideration. Article 36 of the Family Code decrees: Art. 36. A marriage contracted by any party who, at the time of the celebration, was psychologically incapacitated to comply with the essential marital obligations of marriage, shall likewise be void even if such incapacity becomes manifest only after its solemnization. This provision was interpreted through the guidelines laid down in Republic v. Molina up until its modification was recently decreed in Tan­ Andal v. Andal penned by the erudite Associate Justice, now Senior Associate Justice Marvic Mario Victor F. Leonen. As ordained therein, the guidelines in Molina are not meant to straightjacket all petitions for declaration of nullity of marriage; and some adjustments have to be written to the prototypical and then-prevailing doctrine of Molina to make the remedy responsive and relevant. The Court has since recalibrated the application of the guidelines in the now-prevailing case of Tan-Andal. Therefore, we resolve the present motion for reconsideration on the basis of the recent doctrines enunciated in Tan-Andal. [...] Applying the recently modified guidelines in Tan-Andal, we grant petitioner's motion for reconsideration. [...] Ariel was able to provide clear and convincing evidence to establish Cynthia's psychological incapacity. [...] There are durable aspects of Cynthia's personality structure that make it impossible for her to understand and comply with her marital obligations. [...] Cynthia's psychological incapacity is incurable in the legal sense. [...] Cynthia's psychological incapacity is caused by a genuinely seriously psychic cause. [...] Juridical antecedence was established. All told, the Court finds that Ariel proved with clear and convincing evidence that Cynthia was psychologically incapacitated to comply with her essential marital obligations. Their marriage, therefore, is void under Article 36 of the Family Code.","the motion for reconsideration is GRANTED. The petition for review on certiorari is DENIED. The Decision dated September 9, 2013 and Resolution dated May 29, 2014 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 94407 granting the petition for declaration of nullity of marriage are REINSTATED."
"G.R. No. 241507, December 07, 2022","REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, REPRESENTED BY THE REGIONAL DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION [DEPED]-REGION II, PETITIONER, VS. HEIRS OF ERIBERTO ONTIVEROS AND SPOUSES GERARDO AND DAISY ONTIVEROS, RESPONDENTS.","Sometime in the 1970s, the Department of Education built classrooms on a 1,811-square meter parcel of land in Gaddang, Aparri, Cagayan. These classrooms later formed the Gaddang Elementary School. On June 19, 2008, the heirs of Eriberto Ontiveros (Eriberto) and Spouses Gerardo and Daisy Ontiveros filed a Complaint against the Department of Education to recover possession of the land, which they alleged to be covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-56977 under the name of Eriberto and Gerardo Ontiveros (Gerardo). Insisting ownership over the land, the Ontiveroses claimed that the family patriarch, Eriberto, had only allowed the Department of Education to build a temporary structure on the land to be used as classrooms. Upon discovering that the temporary structures became concrete buildings, Eriberto demanded payment of reasonable rent from the school officials and gave them an option to purchase the property. Gerardo also sent letters to Aparri's municipal officials and then Education Secretary Florencio Abad. Despite demands, the Ontiveroses said, they were still deprived of their property without any compensation. Thus, they prayed that the Department of Education vacate the land, surrender its possession, and pay rentals for its use since it has been occupied. In its Answer, the Department of Education, represented by its Regional Director Jesus Lao Taberdo, claimed that the Complaint lacked cause of action due to prescription and the Ontiveroses were guilty of estoppel by laches. It also argued that it had in its favor a deed of sale conveying the property to it, and that it was also immune from suit.","In a March 30, 2016 Decision, the Municipal Circuit Trial Court ruled in favor of the Department of Education and found it to be the rightful possessor of the land. In its November 16, 2016 Decision, the Regional Trial Court reversed and set aside the ruling of the Municipal Circuit Trial Court, thus: WHEREFORE, in the light of the foregoing ratiocination, the contested decision of the 8th Municipal Circuit Trial Court, Branch 2, Aparri-Calayan, Cagayan dated March 30, 2016 is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The defendant-appellee is hereby ordered to vacate the subject property and surrender possession thereof to the plaintiffs-appellants. SO DECIDED. The Regional Trial Court held that the Ontiveroses proved ownership and a better right of possession of the land through the Department of Education's judicial admission and various evidence, such as the relocation survey report, as well as tax receipts and declarations issued in their name. In a February 15, 2018 Decision, the Court of Appeals affirmed the Regional Trial Court's ruling. It held that the Ontiveroses had a superior possessory right over the land, having sufficiently proven their ownership, and the Department of Education even judicially admitted the existence of TCT No. T-56997 and the Ontiveroses' ownership of the property. In an August 8, 2018 Resolution, the Court of Appeals denied the Department of Education's Motion for Reconsideration. Thus, the Republic of the Philippines, represented by the regional director of the Department of Education, filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari before this Court.","The Petition has no merit. This Court finds no reason to review the appreciation of evidence of the Regional Trial Court, as affirmed by the Court of Appeals, that respondents proved their better right to possess the land by a preponderance of evidence. The registered owners' right to eject anyone illegally occupying their property is imprescriptible and never barred by laches. Laches cannot apply to registered land covered by a Torrens Title because under the Property Registration Decree, no title to registered land in derogation to that of the registered owner shall be acquired by prescription or adverse possession. This Court agrees with the Regional Trial Court and the Court of Appeals that respondents did not sleep on their rights and intended to exercise their right to recover possession of the land through their actions. Furthermore, in Pada-Kilario v. Court of Appeals, this Court held that persons occupying a property by sheer tolerance of its owners are not possessors in good faith. Petitioner knew that it had no title to the land, and that its occupation is by mere tolerance of respondents who later repeatedly asserted their right. Thus, petitioner cannot be considered in good faith; it is not entitled to Article 448, in relation to Article 546, of the Civil Code.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DENIED. The February 15, 2018 Decision and August 8, 2018 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 150080 are AFFIRMED. The Department of Education is ordered to vacate the lot subject of this case and surrender its possession to respondents, the heirs of Eriberto Ontiveros and Spouses Gerardo and Daisy Ontiveros. SO ORDERED."

OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSMAN, RESPONDENT. G.R. NOS. 230849-51 JANET LIM NAPOLES, PETITIONER, VS. CONCHITA CARPIO MORALES IN HER OFFICIAL CAPACITY AS OMBUDSMAN, PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, AND SANDIGANBAYAN, SECOND DIVISION, RESPONDENTS.","The consolidated Petitions for Certiorari were filed by Janet Lim Napoles (Napoles) and officers of the Department of Budget and Management (DBM), namely Undersecretary for Operations Mario L. Relampagos, Chief Budget and Management Specialist Rosario S. Nuñez (Nuñez), and Administrative Assistants VI Lalaine N. Paule (Paule) and Marilou D. Bare (Bare) (collectively, Relampagos et al.). They jointly assail the Consolidated Resolution [1] and Consolidated Order [2] of the Office of the Ombudsman finding probable cause for violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019 and malversation under Article 217 of the Revised Penal Code against Relampagos et al. and Napoles; and corruption of public officials under Article 212 of the Revised Penal Code against Napoles in relation to the fund releases of former Davao del Sur Representative Douglas R. Cagas's (Cagas) allocation in the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) under Special Allotment Release Order Nos. ROCS-07-00046 and ROCS-07-03351. The present case involves the 2007 PDAF of Cagas amounting to PHP 16 million, which was diverted through Countrywide Agri and Rural Economic and Development Foundation, Inc. and Philippine Social Development Foundation, Inc., both alleged nongovernment organizations (NGOs). The funds were diverted from the DBM to Technology Resource Center, the implementing agency of the ghost projects. The scheme was discovered after whistleblower Benhur Luy (Luy) was rescued from the Pacific Plaza Tower in Taguig City. He claimed that he was illegally detained because of his responsibilities as ""lead employee"" of Janet Lim Corporation. [3] He, along with Janet Lim Corporation employees, namely Marina Sula (Sula) and Merlina Suñas (Suñas) (collectively referred to as the whistleblowers), revealed the Napoles pork barrel scam. The whistleblowers alleged that several NGOs were created for the pork barrel scam, including Countrywide Agri and Rural Economic and Development Foundation, Inc. and Philippine Social Development Foundation, Inc. The incorporators, officers, and members of these NGOs were household helpers, relatives, employees, and friends of Napoles. Some incorporators were unaware of their involvement, and their signatures in the corporate documents were forged. They operated these dummy NGOs at the Janet Lim Corporation Office at Unit 2502, Discovery Center Suites, O1tigas Center, Pasig City. [4] The pork barrel scam is as follows: Napoles would first negotiate with a lawmaker on what projects to prioritize, which government agency would implement the project, the project cost, and the amount of the lawmaker's commission or kickback, ranging from 40% to 60% of the project cost. [5] Depending on which House of Congress the lawmaker belongs, the lawmaker would write the Senate President or House Speaker and the Chairperson of the Finance Committee or the Appropriations Committee to request for the release of their allocation in the PDAF. The Senate President or House Speaker would then endorse the written request to the DBM. [6] The first tranche of a lawmaker's commission is released after transmittal of the request to Napoles. [7] Janet Lim Corporation employees would follow up with the DBM for the release of the Special Allotment Release Order. Upon the order's release and transmittal to Napoles, the second tranche of commission is released to the lawmaker. In return, the lawmaker signs the endorsement of Napoles- controlled NGOs to the implementing agency. [8] The authorized representative of the lawmaker who receives the commission gets 1% to 5% of the total project cost. [9] Consequently, the implementing agency would enter into a Memorandum of Agreement with the lawmaker and the Napoles-controlled NGO. Thereafter, Janet Lim Corporation employees would follow up again with the DBM for the release of the Notice of Cash Allocation addressed to the implementing government agency. Upon the release of the Notice of Cash Allocation, the implementing agency would issue check payments to the selected NGOs. The agency's head usually gets 10% of the project cost as commission. The implementing agency does not check the veracity of the documents submitted by the selected NGOs. [10] However, no project is implemented. Instead, Napoles would pocket the remainder of the funding of the ""project,"" after deducting the commissions of the lawmaker and other government officials involved. Napoles allegedly implemented the scheme in 2007 through Cagas's endorsement of his PDAF livelihood projects amounting to PHP 16 million. The livelihood projects for the municipalities in the 1st District of Davao del Sur involve financial assistance for farm tools and implements, and technical assistance through video courses and printed materials. For the said projects, Cagas allegedly received a total of PHP 9.3 million through Zenaida G. Cruz-Ducut (Cruz-Ducut), his authorized representative. [11] Through contacts of Napoles in the DBM, namely Relampagos, Nuñez, Paule, and Bare, Special Allotment Release Order Nos. ROCS-07- 0046 and ROCS-07-03351 were released on January 10, 2007 and February 15, 2007, respectively. Each Special Allotment Release Order is for PHP 8 million, for a total of PHP 16 million, to finance Cagas's projects. Cagas then wrote letters to the head of Technology Resource Center, Antonio Y. Ortiz (Ortiz), identifying the agency as project implementor, with Countrywide Agri and Rural Economic and Development Foundation, Inc. and Philippine Social Development Foundation, Inc. as project partners. Both of the NGOs were allegedly controlled by Napoles. [12] For his part, Ortiz allegedly received commissions amounting to 10% of the project or equivalent to PHP 1.6 million. [13] Technology Resource Center executed separate Memorandums of Agreement with the said NGOs. Disbursement Voucher Nos. 012007040604 and 012007040596 were issued for Check Nos. 850421 and 850438, respectively, amounting to PHP 7.68 million each, or a total of PHP 15.36 million. However, no financial assistance for farm implements, livelihood materials, and training were delivered to the supposed beneficiaries. [14] Technology Resource Center relied on the endorsements of Cagas in allowing the negotiated procurement, signing of the Memorandum of Agreement, the disbursement vouchers, and other documents related to the transaction. [15] The Commission on Audit issued Special Audits Office Report No. 2012-03 on the PDAF allocations of lawmakers from 2007 to 2009, including Cagas's livelihood projects in 2007. The Report confirmed the whistleblowers' accounts on the existence of the pork barrel scam. The Commission observed that the implementing agencies, including Technology Resource Center, did not actually implement the PDAF projects. The direct releasing of funds to the NGOs solely upon the instructions of the sponsoring lawmaker violates DBM regulations requiring executive endorsements from supervising departments. The NGOs were also selected as partners in the PDAF projects without public bidding. The supposed organizations have dubious addresses and no track record in executing government projects. Some suppliers identified by the NGOs denied having transacted with them. Their reported beneficiaries were unknown or cannot be located at their given addresses. The NGOs provided nonexistent addresses and other questionable documents. The disbursements from the Special Allotment Release Orders issued in relation to Cagas's 2007 PDAF amounting to PHP 15.36 million were unliquidated. [16] On November 29, 2013, the National Bureau of Investigation filed a Complaint before the Ombudsman recommending the prosecution of Cagas, Napoles, Cruz-Ducut, Ortiz, former Technology Resource Center Deputy Director General Dennis L. Cunanan (Cunanan), Technology Resource Center employees Francisco B. Figura (Figura) and Marivic V. Jover (Jover), Philippine Social Development Foundation, Inc. President Evelyn de Leon (de Leon), Countrywide Agri and Rural Economic and Development Foundation, Inc. President Mylene T. Encarnacion (Encarnacion), and Commission on Audit State Auditors Jerry A. Calayan (Calayan) and Sylvia Montes (Montes) for the following crimes: malversation of public funds, direct bribery, and violations of Section 3(b), (e), (g), and j) of Republic Act No. 3019 and Republic Act No. 6713. Napoles, De Leon, Encarnacion, and Cruz-Ducut were additionally recommended for prosecution for corruption of public officials and violation of Section 4 of Republic Act No. 3019. [17] On February 2, 2015, the Field Investigation Office of the Ombudsman filed a Complaint against Cagas, Cruz-Ducut, Ortiz, Ortiz's assistant Maria Rosalinda M. Lacsamana (Lacsamana), Cunanan, Technology Resource Center Sales and Promotion Supervisor V Belina A. Concepcion (Concepcion), Jover, Napoles, de Leon, Encarnacion, and Representative Eulogio D. Rodriguez (Rodriguez) for direct bribery and malversation of public funds and violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019. The Field Investigation Office also filed a Complaint against Cagas, Ortiz, and Napoles for violation of Section 3(b) of Republic Act No. 3019. [18] The Ombudsman directed those charged to file their counter- affidavits. [19] In his Counter-Affidavit, Cagas denied the accusations against him. He argued that his role was only recommendatory, and it was Technology Resource Center as the implementing agency who was accountable for the use and disbursement of the funding in his PDAF project. Cagas alleged that there was no evidence showing his conspiracy with those charged. He denied having received any commission from Napoles. He also claimed that his signatures in the Special Allotment Release Orders were forged. [20] Cruz-Ducut assailed Luy's credibility, invoking the inadmissibility of his testimony due to the res inter alios acta rule. She claimed that the entries in Luy's daily financial records and his hard drive were not assured to be truthful or accurate. She insisted that the Complaints against her should be dismissed because there was no allegation that she was being sued in her official capacity. [21] The Technology Resource Center officers disclaimed liability and alleged that they had no direct dealings with Cagas or with Countrywide Agri and Rural Economic and Development Foundation, Inc. and Philippine Social Development Foundation, Inc. Cunanan denied his involvement in the scheme since it was Ortiz, his former superior, and his assistant, Lacsamana, who dealt with the project and supervised the processing of the PDAF. As for the other officers in Technology Resource Center, they assumed that the projects were regular and legitimate. Cunanan signed the disbursement vouchers in his ministerial duties as officer-in-charge when Ortiz was on leave. He contended that he did not receive any commission, and when he assumed the Director General position, he initiated the investigation of all PDAF-funded projects of Technology Resource Center. [22] Figura claimed that he signed the checks issued to the NGOs as part of his ministerial duties. He claimed that he was pressured by Ortiz and Cunanan to expedite the issuance of the Memorandum of Agreement and processing of the papers. [23] Meanwhile, Jover contended that the disbursement vouchers passed through her office for proper coding of account. She claimed that her duty to approve disbursement vouchers was ministerial, and that her certification on the adequacy of funds did not state that the expenses were authorized and lawful. [24] Lacsamana alleged that there was no evidence showing her participation in the conspiracy. She said her ministerial duties were limited to checking the proper signing of supporting documents of the project. She also denied involvement in the selection, endorsement, and approval of the project and its partners. She claimed that her signature in the disbursement voucher is dispensable. [25] For her part, Concepcion stated that she relied on the endorsement of the Office of the Director General that the documents were facially complete. She said her internal memorandum recommending the release of the funds was also endorsed for approval by Technology Resource Center's legal department. [26] Commission on Audit State Auditor Montes claimed that she was not the supervising auditor of Technology Resource in 2007 and 2009. Meanwhile, Auditor Calayan claimed his responsibility was limited to supervising and monitoring the progress of the audit work in Technology Resource Center. He alleged that he was not remiss in his duties since he issued a management letter seeking action on the Commission on Audit findings on PDAF. [27] As regards DBM officials, Relampagos et al., in their Joint Counter-Affidavit, denied any participation in the release of public funds to the Napoles-controlled NGOs. They claimed that it was the Budget and Management Bureau that issued the subject Special Allotment Release Orders and not Relampagos's office. They alleged that they had no means of expediting the processing and release of the Special Allotment Release Orders and Notice of Cash Allocations, which go through several offices before finally arriving to Relampagos. They also denied talking directly to Napoles or Luy. They admitted to entertaining follow-up calls from all stakeholders in government on the status of budget releases, but denied expediting its release. [28] For her part, Napoles contended that the Complaints were insufficient in form and substance because the time, place, and the specific acts constituting the offense were unspecified. She claimed that the testimonies of whistleblowers were not credible and full of inconsistencies. She denied instructing the whistleblowers to create bogus foundations and to enter into anomalous projects. She alleged that her signatures were forged by the whistleblowers. [29] After further exchange of pleadings from those charged, the Ombudsman issued the June 2, 2016 Consolidated Resolution, [30] finding probable cause against Cagas, Ortiz, Cunanan, Figura, Concepcion, Jover, Technology Resource Center Internal Auditor Maurine E. Dimaranan, Cruz-Ducut, Relampagos, Nuñez, Paule, Bare, Napoles, and Encarnacion for two counts each of malversation under Article 217 of the Revised Penal Code and violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019. It also indicted Cagas and Ortiz for two counts of direct bribery, and Napoles for two counts of corruption of public officials under Article 212 of the Revised Penal Code. . . . The Ombudsman found prima facie evidence as regards the existence of the pork barrel scheme involving legislators, government agencies, and NGOs under Napoles's control, acting in concert to systematically divert a legislator's PDAF through nonexistent or ghost projects implemented by Napoles-controlled NGOs. [32] The modus operandi was evident from the Commission on Audit Report of the disbursement vouchers, checks, memorandum of agreement, letters, and other evidence such as Luy's ledger, and the sworn statements of Luy, Suñas, Sula, and Simonette Briones, all former employees and dummies of Napoles attesting to the scheme. [33] The Ombudsman found probable cause for violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019 against those who were involved in the processing and release of the PDAF disbursement. It held that Cagas and officers from Technology Resource Center and the DBM acted in conspiracy with Napoles and the officers of her controlled NGOs. [34] The Ombudsman believed that Relampagos et al. were contacts of Napoles in the DBM who expedited the release of the Special Allotment Release Orders and Notice of Cash Allocations for Cagas's PDAF-funded project. [35] The Ombudsman found that these public officers were manifestly partial to Napoles and extended undue favor to her controlled NGOs. Countrywide Agri and Rural Economic and Development Foundation, Inc. and Philippine Social Development Foundation, Inc. were selected without the benefit of public bidding. [36] Moreover, there was unusual accommodation in the examination, processing, and approval of Technology Resource Center officers of payment to the NGOs. Disbursement Voucher Nos. 012007040604 and 012007040596 were accomplished, signed, and approved all in the same day. [37] No prior due diligence was conducted and Technology Resource Center failed to monitor the obligations of the NGOs after the funding was released to them. [38] The Ombudsman held that there was evident bad faith with several public officers benefitting from the PDAF's diversion. It caused undue injury to the government amounting to PHP 15.36 million, which remains unliquidated. There was also no evidence that the said amount was spent on the alleged livelihood projects of Cagas. Through Napoles's directive, her employees fabricated documents and a list of fictitious beneficiaries to make it appear that the projects were implemented. [39] Unwarranted benefits were extended to Napoles and her NGOs which, despite having no capacity to implement the livelihood projects, were given funding with ""indecent haste."" [40] The Ombudsman also found probable cause for malversation. Citing Belgica v. Executive Secretary Ochoa, [41] the Ombudsman held that it was the lawmaker who exercised actual control and custody of the PDAF, which allowed him or her to participate in the release of the funds to implement their PDAF project. [42] Thus, the Ombudsman held that Cagas was an accountable public officer for his PDAF. [43] Relampagos et al. from the DBM facilitated the transfer of funds to Ortiz et al. in Technology Resource Center, which served as a conduit for the diversion of funds to Napoles- controlled NGOs. [44] The Ombudsman held that there is also probable cause for direct bribery based on Luy's testimony that Cagas received the PHP 9.3 million through Cruz-Ducut. Luy also stated that he saw Ortiz receive 10% of the amounts in the subject Special Allotment Release Orders, or PHP 1.6 million in total. [45] These commissions were given to divert the funding of the PDAF to Napoles-controlled NGOs. [46] As regards Napoles, the Ombudsman also found probable cause for corruption of public officials. [47] The Ombudsman directed its Field Investigation Office to further conduct fact-finding on the criminal and administrative liabilities of Relarnpagos et al., who ""may have received commissions and/or kickbacks from Napoles[.]"" [48] Conspiracy was also found to be present among those charged in the Complaints. The roles that each played were indispensable to divert the PDAF. Without the facilitation of DBM officials, and the certifications, approvals, and signatures of the responsible officers in Technology Resource Center, the funds would not have been transferred to Countrywide Agri and Rural Economic and Development Foundation, Inc. and Philippine Social Development Foundation, Inc. [49] The defenses of those charged, such as good faith and regularity in the performance of duties, are matters for trial. [50] The Ombudsman did not appreciate their denials and held them to be weak against the categorical accusations of the whistleblowers. [51] The charges against Montes and Technology Resource Center Budget Officer IV Consuelo Lilian Espiritu were dropped because they have no participation in the transactions. [52] Calayan was also not charged because he issued several Audit Observation Memoranda against Technology Resource Center. [53] Moreover, the Ombudsman dropped the charges of violation of Section 3(b), (g), and j) and Section 4 of Republic Act No. 3019, and Republic Act No. 6713, for these were modalities of committing Section 3(e) for which probable cause had been determined. [54] Relampagos et al. filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which the Office of the Ombudsman denied in the Consolidated Order dated November 17, 2016. [55] On April 21, 2017, Napoles filed her Petition docketed as G.R. Nos. 230849-51. [56] On May 15, 2017, Relampagos et al. filed their Joint Petition docketed as G.R. Nos. 231161 and 231584. [57] On June 5, 2017, the Petitions were consolidated and the respondents were required to file their respective Comments. [58] ... In G.R. Nos. 230849-51, Napoles contends that the Complaints are insufficient in form and substance because the allegations are too sweeping and general. She claims that there is no statement on the particular time, place, and specific acts for which she is being charged. Napoles alleges that the testimonies of the whistleblowers are self-serving and inadmissible for being hearsay. She claims that the Ombudsman gravely abused its discretion in accepting the testimonies as ""gospel truth"" when the whistleblowers are also supposedly guilty themselves. [66] Napoles argues that the Ombudsman should not have charged her with violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019 and malversation of public funds because she is not a public officer. She insists that there was no specific acts showing her supposed planning and preparation in the diversion of the PDAF. For conspiracy to exist, there must be proof and not mere conjectures or assumptions. [67] Napoles adds that there was also no allegation as regards the specific act or omission for corruption of public officers. [68] Napoles also claims that the charge of malversation was misplaced and has no basis because Cagas is not the accountable officer for his PDAF. According to her, Cagas's role was merely recommendatory. Napoles contends that it is the implementing agency that actually designates the NGOs, and that the agency has the custody of the funding and the responsibility to account for it. [69] Napoles alleges that the Complaints are founded on self-serving Affidavits intending to destroy her reputation. She argues that they do not satisfy the requirement of clear and convincing evidence required to establish the presence of conspiracy. [70] She insists that the Ombudsman's finding of probable cause was based on hearsay, self-serving, incredible, and inadmissible testimonies of the whistleblowers. [71] According to Napoles, the Ombudsman should have been more cautious in relying on the statements of the co-conspirators given that they come from ""polluted sources."" [72] She also invokes the res inter alios acta rule, which requires independent evidence of the conspiracy proving its existence, which she argues to be absent in this case. [73] In G.R. Nos. 231161 and 231584, Relampagos et al. insist that they have no participation in the scheme because it is the Budget and Management Bureau-G in the DBM who is responsible for preparing, processing, and reviewing Special Allotment Release Orders and Notice of Cash Allocations. Relampagos only signed SARO No. ROCS-07-003351 as the DBM Secretary's alternate but he did not sign SARO No. ROCS-07- 00046. [74] Relampagos et al. refer to PDAF proceedings of other legislators where DBM Budget and Management Bureau-G Director Carmencita N. Delantar allegedly testified that Relampagos's office has no participation in the issuance of Special Allotment Release Orders. [75] The Special Allotment Release Orders were allegedly hand-carried by Director Delantar to the office of Relampagos for him to sign when the DBM Secretary is absent. [76] Relampagos et al. contend that the Special Allotment Release Orders were released beyond the prescribed period in the DBM Charter, negating the claim that their processing was expedited. [77] They argue that there was no recital of facts as to how they facilitated the processing and issuance of the Special. Allotment Release Orders and Notice of Cash Allocations. They insist that the Ombudsman did not state its criteria for saying that these documents were released with undue haste. [78] Moreover, they also stress that no portion of the PDAF went to the DBM. [79] Relampagos et al. argue that they could not have committed malversation because they are not the accountable officers. According to them, the DBM has no control of the funds of property released to the agency. The Department is charged with allotment of budget through the issuance of either a Comprehensive Agency Budget Matrix or a Special Allotment Release Order. These allotments authorize agencies to enter into obligations. It is the agency's application of the budget which gives rise to the charge of malversation, and not the issuance of Special Allotment Release Order per se. [80] Relampagos et al. contend that the mere signing of the Special Allotment Release Orders and Notice of Cash Allocations is not indicative of conspiracy, [81] as held in Arias v. Sandiganbayan. [82] They assert that the presumption of regularity of the performance of their duties applies. [83]",We do not find grave abuse of discretion. The Petitions are dismissed.,"We find that the present Petitions are moot. The Sandiganbayan found probable cause and issued warrants of arrest against those involved in the diversion of the PHP 16-million PDAF of Cagas. We upheld this in Relampagos v. Sandiganbayan. [113] It involved the same petitioners in G.R. Nos. 231161 and 231584 and the same Special Allotment Release Order Nos. ROCS-07-03351 and ROCS-07-00046 as in the present case. In that case, petitioner Relampagos filed a joint omnibus motion to dismiss the case, hold the warrants of arrest in abeyance, and issue a bill of particulars. The Sandiganbayan denied the motion, which prompted the filing of the petition in Relampagos. In denying the petition, the Court held: . . . Given that there was already a judicial determination of probable cause of the Sandiganbayan involving the PHP 16-million PDAF of Cagas diverted through Special Allotment Release Order Nos. ROCS-07-03351 and ROCS-07-00046, the instant Petition assailing the Ombudsman's determination of probable cause has already been mooted. II Nevertheless, the Petitions still fail as there is no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Ombudsman. There was nothing arbitrary in its finding of probable cause, and its findings are supported by substantial evidence. . . . The Ombudsman's finding of probable cause to file an information against a public official or employee is not a determination of guilt or innocence. [118] . . . Petitioners' objections on the admissibility of the statements of the whistleblowers are irrelevant for purposes of preliminary investigation. During this exploratory stage, the Ombudsman sufficiently established its reasonable basis to file criminal charges against petitioners. The whistleblowers categorically identified petitioner Napoles's involvement in the scheme. She was not only a participant, but the mastermind and at the center of the modus operandi. The accounts of the whistleblowers clearly show Napoles's connection to all those implicated in the scam, including petitioners Relampagos et al., whom Luy categorically identified to be their DBM contacts. . . . III We first discuss the common allegation of petitioners as regards the existence of conspiracy. . . . Here, the presence of conspiracy can be inferred from the coordinated actions of petitioners-from the project identification of Cagas to its endorsement for funding in the DBM, to the allotment of budget by Technology Resource Center and its subsequent release of checks to Napoles-controlled NGOs. We see no grave abuse of discretion in the Ombudsman's finding of conspiracy: . . . Petitioners Relampagos et al. cannot rely on Arias v. Sandiganbayan. Generally, heads of office can rely on the work of his or her subordinates, and that there must be some other grounds aside from signature or approval to sustain the presence of conspiracy. [141] However, it is settled that the doctrine in Arias is not absolute: . . . Here, it is not the mere signature of petitioner Relampagos in Special Allotment Release Order No. ROCS-07-003351 for which they were impleaded in the Complaints. Rather, they were included in the charges because petitioner Relampagos et al. were alleged to be the ""contacts of petitioner Napoles within DBM who helped expedite the release of [Special Allotment Release Orders] and [Notice of Cash Allocations] relating to the PDAF."" [143] Thus, their citation of Arias is misplaced. Matters of their actual involvement in the processing and release of the Special Allotment Release Orders require the presentation of evidence and thus should be reserved for trial. IV We uphold the finding of probable cause for all the charges that the Ombudsman sustained against petitioners. . . . V Petitioner Napoles cannot insist that Cagas was not accountable for his PDAF. [158] The PDAF existed by virtue of the office that he held. The discretion and authority for its use fall on Cagas and not on the implementing agency. He identified the project, the implementing agency, and partner NGOs-without which, the funding would not have been released and its diversion to Countrywide Agri and Rural Economic and Development Foundation, Inc. and Philippine Social Development Foundation, Inc. would not have been possible. Thus, Cagas is an accountable officer for his PDAF, which is under his effective control, and he may be held liable for malversation under Article 217 of the Revised Penal Code. Similarly, the Ombudsman found probable cause for the indictment of Cagas and Technology Resource Center Head Ortiz for direct bribery, there being substantial evidence that they received kickbacks from Napoles. . . . There being a substantial probability that petitioner Napoles corrupted Cagas and Technology Resource Center Head Ortiz in the diversion of the PDAF through the pork barrel scam, the Ombudsman did not err in finding probable cause for malversation and corruption of public officers under Aliicle 217 and 212 of the Revised Penal Code, respectively.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petitions for Certiorari in G.R.

LIM, JR., RESPONDENTS.","Arlo Aluminum Company, Inc. (Arlo Aluminum) is a domestic corporation engaged in fabricating customized aluminum moldings for construction companies. Arlo Aluminum hired the following employees at a per-project basis: Joseph M. Sangalang (Sangalang), Leonil M. Santor (Santor), Paul O. Giray (Giray), Rodolfo C. Ceñir, Sr. (Ceñir), Jerson C. Velasco (Velasco), and Leo C. Hadap (Hadap). On November 2014, Sangalang was terminated from employment. Santor, Giray, Ceñir, Velasco, and Hadap were likewise dismissed on December 2014. On January 7, 2015, Sangalang, Santor, Giray, Ceñir, Velasco, and Hadap (collectively, ""employees"") filed before the labor arbiter a Complaint for unfair labor practice, union busting, reinstatement, illegal dismissal, nonpayment of service incentive leave and 13th month pay, regularization, moral and exemplary damages, and attorney's fees. Alleging that they were regular employees, they claimed in their Position Paper that they had been working for Arlo Aluminum for over a year when they were removed from employment. They asserted that they were illegally dismissed before the assigned projects expired due to their membership with the newly formed worker's union. Arlo Aluminum, in its Position Paper, stated that the employees were hired as project employees with the specific duration and nature of their employment made known to them. It explained that their employment was coterminous with the completion of the project or phase thereof that they were assigned to. On July 14, 2015, the Labor Arbiter Lilia S. Savari dismissed the employees' Complaint. The labor arbiter found that the employees were project employees who were terminated from employment because their project contracts had ended. The employees filed a Memorandum of Partial Appeal with the National Labor Relations Commission, which reversed the labor arbiter's Decision, stating that Arlo Aluminum failed to prove that the employees knew of the duration and scope of the projects for which they were engaged, making them regular employees who were illegally dismissed. Arlo Aluminum filed a Petition for Certiorari before the Court of Appeals, alleging that the National Labor Relations Commission gravely abused its discretion in finding that the employees were regular employees. The Court of Appeals, in its June 29, 2017 Decision, granted Arlo Aluminum's Petition, nullified the NLRC Decision, and reinstated the labor arbiter's Decision, declaring that the employees knowingly entered into project employment contracts with Arlo Aluminum which ""substantially complied with the requisites of designation of a specific project or undertaking and duration of their engagement as well as the nature of their job."" Hence, they filed a petition before this Court.",The Petition has no merit.,"The core issue for this Court's resolution is whether the Court of Appeals was correct in declaring petitioners Joseph M. Sangalang, Leonil M. Santor, Paul O. Giray, Rodolfo C. Ceñir, Sr., Jerson C. Velasco, and Leo C. Hadap as project employees of respondent Arlo Aluminum Company Inc., and consequently, holding their dismissal to be valid. For one to be a project employee, this Court in Gadia v. Sykes Asia, Inc. held that ""the employer must show compliance with two (2) requisites, namely that: (a) the employee was assigned to carry out a specific project or undertaking; and (b) the duration and scope of which were specified at the time they were engaged for such project."" The Court found that petitioners' employment contracts boldly state: (a) the specific project they were assigned to carry out; and (b) the duration and scope of their employment upon their engagement. Moreover, the functions petitioners perform do not dictate one's type of employment; that the particular job assigned to an employee is within the employer's regular or usual business does not automatically make them a regular employee, especially since respondent company is engaged in ""distinct, separate, and identifiable"" projects, consistent with the nature of the construction industry. The repeated rehiring of petitioners for multiple, separate projects, especially given the intervals between engagements, does not regularize their project-based employment. While respondent company failed to submit a report of petitioners' employment termination after each project had expired, non-compliance with one or two indicators listed in Department Order No. 19 will not transform project-based employment into regular employment, especially when the cumulative evidence shows valid project contracts and intermittent work. Accordingly, petitioners are project employees, and their termination from employment, after their work had been completed, was not illegal dismissal.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DENIED. The June 29, 2017 Decision and October 10, 2017 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA­-G.R.

"G.R. No. 204868, December 07, 2022","TOLEDO CONSTRUCTION CORP. EMPLOYEES' ASSOCIATION-ADLO-KMU, REPRESENTED BY DANILO REYES, PETITIONER, VS. TOLEDO CONSTRUCTION CORP., DUMAGUETE BUILDERS AND EQUIPMENT CORP., CASTELWEB TRADING AND DEVELOPMENT CORP., KJP RESOURCES, INC., ONE TRADING CORP., AND JANUARIO RODRIGUEZ, THE OWNER-PRESIDENT­CHAIRMAN OF ALL RESPONDENT CORPORATIONS, RESPONDENTS.","In September 2003, Toledo Construction Corporation Employees' Association-ADLO-KMU (Union) affiliated with ADLO-KMU. Allegedly due to their union activities, Union members were interrogated by Toledo Construction Corporation (Toledo). Thus, the Union filed a preventive mediation case before the National Conciliation and Mediation Board. On September 16, 2003, Toledo issued a memorandum to Danilo Reyes, the Union president, offering him the position of ""office purchaser,"" which he declined. Toledo Human Resource Development Officer Virgie Valenzuela then told Danilo Reyes the following day that he was being placed on ""floating status"" because he refused Toledo's offer. Less than a week after, Toledo issued a memorandum to Danilo Reyes telling him not to report to work anymore beginning October 1, 2003. From September 24, 2003 to October 28, 2003, Toledo issued several other letters to a total of 16 Union officers and members. They were all dismissed from service based on various grounds. As a result, the Union filed a Notice of Strike on October 28, 2003. Upon request of Toledo, the secretary of labor issued an Order dated November 13, 2003, assuming jurisdiction over the labor dispute. The labor secretary directed the parties to desist from taking any action that might aggravate the situation. On December 6, 2003, Toledo dismissed Union secretary Kenneth Canlom from service which prompted the Union to conduct a picket. Toledo then continued to dismiss 65 more Union officers and members from service. Thus, from January 26 to 28, 2004, the Union filed seven complaints for illegal dismissal, unfair labor practice, and non-payment of 13th month pay, service incentive leave pay, rest day, and emergency cost of living allowance. The Union named Toledo, Dumaguete Builders and Equipment Corporation (Dumaguete), and Januario Rodriguez (Rodriguez) as respondents. On February 11, 2004, Toledo filed an illegal strike complaint against the Union, its officers, and members. Consequently, the seven illegal dismissal complaints, Notice of Strike, and illegal strike complaint were all consolidated into a certified case. On February 24, 2005, the National Labor Relations Commission (the Commission) rendered a Decision on the certified case, declaring the strike illegal, but declaring several employees illegally dismissed and entitled to monetary awards. Upon motion for reconsideration, the Commission rendered a February 22, 2006 Decision modifying its earlier Decision. This Decision became final and executory on March 16, 2006. An Entry of Judgment was issued on March 22, 2006. Both parties filed Petitions for Certiorari before the Court of Appeals. On December 20, 2006, the Court of Appeals reversed the Commission's Decision but only insofar as it declared Andres Fulgueras not illegally dismissed. The Court of Appeals reinstated the February 24, 2005 Decision of the Commission declaring Andres Fulgueras illegally dismissed. On February 8, 2007, the Computation Division of the Commission pegged the monetary awards for all employees to P6,430,538.61. On August 13, 2007, the Commission issued a Writ of Execution directing its Quezon City sheriff to collect the amount of the monetary award and the execution fee from Toledo. The sheriff was able to garnish funds in the name of Toledo deposited with the Bank of Commerce, but this amounted only to P12,670.00. On February 10, 2009, Toledo filed an Urgent Motion to Quash and/or Recall the Writ of Execution. On March 10, 2009, the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Land Transportation Office received a copy of a March 3, 2009 Notice of Levy which commanded its annotation on the registration of several vehicles in Toledo's name to satisfy the remaining portion of the judgment award. However, prior to the transmittal of the Notice of Levy from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Land Transportation Office to the Diliman District Office, Toledo was able to register the vehicles in Dumaguete's and Castelweb Trading and Development Corporation's (Castelweb) names. Dumaguete and Castelweb filed their respective third-party claims on the vehicles in their name which were subjects of the levy. The Land Transportation Office issued a memorandum to Dumaguete, informing it of the cancellation of the vehicles' transfers of ownership. The vehicles were then reverted to Toledo. On May 28, 2010, the Commission denied Toledo's Urgent Motion to Quash and/or Recall the Writ of Execution. It also dismissed the third-party claim filed by Dumaguete and Castelweb. On September 30, 2010, the Commission issued a Resolution ordering the release of the garnished funds in Toledo's account and dismissed the Union’s Motion for Partial Reconsideration with Manifestation, which prayed for the enforcement of the monetary award against Dumaguete and Rodriguez. On October 20, 2010, the Union filed an Urgent Motion for Clarification. It argued that both Toledo and Dumaguete are owned and controlled by the Rodriguez family, engaged in the same business, and that Toledo fraudulently transferred its properties. The Union prayed that the Commission pierce the corporate veil of all five corporations (including KJP Resources and One Trading, incorporated after judgment) and hold them jointly and severally liable with Rodriguez. The Commission treated the Urgent Motion for Clarification as a second Motion for Reconsideration and denied it on November 30, 2010. On December 20, 2010, the Union filed a Petition for Relief from Judgment, praying that the September 30, 2010 Resolution be set aside, claiming extrinsic fraud when their counsel was induced by Commissioner Raul T. Aquino to believe that the proper remedy was to file an Urgent Motion for Clarification. The Commission dismissed the Petition for Relief from Judgment in its February 14, 2011 Resolution, finding no extrinsic fraud. From these Resolutions, the Union filed a Petition for Certiorari before the Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals dismissed the Petition, ruling that a petition for relief was not the proper remedy as the fraud alleged was not committed by the prevailing party. It also found no reason to pierce the corporate veils. On February 4, 2013, the Union filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari[51] before this Court, assailing the Decision of the Court of Appeals.",The Petition is granted.,"A petition for relief from judgment is an equitable remedy allowed only in exceptional cases. To invoke fraud as a ground for relief from judgment, the fraud must be extrinsic or collateral. This Court agrees that the Petition for Relief should have been granted. The Court of Appeals improperly relied on AFP Mutual Benefit Association v. Regional Trial Court, which resolved whether the fraud was extrinsic or intrinsic, not whether the fraud must be committed by the prevailing party. The essence of extrinsic fraud is the loss of a party's right to present its case. Here, Commissioner Aquino, the presiding commissioner handling petitioner's case, gave unsolicited advice to petitioner's counsel prompting him to file an Urgent Motion for Clarification instead of a petition for certiorari, thereby preventing petitioner from fully presenting its case. This constitutes extrinsic fraud committed against petitioner. The separate personality of a corporation is respected, but the doctrine of piercing the veil of corporate fiction applies where a corporation is used to evade obligations towards third parties, especially in labor disputes. The facts show a scheme employed by respondents to escape their financial obligations to petitioner. The timing of the deeds of sale and subsequent registrations of vehicles (occurring after the monetary award was fixed but prior to or immediately after the issuance of the Writ of Execution) reveals respondent Toledo's intention to escape its liability. Furthermore, Toledo retained control over the vehicles, as evidenced by its continuous payment of the Motor Vehicle User's Charge. This situation falls under the instance where the corporate veil is pierced when the corporate fiction is used as a vehicle for the evasion of an existing obligation. Thus, respondent corporations Toledo, Dumaguete, and Castelweb should be considered as one. Respondent Rodriguez is also liable as he was the signatory for respondent Toledo in the fraudulent deeds of sale executed between it and respondents Dumaguete or Castelweb. However, petitioner was unable to show evidence that the corporate personalities of KJP Resources and One Trading were used to evade liability. The doctrine of immutability of judgment recognizes exceptions, including when supervening events or circumstances transpire after the decisions' finality, making the decisions' execution unjust and inequitable. The fraudulent transfers to Dumaguete and Castelweb occurred after the decision became final and executory on March 16, 2006. These transfers and subsequent third-party claims are supervening events that have modified the situation of the parties such that execution of the judgment has become inequitable, impossible, or unfair. The constitutional protection accorded to labor requires that dishonest schemes intended to take away victories justly won by laborers must be rejected.","ACCORDINGLY , the Petition for Review on Certiorari is GRANTED. The Court of Appeals August 31, 2012 Decision and December 10, 2012 Resolution in CA-G.R. SP. No. 119872 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Respondents Toledo Construction Corporation, Dumaguete Builders and Equipment Corporation, Castelweb Trading and Development Corporation, and Januario Rodriguez arc solidarily liable for the judgment award by the National Labor Relations Commission.

They married on January 26, 1996, in Pinamungajan, Cebu without a marriage license, as Joseph was in a hurry to report for work abroad. During their marital union, Joseph was always outside of their conjugal home, gambling, drinking, substance using, and womanizing. In 2000, Joseph was ordered to disembark by his employer for engaging in drug trafficking in Mexico, earning almost a million pesos, which he immediately spent on vices. Sue Ann left for Dubai in October 2001, and Joseph left in December 2001, after which Sue Ann had no contact with him. On August 8, 2007, Sue Ann filed a Petition for Declaration of Nullity of Marriage before the RTC of Toledo City, Branch 59 on the ground of psychological incapacity under Article 36 of the Family Code and lack of marriage license. Expert witness Delgado concluded Joseph suffered from Anti-Social Personality Disorder. The RTC granted the nullity based on psychological incapacity. The Republic of the Philippines (OSG) appealed. The CA reversed the RTC Decision, finding the marriage VALID and subsisting, and failed to rule on the issue of lack of marriage license, prompting Sue Ann to file the present recourse.","The Court grants the petition. The Supreme Court found that Sue Ann failed to establish the psychological incapacity of Joseph based on the requirements set in Tan-Andal. However, the marriage is null and void for lack of a valid marriage license, as the parties did not qualify for the exemption under Article 34 of the Family Code (requiring five years of cohabitation as husband and wife prior to the marriage), having only become sweethearts in December 1995, thus making it impossible for them to have cohabited for five years prior to their January 26, 1996 marriage.","WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is GRANTED.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[8] Petitioner and Maria Eloisa Sarmiento Fouts (respondent) were in a relationship for 16 years. Respondent alleged that petitioner broke up with her on December 24, 2017 while they were celebrating Christmas in Hongkong. When they got back to the country, petitioner would come to their house in Antipolo City just to get her things then leave to spend the night with her lover. Respondent then asked petitioner to stop using her credit cards because the latter still owed her P3,000,000.00.[9] Later, petitioner started to demand that respondent leave the house and forced the latter to sign a deed of absolute sale over the property in her favor. Respondent refused to leave and sign the document. On January 12, 2018, because of respondent's continued refusal to leave the house, petitioner became angry and violent that she threatened to break everything and burn the house down. Petitioner's threats caused respondent to suffer chest pain and difficulty in breathing that she was brought to the hospital to seek medical attention.[10] Petitioner visited respondent in the hospital on the next day and tried to make amends. When they went home, respondent averred that petitioner forced her to take Rivotril, a drug that caused her to feel weak and groggy. On January 14, 2018, when respondent regained consciousness, she was already naked with petitioner on top her taking photos and videos of her. She then begged petitioner to delete the photos fearing that the latter might kill her or have her killed. Respondent followed petitioner to her car, but the latter repeatedly crushed her hand with the door of the car and pushed her hard so that she fell to the floor. She suffered fracture on her left wrist and thereafter underwent surgery and physical therapy.[11] For her part, petitioner countered that the complaint against her was filed to seek leverage for a case for reconveyance, annulment of title, and damages that she filed against respondent before the RTC of Antipolo City. She insisted that she alone purchased and built the house in Antipolo City and that respondent merely stayed therein after their break-up to seduce and provoke her.[12] Petitioner further narrated that after respondent was discharged from the hospital, the latter seduced petitioner to have sex with her and asked her to take pictures of them while they were naked. When petitioner asked respondent to delete the pictures, the latter became hysterical and followed petitioner towards her car. Respondent grabbed petitioner's hands to prevent her from entering the car and she fell to the ground as petitioner tried to escape.[13] Thus, on June 8, 2018, an Information for violation of Section 5(a) in relation to 2nd paragraph Section 6(a), of RA 9262 was filed in the RTC against petitioner. Petitioner moved to quash[14] the Information on the ground that the facts charged in the information do not constitute an offense because RA 9262 does not apply to lesbian relationships.[15] The Ruling of the RTC On July 24, 2019, the RTC issued the first assailed Order denying the motion to quash on the ground that Section 3(a) of RA 9262 is clear that any person could be liable for violation of its provisions whether the violator is a man or a woman. Citing the case of of Garcia v. Drilon[16] (Garcia), the RTC explained that the use of the gender-neutral word ""person"" who has or had a sexual or dating relationship with the woman under Section 3(a) encompasses lesbian relationships.[17] Petitioner sought reconsideration,[18] but the RTC denied it in the second assailed Order[19] dated November 28, 2019.","The Court denies the petition on two grounds: first, for being an improper remedy; second, for lack of merit.","The Court denies the petition on two grounds: first, for being an improper remedy; second, for lack of merit. The denial of a motion to quash information is an interlocutory order; hence, not appealable. Section 1 Rule 41 of the Rules of Court provides that an appeal may be taken from a judgment or final order that completely disposes of the case, or of a particular matter therein as may be allowed by the Rules. It is also explicit as to what judgments or final orders are not appealable, thus: No appeal may be taken from: (a) An order denying a motion for new trial or reconsideration; (b) An order denying a petition for relief or any similar motion seeking relief from judgment; (c) An interlocutory order; xxx It is a fundamental principle that an order denying a motion to quash is interlocutory in nature. As such, it is not appealable nor can it be the subject of a petition for certiorari[37] in light of the other available legal remedies.[38] In Enrile v. Manalastas[39] (Enrile), the Court explained that ""[t]he remedy against the denial of a motion to quash is for the movant accused to enter a plea, go to trial, and should the decision be adverse, reiterate on appeal from the final judgment and assign as error the denial of the motion to quash. The denial, being an interlocutory order, is not appealable, and may not be the subject of a petition for certiorari because of the availability of other remedies in the ordinary course of law."" ... At any rate, the Court deems it proper to discuss the issue raised in the petition if only to reiterate the earlier pronouncement in Garcia that RA 9262 applies to lesbian relationships. ... Contrary to petitioner's submission that the foregoing disquisition in Garcia was a mere obiter dictum, the Court notes that one of the issues raised in Garcia is the supposed discriminatory and unjust provisions of RA 9262 which are likewise violative of the equal protection clause.[42] The foregoing discussion of the Court as to the applicability of the law to lesbian relationships is clearly a resolution of the particular issue raised in Garcia and not a mere obiter dictum or an opinion of the Court. ... Applying the case of Garcia, the motion to quash information filed by the petitioner on the ground that the facts charged therein do not constitute an offense utterly lacks basis.","WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 241500, December 07, 2022","VIANNA BANTANG Y BRIONES,* PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","In an Information dated October 6, 2009, Vianna was charged with slight physical injuries defined and penalized under Article 266 of the Revised Penal Code, for willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attacking, assaulting and employing personal violence upon the person of AAA[241500], a minor, sixteen (16) years of age, thereby causing upon her physical injuries which required medical attendance for a period of less than nine (9) days and incapacitated her from performing her customary labor for the same period of time.

The evidence of the prosecution established that on April 9, 2009, at around 7:45 a.m., AAA241500, a 16-year-old minor was passing by the house of Vianna when the latter's mother, Teresita Bantang (Teresita), confronted her regarding an incident the night before where AAA241500 allegedly bad-mouthed Teresita. While Teresita was restrained by her other daughter, Vanessa, Vianna attacked AAA241500 by punching her twice near her left ear and at the back of her neck. AAA241500 suffered a 'contusion hematoma' on her left cheek.

Vianna admitted punching AAA241500, claiming she did so in defense of her mother because AAA241500 was cursing and pointing fingers at Teresita.

The Regional Trial Court (RTC) found Vianna guilty beyond reasonable doubt for violation of Section 10(a) of Republic Act No. 7610 (Child Abuse) instead of slight physical injuries, reasoning that when physical injuries are inflicted against a minor, RA 7610 is the proper charge. The RTC disbelieved Vianna's claim of defense of mother. The RTC sentenced her to six (6) months and one (1) day of prision correccional as minimum, to six (6) years of prision mayor in its maximum period, as maximum, plus damages.

Vianna appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA), claiming the prosecution failed to establish the element of intent to debase, degrade or demean the intrinsic worth of the minor victim, and assailed the probative value of the medical certificate. The CA affirmed Vianna's conviction for violation of Section 10(a) of RA 7610, holding that her intention could be inferred from the manner of the act and that she went overboard in defending her mother. The CA modified the decision only by imposing legal interest of six percent (6%) per annum on all monetary awards. Vianna moved for reconsideration, which was denied, prompting this Petition for Review on Certiorari.","WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED. The Decision dated March 22, 2018 and Resolution dated August 15, 2018 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 39575 are AFFIRMED with the following MODIFICATIONS:","The Court ruled that the petition, being a Rule 45 petition, primarily raises questions of fact, which are beyond the Court's jurisdiction, and none of the exceptions apply. Even if reviewed, the Court found the petition without merit.

First, the applicable law is Section 10(a) of Republic Act No. 7610 because the victim was a minor, consistent with the law's policy to provide stronger deterrence and special protection against child abuse, carrying a heavier penalty than slight physical injuries.

Second, the specific intent to debase, degrade, or demean the intrinsic worth and dignity of the child is not an indispensable element in all forms of violation of Section 10(a) of RA 7610, particularly where the charge is physical abuse, and the Information did not allege this specific intent. In any case, Vianna's act of punching the defenseless minor twice in the face and neck, resulting in a contusion hematoma, constituted physical abuse and implied an intent to debase and demean.

Third, the mitigating circumstance of passion and obfuscation was rejected because a considerable length of time had lapsed between the initial insult (the night before) and the physical infliction of injury (the following morning). Furthermore, her act was viewed as revenge, which does not originate from lawful sentiments.

Fourth, the conviction was based on the totality of evidence, particularly the positive testimony of AAA241500 and Vianna's own admission, making the medical certificate merely corroborative. The Court deferred to the RTC's findings on credibility.

Finally, the Court modified the sentence, applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law based on the nomenclature of the Revised Penal Code penalties adopted by the special law. Since no modifying circumstances existed, the minimum term was set within prision correccional maximum, and the maximum term within prision mayor minimum.","Petitioner VIANNA BANTANG y BRIONES is GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt for violating Section 10(a) of Republic Act No. 7610, and applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, this Court imposes upon her the indeterminate sentence of four (4) years two (2) months and one (1) day prision correccional , as minimum to six (6) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day prision mayor , as maximum.

Further, VIANNA BANTANG y BRIONES is ORDERED to pay AAA241500 the sum of ONE HUNDRED FIFTY PESOS (PHP 150.00) as actual damages, TWENTY THOUSAND PESOS (PHP 20,000.00) as moral damages, and TWENTY THOUSAND PESOS (PHP 20,000.00) as exemplary damages. All the monetary awards shall earn interest at the rate of 6% per annum reckoned from the finality of this Decision until full payment."
"A.C. No. 13443 (Formerly CBD Case No. 19-6136), December 07, 2022","BATANGUEÑO HUMAN RESOURCES, INC., AS REPRESENTED BY JOSELITO S. ATIENZA, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. PRECY C. DE JESUS,* RESPONDENT.","In its letter-complaint, BHRI, a recruitment agency, alleged that it deployed several persons to Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, under a one­-year contract duly approved by the Philippine Overseas Employment Agency (POEA), and that before the lapse of their contract, they were repatriated to the Philippines. Upon such repatriation, said employees, with the assistance of respondent as their counsel, filed a case against BHRI before the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) seeking that they be paid for the ""unexpired portion"" of their respective contracts. The employees, through respondent, filed their Position Paper.[2] When BHRI perused the employees' Position Paper and attachments, it noticed that the employees' POEA-approved contract attached to the Position Paper was altered. In particular, Clause 16 of the contract — which allows the termination of the employment contract before the expiration of the one-year period, provided that the project covered by such contract has been completed — had been unduly erased. Believing that such erasure was intentional, BHRI wrote letters to the employees, as well as to respondent, asking them to explain the glaring falsification as above-described. In response, the employees denied their participation in the deletion, claiming that they merely submitted their respective contracts to respondent. On the other hand, respondent conceded that the deletion of Clause 16 was done surreptitiously but without her permission, and that she apologized to BHRI and its counsel for the said deletion. She likewise admitted that: ( a ) the position papers she submitted in the labor case were outsourced from pleaders she contracted; ( b ) she did not properly supervise said pleaders in drafting the same; and ( c ) she met with the repatriated workers only once prior to the filing of the position paper, and that it was just a mere short conversation for around ten minutes. Moreover, respondent, in explaining that she was not charging any fee at the onset, claimed that ""all expenses from the drafting of pleadings, photocopy, and notary were shouldered by the law office."" Due to the foregoing, BHRI was constrained to file the instant administrative disciplinary Complaint against respondent.[3] In her Verified Answer,[4] respondent claimed that the preparation of the position papers of her clients, including herein repatriated employees, was outsourced to nonlawyers, and that she learned only of the issue of the omission of Clause 16 in the Reply to the position paper filed by BHRI's lawyer. She further alleged that upon learning that the POEA-approved contracts attached to the Position Paper were tampered, she immediately filed a pleading which sought to adopt the untampered version of the contract. She then averred that she explained said inadvertence with BHRI and its lawyers, and that since then, she already withdrew her appearance in the case.[5]","The Court affirms the findings and adopts the recommendation of the IBP, with modification as to the penalty imposed. Rules 18.02 and 18.03, Canon 18 of the CPR provide: CANON 18 – A LAWYER SHALL SERVE HIS CLIENT WITH COMPETENCE AND DILIGENCE. x x x x RULE 18.02 – A lawyer shall not handle any legal matter without adequate preparation. RULE 18.03 – A lawyer shall not neglect a legal matter entrusted to him, and his negligence in connection therewith shall render him liable. In this regard, case law instructs that ""[o]nce a lawyer agrees to take up the cause of a client, the lawyer owes fidelity to such cause and must always be mindful of the trust and confidence reposed in him. He owes entire devotion to the interest of the client, warm zeal in the maintenance and defense of his client' rights, and the exertion of his utmost learning and ability to the end that nothing be taken or withheld from his client, save by the rules of law, legally applied. A lawyer who performs his duty with diligence and candor not only protects the interest of his client, he also serves the ends of justice, does honor to the bar, and helps maintain the respect of the community to the legal profession.""[12] Here, respondent miserably failed to comply with these tenets. As she herself admitted: (a) she merely ""outsourced"" the drafting of her clients' Position Paper and did not properly supervise such drafting; and (b) she merely met her clients once and only engaged them in more or less than a ten-minute conversation. More significantly, it appears that she did not even scrutinize the draft of the Position Paper before signing and filing it to the NLRC, thus, paving the way for the submission of the altered contracts to the said Tribunal. Verily, when a lawyer takes a client's cause, they covenant that they will exercise due diligence in protecting his or her rights. The failure to exercise that degree of vigilance and attention expected of a good father of a family makes such lawyer unworthy of the trust reposed in them by their client and makes them answerable not just to his or her client but also to the legal profession, the courts and society,[13] as in this case. Moreover, the Court also notes that as counsel of record of the employees who signed the Position Paper on their behalf, her responsibility as such is governed by Section 3, Rule 7 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure (the prevailing Rules at the time the pleading was filed), which reads: Section 3. Signature and address. — Every pleading must be signed by the party or counsel representing him, stating in either case his address which should not be a post office box. The signature of counsel constitutes a certificate by him that he has read the pleading; that to the best of his knowledge, information, and belief there is good ground to support it; and that it is not interposed for delay. An unsigned pleading produces no legal effect. However, the court may, in its discretion, allow such deficiency to be remedied if it shall appear that the same was due to mere inadvertence and not intended for delay. Counsel who deliberately files an unsigned pleading, or signs a pleading in violation of this Rule, or alleges scandalous or indecent matter therein, or fails to promptly report to the court a change of his address, shall be subject to appropriate disciplinary action. (emphases and underscoring supplied) Thus, respondent's act of signing her clients' Position Paper is essentially a certification from her that she has read it, that she knew it to be meritorious, and it was not for the purpose of delaying the case. More importantly, it was her signature on said Position Paper which supplied the same with legal effect and elevated its status from a mere scrap of paper to that of a legal document.[14] Thus, by admitting that she was not the one who drafted the Position Paper and merely signed the same, she has committed a violation of this rule — an act of falsehood which is a ground for subjecting her to disciplinary action. Furthermore, by admitting that she merely ""outsourced"" the drafting of the Position Paper to nonlawyers (who are most likely paid for such service), respondent likewise violated Rules 9.01 and 9.02, Canon 9 of the CPR when she allowed nonlawyers to engage in unauthorized practice of law, viz.: CANON 9 – A LAWYER SHALL NOT, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ASSIST IN THE UNAUTHORIZED PRACTICE OF LAW. RULE 9.01 – A lawyer shall not delegate to any unqualified person the performance of any task which by law may only be performed by a member of the bar in good standing. RULE 9.02 – A lawyer shall not divide or stipulate to divide a fee for legal services with persons not licensed to practice law x x x The lawyer's duty to prevent, or at the very least not to assist in, the unauthorized practice of law is founded on public interest and policy. Public policy requires that the practice of law be limited to those individuals found duly qualified in education and character. The permissive right conferred on the lawyer is an individual and limited privilege subject to withdrawal if he or she fails to maintain proper standards of moral and professional conduct. The purpose is to protect the public, the court, the client, and the Bar from the incompetence or dishonesty of those unlicensed to practice law and not subject to the disciplinary control of the Court. It devolves upon a lawyer to see that this purpose is attained. Thus, the canons and ethics of the profession enjoin lawyers not to permit their professional services or name to be used in aid of, or to make possible the unauthorized practice of law by, any agency, personal or corporate. And, the law makes it a misbehavior on the lawyer's part, subject to disciplinary action, to aid a layman in the unauthorized practice of law.[15] Suffice it to say that respondent also failed in this regard. In view of the foregoing, the Court concludes that there is substantial evidence to hold respondent administratively liable, and accordingly, must be sanctioned therefor. In Spouses Mariano v. Abrajano,[16] the erring lawyer who violated Section 3, Rule 7 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure was given a reprimand with a stem warning. In Baldado v. Mejica,[17] a lawyer who violated Rules 18.02 and 18.03, Canon 18 of the CPR was suspended for three months, a mitigated penalty on account of his inexperience as a lawyer who recently passed the Bar examinations. In Ang v. Gupana[18] and Petelo v. Rivera,[19] the Court suspended therein erring lawyers for one (1) year for violating, among others, Rule 9.01, Canon 9 of the CPR. Given the circumstances of this case — and taking into consideration that this is respondent's first offense and that she had shown extreme remorse for her actions — the Court deems it appropriate to impose on her the penalty of suspension from the practice of law for a period of six months, with a stern warning that the commission of the same or similar offense in the future shall be dealt with more severely. As a final note, it must be emphasized that membership in the legal profession is bestowed upon individuals who are not only learned in law, but also known to possess good moral character. Lawyers should act and comport themselves with honesty and integrity in a manner beyond reproach, in order to promote the public's faith in the legal profession. Verily, of all classes and professions, lawyers are most sacredly bound to uphold the law, and as such, it is imperative that they live by the law.[20]","ACCORDINGLY, respondent Atty. Precy C. De Jesus (respondent) is found GUILTY of violating Section 3, Rule 7 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, Rules 9.01 and 9.02, Canon 9, and Rules 18.02 and 18.03, Canon 18 of the Code of Professional Responsibility.

"G.R. No. 246201, December 07, 2022","JOSE CO LEE, PETITIONER, VS. CITY OF OLONGAPO REPRESENTED BY ITS CITY MAYOR HON. ROLEN C. PAULINO, RESPONDENT.","Lee is the registered owner of a parcel of land located in East Tapinac, City of Olongapo. On July 4, 2012, Ordinance No. 12, Series of 2012 was passed by the Sangguniang Panlungsod of the City of Olongapo, reclassifying and rezoning some government properties into an institutional/mixed zone and mixed-use development for the construction of a new civic center complex. On December 23, 2014, a Notice of Negotiated Sale or Expropriation was sent to Lee, informing him that the City of Olongapo had approved a mixed-use development plan that would affect his property, and offered PHP 13,824,000.00 for it. Lee rejected the offer. On May 15, 2015, Ordinance No. 15, Series of 2015, authorized Mayor Rolen C. Paulino to expropriate parcels of land for the construction of a civic center complex. When the parties failed to reach an agreement, City of Olongapo filed a Complaint for Expropriation. Lee filed his Answer, alleging that the Complaint states no cause of action, that the expropriation was not for public use (but for the benefit of SM Prime Holdings, Inc.), that the Complaint was defective since the Mayor lacked proper authorization, and that the basis for just compensation was wrong. During a hearing on May 5, 2016, the City of Olongapo objected to the presentation of Lee’s Judicial Affidavit. Subsequently, the Regional Trial Court issued an Order dismissing Lee's affirmative defenses and declared that the City of Olongapo has a lawful right to expropriate his property.

However, the Court found that the fourth element of a valid expropriation (valid and definite offer) was lacking, as there was no evidence on record that after petitioner rejected the initial offer, the City of Olongapo exerted effort to renegotiate, thereby failing to exhaust all reasonable efforts to acquire the property by mutual agreement. Most critically, petitioner's right to procedural due process was violated when the Regional Trial Court overruled his affirmative defenses, particularly the claim that the taking was not for public use, without conducting a full-blown trial and hearing, which is required for defenses necessitating the presentation of evidence aliunde.

"G.R. No. 235595, December 07, 2022","CESAR C. PAITA, PETITIONER, VS. TASK FORCE ABONO FIELD INVESTIGATION OFFICE, OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSMAN, RESPONDENT.","This resolves the Petition for Review on
Certiorari[1] filed by Cesar C. Paita challenging the Decision[2] dated May 31, 2017 and Resolution[3] dated October 11, 2017, of the Court of Appeals in CA-GR. SP No. 138817, which affirmed the findings of the Ombudsman that held him liable for Grave Misconduct and Conduct Grossly Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service and meted on him the penalty of dismissal from service.
Facts
In 2004, the Department of Budget and Management (
DBM
) released funds amounting to PHP 291,200,000.00 for the implementation of the Farm Inputs and Farm Implements Program of the Department of Agriculture (
DA
). [4] One of the beneficiaries of the program was the Province of Camarines Norte, which received an allocation of PHP 5,000,000.00, for the purchase of agricultural supplies and inputs. [5] In line with this initiative, a Memorandum of Agreement (
MOA
) was entered into between DA Regional Executive Director Hector M. Sales and then Governor Jesus O. Typoco, Jr. (
Governor Typoco
). [6] At the time material to the controversy, Cesar C. Paita (
Paita
) was the Provincial Engineer of Camarines Norte. [7] Likewise, he was designated as one of the members of the Provincial Bids and Awards Committee (
PBAC
) of the province. [8] On April 16, 2004, the PBAC issued BAC Resolution No. 2004-01, which recommended ""Direct Contract (Exclusive Manufacturer/Distributor) Procurement of Liquid Fertilizer"" from the company Hexaphil Agriventures, Inc. (
Hexaphil
), amounting to PHP 5,000,000.00. [9] Hexaphil certified that it was the sole distributor of Hexaplus products within Region V. [10] Provincial Agriculturist Rodolfo B. Salamero and General Services Officer Jose Rene G Ruidera also issued a Certification dated April 20, 2004, stating that there is no suitable substitute for Hexaplus 11-7-11, as indicated in their purchase request, considering its quality and low price. [11] As one of the PBAC members, Paita signed BAC Resolution No. 2004-01. [12] Consequently, the provincial government issued the necessary disbursement vouchers and checks for the payment of the purchased liquid fertilizers. [13] On May 2, 2011, pursuant to Civil Service Commission (
CSC
) Resolution No. 99136, the Task Force Abono, Field Investigation Office, Office of the Ombudsman (
Ombudsman
), filed an administrative charge against Paita, among others. [14] As earlier mentioned, the Ombudsman issued a Decision dated November 12, 2013, which found Paita guilty of Grave Misconduct and Conduct Grossly Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service in connection with his participation in issuing BAC Resolution No. 2004-01. He was meted the penalty of dismissal from service. [15] Paita moved for a reconsideration of the said ruling, but the Ombudsman denied the same, in its Order dated May 27, 2015. [16] Undaunted, Paita brought the case before the Court of Appeals. [17] In its Decision[18] dated May 31, 2017, the Court of Appeals held that there was substantial evidence to hold Paita liable for grave misconduct when he signed the questioned Resolution which authorized direct contracting in the purchase of liquid fertilizers. [19] He failed to present evidence that he observed the necessary precautions to determine the qualifications of Hexaphil, and to verify whether there were other suitable substitutes in the market. [20] Suffice it to say, Paita failed to perform his duty as a member of the PBAC, which led to the consummation of a contract that was disadvantageous to the province of Camarines Norte and its constituents. His questionable conduct tainted the image and integrity of his office which made him also liable for conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service. [21] Thus, the Court of Appeals in its assailed Decision, affirmed the ruling of the Ombudsman. The dispositive portion of the Decision states: WHEREFORE, the petition for review is DENIED. Let a copy of this Decision be furnished the Secretary of Interior and Local Government and the Executive Director of the Government Procurement Policy Board. SO ORDERED. [22] Dissatisfied, Paita filed a motion for reconsideration, but the Court of Appeals denied the same in its Resolution dated October 11, 2017. [23] Unyielding, petitioner Paita elevated the case before this Court and raised the following assignment of errors: [24] I. WHETHER THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED WHEN IT DID NOT DISMISS THE COMPLAINT AGAINST PETITIONER DESPITE THE VIOLATION OF HIS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO SPEEDY DISPOSITION OF CASES II. WHETHER THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED WHEN IT AFFIRMED THE RULING OF THE OMBUDSMAN WHICH HELD PETITIONER GUILTY OF GRAVE MISCONDUCT III. WHETHER THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED WHEN IT AFFIRMED THE RULING OF THE OMBUDSMAN WHICH ADJUDGED PETITIONER LIABLE FOR CONDUCT PREJUDICIAL TO THE BEST INTEREST OF THE SERVICE IV. WHETHER THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED WHEN IT FAILED TO CONSIDER THE UNBLEMISHED LENGTH OF PUBLIC SERVICE OF PETITIONER AS A MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCE",The petition is partly meritorious.,"I.
There was no violation of Paita's right to a speedy disposition of his case
The right to speedy disposition of cases is enshrined under Article III, Sec. 16 of the present Constitution. [44] It states:
Section 16. All persons shall have the right to a speedy disposition of their cases before all judicial, quasi-judicial, or administrative bodies.
The fundamental law expressly provides that ""the constitutional right to a 'speedy disposition of cases' is not limited to the accused in criminal proceedings but extends to all parties in all cases, including civil and administrative cases, and in all proceedings, including judicial and quasi­judicial hearings."" [45] Verily, the right to a speedy disposition of a case is inextricably linked to a person's constitutional right to due process. [46] ""The protection of a person's constitutional right to procedural due process warrants the State's obligation to conform to the prescribed periods under our laws and rules."" [47] It bears to stress that even if the Constitution guarantees the right to speedy disposition of cases, it remains a flexible concept. [48] In Ombudsman v. Jurado (
Jurado
), this Court underscored that since the constitutional right to a speedy disposition of cases is relative, ""[a] mere mathematical reckoning of the time involved is not sufficient. Particular regard must be taken of the facts and circumstances peculiar to each case."" [49] It is a balancing test because ""[c]ourts should appraise a reasonable period from the point of view of how much time a competent and independent public officer would need in relation to the complexity of a given case."" [50] Just like the right to speedy trial, the right to a speedy disposition of a case is deemed violated only when the delays are unreasonable, arbitrary and oppressive. [51] It is ""inordinate delay in the resolution and termination of a preliminary investigation [that] will result in the dismissal of the case against the accused,"" [52] because in this instance, the accused's constitutional rights to due process and speedy disposition of cases will be impaired. In Palacpac v. Sandiganbayan, [53] this Court enumerated four factors which must be considered to determine whether a person's right to a speedy disposition of his or her case has been violated: (a) length of delay; (b) the reason for the delay; (c) the defendant's assertion of his or her right; and (d) prejudice to the defendant.
At this juncture, this Court underscores the doctrine laid down in Cagang v. Sandiganbayan, Fifth Division, [54] where it clarified that in cases before the Office of the Ombudsman where the party invoked his or her right to a speedy disposition of cases, ""the fact-finding investigation is not deemed included in the preliminary investigation for the purpose of determining the existence of inordinate delay, because the investigations are not yet adversarial proceedings against the accused."" [55] In Cagang, this Court elucidated in this wise:
When an anonymous complaint is filed or the Office of the Ombudsman conducts a motu proprio fact-finding investigation, the proceedings are not yet adversarial. Even if the accused is invited to attend these investigations, this period cannot be counted since these are merely preparatory to the filing of a formal complaint. At this point, the Office of the Ombudsman will not yet determine if there is probable cause to charge the accused.
This period for case build-up cannot likewise be used by the Office of the Ombudsman as unbridled license to delay proceedings. If its investigation takes too long, it can result in the extinction of criminal liability through the prescription of the offense.
Considering that fact-finding investigations are not yet adversarial proceedings against the accused, the period of investigation will not be counted in the determination of whether the right to speedy disposition of cases was violated. [56]
In Cagang, this Court abandoned the old rule in People v. Sandiganbayan, Fifth Division, [57] that included fact-finding investigations in the period for purposes of determining inordinate delay. In other words, to determine the presence of inordinate delay, ""a case is deemed to have commenced from the filing of the formal complaint and the subsequent conduct of the preliminary investigation."" [58] Therefore, as it stands, the time spent on fact-finding investigations is excluded.
Further to this point, in Cagang, this Court shed light on the framework of analysis in situations where the right to a speedy disposition of cases or the right to a speedy trial is invoked:
First, the right to speedy disposition of cases is different from the right to speedy trial. While the rationale for both rights is the same, the right to speedy trial may only be invoked in criminal prosecutions against courts of law. The right to speedy disposition of cases, however, may be invoked before any tribunal, whether judicial or quasi-judicial. What is important is that the accused may already be prejudiced by the proceeding for the right to speedy disposition of cases to be invoked.
Second, a case is deemed initiated upon the filing of a formal complaint prior to a conduct of a preliminary investigation. This Court acknowledges, however, that the Ombudsman should set reasonable periods for preliminary investigation, with due regard to the complexities and nuances of each case. Delays beyond this period will be taken against the prosecution. The period taken for fact-finding investigations prior to the filing of the formal complaint shall not be included in the determination of whether there has been inordinate delay.
Third, courts must first determine which party carries the burden of proof. If the right is invoked within the given time periods contained in current Supreme Court resolutions and circulars, and the time periods that will be promulgated by the Office of the Ombudsman, the defense has the burden of proving that the right was justifiably invoked. If the delay occurs beyond the given time period and the right is invoked, the prosecution has the burden of justifying the delay.
If the defense has the burden of proof, it must prove first, whether the case is motivated by malice or clearly only politically motivated and is attended by utter lack of evidence, and second, that the defense did not contribute to the delay.
Once the burden of proof shifts to the prosecution, the prosecution must prove first, that it followed the prescribed procedure in the conduct of preliminary investigation and in the prosecution of the case; second, that the complexity of the issues and the volume of evidence made the delay inevitable; and third, that no prejudice was suffered by the accused as a result of the delay.
Fourth, determination of the length of delay is never mechanical. Courts must consider the entire context of the case, from the amount of evidence to be weighed to the simplicity or complexity of the issues raised.
An exception to this rule is if there is an allegation that the prosecution of the case was solely motivated by malice, such as when the case is politically motivated or when there is continued prosecution despite utter lack of evidence. Malicious intent may be gauged from the behavior of the prosecution throughout the proceedings. If malicious prosecution is properly alleged and substantially proven, the case would automatically be dismissed without need of further analysis of the delay.
Another exception would be the waiver of the accused to the right to speedy disposition of cases or the right to speedy trial. If it can be proven that the accused acquiesced to the delay, the constitutional right can no longer be invoked.
In all cases of dismissals due to inordinate delay, the causes of the delays must be properly laid out and discussed by the relevant court.
Fifth, the right to speedy disposition of cases or the right to speedy trial must be timely raised. The respondent or the accused must file the appropriate motion upon the lapse of the statutory or procedural periods. Otherwise, they are deemed to have waived their right to speedy disposition of cases. [59] (Citations omitted)
Cagang was reiterated in the recent case of Republic v. Sandiganbayan (Special Second Division), [60] where this Court emphasized that with respect to the cases before the Office of the Ombudsman, neither the Constitution nor R.A. No. 6770 or the Ombudsman Act of 1989 provided for a specific period to be observed in terms of disposition of the pending cases. Nevertheless, the Constitution mandates for the Ombudsman to act ""promptly"" on these cases. Acting promptly means that ""the Ombudsman should set reasonable periods for preliminary investigation, with due regard to the complexities and nuances of each case."" [61]
Guided by these pronouncements, Paita 's contention that the Ombudsman took more than nine years to resolve the administrative complaint against him is completely erroneous. While he was investigated for his participation in the promulgation of BAC Resolution No. 2004-01 on April 16, 2004, the formal complaint against him was only filed on May 2, 2011. [62] Following Cagang, this interim fact-finding period is not included in the preliminary investigation for purposes of computing inordinate delay, since it is not an adversarial proceeding against him. Notably, the Ombudsman was able to resolve the administrative complaint when it rendered its Decision on November 12, 2013. [63] Thus, contrary to Paita's claim, the Ombudsman took only two years, more or less, to rule on his administrative liability.
As for the two-year period that it took the Ombudsman to decide on the administrative complaint, it explained that the time frame was not unreasonable considering that when the fertilizer scam issue broke out in 2004, more than 140 lawmakers were involved and investigated. [64] Thus, the complexity lies in the number of individuals involved, which entailed a review of voluminous records.
In this regard, Cagang stresses that the burden rests on the defense to prove two things: ""first, that the case took much longer than was reasonably necessary to resolve, and second, that efforts were exerted to protect their constitutional rights."" [65] Unfortunately, Paita failed to discharge this burden. A painstaking review of the records reveals that he did not endeavor to explain why the two-year period it took the Ombudsman to resolve the case against him was considered arbitrary, vexatious, and oppressive. In fact, his defense was anchored on the mistaken assumption that the Ombudsman took more than nine years to rule on his administrative liability. Moreover, it also appears from the records that this is the first time that he has raised the issue on the alleged violation of his constitutional right to a speedy disposition of his cases. Withal, the proceedings before the Court of Appeals are silent with respect to this issue, from which this Court can infer that he only raised the same for the first time on appeal before this Court.
On this score, jurisprudence [66] holds that ""[f]ailure to timely raise the alleged violation of [the] right operates against the defendant because sleeping on the right indicates his or her acquiescence to the delay.""
It behooves this Court to ponder why Paita failed to invoke his right the moment he claims to have already suffered the consequences of the alleged delay. Certainly, ""[t]he invocation of the constitutional right does not require a threat to the right to liberty. Loss of employment or compensation may already be considered as sufficient to invoke the right."" [67] Consequently, his belated assertion of his right also undoubtedly undermined his claim that he was prejudiced.
Furthermore, while this Court is cognizant that every type of prosecution may cause ""financial drain, restrained freedom of movement, public ridicule, embarrassment, anguish, sleepless nights, restless moments, and isolation from friends and other people[,]"" [68] which are indeed burdensome to the accused, the same ""must be shown that they are of the nature and degree that it becomes oppressive, unnecessary[,] and notoriously disproportionate to merit the case's dismissal."" [69] Lamentably, Paita also miserably failed in this undertaking.
All told, this Court finds that the two-year period it took the Ombudsman to resolve the administrative complaint against Paita was not attended by inordinate delay. Accordingly, he was not deprived of his constitutional right to a speedy disposition of his case.
II.
Paita is liable for Simple Misconduct
R.A. No. 9184 governs the rules with respect to all government procurement. [70] The law aims to ensure transparency, competitiveness, efficiency and accountability in the procurement process. [71] To eliminate any suspicion of favoritism or partiality in the execution of public contracts [72] ""as a general rule, the law requires that all government procurement must undergo competitive bidding."" [73] However, resort to alternative methods of procurement, such as direct contracting, is allowed subject to certain conditions. [74] Nonetheless, in any of these alternative methods, the procuring entity must ensure that ""it secures the most advantageous price for the government."" [75]
Here, the Province of Camarines Norte, upon recommendation of its PBAC, resorted to direct contracting with Hexaphil for the procurement of its liquid fertilizers. [76] In direct contracting, otherwise known as single source procurement, ""the supplier is simply asked to submit a price quotation or a pro-forma invoice together with the conditions of sale, which offer may be accepted immediately or after some negotiations."" [77] Direct contracting may be resorted to only in any of the following conditions:
a) Procurement of Goods of proprietary nature, which can be obtained only from the proprietary source, i.e. when patents, trade secrets and copyrights prohibit others from manufacturing the same item;
b) When the Procurement of critical components from a specific manufacturer, supplier or distributor is a condition precedent to hold a contractor to guarantee its project performance, in accordance with the provisions of this contract; or,
c) Those sold by an exclusive dealer or manufacturer, which does not have sub-dealers selling at lower prices and for which no suitable substitute can be obtained at more advantageous terms to the Government. [78]
To ascertain these conditions, the BAC must observe the following process:
How can Direct Contracting be justified?
To justify the need to procure through the Direct Contracting method, the BAC should conduct a survey of the industry and determine the supply source. This survey should confirm the exclusivity of the source of goods or services to be procured. In all cases where Direct Contracting is contemplated, the survey must be conducted prior to the commencement of the procurement process. Moreover, the Procuring Entity must justify the necessity for an item that may only be procured through Direct Contracting, and it must be able to prove that there is no suitable substitute in the market that can be obtained at more advantageous terms. [79]
Significantly, the requirement to conduct initial industry survey is also reflected in Section 366 in relation to Section 367 of the Local Government Code (
LGC
), which requires the personal canvass of suppliers when the procurement of supplies by local government units were made without the benefit of public bidding. In such instance, the law mandates the Local Government Units to observe the following parameters:
Section 367.
Procurement through Personal Canvass.
- Upon approval by the Committee on Awards, procurement of supplies may be effected after personal canvass of at least three (3) responsible suppliers in the locality by a committee of three (3) composed of the local services officer or the municipal or barangay treasurer, as the case may be, the local accountant, and the head of office or department for whose use the supplies are being procured. The award shall be decided by the Committee on Awards.
Purchase under this Section shall not exceed the amounts specified hereunder for all items in any one (1) month for each local government unit:
Provinces and Cities and Municipalities within the Metropolitan Manila Area:
First and Second Class - One hundred fifty thousand pesos (PHP 150,000.00)
Third and Fourth Class - One hundred thousand pesos (PHP100,000.00)
Fifth and Sixth Class - Fifty thousand pesos (PHP 50,000.00)
Municipalities:
First Class - Sixty thousand pesos (PHP 60,000.00)
Second and Third Class - Forty thousand pesos (PHP 40,000.00) Fourth Class and Below - Twenty thousand pesos (PHP 20,000.00)
Under R.A. No. 9184, the BAC is primarily responsible ""to determine the eligibility and qualifications of a prospective bidder."" [80] Significantly, ""this obligation holds true even if a procuring entity is justified to resort to alternative modes of procurement."" [81] Under the circumstances, it is still the BAC's responsibility to ensure that the procuring entity complies with the standards set forth by law and its implementing rules. [82]
At this juncture, it is undisputed that the purchase of liquid fertilizers from Hexaphil did not undergo public bidding. Thus, Paita's defense is hinged entirely on whether the conditions for the resort to direct contracting were met. ""It is incumbent upon a party who invokes coverage under the exception to a general rule to prove the fulfillment of the requisites thereof."" [83] Viewed in this light, Paita failed to demonstrate why there was a need to avail of direct contracting to purchase the liquid fertilizers, as the records are bereft of basis to establish whether an initial industry survey or a personal canvass was made to ensure that ""the local government would spend the lowest possible price for such purchase."" [84] Failure to observe the proper procedure on government procurement is considered a misconduct because it is ""a transgression of some established and definite rule of action, more particularly, unlawful behavior or gross negligence by a public officer."" [85] The misconduct is grave ""if it involves any of the additional elements of corruption, such as willful intent to violate the law or to disregard established rules, which must be established by substantial evidence."" [86] As an element of grave misconduct, jurisprudence [87] defines corruption as an ""act of an official or fiduciary person who unlawfully and wrongfully uses his or her station or character to procure some benefit for himself or herself or for another person, contrary to duty and the rights of others."" [88] Accordingly, ""grave misconduct is not mere failure to comply with the law. Failure to comply must be deliberate and must be done in order to secure benefits for the offender or for some other person."" [89] At the very least, the transgression must be tainted with bad faith which ""connotes a dishonest purpose or some moral obliquity and conscious doing of a wrong; a breach of sworn duty through some motive or intent or ill will; it partakes of the nature of fraud."" [90] Consequently, ""[a] person charged with grave misconduct may be held liable for simple misconduct if the misconduct does not involve any of the additional elements to qualify the misconduct as grave."" [91]
Applying these principles to the present case, this Court finds that none of the elements of grave misconduct were adequately proven.
Indeed, while there was a transgression of the established rules on public bidding, there was no evidence on record that Paita schemed or colluded with the other PBAC members to favor Hexaphil. Moreover, there was no evidence to establish that Paita benefitted from the lack of public bidding in the procurement of liquid fertilizers from the said supplier. To stress, ""there must be evidence, independent from this transgression, which would show that [the offender] or some other person on his or her behalf benefited from the x x x contract."" [92] Similarly, in Office of the Ombudsman v. Miedes, Sr., [93] the respondents therein were BAC members who purchased 19 cellphones without public bidding and from an authorized distributor, and not from its manufacturer or exclusive distributor, which violated pertinent rules on auditing and procurement. As BAC members, the respondents were presumed to know all existing policies and guidelines in carrying out such purchase. The respondents therein were only held liable for simple misconduct because there was no substantial evidence to establish that they approved such purchase with a corrupt intention or a clear willful intention amounting to an open defiance or a flagrant disregard of the rules.
Considering that none of the qualifying elements were established, Paita cannot be held accountable for grave misconduct. Nonetheless, he can be held liable for simple misconduct since he should have exercised all the necessary prudence to ensure compliance with the proper procedure in the purchase of the said liquid fertilizers.
III.
Paita is guilty of conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service
At the outset, it bears to stress that a public office is a public trust. ""As such, public officers must, at all times, be accountable to the people, serve them with utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty and efficiency."" [94] To ensure public accountability, the law punishes acts which are prejudicial to the best interest of the service. To determine whether a conduct is prejudicial to the best interest of the service, ""the only question is whether the public officer's acts tarnished the image or integrity of the public office."" [95] In addition, ""conduct grossly prejudicial to the best interest of the service may or may not be characterized by corruption or a willful intent to violate the law or to disregard established rules."" [96]
Here, Paita, as member of the PBAC, was in a position to inquire into the regularity of the process which attended the procurement of the liquid fertilizers. However, it does not appear that he raised objections on the lack of personal canvass or initial survey of suppliers, which he should have done had he exercised the due diligence expected of him. His lackadaisical stance endangered government coffers and undoubtedly tarnished the image and integrity of public office. Hence, he is guilty of conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service.
IV.
Paita is liable to pay a fine equivalent to one year of his salary deductible from his retirement benefits
Foregoing considered, We find Paita liable for Simple Misconduct and Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service. It is well to note that the Ombudsman did not refute Paita's claim that this is the first time where he had been adjudged administratively liable.
Simple misconduct is classified as a less grave offense punishable by suspension for a period of one month and one day to six months for the first offense. [97] On the other hand, conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service is classified as a grave offense with a corresponding penalty of suspension for six months and one day to one year for the first offense. [98]
Pursuant to Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (
URACCS
), if the offender is found guilty of two or more charges, the penalty for the most serious charge shall be imposed and the other charges shall be considered as aggravating circumstances. [99] In addition, the same Rules also provide that the maximum of the penalty shall be imposed where only aggravating and no mitigating circumstances are present, [100] as in this case. While Paita invoked his length of service as a mitigating circumstance, this Court cannot consider the same since he failed to attach his service record or any document that would prove such circumstance.
With Paita's comm1ss1on of Simple Misconduct appreciated as ah aggravating circumstance to his penalty for Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service, he is sentenced to suffer suspension for one year. However, the records [101] show that he has already retired from service, thus we can no longer impose upon him the penalty of suspension from service. In lieu thereof, this Court imposes a fine equivalent to his one year salary, which may be deducted from his retirement benefits. [102]","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is PARTIALLY GRANTED. The Decision dated May 31, 2017 and Resolution dated October 11, 2017 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 138817 are AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATION that petitioner Cesar C. Paita is GUILTY of Simple Misconduct and Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service. Accordingly, he is sentenced to suffer suspension for a period of one (1) year. In view of his retirement from the service, his suspension shall be converted to a FINE equivalent to his one (1) year salary, which may be deducted from his retirement benefits. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 250203, December 07, 2022","WARREN A. REUYAN, PETITIONER, VS. INC NAVIGATION CO. PHILS., INC., INTERORIENT MARINE SERVICES LTD., AND REYNALDO L. RAMIREZ, RESPONDENTS.","Petitioner was employed as an Ordinary Seaman by respondent INC Navigation Go. Phils., Inc. for and on behalf of its principal, Interorient Marine Services Ltd. (respondents), on board M/V Jork Valiant under a seven (7)-month contract signed by the parties and approved by the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA). On November 28, 2015, petitioner boarded the vessel. [6] Petitioner alleged that sometime in February 2016, he developed an enlarging mass on his neck while on board the vessel. On March 2, 2016, he developed a fever and chills, prompting him to request for a medical check­-up. Petitioner averred that the vessel's captain told him to wait until the next port in Athens, Greece. On March 9, 2016, he consulted a doctor in Athens and found out through a neck CT scan that he has a ""palpable mass at approximately 4 cm the right side of the thyroid gland pain on palpation""[7] and ""enlarged node approximately 3[.]5 cm of the thyroid gland at the right si[d]e complicated by bleeding.""[8] He underwent another check-up and his final medical report recommended thyroidectomy.[9] Consequently, he was medically repatriated on March 13, 2016. Petitioner claimed that upon his repatriation, he immediately reported to his manning agency and was referred to a company-designated physician at NGC Medical Specialist Clinic, Inc. where he underwent neck ultrasound and was recommended to undergo surgery. On April 6, 2016, he was admitted at Manila Doctors Hospital for his surgery. The mass recovered from him was then biopsied and the results revealed that he has papillary thyroid carcinoma. He was then readmitted to the hospital on May 13, 2016 for complete thyroidectomy and later discharged on June 5, 2016. On September 2, 2016, petitioner alleged that the company-designated physician recommended radiation therapy but said treatment was discontinued by respondents. This prompted petitioner to seek treatment and ask for an independent assessment of his medical condition from Dr. Emmanuel Trinidad (Dr. Trinidad) who declared him to be unfit for sea duty and that his illness, papillary thyroid carcinoma, is work-related/aggravated. Thus, petitioner was constrained to file a complaint for, inter alia , disability benefits against respondents.[10] For their part, respondents denied petitioner's claims, contending that petitioner's illness was not work-related and that there was no accident nor incident on board the vessel related to the health of petitioner aside from the manifestation of his condition, as admitted by petitioner in his consultation with the physician in Athens. Respondents further alleged that upon repatriation, petitioner was placed under the care of the company-designated physicians of NGC Medical Specialist Clinic, Inc. led by Dr. Nicomedes Cruz (Dr. Cruz). He was treated from March 15, 2016 to August 31, 2016 or for a total of 169 days. Respondents maintained that petitioner's true state of health was ascertained with specialized diagnostic examinations and tests such as ultrasound and that he underwent thyroidectomy to alleviate his condition. Respondents further claimed that petitioner was provided with a medical regimen and regular physical examination to monitor his condition and ensure his recovery. Respondents averred that petitioner's illness, papillary carcinoma of the thyroid, was found not to be work-related, as affirmed by the medical assessment[11] dated September 23, 2016. Finally, respondents alleged that petitioner was fully paid of his sickness allowance as shown by four (4) cash vouchers signed by him.[12]","The Court finds that the CA erred in not ascribing grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC when the latter tribunal ruled that petitioner is not entitled to permanent and total disability benefits. The failure of the company-designated physicians to issue a final and definite assessment within the prescribed periods gave rise to the conclusive presumption that petitioner indeed sustained a work-related permanent and total disability; thus, entitling him to benefits corresponding thereto.","ACCORDINGLY , the petition is PARTLY GRANTED. The Decision dated June 28, 2019 and the Resolution dated October 24, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

The same shall earn legal interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from finality of this Decision until full payment. SO ORDERED.","The petition is PARTLY GRANTED.

"G.R. No. 256495, December 07, 2022","ALEXEI JOSEPH P. GROSSMAN, PETITIONER, VS. NORTH SEA MARINE SERVICES CORPORATION, V. SHIPS LEISURE S.A.M., AND/OR SILVERSEA CRUISES LTD., RESPONDENTS.","On February 26, 2016, respondents V. Ships Leisure S.A.M., 'Les Industries', through its agent North Sea Marine Services Corporation (North Sea; collectively, respondents), hired petitioner to work as Galley Utility on board the vessel Silver Whisper for a period of eight (8) months, plus or minus one (1) month. Petitioner's contract is covered by the International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF) Cruise TCC-FIT/CISL Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). Sometime in July 2016, while on board the vessel, petitioner felt pain in his left knee that radiated to his leg and thigh. Petitioner reported his condition to the ship doctor who referred him for medical attention in Norway on July 20, 2016 and in Russia on August 1, 2016. Petitioner was diagnosed to be suffering from ""Tumor of distal metaepiphysis of left femur, which damage medial condyle with lysis of cortical rim with soft tissue component[.] Extremely high risk for pathological fracture."" Petitioner's condition led to his repatriation to the Philippines on August 5, 2016. On August 8, 2016, petitioner reported to respondents' office who thereafter referred him to the company-designated physicians of Trans Global Health System, Inc. for evaluation and treatment. After examination of the tests and findings of the foreign doctors, Dr. Fidel Chua (Dr. Chua) concluded that petitioner has Giant Cell Tumor (GCT). Petitioner was then referred to Dr. Tiong Sam Lim (Dr. Lim) of the Chinese General Hospital who concurred with Dr. Chua's findings and suggested the resection of petitioner's tumor and bone grafting. On August 17, 2016, petitioner underwent a procedure for the excision of left femur mass and curettage with application of bone cement. The surgery resulted in the deformity of petitioner's left leg, as well as muscle atrophy, which caused difficulty in walking. Petitioner thereafter underwent physical therapy from September 2016 until April 2017. In a Notice dated April 11, 2017, petitioner was required to report for follow-up treatment and re-evaluation on May 12, 2017. When petitioner reported for re-evaluation on May 12, 2017, Dr. Chua allegedly declared him unfit to work and assessed his medical condition as not work-related. Dr. Chua, however, did not issue any medical report of said findings and assessment. Thereafter, on March 2, 2018, Dr. Lim executed an Affidavit stating that GCT is a benign tumor which histogenesis remains unclear. The cause is unknown but it is not known to be caused by trauma environmental factors, or diet. Additionally, Dr. Lim noted that it is not work-related and not related to the seafaring profession, and that stress and work strain are not factors in the development of GCT. Meanwhile, since petitioner was still having difficulty of movement and pain in his left knee, he sought medical assistance from an orthopedic specialist, Dr. Renato P. Runas (Dr. Runas). In his Medical Evaluation Report, Dr. Runas stated that as of the date of examination on August 23, 2017, petitioner still complained of pain in his deformed knee; and that physical therapy was no longer a viable option to regain full extension as it may result to fracture. As such, Dr. Runas declared petitioner ""permanently and totally unfit to work in any capacity as a seafarer."" Armed with this evaluation, petitioner, through counsel, sent a letter dated September 18, 2017 to North Sea requesting a meeting to discuss the payment of disability benefits, but to no avail. Thus, petitioner filed a Notice to Arbitrate before the Regional Conciliation and Mediation Board-NCR wherein the parties agreed to undergo voluntary arbitration. Petitioner claimed that his illness is work-related inasmuch as he was declared fit to work during the pre-employment medical examination. He also averred that the presumption of work-relation and compensability must be upheld as GCT has no known cause and his employer failed to show contrary evidence. Further, petitioner pointed out that Dr. Chua's assessment was issued beyond the 240-day period provided under the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration-Standard Employment Contract (POEA-SEC); thus, his disability should be deemed total and permanent. Lastly, petitioner argued that he is entitled to moral and exemplary damages, as well as attorney's fees, due to respondents' fraudulent intent to evade their contractual obligations and continued refusal to pay the disability benefits. For their part, respondents argued that the provisions of the CBA cannot apply to petitioner's claim since his illness was not caused by accident onboard Silver Whisper. They also claimed that his illness is not compensable under the POEA-SEC since the Court already ruled that GCT is not a work- related illness. Lastly, they argued that Dr. Lim's assessment must prevail as he provided extensive treatment to petitioner, in contrast with Dr. Runas whose medical evaluation was based on a single examination of petitioner and did not indicate any disability grading.","In a Decision dated January 28, 2020, the CA reversed the VA's ruling, and accordingly, dismissed petitioner's claim. It held that while petitioner's disability was presumed work-related pursuant to Section 32-A of the POEA-SEC, respondents nonetheless successfully overthrew this presumption based on the explanations given by Dr. Chua, in his Medical Report dated December 27, 2016, and by Dr. Lim, in his Affidavit dated March 2, 2018. Moreover, the CA ruled that petitioner failed to prove by substantial evidence that the conditions of his work onboard the vessel as Galley Utility caused or, at least, increased the risk of contracting GCT. As such, petitioner is not entitled to his disability benefits claim. This notwithstanding, the CA awarded petitioner financial assistance in the amount of US$3,000.00 in the interest of equity and compassionate justice.","The Court fully agrees with the VA. Records show that as of April 11, 2017 – or 244 days from his first consultation with Dr. Chua on August 8, 2016 and the date of the latest report/notice issued with respect to petitioner's medical condition – petitioner was still undergoing treatment and monitoring by the company-designated physicians. ... And despite the cessation of petitioner's treatment on May 12, 2017, or 265 days from August 8, 2016, neither Dr. Chua nor Dr. Lim issued the required final, definite, and conclusive assessment of petitioner's disability. Since there is no final and definite assessment issued by the company-designated physicians within the prescribed periods, respondents failed to discharge their burden of controverting the presumption of work-relation. Consequently, the obligation of petitioner to present evidence proving work-relation did not arise. ... the Court is convinced that the December 27, 2016 Medical Report was a mere interim evaluation that fell short of the requirements for a final, definite, and conclusive assessment. Finally, as regards the March 2, 2018 Affidavit of Dr. Lim, suffice it to say that the same cannot be given any legal significance in this case considering that it was clearly issued way beyond the 240-day period. Verily, under the circumstances, the Court is hard-pressed not to agree with the VA's observation that the same was a ""mere afterthought"" which can no longer overcome petitioner's ""entitlement to disability benefits [as] confirmed by law prior to [such] declaration."" Viewed in these lights, the Court therefore finds that the CA reversibly erred in dismissing petitioner's claim based on what it perceived as petitioner's failure to prove the work-relation of his illness. There being no final and definite assessment of petitioner's fitness to work or permanent disability within the prescribed periods, and since petitioner's disability remains unresolved, which thus precludes him from pursuing his usual work as a seafarer, his disability has, by operation of law, become total and permanent.","ACCORDINGLY, the petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated January 28, 2020 and the Resolution dated May 21, 2021 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 159377 are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The Decision dated September 28, 2018 and the Resolution dated January 15, 2019 of the Office of the Voluntary Arbitrators in AC-980-RCMB-NCR-MVA-020-04-01-2018 are REINSTATED, in that respondents North Sea Marine Services Corporation, V. Ships Leisure S.A.M., and/or Silversea Cruises Ltd. are jointly and severally liable to pay petitioner Alexei Joseph P.

"G.R. No. 218341, December 07, 2022","FORT BONIFACIO DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. MANUEL M. DOMINGO, RESPONDENT.","On June 5, 2000, FBDC, a domestic corporation duly organized under Philippine laws engaged in the real estate development business, entered into a Trade Contract [5] with MS Maxco Company, Inc. (MS Maxco), then using the name L&M Maxco Company Inc., [6] for the execution of the structural and partial architectural works of the Bonifacio Ridge Condominium Project (project) in Taguig City. [7] Under the said Trade Contract, FBDC had the right to withhold the retention money amounting to 5% of the contract price for a period of one year after the completion of the project. [8] Retention money pertains to a percentage of the contract price set aside by the project owner and retained for a specified period to guarantee the contractor's performance of all corrective works and services throughout the defect-liability period. [9] The defect-liability period refers to the 12 month-period from the issuance of a practical completion within which MS Maxco is obliged to repair any defects in the project at no cost to FBDC. [10] For this project, the defect-liability period commenced in January 2005 and ended in December 2005. [11] The Trade Contract likewise provides that MS Maxco is prohibited from assigning or transferring any of its rights, obligations, or liabilities under the said Contract without the written consent of FBDC. [12] On July 30, 2004, FBDC received the first Notice of Garnishment [13] directed against the receivables of MS Maxco, issued by the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission (CIAC). The garnishment was in connection to CIAC Case No. 11-2002 filed by Asia-Con Builders against MS Maxco, making the latter liable for the amount of P5,990,927.77. [14] Meanwhile, because of the defect and delay in MS Maxco's work on the project, FBDC unilaterally terminated the Trade Contract in a letter [15] dated August 24, 2004, and engaged another contractor to complete the remaining work left unfinished by the former. [16] Pursuant to the Trade Contract, the expenses incurred by FBDC in completing the remaining work were deducted from the retention money. [17] Nonetheless, FBDC was still obliged to pay MS Maxco a fraction of the contract price in accordance with the works previously completed by the latter. [18] Sometime in April 2005, FBDC received a letter [19] dated April 18, 2005 from the counsel of Domingo informing the former that MS Maxco had already assigned its receivables from FBDC to him by virtue of a notarized Deed of Assignment [20] dated February 28, 2005. Under the said Deed of Assignment, MS Maxco assigned the amount of P804,068.21 to Domingo as payment of the former's obligation to the latter, which amount was to be taken from the retention money with FBDC. [21] In its letter-reply [22] dated October 11, 2005, FBDC acknowledged the 5% retention money of MS Maxco, but asserted that the same was not yet due and demandable and that it was already the subject of garnishment by the latter's other creditors. [23] Unsatisfied with the reply, Domingo, through counsel, sent another letter [24] dated October 14, 2005, asserting his ownership over a portion of the retention money, and maintaining that the amount thereof assigned to him cannot be garnished to satisfy the obligations of MS Maxco to other creditors, since the same ceased to be MS Maxco's properties pursuant to the Deed of Assignment. [25] Attached was MS Maxco's endorsement letter, [26] dated January 17, 2005, approving Domingo's claim against FBDC in the sum of P804,068.21, to be charged against the retention money. [27] During the interim, FBDC received another Notice of Garnishment, [28] dated June 6, 2005, issued by the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) in connection with NLRC-NCR Case No. 00-07-05483-2003 filed by Nicolas Consigna against MS Maxco and/or Michael Say, where the latter was made to pay P181,635.01. [29] On July 13, 2005, FBDC received an Order of Delivery of Money [30] enforcing the first Notice of Garnishment in connection with CIAC Case No. 11-2002. [31] On January 26, 2006, FBDC was served with a third Notice of Garnishment [32] against the receivables of MS Maxco, already accompanied by an Order of Delivery of Money, [33] issued by the RTC of Makati, Branch 133 in Civil Case No. 05-164 file by Concrete Masters, Inc. against MS Maxco, where the latter was made liable for P558,448.27. FBDC received a consequent Order of Delivery of Money. [34] FBDC was able to make the following payments [35] pursuant to the Garnishment Orders: Garnishment Order in CIAC Case No. 11-2002 due to Asia-Con P5,110,833.44 Garnishment Order in NLRC-NCR Case No. 00-07-05483-2003 due to Nicolas Consigna P181,635.01 Garnishment Order in Civil Case No. 05-164 due to Concrete-Masters, Inc. P558,448.27 Total P5,850,916.72 Precisely, the garnishment proceedings cost the retention money P5,850,916.72. Adding the said amount to the costs of rectification of defects totaling to P1,567,779.12, [36] the final amount to be deducted from the retention money amounted to P17,418,695.84. Thus, in a letter [37] dated January 31, 2006, FBDC emphatically refused Domingo's claim on MS Maxco's retention money, arguing that following the completion of the project and fulfilment of the multiple garnishment orders, the retention money of P17,237,060.83 [38] was already exhausted. [39] The preceding circumstances prompted Domingo to file a Complaint for Collection of Sum of Money, [40] dated February 7, 2006, against both MS Maxco and FBDC before the RTC of Pasay City, Branch 109, docketed as Civil Case No. 06-0200-CFM. [41] Instead of filing an Answer, FBDC filed a Motion to Dismiss [42] on the ground of lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter, among others. [43] The Motion to Dismiss was denied, [44] and the issue on jurisdiction was settled by the Court in Fort Bonifacio Development Corporation v. Domingo , [45] where it was ruled that the RTC, not the CIAC, has jurisdiction over the case at bar. [46] With the said motion being denied, a full-blown trial was held.","In a Decision [53] dated November 20, 2014, the CA affirmed the RTC ruling, the dispositive portion reads: WHEREFORE, We DISMISS the Appeal for want of merit. Further, in view of the points we have herein set forth, We MODIFY the appealed Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Pasay City, Branch 109 in Civil Case No. 06-200 to conform to the evidence thuswise: (i) Fort Bonifacio Development Corporation (FBDC) is held liable to pay Manuel M. Domingo the amount of Eight Hundred Four Thousand Sixty Eight and 21/100 (P804,068.21) with legal interest from the date of the finality of this Decision until fully paid as and by way of actual or compensatory damages; and (ii) the pronouncement made as against defendant MS MAXCO COMPANY, INC. is DELETED its obligation under Article 1628 of the New Civil Code not having been properly established. SO ORDERED.","The issue on the validity of the Deed of Assignment between MS Maxco and its creditor, in relation to FBDC, was already settled in Fort Bonifacio Development Corporation v. Fong (FBDC v. Fong). [58] The Court emphasized therein that obligations arising from contracts have the force of law between the contracting parties and should be complied with in good faith. [59] These stipulations in contracts are binding on them unless the same is contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order, or public policy. [60] Consequently, by virtue of the principle of relativity of contracts, these stipulations bind the parties, their assigns and heirs, except in cases where the rights and obligations arising from the contract are not transmissible by their nature, or by stipulation or by provision of law. [61] As explained by the Court in FBDC v. Fong, the rationale behind the assignees, although a third party to the contract, being bound by the original party's transaction under the relativity principle further lies in the concept of subrogation, which inheres in assignment. [62] Thus, in FBDC v. Fong, the Court stressed that when a person assigns his or her credit to another person, the latter is deemed subrogated to the rights and obligations of the former. [63] The assignee is bound by the exact same conditions as those which bound the assignor, since the former simply stands into the shoes of the latter, and hence cannot acquire greater rights than those pertaining to the assignor. [64] Relevantly, the foregoing concepts were applied in FBDC v. Fong, where the Court ruled that MS Maxco, as Trade Contractor, cannot assign or transfer any of its rights, obligations, or liabilities under the Trade Contract without the written consent of FBDC, the Client. [65] As such, the Court emphasized that without any proof that FBDC had consented to the assignment, Fong, as the assignee therein, cannot validly demand from the former the delivery of the sum of money that was assigned to him by MS Maxco as a portion of its retention money with FBDC. [66] To stress, the practical efficacy of the assignment, although valid between the MS Maxco and Fong, remains contingent upon the written approval of FBDC. [67] Without fail, the above-discussed principles and findings in FBDC v. Fong apply squarely in the present case. The aforementioned case and the case at bar concern the same Trade Contract between FBDC and MS Maxco, and the same receivables of MS Maxco from FBDC. The difference lies on the identity of the assignees of MS Maxco – Fong being the assignee in the settled case of FBDC v. Fong, and Domingo being the assignee in the present case. Applying the foregoing, the Court herein finds that FBDC and Domingo, as assignee of MS Maxco, are bound by the stipulations under the Trade Contract. The stipulation in dispute specifically provides: 19.1 The Trade Contractor [MS Maxco] shall not, without written consent of the Client [FBDC], assign or transfer any of his rights, obligations or liabilities under this Contract. The Trade Contractor shall not, without the written consent of the Client, sub-let any portion of the Works and such consent, if given, shall not relieve the Trade Contractor from any liability or obligation under the Contract. [68] By virtue of the obligatory force and relativity of contracts, the said stipulation, not being contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order, or public policy, is valid and binding among the parties. Thus, pursuant to Clause 19.1, MS Maxco, the Trade Contractor, cannot assign or transfer its receivables under the Trade Contract without the written consent of FBDC, the Client. The same clause equally binds Domingo as the assignee of MS Maxco. Since MS Maxco failed to secure the written consent of FBDC when the former assigned its receivables to Domingo, the Court concludes that FBDC is not liable to pay Domingo the amount P804,068.21 representing a portion of the retention money subject of the Deed of Assignment. The purported liability of FBDC to Domingo is sourced from the Deed of Assignment, where MS Maxco assigned its receivables under its Trade Contract with FBDC to Domingo. However, as its practical efficacy remains contingent upon the written assent of FBDC, the same still wanting in this case, FBDC cannot be made liable to Domingo. In any case, it must be stressed that the retention money amounting to P17,237,060.83 has already been exhausted against the liabilities of MS Maxco which totaled to P17,418,695.84, consisting of the cost of the garnishment proceedings against MS Maxco and cost of rectification of defects advanced by FBDC. In sum, since the Deed of Assignment between MS Maxco and Domingo cannot be enforced against FBDC for want of its written consent, FBDC is not liable to pay Domingo the amount P804,068.21 representing a portion of the retention money subject of the Deed of Assignment. Needless to say, this finding does not preclude Domingo from any recourse he may take against MS Maxco.","WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated November 20, 2014 and the Resolution dated May 21, 2015 of the Com1 of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 96338, affirming the Decision dated December 18, 2009 of the Regional Trial Court of Pasay City, Branch 109 in Civil Case No. 06-0200cfm are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

ELEUTERIA B. ERASMO, RESPONDENT.","Gregorio Bagano ( Gregorio ) was the owner of Lot No. 1442-Q, a 1,979 square meter property located at Urgello Street, Barangay Sambag I, Cebu City. Upon Gregorio's death, one of his heirs Florentino Bagano ( Florentino ) received 390 square meters of the property. This was a residential lot located in the southern pait of Urgello Street.[4] Atty. Lawrence Parawan ( Atty. Parawan ) rented Florentino's lot and constructed a house over a 102 square meter portion thereof. Thereafter, Atty. Parawan sold the house to Dr. Enrique Hipolito, Sr. ( Dr. Hipolito ) who, in turn, sold it to petitioner Rufino B. Requina, Sr. ( Rufino ), and Aurea U. Ereño ( Aurea ), petitioner Allan Ereño's mother, under a Deed of Sale dated October 30, 1993 .[5] In 1994, Florentino died intestate. Thus, his sole heir Rosalita Bagano Nevado ( Rosalita ) subdivided Florentino's share and executed an Affidavit of Adjudication with Sale dated March 15, 1994[6] ( Affidavit of Adjudication ) transferring the 102 square meter portion where the house was constructed in favor of petitioners. . . . Also in 1994, petitioners started paying real property taxes on the property, albeit it was still registered in the name of Florentino. They, too, continued possession and ownership[9] over the house and lot until 2001 when a fire razed their house along with other houses in the vicinity. . . . After the fire, petitioners learned that respondent Eleuteria B. Erasmo ( Eleuteria ) presented a Deed of Sale dated November 17, 1989[11] to the Register of Deeds of Cebu City. Upon verification, however, Records Management and Archives Office of the National Commission for Culture and the Arts certified that the Deed of Sale dated November 17, 1989 ""is not among the documents transferred by the Regional Trial Court for safekeeping.""[12] Accordingly, petitioners sued respondent for Declaration of Nullity of Deed of Sale, with Prayer for a Better Right of Possession and Ownership over a Portion of Real Property, and Preliminary Injunction before the Regional Trial Court, Cebu City via Civil Case No. CEB-26877. They essentially claimed that respondent's Deed of Sale was void for being simulated or fictitious. . . . In her Answer, respondent denied all allegations against her. She claimed that in 1985, she purchased Lot No. 1442-Q-1 with an area of about 225 square meters from Spouses Florentino and Aurelia Bagano ( Aurelia ) on installment. At first, she allegedly acquired 50 square meters of the property for which Florentino executed a Deed of Sale dated May 8, 1989[14] in her favor. . . . About eight months later, respondent allegedly acquired an additional 195 square meters with the help of a certain Martin Gingoyon who paid for 150 square meters in her name. Spouses Bagano executed another Deed of Sale dated November 17, 1989[16] in her favor in exchange for PHP 75,000.00. . . . In May 2001, she filed a complaint for ejectment against petitioners.","By Decision[20] dated June 17, 2009, the Regional Trial Court – Branch 9, Cebu City ruled in favor of petitioners, viz.: WHEREFORE, by reason of preponderance, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of Plaintiffs and against Defendant. Along this line, this court declares that: The deeds of sale in favor [of] Defendant Erasmo conveying 245 square meters of the lot subject of this case is declared void; The Affidavit of Adjudication of Sole [H]eir executed by Rosalita Bagano Nevado is hereby declared valid and binding; [and] The plaintiffs are hereby declared the true co-owners in fee simple over the portion of residential land on the basis of the Adjudication By Sole Heir of the Estate of the Deceased Person with Sale over a Portion Thereof dated March 15, 1994. . . . By Decision[26] dated February 26, 2015, the Court of Appeals reversed. For one, petitioners failed to establish forgery with clear, positive, and convincing evidence. . . . Finally, Article 1544 on double sale is inapplicable here as it presupposes the same thing being sold to different vendees by one vendor. As it was, the lot was sold by different vendors. In any event, the provision does not apply to unregistered lands. Instead Act No. 3344[28] should govern which states that the act of registration should be without prejudice to a third party with a better right. The Court of Appeals denied petitioners' motion for reconsideration by Resolution dated September 23, 2015.[29]","We grant the petition. . . . The Deed of Sale dated November 17, 1989 is a spurious document. . . . The Court finds that the attendant circumstances regarding the notarization of the Deed of Sale dated November 17, 1989 are sufficient to overcome the presumption of regularity attached to public documents. . . . Coupled with irregular notarization that destroyed the presumption of regularity of the Deed of Sale dated November 17, 1989, petitioners were able to prove that Florentino's signature was forged. . . . Being a forgery, the Deed of Sale dated November 17, 1989 (for 195 square meters) conveyed nothing in favor of respondent. The necessary consequence of which follows that such document should be annulled and set aside. . . . Double sale under Article 1544, Civil Code. If we are to assume that both sales are valid, as ruled by the trial court applying Article 1544 of the Civil Code, the first buyer was respondent and the second buyer was petitioners. Evidence shows that it was the second buyer, the petitioners, who registered the land first in good faith. They are considered in good faith since they were not aware that Florentino allegedly sold the land to respondent. There was also no evidence presented by respondent that she took steps to gain possession of the land or inform occupants of her purchase of the land. Thus, even if the deeds of sale in favor of respondent were not declared void, ownership of the said land is still vested in petitioner by virtue of Article 1544 of the Civil Code. Their right over the lot subject of this case is still superior to the rights of respondent. . . . Petitioners have a better right to the subject property. . . . Verily, since the residential house and lot in question have been transferred to petitioners by virtue of the Deed of Sale dated October 30, 1993, and the Affidavit of Adjudication with Sale dated March 15, 1994, only petitioners have a clear right over the property.","ACCORDINGLY , the petition is GRANTED . The Decision dated February 26, 2015 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CEB-CV No. 03337, as well as its Resolution dated September 23, 2015, are REVERSED and SET ASIDE . A new judgment is ENTERED in favor of petitioners: 1) Declaring the Deed of Sale dated November 17, 1989 for 195 square meters as a forgery, and therefore, NULL and VOID ; 2) Declaring the Deed of Sale dated October 30, 1993 , and the Affidavit of Adjudication with Sale dated March 15, 1994 over 102 square meter portion of Lot No. 1442-Q in favor of petitioners, VALID and enforceable, and therefore, rightfully entitled to the subject property; and 3) Declaring the Deed of Sale dated May 8, 1989 for 50 square meters as not part of the subject property of the petitioners.

"G.R. No. 255613, December 07, 2022","PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. NADJERA TAMUNDI Y PAMLIAN, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","This case stemmed from an Information[5] filed before the RTC charging Tamundi of the crime of illegal sale of dangerous drugs, defined and penalized under Section 5, Article II of RA 9165, the accusatory portion of which reads: That on or about the 10th day of January, 2015, in Quezon City, Philippines, the said accused, not being authorized by law to sell, dispense, deliver, transport or distribute any dangerous drug, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and knowingly sell, dispense, deliver, transport, distribute or act as a broker in the said transaction to wit: 295.53 (two hundred ninety five point fifty three) grams of Methamphetamine Hydrochloride, a dangerous drug. CONTRARY TO LAW.[6] The prosecution alleged that on January 9, 2015, at the Philippine National Police (PNP) Anti-Illegal Drugs Special Operations Task Force (AIDSOTF) in Camp Crame, Quezon City, P/Supt. Dwight Monato formed a buy-bust team and held a briefing based on reports by the confidential informant (CI) that a certain alias Ed and his cohorts were looking for buyers for their illegal drugs. PO3 Junel Dela Cruz (PO3 Dela Cruz) was designated as poseur buyer. PO3 Dela Cruz sealed a deal with alias Ed for the purchase of 300 grams of shabu for P300,000.00, agreeing to meet on January 10, 2015, in front of Burger King, Timog Avenue corner Mother Ignacia, Quezon City. Moments later, Tamundi approached them and entered the L-300 van. After showing the buy-bust money composed of one piece of P1,000.00 genuine bill marked money on top of a stack of boodle money, Tamundi gave PO3 Dela Cruz a black paper bag with a Guess logo containing the suspected shabu. In exchange, PO3 Dela Cruz handed Tamundi the buy-bust money. SPO2 Calimlim arrested Tamundi and recovered the buy-bust money. PO3 Dela Cruz marked the contraband, followed by the conduct of an inventory in the presence of Tamundi, the media representative Rod Vega (Vega) of DZBB, and Barangay Kagawad Pedro B. Battung, Jr. (Barangay Kagawad Battung, Jr.). Vega refused to sign the inventory receipt, citing company policy, so the police placed 'RTS' above his name. The confiscated contraband was turned over sequentially from PO3 Dela Cruz to PO3 Peña, then submitted to PCI De Guzman (Forensic Chemist) who found it positive for methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu). It was then entrusted to evidence custodian PO2 Castillo. In defense, Tamundi denied the allegations, averring that she was seized by police officers at Cash and Carry in Makati City, brought to Camp Crame, and then asked to produce P50,000.00 in exchange for her release. The RTC, in a Decision dated September 17, 2018, convicted Tamundi, sentencing her to life imprisonment and P500,000.00 fine. The RTC found all elements present and the chain of custody maintained. Tamundi appealed to the CA. In a Decision dated June 29, 2020, the CA affirmed Tamundi's conviction, holding that the prosecution proved the elements of illegal sale of dangerous drugs and an unbroken chain of custody, finding Vega's refusal to sign a valid ground for deviation from the rule.","The instant appeal is DENIED. The Decision dated June 29, 2020 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 11879 is hereby AFFIRMED.","The Court has settled in numerous cases that the following elements must be established in order to warrant a conviction for illegal sale of dangerous drugs, as defined and penalized under Section 5, Article II of RA 9165: (a) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object, and the consideration; and (b) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment. All elements were established in this case. The prosecution established the identity of the corpus delicti — the confiscated shabu — as the same substance presented as evidence in court through unbroken links in the chain of custody. Regarding the required insulating witnesses, the police officers secured the presence of media representative Vega and Barangay Kagawad Battung, Jr. While Vega did not sign the inventory receipt, his presence during the inventory and photography was established, and his refusal was due to company policy, leading the police to annotate 'RTS' (Refused to Sign). The Court holds that these circumstances constitute sufficient justification on the slight deviation from the requirements under Section 21 of RA 9165, and the integrity and evidentiary value of the confiscated shabu were properly preserved.","Accused-appellant Nadjera Tamundi y Pamlian is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of illegal sale of dangerous drugs, as defined and penalized under Section 5, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165. She is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and ordered to pay the fine of Five Hundred Thousand Pesos (P500,000.00)."

AMBAGAN [SUBSTITUTED BY HIS HEIRS] AND PHILIP AMBAGAN, PETITIONERS, VS. RODOLFO SERAPION, SR. AND RODOLFO SERAPION, JR., RESPONDENTS.","The present case stemmed from an Amended Complaint[6] dated August 27, 2008 filed by Rodolfo, Sr. and his son Rodolfo Serapion, Jr. (Rodolfo, et al.) before the Municipal Trial Court of Binangonan, Rizal, Branch 2 (MTC) for quieting of title and recovery of possession with damages against Napoleon Ambagan (Napoleon), Philip Ambagan, and all persons claiming rights under them (Napoleon, et al.) involving a 2,439- square meter (sq.m.) parcel of land, designated as Lot 15326, Cad. 609-D, situated in Tayuman, Binangonan, Rizal (Lot 15326) and covered by Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. M-4863.[7] Rodolfo, et al. claimed that Napoleon was the caretaker of the adjacent lot leased by the Hinoba-an Mining Exploration Corporation. In time, Napoleon occupied Lot 15326 by demolishing the existing shanty and building another one in its place. Napoleon then applied for a free patent over Lot 15326 which they opposed because a title has already been issued to them. In view of their opposition, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), in DENR Case No. V-5806 dated March 10, 2005, cancelled and revoked Free Patent Nos. (IV-1) 045804-91-1070P[8] and (IV-1) 15053 previously issued to Napoleon. Thereafter, Rodolfo, Sr. donated the property to his son, Rodolfo, Jr., and Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. M-41673 was issued in the latter's name. Lot 15326 was subsequently subdivided into 11 lots for which separate titles were issued.[10] Rodolfo, et al. argued that Napoleon's occupation of Lot 15326 has been unlawful from the beginning knowing fully well that he and the others claiming rights under him are strangers to the lot and have no color of ownership whatsoever. Since their demands for Napoleon to vacate remained unheeded, and their efforts to settle with him proved futile, they were forced to file the Complaint. For their part, Napoleon, et al. filed an Answer with Counterclaim,[11] arguing that the Amended Complaint states no cause of action since the free patent and OCT No. M-4863 issued in Rodolfo, Sr.'s name are void and fraudulent. They claimed that Rodolfo, Sr. did not comply with the strict legal requirements in applying for free patents since Napoleon had a pending application for free patent two years prior to the time the former filed his application. They argued that they are in fact the ones in actual possession of Lot 15326 as confirmed by Land Management Officer II Alice Saubon of DENR Region IV who conducted an ocular inspection and investigation of the said lot in 1995. In any event, they claimed that their possession of Lot 15326 has been public, continuous, adverse, and in the concept of an owner for more than 30 years. Further, they argued that the Amended Complaint's verification and certification against forum shopping was solely signed by Rodolfo, Sr. who was neither the real party in interest, since Lot 15326 is now in his son's name, nor was he properly authorized to file the action. Accordingly, Napoleon, et al. prayed for the: (a) annulment of the free patent and OCT No. M-4863 issued in Rodolfo, Sr.'s name, including the derivative titles; (b) reconveyance of Lot 15326 in their favor; (c) cancellation of the titles issued in Rodolfo, et al.'s names and the issuance of new titles in their names; and (d) award of damages in their favor.[12]",The Court denies the petitions.,"The Court denies the petitions. At the outset, it bears reiterating that a petition for review on certiorari 'shall raise only questions of law which must be distinctly set forth.'[30] There is a question of law in a given case when the doubt or difference arises as to what the law is on certain state of facts. To be one of law, a question must not involve an examination of the probative value of the evidence presented by the litigants or any of them. In contrast, there is a question of fact when the doubt or difference arises as to the truth or falsehood of alleged facts. Whether or not the proofs on one side or the other are clear and convincing and adequate to establish a proposition in issue; or whether or not the body of proofs presented by a party, weighed and analyzed in relation to contrary evidence submitted by adverse party, may be said to be strong, clear and convincing — are issues of fact.[31] As a rule, factual matters are not the proper subject of an appeal by certiorari as it is not the function of the Court to analyze and weigh the evidence that has been considered in the proceedings below.[32] 'The resolution of factual issues is the function of lower courts, whose findings thereon are received with respect and are [generally] binding on the Supreme Court.'[33] Nonetheless, case law permits a review of factual matters in exceptional situations, such as when the findings are contrary to those of the trial courts,[34] as in this case. Rodolfo did not have the requisite interest nor authority to file the Amended Complaint for quieting of title and recovery of possession The main thrust of Rodolfo, et al.'s arguments refers to the alleged error of the CA in ruling that Rodolfo, Sr. was not the real party-in-interest nor was he authorized to file the Amended Complaint on his son's behalf, and in any case, that they failed to prove their cause of action for quieting of title and recovery of possession — an error that affected their right and interest over Lot 15326. Verily, the resolution of this issue evidently requires a calibration of the evidence presented — a clear question of fact which is barred in a Rule 45 petition. In any event, even if this Court evaluates Rodolfo, Sr.'s arguments with respect to the sufficiency of his presented interest or of his authority to file the action for quieting of title, it still finds no compelling reason to disturb the findings as well as the conclusions of the courts a quo as the same is well supported by the records of this case as well as prevailing laws, rules, and case law pertinent thereto. Section 2, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court requires every action to be prosecuted or defended in the name of the real party-in-interest, thus: Section 2. Parties-in-interest. — A real party-in-interest is the party who stands to be benefited or injured by the judgment in the suit, or the party entitled to the avails of the suit. Unless otherwise authorized by law or these Rules, every action must be prosecuted or defended in the name of the real party-in-interest.[35] In Magallanes v. Palmer Asia, Inc.,[36] the Court, through Senior Associate Justice Antonio T. Carpio, explained that this provision has two requirements, namely: '(1) to institute an action, the plaintiff must be the real party-in-interest; and (2) the action must be prosecuted in the name of the real party-in-interest. Interest within the meaning of the Rules of Court means material interest or an interest in issue to be affected by the decree or judgment of the case, as distinguished from mere curiosity about the question involved.'[37] A real party-in-interest, therefore, is a litigant whose right or interest stands to benefit or get injured by the judgment of the case.[38] They bring a suit because the act or omission of another has caused them to directly suffer its consequences.[39] 'One having no material interest to protect cannot invoke the jurisdiction of the court as the plaintiff in an action.'[40] In such situation, the action filed 'is dismissible for lack of personality to sue upon proof that the plaintiff is not the real party-in-interest, hence grounded on failure to state a cause of action.'[41] This notwithstanding, plaintiffs who are not the real parties-in-interest may be included in a suit pursuant to Section 3, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court, viz.: Section 3. Representatives as parties. Where the action is allowed to be prosecuted or defended by a representative or someone acting in a fiduciary capacity, the beneficiary shall be included in the title of the case and shall be deemed to be the real party in interest. A representative may be a trustee of an express trust, a guardian, an executor or administrator, or a party authorized by law or these Rules. An agent acting in his own name and for the benefit of an undisclosed principal may sue or be sued without joining the principal except when the contract involves things belonging to the principal.[42] However, in order for a representative to properly pursue the action on behalf of the real party-in-interest, the rule requires that the representative must be acting in a fiduciary capacity or one 'authorized by law or these Rules.' Guided by the foregoing considerations, the Court rules that the CA correctly affirmed the dismissal of the Amended Complaint for quieting of title and recovery of possession on the ground that Rodolfo, Sr. was not the real party-in-interest, but rather his son, Rodolfo, Jr., whose authorization to sue on his behalf was not duly proven by the former. An action for quieting of title is essentially a common law remedy grounded on equity. '[F]or an action to quiet title to prosper, two indispensable requisites must concur, namely: (1) the plaintiff or complainant has a legal or an equitable title to or interest in the real property subject of the action; and (2) the deed, claim, encumbrance, or proceeding claimed to be casting cloud on his title must be shown to be in fact invalid or inoperative despite its prima facie appearance of validity or legal efficacy.'[43] Legal title denotes registered ownership, while equitable title means beneficial ownership. In the absence of such legal or equitable title, or interest, there is no cloud to be prevented or removed.[44] Based on the foregoing, it is clear that in an action for quieting of title and recovery of possession, the real party-in-interest is the person claiming title to or interest that is adverse to the one in possession of the real property subject of the action. Here, it is undisputed that Lot 15326 had already been donated by Rodolfo, Sr. to his son and co-plaintiff Rodolfo, Jr., by reason of which OCT No. M-4863, issued in the former's name, was cancelled and TCT No. M-41673 was issued under the name of the latter. Additionally, they judicially admitted that after the said donation and issuance of the new title in Rodolfo, Jr.'s name, Lot 15326 was subdivided into 11 lots, with each lot bearing a separate title. Verily, and as aptly observed by the CA as it affirmed the trial courts' rulings, the party with the material interest in prosecuting the action for quieting of title and recovery of possession against Napoleon, et al. was Rodolfo, Jr., and not his father Rodolfo, Sr. Since the real party-in-interest in the case is Rodolfo, Jr., it was incumbent upon Rodolfo, Sr. to prove that he was authorized to file the Amended Complaint and sign the verification and certification of non-forum shopping on the former's behalf. Under Sections 4 and 5, Rule 7[45] of the Rules of Court, the authorization of the affiant to act on behalf of a party must be attached to the pleading, failing in which shall be cause for the dismissal of the case without prejudice. Here, Rodolfo, Sr. failed to present sufficient evidence that Rodolfo, Jr. specifically authorized him to institute the action subject of the present petition since the SPA he presented to prove the said authority appeared highly questionable, was general in tenor, and executed 5 years prior to the filing of the case. All told, the CA correctly upheld the trial courts' dismissal of the Amended Complaint on the ground that Rodolfo, Sr. was not the real party-in-interest and hence, the amended complaint failed to state a cause of action, and he failed to prove his authority to file the case on his son's behalf. Accordingly, all other issues raised by Rodolfo, et al. with respect to the merits of their action for quieting of title are hereby denied for lack of merit. Napoleon, et al. did not have standing to file the reversion case Meanwhile, the main thrust of Napoleon, et al.'s arguments refers to the alleged error of the CA in ruling that they did not have standing to ask for the cancellation of Rodolfo, Sr.'s free patent and OCT and for the reconveyance of Lot 15326 through their counterclaim. To recall, the MTC, which the RTC affirmed, partially granted the counterclaim, cancelling Rodolfo, Sr.'s free patent and OCT and ordering the reversion of Lot 15326 to the public domain, based on the finding that Rodolfo, Sr.'s application for free patent was fraudulent. On the other hand, the CA, while agreeing with the MTC's finding of fraud, nonetheless referred the matter of reversion to the OSG on the ground that, based on its allegations and the evidence on record, Napoleon, et al.'s counterclaim is essentially an action for reversion which, under the law, can only be brought by the OSG. Napoleon, et al. argue that since a free patent was already issued in their favor, Lot 15326 was converted into their private ownership thereby giving them standing to sue for the cancellation of Rodolfo, Sr.'s free patent and OCT. In any case, they argue that an action for reversion is no longer necessary and practicable since the MTC, as affirmed by the RTC and CA, already found that Rodolfo, Sr.'s free patent and title were fraudulently issued. Rodolfo, et al., on the other hand, contend that the MTC should have dismissed the counterclaim which, based on its allegations and following the CA's ruling, is an action for reversion that could only be instituted by the OSG. While as a rule, factual matters are not the proper subject of an appeal by certiorari, the contrary findings of the trial courts and the CA with respect to the propriety of the grant of Napoleon, et al.'s counterclaim permits the Court's review of the factual matters in this case. An ordinary civil action for declaration of nullity of free patents and certificates of title is different from an action for reversion. Whether an action is one for reversion or for the ordinary action for declaration of nullity of free patents and certificates of title depends on the allegations in the complaint (or counterclaim) as to the character of ownership of the realty whose title is sought to be nullified.[46] In an action for reversion, the pertinent allegations in the complaint would admit State ownership of the disputed land.[47] The action essentially seeks to cancel or annul a certificate of title and revert public land to the State.[48] Under Section 101 of C.A. No. 141, 'actions for the reversion to the Government of lands of the public domain or improvements thereon shall be instituted by the Solicitor-General or the officer acting in his stead, in the proper courts, in the name of the' Republic of the Philippines. Thus, pursuant to this provision, a private individual may not bring an action for reversion or any action which would have the effect of cancelling a free patent and the corresponding certificate of title issued on the basis thereof, such that the land covered thereby will again form part of the public domain.[49] If a title originates from a grant of the government, its cancellation is a matter between the grantor and the grantee.[50] Thus, only the Solicitor General or the officer acting in his stead, on behalf of the State, may do so. In contrast, a cause of action for declaration of nullity of free patent and certificate of title would require allegations of the plaintiff's ownership of the contested lot prior to the issuance of such free patent and certificate of title as well as the defendant's fraud or mistake, as the case may be, in successfully obtaining these documents of title over the parcel of land claimed by plaintiff.[51] In such a case, the nullity arises strictly not from the fraud or deceit but from the fact that the land is beyond the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Lands to bestow and whatever patent or certificate of title obtained therefor is consequently void ab initio. The real party-in-interest is not the State but the plaintiff who alleges a preexisting right of ownership over the parcel of land in question even before the grant of title to the defendant.[52] Meanwhile, in an action for reconveyance, the free patent and the certificate of title are respected as incontrovertible. What it seeks is the transfer of the property, or the title thereof, which has been wrongfully or erroneously registered in the defendant's name. All that must be alleged in the complaint are 2 facts which admitting them to be true would entitle the plaintiff to recover the title to the disputed land, namely: (a) that the plaintiff was the owner of the land; and (b) that the defendant had illegally dispossessed him/her of the same.[53] Albeit partly different from an ordinary action for cancellation of title in that it respects the indefeasibility of a Torrens title, an action for reconveyance, nonetheless, similarly requires an allegation that the property is already privately owned, and hence beyond State jurisdiction. In both actions, the party with material interest in filing the action is the one claiming ownership of the private property in question. Based on the foregoing, the Court finds no reason to disturb the ruling of the CA. Indeed, a reading of the counterclaim shows that Napoleon, et al. in fact essentially admitted that Lot 15326 was part of the public domain by reason of which Napoleon filed his own application for free patent. Moreover, there is nothing in their allegations, more so in the evidence they presented, which shows their possession and occupation of the said lot in the character and for the period required by law sufficient to vest in them an imperfect title. On the contrary, the records show that Napoleon began occupying Lot 15326, at the earliest, only sometime in 1980[54] and had purchased the same in 1991 from a certain Cornelio Cenina,[55] whose purported ownership thereof remained questionable. While Napoleon may have applied for free patent as early as 1985, it remains undisputed that the said free patent was approved only in 1991 or 3 years after a free patent and OCT were already issued in Rodolfo, Sr.'s name in 1988. Significantly, as found by the MTC in its January 12, 2015 Decision, Napoleon's free patent was already cancelled and revoked by the DENR in its ruling in DENR Case No. V-5806, which Napoleon did not appeal. On this score, case law provides that prior to the issuance of the patent and its subsequent registration with the Register of Deeds, the title over the lot remained with the State; it is only after registration that the lot is segregated from the mass of public domain and converted into private property.[56] As such, the CA correctly ruled that Napoleon, et al. had no standing to ask for the declaration of nullity of Rodolfo, Sr.'s free patent and title, and for the reconveyance of Lot 15326. Accordingly, following Section 101 of C.A. No. 141 and pursuant to case law, only the State, through the OSG, may properly sue for the cancellation of Rodolfo, Sr.'s free patent and OCT and seek the reversion of Lot 15326 to the public domain. Considering that Napoleon, et al. are not the real parties-in-interest to sue for reversion of Lot 15326, their counterclaim for the cancellation of Rodolfo, Sr.'s free patent and title must perforce be dismissed for failure to state a cause of action. The dismissal shall be without prejudice to the right of the State, through the OSG, to file the appropriate action for reversion if warranted under the circumstances.","ACCORDINGLY, the petitions in G.R. No. 248739 and G.R. No. 248505 are DENIED. The Decision dated October 18, 2018 and the Resolution dated July 5, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

FRENCH CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN THE PHILIPPINES-LE CLUB, CHRISTOPHE[1] RIOUT, AND RAYMOND LIONS, RESPONDENTS.","The French Chamber of Commerce in the Philippines-Le Club engaged Steven Rouche as a Consultant under a Consultancy Agreement executed on December 11, 2013, securing a 9(g) visa valid until December 18, 2014. On May 1, 2014, the agreement was replaced by an Employment Contract, engaging Rouche as Managing Director under a three-year contract, but no renewal of his employment visa or Alien Employment Permit (AEP) was secured for the change in his role. On May 4, 2015, Christophe Riout, then President of the French Chamber of Commerce, terminated Rouche’s services on the ground of loss of trust, without specifying particular acts. Rouche refused the offer to resign and protested the decision. On June 1, 2015, Rouche filed a case for illegal dismissal. The French Chamber of Commerce sought dismissal, claiming Rouche had not renewed his AEP and only held a tourist visa, disqualifying him from working and rendering his employment void. The Labor Arbiter (LA) found Rouche illegally dismissed. However, the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) reversed the LA Decision and dismissed the complaint for lack of merit, citing Rouche’s failure to comply with AEP requirements. The Court of Appeals affirmed the NLRC, ruling that Rouche had come to court with unclean hands. Rouche petitioned the Supreme Court, arguing that the lack of renewal of his visa and AEP for his new position was due to the negligence of the French Chamber of Commerce’s counsel, Paras & Manlapaz Lawyers, which previously handled his visa application but failed to process the renewal despite his follow-up.","The Supreme Court resolved that an alien employee who was illegally dismissed and whose visa and permit were not processed solely due to the negligence of their employer's counsel, should not be barred from seeking relief under the Labor Code. The Court found that the cases of *WPP Marketing Communications, Inc. v. Galera* and *McBurnie v. Ganzon* were inapplicable because Rouche's non-renewal was directly attributed to the negligence of respondents' own counsel, Paras & Manlapaz, who had assured him the renewal was being processed. To allow petitioner's defeat based on the actions of the opposing party's lawyer would be unjust. The Court further found that Rouche was illegally dismissed because the respondents failed to allege specific acts constituting just cause (gross and habitual neglect or willful breach of trust) and failed to comply with the twin-notice rule, as the Notice to Explain was only sent after the complaint for illegal dismissal had already been filed. Finally, the Court noted the potential violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility by respondents' counsel for representing conflicting interests, as the firm used its failure to process the visa against Rouche.","The Petition is GRANTED.

"G.R. No. 258791, December 07, 2022","TAIHEI ALLTECH CONSTRUCTION (PHIL.) INC., PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, RESPONDENT.","Taihei is a domestic corporation primarily engaged in the construction of industrial plants. Within the mandatory two-year period under Section 112(A), National Internal Revenue Code, as amended, Taihei filed the following administrative claims for refund before the One-Stop Shop Inter-Agency Tax Credit and Duty Drawback Center of the Department of Finance in the total amount of P19,345,434.54 representing unutilized excess tax credit for the 3rd and 4th quarters of calendar year 2011: a) September 30, 2013 - For excess input VAT for the 3rd Quarter (July to September) of calendar year 2011 in the amount of P6,649,651.47. b) December 23, 2013 - For excess input VAT for the 4th Quarter (October to December) of calendar year 2011 in the amount of P12,695,783.07. Meantime, on June 11, 2014, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue issued Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 54 (RMC 54-2014). Thereafter, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue issued Revenue Regulations No. 1-2017 (RR 1-2017) dated January 3, 2017 on the ""supposed erroneous retroactive application"" of RMC 54-2014, leading Taihei to allege its administrative claim was deemed revived. Subsequently, on June 10, 2019, OIC-Assistant Commissioner for Assessment Service Ma. Luisa I. Belen denied Taihei's administrative claim under Letter dated February 6, 2019, for lack of factual and legal bases. In view of the denial, Taihei filed a Petition for Review with the Court of Tax Appeals entitled Taihei Alltech Construction (Phil.) Inc. v. CIR docketed as CTA Case No. 10108 on July 10, 2019.","The Court of Tax Appeals En Banc affirmed by Decision dated July 19, 2021 and Resolution dated February 3, 2022. It pronounced that since Taihei's judicial claims for refund were clearly filed out of time, the court was devoid of jurisdiction over the same.","Following these doctrinal rulings, the 120+30-day period for Taihei's judicial claims for refund should reckon with the following dates relevant to its earlier administrative claims for refund: End of 120-day Period: January 28, 2014 (3rd Quarter) and April 22, 2014 (4th Quarter). End of 30-day Period: February 27, 2014 (3rd Quarter) and May 22, 2014 (4th Quarter). Taihei filed its judicial claims with the Court of Tax Appeals only on July 10, 2019 way beyond the 120+30-day period. The post facto denial of Taihei's administrative claims is irrelevant as Commissioner of Internal Revenue's inaction for 120 days is already considered ""deemed denial"" of the administrative claims for refund. Without a timely appeal, the ""deemed denial"" becomes final and unappealable. RMC 54-2014 was not retroactively applied to Taihei's claims for refund as Taihei already lost its 30-day period before RMC 54-2014 was issued. RR 1-2017 did not revive Taihei's claims for refund as the Commissioner of Internal Revenue has no power to revive lapsed claims for refund, and RR 1-2017 did not create an exception to the 120+30-day period. Strict compliance with the 120+30-day periods is necessary for such a claim to prosper.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DENIED.

MC15-4695-FC, MC15-4696-FC, and MC15-4661-FC, thus: [Criminal Case No. MC15-4695-FC] That on or about the 14th of September 2013, in the City of xxxxxxxxxxx , Philippines, a place within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, by means of force and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of [AAA255677 ** ], a minor, twelve (12) years of age, against her will and without her consent, to her damage and prejudice, which act is qualified by the latter's minority and relationship to accused who is her step-father. CONTRARY TO LAW. [Criminal Case No. MC15-4696-FC] That on or about the first week of April 2014, in the City of xxxxxxxxxxx , Philippines, a place within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, by means of force and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of [AAA255677], a minor, twelve (12) years of age, against her will and without her consent, to her damage and prejudice, which act is qualified by the latter's minority and relationship to accused who is her step-father. CONTRARY TO LAW. [Criminal Case No. MC15-4661-FC] That on or about the 30th day of May 2015, in the City of xxxxxxxxxxx , Philippines, a place within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, by means of force and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of [AAA255677], against her will and without her consent, to her damage and prejudice, which act is qualified by the fact that accused is the step-father of said AAA, a minor, twelve (12) years of age. CONTRARY TO LAW. XXX pleaded not guilty. At the joint pre-trial, the parties stipulated on AAA255677's minority. Trial then ensued. In Criminal Case No. MC15-4695-FC, AAA255677 testified that her mother just gave birth in a hospital. At that time, she was sleeping in the second floor of their house when she was awakened by the feeling of heaviness on her chest. AAA255677 then noticed that someone was pulling down her undergarments. Thereafter, AAA255677 saw her stepfather, XXX on top of her who was drunk and clad only in underwear. XXX lifted AAA255677's upper garments and pressed his body against her. AAA255677 felt pain when XXX inserted something in her vagina. AAA255677 was unsure what was inserted because XXX was not holding anything. Afterwards, AAA255677 felt something watery on the lower part of her body near her vagina. XXX told AAA255677 that one of her siblings urinated on her. AAA255677 cried out of fear after XXX left. In Criminal Case No. MC15-4696-FC, the prosecution established that AAA255677 was awakened when someone removed her clothes. AAA255677 shouted and cried after she felt that she was being choked. This caused her aunt to ask what was going on which prompted XXX to leave. In Criminal Case No. MC15-4661-FC, AAA255677 narrated that she and her siblings were taking an afternoon nap. AAA255677 was awakened when XXX transferred her little sibling to the cradle. Suddenly, XXX mounted AAA255677, removed her undergarments, and inserted his penis into her vagina. AAA255677 felt pain, got frightened, and cried. XXX stopped and put on his shorts when one of AAA255677's siblings woke up. Thereafter, XXX caressed AAA255677 from her feet up to her breasts. XXX gestured to AAA255677 to keep quiet and then he left. This gave AAA255677 the opportunity to escape together with her siblings. AAA255677 narrated to her mother what happened and they reported the matter to the police. The physical examination revealed that AAA255677 had a deep healed laceration at 9:00 o'clock position which was clearly caused by the penetration of a blunt object, such as a penis or a finger. The prosecution then offered documentary evidence consisting of inquest referral letter, sworn statements of the witnesses, joint affidavit of arrest, booking sheet, request for physical examination, medico-legal report, and anatomical sketch. XXX denied the accusations and claimed that on the date of the alleged first rape, he was with his wife at the hospital while AAA255677 and her siblings were left under the care of their grandmother. As regards the second rape charge, XXX averred that he was busy with his work as a cigarette and salt vendor, and was occupied looking for other employment. Anent the supposed third rape, XXX explained that he was at home taking care of his children. XXX was surprised when police officers arrested him. XXX believed that AAA255677 fabricated the stories of sexual abuse when he disallowed her to meet her friends and her biological father. On October 4, 2017, the RTC, in a Joint Decision, convicted XXX for qualified rape in Criminal Case No. MC15-4661-FC. The prosecution proved that XXX had carnal knowledge of minor AAA255677. Moreover, the prosecution established the minority of AAA255677 based on the stipulation of the parties during the pre-trial, and her relationship to XXX as his stepdaughter based on XXX's own admission during the direct examination. Also, the RTC found XXX guilty in Criminal Case No. MC15-4695-FC for acts of lasciviousness punished under Article 336 of the Revised Penal Code in relation to Section 5(b) of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7610 considering that AAA255677 was just 10 years old at the time of the sexual violation. The RTC pointed out that the prosecution's evidence negates carnal knowledge because it was inconclusive whether XXX inserted his penis into AAA255677's vagina. Nonetheless, the RTC acquitted XXX in Criminal Case No. MC15-4696-FC for insufficiency of evidence.","On June 23, 2020, the CA affirmed the RTC's findings with modifications as to the penalties and award of damages, to wit : WHEREFORE, the appeal is DENIED. The decision of the [RTC] dated October 4, 2017 in Criminal Cases Nos. MC15-4661-FC and MC15-4695-FC is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION, as follows: 1. In Criminal Case No. MC15-4661, accused-appellant [XXX] is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of rape under Article 266-A in relation to Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, and is sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua. In addition, said accused-appellant is ordered to pay private complainant [AAA255677] the amounts of One Hundred Thousand Pesos (P100,000.00) for civil indemnity. One Hundred Thousand Pesos (P100,000.00) for moral damages, and One Hundred Thousand Pesos (P100,000.00) for exemplary damages; and, 2. In Criminal Case No. MC15-4695-FC, above[-]named accused-appellant is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of acts of lasciviousness under Article 336 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, in relation to Section 5 (b), Article III of R.A. 7610, and is sentenced to an indeterminate prison term of thirteen (13) years, nine (9) months and ten (10) days of reclusion temporal minimum, as minimum, to sixteen (16) years, five (5) months and nine (9) days of reclusion temporal medium, as maximum. In addition, accused-appellant is ordered to pay above[-]named private complainant the amounts of Twenty Thousand Pesos (P20,000.00) for civil indemnity, Fifteen Thousand Pesos (P15,000.00) for moral damages, Fifteen Thousand Pesos (P15,000.00) for exemplary damages, and Fifteen Thousand Pesos (P15,000.00) as fine. Further, accused-appellant is ordered to pay private complainant interest on all damages awarded in both cases at the legal rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the date of finality of this judgment until fully paid.","XXX assailed his conviction on the ground that AAA255677's testimony is incredible. On this point, we stress that the CA and the RTC's assessment on the credibility of the prosecution witness and the veracity of her testimony are given the highest degree of respect, especially if there is no fact or circumstance of weight or substance that was overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied, which could affect the result of the case. XXX's uncorroborated denial and alibi cannot prevail over the positive declaration of the prosecution witness. XXX is guilty of simple rape absent allegation and proof as to the concurrence of the special qualifying circumstance of minority and relationship. In Criminal Case No. MC15-4661-FC, the Court finds that the prosecution proved the minority of AAA255677 notwithstanding the non-presentation of her birth certificate, based on her testimony and XXX's admission/stipulation. However, with regard to the circumstance of relationship, the CA and the RTC anchored their findings that XXX is the stepfather of AAA255677 solely on his admission during direct examination. Notably, the relationship between a stepfather and a stepdaughter assumes the existence of a legitimate relationship, that is, the stepfather should be legally married to the stepdaughter's mother. The best evidence to prove the relationship is a marriage contract. The admission of XXX during his direct examination that he was married to AAA255677's mother is not part of the prosecution evidence in chief, and did not dispense the duty to offer the proof of marriage. Evidently, the flaw committed by the prosecution spared XXX from the gallows of qualified rape and its prescribed penalty. At most, XXX is liable only for simple rape in Criminal Case No. MC15-4661-FC. XXX is liable for Lascivious Conduct under Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610 since the Information alleged that the victim was exactly 12 years old although it was proven during trial that she was below the threshold age at the time of the commission of the offense. In Criminal Case No. MC15-4695-FC, this Court agrees with the CA and the RTC's factual findings that XXX violated Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610 absent evidence of carnal knowledge of the victim. Yet, the CA and the RTC reversibly erred in the classification of the offense. Although AAA255677 was just 10 years old at the time of the sexual violation, such fact cannot be appreciated because her age as alleged in the Information was exactly 12 years old which is different from that actually proven. Hence, the offense should be designated as lascivious conduct under Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610, and the imposable penalty is reclusion temporal in its medium period to reclusion perpetua.","ACCORDINGLY, the Appeal is DISMISSED. The Court of Appeals' Decision dated June 23, 2020 in CA-G.R. CR HC No. 10042 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATIONS. In Criminal Case No. MC15-4661-FC, accused-appellant XXX is found GUILTY of simple rape and is sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua. Accused-appellant is also held liable to pay the victim P75,000.00 civil indemnity, P75,000.00 moral damages, and P75,000.00 exemplary damages. In Criminal Case No. MC15-4695-FC, accused-appellant is found GUILTY of lascivious conduct under Section 5(b) of Republic Act No. 7610 and is sentenced to suffer the indeterminate penalty of eight (8) years and one (1) day of prision mayor, as minimum, to seventeen (17) years, four (4) months and one (1) day of reclusion temporal, as maximum, and to pay a fine of P15,000.00. Accused-appellant is also ordered to pay P50,000.00 civil indemnity, P50,000.00 moral damages, and P50,000.00 exemplary damages. The award of damages in both cases shall all earn legal interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the finality of this Decision until full payment."
"G.R. No. 253020, December 07, 2022","QUESTCORE, INC., PETITIONER, VS. MELODY A. BUMANGLAG, RESPONDENT.","Petitioner is a corporation engaged in the business of recruitment for overseas employment. On May 10, 2013, it deployed Melody as operations head for its principal, Cosmo Seafoods Ltd. (Cosmo), in Ghana, West Africa. The first contract was for a period of 12 months, from May 10, 2013 to May 10, 2014. Melody was later promoted to vice general manager and her initial one-year contract was renewed for three successive years. The last Employment Agreement covers the period from May 1, 2016 to April 30, 2017. [4] However, on October 25, 2016, before the expiration of her fourth and last contract, Melody was dismissed from employment without just cause and was repatriated to the Philippines. [5] Melody filed a Complaint [6] before the labor arbiter for illegal dismissal, with claims for non-payment of her one month salary, 13th month pay, salary for the unexpired portion of the contract, service incentive leave pay, cash in lieu of prior notice of termination, unused leave, performance bonus, and damages. Petitioner denied liability for Melody's dismissal on the ground that its solidary liability with the foreign employer only extends up to the first contract. It argued that since it is not privy to the subsequent renewals of Melody's employment contract, it should be released from any liability resulting from the dismissal. [7] Resolving the dispute, the labor arbiter ruled that Melody was illegally dismissed by her foreign employer. [8] Melody was given a termination letter without informing her of the cause of her dismissal. On the basis of the original Recruitment Agreement between Cosmo and petitioner, the labor arbiter declared petitioner to be solidarily liable with the foreign employer. It held that the successive renewal of Melody's contract is sanctioned under the Recruitment Agreement as there was no showing that the agency relations between Cosmo, as principal and petitioner, as its local agent was severed, thus ruling: WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered, ordering Questcore, Inc. and/or Cosmo Seafoods Ltd., to solidarily pay Melody A. Bumanglag the following claims, in the following amounts: Wages for Unexpired portion of employment contract - US $20,000 Unpaid Wages - 4,000 Cash payment in lieu of notice of termination - 8,000 Performance Bonus - 21,600 US $53,600 ======== The rest of the decision in this case dated 29 November 2017 not inconsistent with the foregoing, are hereby adopted and made and integral part hereof. SO ORDERED. [9] On appeal, the National Labor Relations Commission affirmed with modification the labor arbiter's ruling by deleting the grant of performance bonus and reducing the cash payment award, as follows: WHEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing disquisitions, the instant Appeal is DENIED. The assailed 08 December 2017 Decision of the Executive Labor Arbiter Rhett Julius J. Plagata is hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION that respondents-appellants and respondent Cosmo Seafood Ltd. are solidarily liable to pay Melody A. Bumanglag only the following: Wages for the Unexpired portion of the employment contract - US $20,000 Unpaid Wages - $4,000 Cash payment in lieu of notice of Termination - $4,000 __________ - US S28,000 SO ORDERED. [10] On certiorari , the CA affirmed with modification the NLRC's ruling in the assailed Decision dated October 14, 2019 in CA-G.R. SP No. 09062-MIN, thus: WHEREFORE, the Petition for Certiorari is DENIED. The July 6, 2018 Decision of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) – Eighth Division, Cagayan de Oro City, in NLRC NO. MAC-01-015276-2018 (RAB-09-OFW (L)-09-20066-17); and its October 9, 2018 Resolution are hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION that Melody A. Bumanglag is entitled to full reimbursement of her placement fee with twelve percent (12%) interest per annum from October 25, 2016 to the date that this Decision becomes final and executory. All the monetary awards herein to private respondent Bumanglag shall earn legal interest at six percent (6%) per annum from the date that this Decision becomes final and executory until full satisfaction thereof. SO ORDERED. [11] The CA denied petitioner's motion for reconsideration in the assailed Resolution dated July 13, 2020. Hence, this recourse.",The Court denies the petition.,"The Court denies the petition. Migrant workers or overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) are entitled to security of tenure for the period stipulated in their contracts. If their employments are severed before the end of the contract term without due process, this violates their right to security of tenure and the dismissal is considered illegal. [14] In Melody's case, there is no question that she was illegally dismissed by her foreign employer Cosmo. Melody was simply handed a letter terminating her employment before the end of her 4th employment contract and was given a return ticket to the Philippines. Under Section 10 [15] of Republic Act No. (RA) 8042, or the Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act of 1995, as amended, an illegally dismissed overseas worker is entitled to the full reimbursement of the placement fee, with interest of 12% per annum, plus salaries for the unexpired portion of the employment contract. [16] Further, the provision states that the foreign employer and the local employment agency are jointly and severally liable for money claims of Filipino workers arising out of an employer-employee relationship, or by virtue of any law or contract, including damages. x x x Such liabilities shall continue during the entire period or duration of the employment contract and shall not be affected by any substitution, amendment or modification made locally or in a foreign country of the said contract . x x x Petitioner's argument is unavailing. The question of whether the solidary liability of a private recruitment agency under Section 10 of RA 8042 is limited to the original employment contract and the period indicated therein is not novel. [...] In this case, the CA correctly ruled that petitioner Questcore's solidary liability with the foreign principal Cosmo was not terminated when Melody's first contract ended on May 10, 2014. Section 10 of RA 8042 expressly states that the liability of the recruitment agency 'shall continue during the entire period or duration of the employment contract and shall not be affected by any substitution, amendment or modification made locally or in a foreign country of the said contract.' Here, the initial contract provides for an option to renew, and it is unlikely that petitioner was unaware that Melody was actually reemployed by Cosmo. As keenly observed by the NLRC, there was a subsisting recruitment agreement/contract of agency between Cosmo and petitioner, which coincided with Melody's entire stint in Ghana, Africa. The exchange of electronic communications between petitioner and Cosmo shows that Melody is only one of the many Filipino overseas workers deployed by petitioner to Cosmo's jobsite in Africa. To be sure, petitioner may not assume liability insofar as the other Filipino workers it deployed in Cosmo are concerned, while at the same time dispute its responsibilities as Melody's agent. [30] Precisely, this is why petitioner cannot invoke Sunace International Management Services, Inc. v. NLRC , [31] and harp on the alleged lack of privity or knowledge of the subsequent renewals of Melody's employment contract. To stress, Article 18 of the Labor Code bans a foreign employer from directly hiring a Filipino worker for overseas employment. [32] Even assuming that Cosmo dealt directly with Melody for the renewal of her contract, petitioner is still jointly and solidarily liable with its foreign principal because under Article 18, the foreign employer does not have a personality to hire an OFW unless it acts through a licensed local manning agent. The act of petitioner and Cosmo in excluding Melody from their roster of agency-deployed employees after her initial contract, despite their subsisting contract of agency, is an attempt to circumvent the ban on direct hiring, which the Court cannot countenance. [33] At any rate, although petitioner is made to answer for the overseas worker's illegal dismissal claims, it is not left without remedy. Petitioner may seek reimbursement from Cosmo for whatever amount it paid to Melody for the money claims against the foreign employer. [36]","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DENIED. The Decision dated October 14, 2019 and Resolution dated July 13, 2020 issued by the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 09062-MIN are AFFIRMED. Petitioner Questcore, Inc. and its foreign principal Cosmo Seafoods Ltd., are ordered to pay respondent Melody A. Bumanglag the following: (1) wages for the unexpired portion of the employment contract; (2) unpaid wages; (3) cash payment in lieu of notice of termination in the total amount of Twenty Eight Thousand US Dollars (US$ 28,000.00); and (4) the full reimbursement of her placement fee, with 12% interest per annum from October 25, 2016 to the date that this Decision becomes final and executory.

"G.R. No. 232798, December 07, 2022","ADVAN MOTOR, INC. PETITIONER, VS. LILA R. SAAVEDRA, RESPONDENT.","On March 26, 2002, Saavedra purchased a Chevrolet Zafira (the Zafira) from Advan for P1,190,000.00. On February 2, 2007, Saavedra brought the car to Advan's repair shop because it ""had a rough idling and certain symbols appeared on the console."" Advan issued Saavedra a repair order listing the following works to be done on the Zafira: ""a) check traction control on; b) check engine misfire; and c) check brakes noisy."" Advan informed Saavedra that the Zafira would require several other repairs but failed to respond to her request for a detailed report. With the Zafira's repair still incomplete on June 16, 2007, Saavedra requested its return regardless of working condition. Advan denied the request, claiming that the car's engine ""had been dismantled and sent to a repair shop"". On July 9, 2007, Saavedra sought the assistance of counsel in sending Advan a letter demanding payment for the vehicle's market value, indicating that she was ""no longer interested in getting back the Zafira[.]"" When her demand letter was ignored, Saavedra filed a Complaint for sum of money and damages against Advan.","The Court of Appeals partially granted the appeal. While Advan was still found in breach of contract, its civil liability was modified because: (1) there was no evidence that Advan's acts worsened the Zafira's condition; (2) Saavedra neither prayed for nor established Advan's liability for the cost of her replacement car; and (3) there was no proof of actual damage resulting from Saavedra's inability to use the Zafira. ACCORDINGLY, the appeal is PARTLY GRANTED. The Decision dated September 11, 2014, of the Regional Trial Court of Paranaque City, Branch 195, in Civil Case no. 08-0008, is hereby MODIFIED, as follows: 1. Defendant Advan Motor Inc. is hereby ordered to RETURN to plaintiff Lila Saavedra her Chevrolet Zafira... in good order and condition: 2. Advan Motor, Inc. is hereby ordered to PAY Lila Saavedra the following: a. Two Hundred Thousand Pesos (Php200,000.00) as temperate damages; b. Two Hundred Thousand Pesos (Php200,000.00) as moral damages: c. Two Hundred Thousand Pesos (Php200,000.00) as exemplary damages; d. One Hundred Thousand Pesos (Php100,000.00) as attorney's fees plus Php5,000.00 appearance fee per court hearing; and e. Costs of the suit.","The Court of Appeals should not have ordered the return of the vehicle when neither party prayed for the same. In any event, it is no longer feasible to return the Zafira to respondent, as both parties have agreed on the vehicle's abandonment and treated the vehicle as such. Petitioner should instead be made to pay respondent the vehicle's fair market value at the time it was surrendered for repair, previously decided by the Regional Trial Court. Petitioner should also pay temperate damages for respondent's inability to use the Zafira pending its repair, as a pecuniary loss distinct from the loss of the vehicle. Likewise, the Court of Appeals should not have increased the award for moral and exemplary damages without an appeal from respondent. However, we affirm the deletion of petitioner's liability for the installment payments on the Vios. Respondent's purchase of another vehicle is unrelated to the contract of repair that she entered into with petitioner.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is PARTIALLY GRANTED. The Court of Appeals' Decision dated January 31, 2017 and its Resolution dated July 14, 2017 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. The Court of Appeals' order for petitioner Advan Motor, Inc. to return the subject vehicle to respondent Lila R. Saavedra in good working condition is hereby DELETED. Instead, petitioner Advan Motor, Inc. is hereby ordered to PAY respondent Lila R. Saavedra the following: P700,000.00 in actual damages, as compensation for loss of respondent's vehicle; P20,000.00 as moral damages; P20,000.00 as exemplary damages; P25,000.00 as temperate damages; Attorney's fees of P100,000.00, and P5,000.00 appearance fee per court hearing; and Costs of the suit.

"G.R. No. 258095, December 07, 2022","LEILANI[1] LIM GO, PETITIONER, VS. HENDRICK N. GO[2] AND REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENTS.","On July 19, 2011, Leilani filed a petition for declaration of nullity of her marriage with Hendrick based on Article 36[6] of the Family Code. The case was docketed as Civil Case No. R-PSY-14-17782-CV and raffled to the Regional Trial Court (RTC)-Branch 113, Pasay City.[7]
She essentially averred:
On August 7, 1999, she and Hendrick were married in church rites at St. Augustine Church in Intramuros, Manila. They had two children, namely, Lance Harvey and Heiley Louise.[8]
She and Hendrick first met sometime in December 1996 in Hong Kong. Their second encounter was in March 1997 at De La Salle-College of St. Benilde. He asked for her phone number. She initially refused but later on relented when she realized he was a nice person.
This led to courtship. He gave her flowers and found time to travel from his house in Pasay City to her residence in Quezon City just to see her. They became sweethearts in 1998 and eventually engaged in pre-marital sex.
A year later, she got pregnant and was advised by her parents to marry Hendrick as it was allegedly the right thing to do. He, however, said he was not prepared to get married yet and that they should consider an abortion. He even asked her if he was indeed the father of the child she was carrying. She consequently became enraged and would have cancelled their wedding plans were it not in consideration of her parents.[9]
After their wedding, they lived in the house of Hendrick's parents. For this, Hendrick was very grateful as he no longer had to endure the long trip going to her house in Quezon City. Meanwhile, she found it difficult living with her parents-in-law. Hendrick's mother would often viciously comment that she was not really the type of woman her son wanted to marry.[10]
Sometime in 1999, she and Hendrick went to Guam for a vacation. She gave birth to their first child there. Then, breastfeeding became an issue between her and Hendrick. One time, even when she felt already too weak to breastfeed her baby, Hendrick still insisted she must.[11]
In 2000, she caught Hendrick having a phone conversation with his former girlfriend Kristine. Feeling jealous and suspicious that her husband was engaging in extra-marital affairs, she did a covert investigation by herself.[12] She learned from the sales personnel at Hendrick's office that he was often seen happily speaking with someone over the phone. She discovered from Hendrick's mobile phone that he had been seeing and constantly communicating with Kristine. Immediately, she felt like losing her mind especially after reading this text message: ""Love, we may not be together now, but love I know we will be together in the end."" She got so deeply hurt that she just slept on the couch for about a week. When she later on confronted Hendrick about his illicit affair, he asked for forgiveness and promised to stop communicating with Kristine. But he never did. His infidelity eventually took a toll on their marriage as they grew cold toward each other. She expected him to open up to her, but he was not that type of person. He did not exert any effort to fix their marriage. Neither did she, though she hoped she did.[13]
She complained too about his failure to work hard and earn enough money to provide a better life for their family. He was content with his small business and made basketball his priority. He refused to go on vacation with her and their children due to lack of funds. She expected him to take them on a vacation abroad at least once a year but he always told her he had no money.[14]
She focused on her work, helping out in her father's business. She also provided for the needs of their children and paid for the salary of their kasambahay. As for Hendrick, he was always missing. He barely spoke to her. He did not tell her how his day went. She tried to express her thoughts and feelings to him but he always ignored her. Nonetheless, she continued to support him. She took care of his needs especially when he suffered from epilepsy in 2006.[15]
In 2007, she got pregnant with their third child. Unfortunately, she lost the baby on her tenth week of pregnancy. She got depressed. She resented her husband's nonchalance towards her ordeal. But she wanted another child. Her children gave her comfort in the midst of Hendrick's indifference.[16]
To her dismay, he refused to have another child saying ""gastos lang 'yan."" She initiated physical intimacy but he was always not interested. In 2009, they had sexual intercourse for six times only. True to form, in his Facebook account, he identified himself as a single person and kept a secret chat box with Kristine.[17]
On their tenth wedding anniversary, she expected him to make her feel special, but she only got frustrated. They only had what she called a casual dinner. The lack of blandishments and sweet nothings coming from her husband on that special occasion made her feel unloved. It then dawned on her that they were only together for the sake of their children.[18]
In 2013, she began to sleep in her parents' house during weekends and brought their children with her. This was the start of their separation. Whenever they were together, they did nothing but argue and quarrel. He blamed her for the love lost between them.[19]
She faulted his unending devotion to Kristine, whom he had described as his ""first girlfriend, first kiss, prom date, first sex, and first in everything."" As a way of escaping depression, she kept herself busy with a new business venture. But everything he did to her kept haunting her. She consequently decided to seek psychiatric help and was prescribed antidepressants. As a last resort, she suggested to Hendrick that they undergo marriage counselling together but he was dismissive. He even arrogantly retorted ""mas magaling pa ako sa counsellor.""[20]
In 2014, they completely separated. Not long after, she filed the petition for nullity of marriage. She deeply felt that their marriage was no longer founded on love, respect, honor, and commitment.[21]
She eventually realized, however, that their separation has actually brought them peace. She regained her respect for him. They have become better parents to their children; and amiable to each other. As a result, they have been harmoniously co-parenting their children. They have joint custody of them. During weekends, the children stay with her, while during school days, they stay with him. He has also provided for their tuition fees and school needs.[22]
Jennel See (Jennel) is Leilani's close friend and the spouses' schoolmate since grade school. Jennel described Leilani as a sweet person who would trade her own happiness just to please people. Leilani was easily disappointed or hurt if things did not go her way. Jennel knew Leilani to be a popular campus figure due to her physical beauty. Leilani's parents, though, were strict, and they did not allow her to go out on ""gimmicks.""[23]
Jennel was Leilani's confidante about the latter's marriage and family life. Leilani shared with Jennel updates about Hendrick's infidelity and showed Jennel screenshots of his conversations with Kristine. Jennel often visited Leilani's household, often slept in their home, and went with them on out of town trips. During these occasions, Jennel was able to observe their behavior toward each other.[24]
Jennel noticed Hendrick's lack of affection towards Leilani. Jennel learned too from Leilani that he never minded his wife's situation whenever he was out of town for work.[25]
She also learned from Leilani that Hendrick was extremely dependent on his parents for support and decision-making. She confirmed though that she never witnessed the couple engage in any physical fight.[26]
Clinical Psychologist Nedy L. Tayag did a psychological evaluation of the couple. She based her evaluation on the information gathered from her interviews with Leilani and Jennel, and the results of Leilani's psychological tests. The Clinical Psychologist sent an invitation dated August 30, 2014 to Hendrick for psychological testing and clinical interview, but he ignored it.[27]
She testified that, on a clinical perspective, Leilani was suffering from Passive Aggressive Personality Disorder with features of Narcissistic Personality Disorder while Hendrick was suffering from Avoidant Personality Disorder with features of Antisocial Personality Disorder.[28]
The Psychological Evaluation Report[29] noted that throughout their marriage, Leilani complied with her marital obligations. She did so out of what she believed was culturally expected of her. She also did not want others to blame her for their failed marriage.[30]
Leilani's passivity persisted, though she had been terribly frustrated with her marital woes. She derived self-identity and self-worth from being a passive spouse. On the flipside, she harbored a lot of resentment due to Hendrick's failure to reciprocate her efforts.[31]
She confided that""malungkot kasi ako at very emotional na tao, gusto ko lagi kami nag-uusap, nagkukwentuhan, gusto ko sabihin sa kanya everything that's on my mind pero hindi kami ganon, usap namin, isang tanong, isang sagot."" She was desperately waiting and hoping for him to reciprocate the love and affection she had given him.[32]
When her frustration worsened, she became hostile towards him. She confided alam niya nagseselos ako, pero wala lang, kung ikaw ang husband, assure mo wife mo na siya lang sa buhay mo, wala nang iba, lalambingin ka niya, ipafeel niya sana important ako sa buhay niya, and mahal niya ako, ayaw ko ma-feel insecure.""[33]
According to the Clinical Psychologist, Leilani was a very emotionally dependent woman. She valued her worth through the appreciation and recognition she received from other people. Highly vulnerable to social criticisms and feedback, she did her best to be socially acceptable. She was more than willing to trade social acceptance with her own true happiness and self-worth. Criticism from others destroyed her self-worth. She was happy with her accomplishments, but these should be recognized. Her depression came from others' non-recognition of her worth.[34]
Leilani lived her life banking on her ideals and opinions rather than coming to terms with the day to day vicissitudes. Hence, during their wedding anniversaries, she was often disappointed by Hendrick's lack of reciprocation. He refused to give her flowers because they were expensive and ""di na kailangan."" Her lofty views being unmet, she fell into deep depression over her self-worth.[35]
In the Clinical Psychologist's opinion, Leilani manifested personality aberration as a result of the strained familial environment she grew up in.[36]
She had a kind-hearted father — too kind that people tended to take advantage of him. She emulated this kind of passive kindness which contributed to her present psychopathology. As a child, she also experienced scolding and spanking which made her obey her primary caregivers all the time. Obedience was the only way for her to gain parental approval and favor. Growing up, she had been so accustomed to following her parents' lead, which she had difficulty going against. She developed a high need to please people which consequently undermined her level of confidence. She also developed a faulty perception of intimate relationships making her pathologically passive and tolerant of irregularities even over a long period of time just to ensure a continuous sense of attachment and belongingness. Because of her deep-seated need for nurturing and love, she hung on and stayed in her relationship with Hendrick, although such relationship was unable to satisfy her emotional longings.[37]
On the other hand, the Clinical Psychologist found Hendrick to be suffering from Avoidant Personality Disorder with features of Antisocial Personality Disorder. The flawed behavioral patterns showed him to be a pleasure-oriented and self-centered individual. His only mental preoccupation was the immediate satisfaction of his self-interest. His egocentrism meant he was only thinking of himself and his best interests. He thus flaunted his amorous relationships with women. As he lived only to please himself and gratify his urges, he was non-committal. He lacked depth towards his marital commitments, emotionally manipulating his wife to achieve only his comfort. This explained his lack of meaningful communication with his wife.[38]
He was irresponsible and reckless. He did not think of the foreseeable consequences of his actions. He did not strive hard for his family. He left the responsibility for their family entirely to Leilani. He could have exerted more effort to augment his meager income but he was simply content with what he earned despite the increasing needs of his family.[39]
So ingrained was his sell-absorption and self-worship that he never felt even a tinge of guilt or remorse for any of his transgressions. The best he could offer as an apology was transactional superficial repentance. He sought forgiveness when it served his interests. He could not accept responsibility much less blame for any failures.[40]
The Clinical Psychologist further opined that Hendrick's personality deviation originated from his faulty familial and childrearing settings. The Clinical Psychologist pictured Hendrick's father as the type of man who wanted to be followed at all times, ""gusto lagi siya nasusunod."" He was typically patriarchal. His father, however, was negatively described as ""maraming kaaway, matapobre, lagi galit.""[41]
On the other hand, the Clinical Psychologist described Hendrick's mother as being blindly disposed to compare people's statuses and standings. She was haughty, arrogant, and ""inggitera."" She played favorites. She favored the youngest child above all her children.[42]
The Clinical Psychologist concluded that these flaws in familial and childrearing dynamics gave confusing signals to Hendrick. He developed a passive defiance of rules. This became part of his system and distorted his moral foundation. He embraced an immature, self-centered, and irresponsible disposition. This eventually manifested in his incapacity to discharge his marital and family obligations. His selfishness and egotism kept him away from playing meaningful roles for these duties.[43]
The Clinical Psychologist found the respective psychopathological conditions of the spouses to be permanent and grave. She asserted that individuals diagnosed with these personality disorders ""lack the adequate insight to their tarnished condition as such their aberrant statuses have become deeply ingrained into their system thereby making them inflexible, maladjusted, dysfunctional and beyond repair."" Hence, no amount of intervention and psychotherapy would suffice to cure their flawed and defective nature.[44]
On the part of Hendrick, he testified that he is still deeply in love with his wife, albeit he admitted he did not give her the attention, love, and financial support she deserves. He had an income of P1,000.00 a day for tending the hardware owned by his father. Since this amount was not enough to support his family, his father augmented Hendrick's finances. While he may not have a lot of money, he made sure he took care of his children. He brings them to the mall and allows them to eat all the food they fancied on.[45]
He admitted though that he could be a thoughtless spender. In 2013, despite his lack of funds, he bought a Pajero on installment basis. The P20,000.00 from his monthly salary of P28,000.00 went to the car's monthly installments. Left with a meager amount of P8,000.00, his father came to his rescue and paid for his children's tuition fees and other needs.[46]
He also denied having an extra-marital affair with his long-time friend Kristine.
His father Go Pen Siong testified that his son had been given proper parental guidance, a good education, quality of life conducive to his physical and moral well-being, and discipline. Hendrick and Leilani were deeply in love with each other and were not forced or unduly influenced to get married. He recognized Leilani as his daughter-in-law and they lived under the same roof because his house was big enough to accommodate even Leilani's whole family. He was proud of his son for being a dedicated worker and soon Hendrick will inherit their business. Even though Leilani and Hendrick are separated in fact, they exerted efforts to rekindle their love and constantly worked on their marriage. He decried the allegation that his wife, Leilani's mother-in-law, often spewed stride comments that Leilani was not the kind of woman Hendrick deserves. On the contrary, he and his wife were kind and gentle to Leilani. He did not want the couple to separate for the sake of his grandchildren. The couple had lived together in his house for more than 15 years, yet, he had not seen them having problems.[47]",We GRANT the petition.,"Applying the re-conceptualized framework in Tan-Andal and the set of guidelines in determining incompatible personality structures in Laroco, we at once find the existence and gravity of the mutual incompatibility and antagonism between spouses Leilani and Hendrick. This state of discord between them has undermined the unity and harmony in their family as shown by their separation since 2014 and the initiation of the present case. The acts, behavior, conduct, events, reputation, character, or circumstances of dysfunctionalities revolve around conflicting personality structures between the spouses. It is from this clear and convincing inference that we conclude that their marriage is marred by mutual incompatibility and antagonism. Based on Leilani's evidence, ironically corroborated by Hendrick and his father, their mutual incompatibility and antagonism is grave. It has already brought about their marital breakdown and separation as spouses. Their mutual incompatibility and antagonism are incurable. Giving substantial probability to this conclusion is the Clinical Psychologist's opinion. The behavior of the spouses confirms this opinion. The spouses tried to reconcile within their means and time but failed miserably. Clearly and convincingly, and paradoxically too, it was their separation that brought them back together as reasonable adults and parents to their children. Finally, Leilani's and Hendrick's mutual incompatibility and antagonism are pre-marital. Since their mutual incompatibility and antagonism are symptomatic of their clashing personality structures, as probably demonstrated by their respective personality disorders, this mutual incompatibility and antagonism must have been present though latent before they were married. Conceivably, their marriage and its concomitant requirement to be together triggered the ghastly manifestation of this mutual incompatibility and antagonsim. All in all, there is clear and convincing evidence of juridical antecedence. All told, applying Article 36 of the Family Code as revisited in Tan-Andal and the guidelines in determining incompatible personality structures in Laroco, the Court finds that there is clear and convincing evidence here to support the conclusion that Leilani and Hendrick are both psychologically incapacitated, in the legal sense, from complying with their marital obligations.","ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is GRANTED. The marriage of Hendrick N. Go and Leilani Lim Go is declared VOID AB INITIO. The Decision dated December 17, 2020 and Resolution dated November 3, 2021 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

CESAR BRAGANZA Y ARCILLA, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.","Cesar Braganza y Arcilla (Cesar), Isagani Lajara y Briones (Isagani), Joana Paula Oruga y Pedrigosa (Joana), and Myrna Lajara (Myrna) were charged with child prostitution and qualified trafficking, defined and penalized under Republic Act (RA) Nos. 7610 and 9208, respectively, under the following Amended Informations: Criminal Case No. 17583-2010-C (Violation of R.A. No. 7610) [child prostitution] and Criminal Case No. 17584-2010-C [Violation of RA No. 9208 — qualified trafficking]. Trial ensued. Senior Inspector Mark Anthony Diaz (SI Diaz) testified that the NBI conducted an entrapment/rescue operation around 10:00 p.m. on October 9, 2010, at Getz Drive Inn after receiving a tip about the prostitution of minors. Two assets acted as poseur customers. Cesar approached the assets, directed the women to line up, and engaged the services of DDD253293 and EEE253293, two minor girls. Cesar told the assets to pay One Thousand One Hundred Pesos (PHP 1,100.00) each, handed the marked money to the cashier, Joana, and ushered the assets and the girls to rooms. Cesar was arrested along with Joana and Isagani, and 28 women were rescued (9 minors confirmed by dental examination). AAA253293, BBB253293, and CCC253293 testified about being deceived and forced into prostitution at the inn, identifying Cesar as a pimp. The RTC dated January 18, 2017, found Cesar guilty of qualified trafficking and child prostitution but acquitted Myrna, Isagani, and Joana. Cesar filed a Notice of Appeal. In its October 24, 2019 Decision, the CA affirmed Cesar's conviction for qualified trafficking with modification in that subsidiary imprisonment was deleted, and acquitted Cesar of child prostitution due to the prosecution's failure to prove the minority of the victims.","In its October 24, 2019 Decision, the CA affirmed Cesar's conviction for qualified trafficking with modification in that subsidiary imprisonment was deleted. The CA acquitted Cesar of child prostitution due to the prosecution's failure to prove the minority of the victims, viz.: WHEREFORE, premises considered, the appeal is PARTLY GRANTED. The assailed Decision dated 18 January 2017 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 36 of xxxxxxxxxxx Laguna is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION as follows: 1) Appellant Cesar Braganza y Arcilla is found GUILTY in Criminal Case No. 17584-2010-C for violation of Section 6(c), R.A. No. 9208, as amended, and is sentenced to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and to pay the fine of Two Million Pesos (PHP 2,000,000.00), without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and Five Hundred Thousand Pesos (PHP 500,000.00) as moral damages as well as One Hundred Thousand Pesos (PHP 100,000.00) as exemplary damages. An interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum on the monetary awards from the finality of this Decision until fully paid is likewise imposed. 2) Appellant Cesar Braganza y Arcilla is ACQUITTED in Criminal Case No. 17583-10-C, for violation of Section 5(a), R.A. No. 7610 for failure to prove the qualifying circumstance of minority of the victims.","The Appeal is unmeritorious. Cesar was lawfully arrested. Contrary to Cesar's claims, SI Diaz had probable cause to believe that he committed, was committing, or was attempting to commit an offense at the time of his arrest. In any case, Cesar did not question the illegality of his arrest before he entered his plea of not guilty. Consequently, any evidence confiscated after his arrest can be considered for any purpose. Cesar is guilty of qualified trafficking. The Court affirms the conviction of Cesar for qualified trafficking. The prosecution satisfactorily established the presence of the elements of the offense. Cesar harbored, received, maintained and hired women, whose vulnerability he took advantage of, for sexual exploitation or prostitution in the inn. Since Cesar offered DDD253293 and EEE253293 to the poseur customers for prostitution and sexual exploitation and AAA253293 identified Cesar as her pimp, the crime is deemed qualified because it was committed against three persons.","ACCORDINGLY, the Appeal is DISMISSED.

"G.R. No. 240005, December 06, 2022","FLORENCIO B. NEDIRA, SUBSTITUTED BY HIS WIFE EMMA G. NEDIRA, PETITIONER , VS. NJ WORLD CORPORATION, REPRESENTED BY MICHELLE Y. BUALAT, RESPONDENT.","Respondent, a taxi company, hired Florencio as a taxi driver on September 2, 2010. On October 29, 2013, Florencio filed a complaint for constructive dismissal before the NLRC, but died during the pendency of the proceedings. His wife, Emma, filed an Omnibus Motion (For Substitution and Extension of Time to File Position Paper).
Subsequently, Emma filed a position paper alleging that Florencio was illegally suspended on July 16, 2013 and August 6, 2013 for infractions that were either untrue or did not deserve ""a length of suspension as what was imposed"" on him. Allegedly, when Florencio reported back to work after serving his suspension, respondent's manager, Carlos M. Almarines III ( Carlos ), told him that he would be placed on floating status until he pays the penalty of P6,000.00. Florencio allegedly asked that the bond imposed upon him for every tour of duty be applied to the penalty but Carlos refused, reasoning that the bond would not be enough. Emma further claimed that Florencio was indefinitely placed on floating status conditioned upon the payment of an amount he could not raise ""precisely because he was denied of [sic] the opportunity to report for work."" Lastly, she alleged that Florencio was never paid the value of his unused service incentive leaves ( SIL ) and his 13th month pay, and she asserted the bond he gave to respondent must be returned.
Citing Cruz v. Cruz , respondent countered that the complaint for constructive dismissal does not involve property or property rights. Thus, it did not survive the death of Florencio, and Emma can no longer pursue it. Respondent also denied that Florencio was constructively dismissed, and instead averred that Florencio was an on-call taxi driver who stopped driving after failing to remit boundary payments in 2013. Lastly, respondent asserted that there is no documentary evidence supporting the allegations in the complaint.
The Labor Arbiter ( LA ) dismissed the complaint for illegal dismissal for lack of merit on November 17, 2014, finding Emma lacked personal knowledge of the facts. The NLRC reversed the LA in its May 29, 2015 Resolution and ordered respondent to pay backwages, separation pay, and attorney's fees, finding illegal dismissal. The Court of Appeals ( CA ) granted respondent's petition for certiorari, annulling the NLRC resolutions and reinstating the LA's decision, finding that Emma failed to show substantial evidence of constructive dismissal. Emma appealed the CA decision to the Supreme Court.",The appeal lacks merit and must be denied. The CA did not commit any serious error in finding that Emma failed to prove that Florencio was illegally dismissed.,"Ei incumbit probatio qui dicit, non qui negat. The burden of proof is on the one who declares, not on one who denies. A party alleging a critical fact must suppo1i his allegation with substantial evidence, for any decision based on unsubstantiated allegation cannot stand without offending due process. And in illegal termination cases, jurisprudence had underscored that the fact of dismissal must be established by positive and overt acts of an employer indicating the intention to dismiss before the burden is shifted to the employer that the dismissal was legal. The fact of dismissal was not established in the instant case. The records are absent of any evidence as to the nature of the supposed suspension, as well as the circumstances of the alleged constructive dismissal. No documentary proof was presented to substantiate the claim that respondent required Florencio to pay P6,000.00, and that, due to his alleged nonpayment, he was not permitted to work. Thus, as a result of the lack of evidence to substantiate this claim, the charge of constructive dismissal was not established. 
[The Court further clarified that] an illegal dismissal complaint cannot be classified as to cause or foundation like an ordinary civil action insofar as the effect of death of any of the parties is concerned. Substitution by the heirs of the deceased complainant in a pending complaint for illegal dismissal should be allowed. This approach respects and breathes life to the public interest imbued in contractual relations between the employer and the employee. In keeping with the peculiar nature of a complaint for illegal dismissal, the rule is that in case any of the parties to a complaint for illegal dismissal dies during the pendency of such proceedings, he or she may be substituted by his or her heirs.","WHEREFORE, the appeal is DENIED. The December 6, 2017 Decision and the June 6, 2018 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 142044 are AFFIRMED. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 254871, December 06, 2022","DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND DEVELOPMENT, REPRESENTED BY DIRECTOR SITTIE RAIFAH M. PAMALOY-HASSAN, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON AUDIT, RESPONDENT.","Central to the present controversy is DSWD's hiring of Atty. Melanie D. Ortiz-Rosete (Atty. Ortiz-Rosete) as private legal retainer of DSWD Field Office No. 10 (FO). Previously, in 2015 and 2016, upon the Solicitor General's approval and COA's concurrence,[3] DSWD already contracted Atty. Ortiz-Rosete to appear as counsel in all civil cases pending before the trial courts and involving the FO or its officials. DSWD sought to continue its engagement of Atty. Ortiz-Rosete through 2017. Thus, on November 2, 2016, DSWD executed a Contract of Service[4] (Contract) rehiring Atty. Ortiz-Rosete as the FO's private legal retainer covering the period of January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017 (2017 Contract). Subsequently, in a Letter[5] dated December 5, 2016, the DSWD requested the Solicitor General's approval to renew Atty. Ortiz-Rosete's authority to appear as the FO's counsel. The Solicitor General granted this request on May 22, 2017.[6] Later on, in a Letter[7] dated January 5, 2018, DSWD requested for the COA's concurrence in relation to the aforementioned hiring. Ruling of the COA LRR The COA LRR denied the request on account of DSWD's belated application for concurrence.[8] It noted that DSWD requested the COA to concur in the 2017 Contract only on January 5, 2018, or when said agreement had already expired. It explained as follows: First, requests of this nature must be obtained prior to hiring of a private lawyer or, in exceptional cases, the expiration of his contract.[9] Second, COA Circular No. 86-255,[10] as amended, requires the COA's concurrence as a pre­condition to a government agency's hiring of a private legal counsel.[11] Seeking compassion and leniency, DSWD moved for reconsideration[12] before the COA Proper. It cited the following reasons to justify Atty. Ortiz-Rosete's rehiring: 1. The DSWD Central Office has only four lawyers x x x they cannot provide all the legal assistance sought by all DSWD FOs; 2. It would be unjust for Atty. Ortiz-Rosete not to be compensated for the services she rendered in 2017; 3. Atty. Ortiz-Rosete's expertise in legal matters pertaining to the DSWD has created trust and confidence between them; 4. The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) deputized Atty. Ortiz-Rosete as private legal counsel of DSWD FO No. 10 for the period of January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017 as early as May 22, 2017. Likewise, Director Martha Roxana C. Sese, Cluster 6 – Health and Science, National Government Sector (NOS), this Commission, gave a favorable recommendation on the DSWD's request for concurrence in the Contract of Services of Atty. Ortiz­Rosete; and 5. COA granted concurrence with respect to Atty. Ortiz-Rosete's 2015 and 2016 Contracts of Services, justifying the exceptional reasons for DSWD FO No. 10 to engage her services.[13] Stated differently, DSWD asse1ied that Atty. Ortiz-Rosete's rehiring was justified because: (a) the DSWD Central Office's scarce legal manpower could no longer accommodate requests for legal assistance from the FOs; (b) DSWD developed trust and confidence in Atty. Ortiz-Rosete on account of her previous years' service to DSWD; (c) the Solicitor General approved the 2017 Contract; (d) the COA Director already recommended that DSWD's request for concurrence be granted; and (e) the COA already concurred in the 2015 and 2016 Contracts hiring Atty. Ortiz-Rosete. Further, it pointed out that Atty. Ortiz-Rosete already rendered the required services pursuant to her 2017. Thus, she must be compensated for the work she has performed.[14] Ruling of the COA Proper In the assailed Decision No. 2020-334, the COA Proper denied DSWD's motion and affirmed the COA LRR's ruling.[15] It emphasized that, pursuant to COA Circular No. 86-255, as amended by COA Circular No. 95-011, as well as the Court's pronouncements in Polloso v. Hon. Gangan[16] ( Polloso ) and Phividec Industrial Authority v. Capital Steel Corporation,[17] the Solicitor General's approval and the COA's concurrence shall first be secured before the DSWD may engage the services of a private legal counsel.[18] Expenditures arising from the hiring of private lawyers without the aforementioned prior written conformities shall be considered as irregular expenditures.[19] While it is true that this procedural rule may be relaxed, it is incumbent upon the party invoking liberality to justify their noncompliance with the rules. In the present case, DSWD admitted that its request for concurrence relative to the 2017 Contract was filed late or when the Contract was already expired. DSWD did not offer any reason justifying specifically its belated filing.[20] Thus, the COA Proper found no reason to set aside the procedural requirements of prior approval by the Solicitor General and concurrence by the COA.",The Court resolves to dismiss the petition for lack of merit.,"Preliminarily, the Court addresses matters of procedure concerning the timeliness of the present petition's filing and the sufficiency of the allegations contained therein. First, the following circumstances establish that the present petition was filed on time: (a) DSWD received a copy of the assailed ruling on November 11, 2020; (b) Pursuant to the 30-day reglementary period under Section 3, Rule 64 of the Rules of Court, DSWD had until December 11, 2020 to file its petition. However, right on the deadline, it requested for an additional 30 days;[25] (c) The Court granted this request and gave DSWD another 30 days counted from December 11, 2020 within which to file its petition; and (d) The 30th day of the extended period fell on January 10, 2021, a Sunday. DSWD filed the present petition on January 11, 2021, or the immediately succeeding business day. Second, although timely, it is proper to dismiss the present petition outright for its lack of bona fide imputations of grave abuse against the COA Proper. The Court's review of COA decisions via Rule 64 petitions is limited to jurisdictional errors or grave abuse of discretion.[26] In general, the Court shall dismiss the petition outright and uphold the COA's ruling[27] unless the petitioner establishes a prima facie case of grave abuse in his petition, that is, to specifically identify those acts committed by the COA that had been unauthorized, whimsical, or capricious.[28] The arguments, at best, point out mere errors of judgment. These are beyond the scope of certiorari proceedings.[30] II At any rate, the Court finds the COA Proper's refusal to concur in the subject Contract to be in accord with the prevailing rules and jurisprudence. In general, government entities are prohibited from securing the services of a private legal counsel. Prior Written Conformity/Concurrence Requirement By exception, government agencies may be allowed to engage a private lawyer, provided that they first comply with applicable rules and regulations. In particular, COA Circular No. 86-255, as amended by COA Circular No. 95-011, sets forth the following categorical requirement: [P]ublic funds shall not be utilized for payment of the services of a private legal counsel or law film to represent government agencies in court or to render legal services for them. In the event that such legal services cannot be avoided or is justified under extraordinary or exceptional circumstances, the written conformity and acquiescence of the Solicitor General or the Government Corporate Counsel, as the case may be, and the written concurrence of the Commission on Audit shall first be secured before the hiring or employment of a private lawyer or law firm. (Italics and underscoring supplied.) The rule is clear: the prior written conformity and concurrence of the Solicitor General and COA, respectively, are indispensable. There must be strict compliance: it must be timely (i.e., obtained prior to the hiring or employment of private lawyer) and complete (i.e., approval/concurrence of both the Solicitor General and COA). Otherwise, the engagement of a private lawyer is deemed unauthorized.[32] In the present case, DSWD's alleged compliance with the rule is not only belated, but also incomplete. Following are the dates critical to DSWD's engagement of Atty. Ortiz-Rosete relative to calendar year 2017: Event Date Execution of Contract November 2, 2016[33] Letter-Request to Solicitor General December 5, 2016[34] Solicitor General's Approval May 22, 2017[35] Request for COA Concurrence January 5, 2018[36] These make certain that there was an absolute lack of compliance on the part of DSWD. As to timeliness. The attempts to secure the required approvals were post facto. DSWD decided to secure the required approvals only after it already finalized its agreement to rehire Atty. Ortiz-Rosete. Its request for COA concurrence was overdue, so much so that the Contract period (i.e., 2017) had already ended by the time DSWD sent out its application to the COA. x x x As to completeness. Even if the Court assumes that the Solicitor General's approval was requested for and secured on time, one approval would have amounted only to a partial compliance. That the COA ultimately withheld its concurrence emphasizes that the required COA approval was never obtained. Contrary to DSWD's theory, a COA Director's favorable recommendation cannot take the place of a COA concurrence. Only the COA Proper[37] is authorized to issue a written concurrence in the hiring of a legal retainer. x x x In contrast, DSWD's glaring misstep here lies in having executed and completed the Contract without even requesting for the COA's conformity. Even its letter-request to the Solicitor General was sent only after it had already finalized the Contract. x x x All in all, the Court views DSWD's belated attempts to comply as mere afterthoughts to mend the irregular rehiring of Atty. Ortiz-Rosete. It must be stressed that there was a complete absence of the Solicitor General and COA's respective approvals when DSWD entered into the agreement, all throughout the contract period, and even upon and after its expiration. DSWD does not even deny its noncompliance. These considerations make certain that DSWD's execution of the Contract was premature and unauthorized. Finally, this is not a disallowance case. Thus, the Court's pronouncement shall not include a determination of the validity of payments made to Atty. Ortiz-Rosete under the 2017 Contract or the liability over any such payments.","the petition for certiorari is DISMISSED for lack of merit. The assailed Decision No. 2020-334 dated January 31, 2020 of the Commission on Audit Commission Proper is AFFIRMED."

FERRARIS, JR., BRANCH 7, MUNICIPAL TRIAL COURT IN CITIES, DAVAO CITY AND VIVIAN N. ODRUÑA, CLERK OF COURT III, SAME COURT, RESPONDENTS.","Owing to the compulsory retirement of Judge Rufino S. Ferraris, Jr. (Judge Ferraris, Jr.), the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) conducted a judicial audit of Branch 7, Municipal Trial Court in Cities (MTCC, Br. 7), Davao City, from August 25, 2020 to September 7, 2020. The OCA discovered delays in the rendition of judgment, resolution of pending incidents and motions, appropriate actions in the implementation of writs of execution, release of orders requiring the submission of counter-affidavits in criminal cases, and submission of returns and periodic reports in the implementation of writs of execution. It also identified the MTCC Br. 7's incorrect practices relating to case records management, reportorial requirements, implementation of the writs of execution, and incomplete details in the court-issued orders, such as the absence of the original signature of the presiding judge in some court documents and details of hearing dates in some of the pre-trial orders. The OCA found that Judge Ferraris, Jr. failed to decide one (1) civil case within the 30-day reglementary period, failed to resolve motions in three (3) civil cases, belatedly acted on the motion to plea bargain in six (6) criminal cases, failed to take appropriate actions in four (4) civil cases for a considerable time, and took no further action in four hundred sixty (460) criminal cases after directing the submission of counter-affidavits, leading to delay. He also failed to comply with relevant Supreme Court circulars on the preparation and submission of monthly and semestral docket inventory reports, and guidelines in the conduct of pre-trial. Ms. Odruña, as Clerk of Court, was found liable for simple neglect of duty for failure to supervise court personnel, and gross negligence for failure to timely release/mail orders in two hundred seventy-four (274) cases. As former sheriff, she was found guilty of gross neglect and gross inefficiency for failure to submit a return and/or periodic reports on the implementation of sixty-three (63) writs assigned to her from 2006 to 2017.","The Court agrees with the OCA's findings but modifies the recommended penalties, following the amendments in Rule 140 after Rules of Court (Rule 140). Applying the new rules, Judge Ferraris, Jr. is guilty of two (2) counts of gross neglect of duty in the performance of official functions, one (1) count of simple neglect of duty, and one (1) count of violation of Supreme Court rules, directives and circulars that establish an internal policy, rule of procedure or protocol. Ms. Odruña is found guilty of two (2) counts of gross neglect of duty (for failing to timely release orders in 274 criminal cases and for failing to implement writs/submit reports as former sheriff) and one (1) count of simple neglect of duty (for failure to supervise court personnel and ensure accurate docket reports).","The Court applied the provisions of the amended Rule 140 (A.M. No. 21-08-09-SC), specifically Section 21 which mandates separate penalties for multiple offenses arising from separate acts or omissions. The Court classified Judge Ferraris, Jr.'s unreasonable delays in motions/incidents and his failure to act on over 400 criminal cases as Gross Neglect of Duty (Serious Charge), his delay in deciding one case as Simple Neglect of Duty (Less Serious Charge), and his non-compliance with circulars as Violation of Supreme Court rules (Less Serious Charge). Ms. Odruña's failures as sheriff and her failure to timely release 274 orders were classified as Gross Neglect of Duty, and her failure to supervise personnel was Simple Neglect of Duty. Considering the mitigating circumstances—Judge Ferraris, Jr.'s advanced age, his compulsory retirement, and the adverse economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and Ms. Odruña's apologetic stance, 15 years of service, and the pandemic's economic effects—the Court applied Section 20 of A.M. No. 21-08-09-SC, reducing the total fine imposed on both respondents to half of the minimum prescribed amount.","FOR THESE REASONS, the Court finds former Judge Rufino S. Ferraris, Jr. GUILTY of two (2) counts of the serious charge of gross neglect of duty in the performance or nonperformance of official functions; one (1) count of the less serious charge of simple neglect of duty; and one (1) count of the less serious charge of violation of Supreme Court rules, directives, and circulars, that establish an internal policy, rule of procedure, or protocol. The Court imposes upon him the penalty of fines amounting to P100,001.00 for each count of gross neglect of duty; P35,001.00 for simple neglect of duty; and P35,001.00 for failure to comply with relevant rules and circulars, establishing an internal policy or a total of P270,004.00. After considering the mitigating circumstances, the penalty of fine is reduced to P135,002.00. The Court also finds Ms. Vivian N. Odruña GUILTY of two (2) counts of the serious charge of gross neglect of duty; and one (1) count of the less serious charge of simple neglect of duty. The Court imposes upon her the penalty of fines amounting to P100,001.00 for each count of gross neglect of duty; and P35,001.00 for simple neglect of duty or a total amount of P235,003.00. After considering the mitigating circumstances, the penalty of fine is reduced to P117,502.00 with a STERN WARNING that repetition of the same or similar act shall be dealt with more severely.

"G.R. No. 247367, December 05, 2022","MARIA LUISA MORALES, PETITIONER, VS. ABNER DE GUIA, REPRESENTED BY HIS ATTORNEY-IN-FACT, NOMERIANO DE GUIA, RESPONDENT.","Sometime in 1966, Abner bought an unregistered parcel of land from Beatriz and Esperidion Sabangan (Spouses Sabangan) with an area of 18,000 square meters and situated at Sitio Maquinaya, now known as Abra Street Extension, Barangay Barretto, Olongapo City (subject property). The sale was evidenced by a Deed of Sale of Miscellaneous Improvements and Transfer of Possessory Rights over Land. In 1968, former Mayor Amelia Gordon asked Abner if he could provide a place where Dominador Morales (Dominador) and his family (Morales family) could stay. Abner allowed the Morales family to stay on the property. On May 9, 1975, Dominador and Abner's wife, Diana de Guia, executed an Agreement wherein Dominador acknowledged the superior right and interest of Abner as owner of the property. Dominador also agreed to act as the overseer and tenant of the property. In consideration thereof, Abner allowed the Morales Family to stay on the property free of charge. Dominador agreed to vacate the property upon reasonable notice. In 1975, Abner and his family migrated to the United States of America (USA) where Abner, later on, became a naturalized American citizen. Unknown to Abner, Dominador declared portions of the property under Dominador and his children's names for tax purposes. Thus, on December 14, 2000, Abner, represented by his Attorney-in-fact, Nomeriano de Guia (Nomeriano), filed an Action for Recovery of Possession and Ownership of Real Property, Annulment of Documents and Damages against the Morales Family. The Regional Trial Court (RTC) ruled in favor of Abner, finding that Abner clearly substantiated his claim of ownership and that the Morales Family were in bad faith when they secured tax declarations in their names and applied for title. The CA affirmed the RTC Decision, denying the appeal on the ground that Dominador, et al. cannot arrogate the subject property unto themselves for the simple reason that they are mere caretakers who cannot deny the title of their landlord pursuant to Article 1436 of the New Civil Code.","The Petition is DENIED. The assailed Decision dated June 18, 2018 and the Resolution dated February 13, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 103406 are AFFIRMED.","The petition is without merit. Abner acquired the possessory rights to the property through a Deed of Sale of Miscellaneous Improvements and Transfer of Possessory Rights over Land in 1966 while he was still a natural-born Filipino citizen. As a result, he is deemed to have acquired a vested right over the property which cannot be defeated by the mere possession and occupation of the Morales Family as caretakers thereof. The prohibition under Sections 7 and 8 of Article XII of the 1987 Constitution finds no application in the present case as the prohibition pertains to the acquisition of property after a natural-born Filipino has lost his or her citizenship. Maria Luisa and her family never denied that they occupied and possessed the property as overseers and caretakers of Abner. As such, they cannot acquire ownership over the property even by acquisitive prescription because their possession was not adverse. Furthermore, Maria Luisa’s bare assertion that Abner verbally stated that the portion on which they built their bungalow was already given to them does not hold water as it lacks the formalities required by law, noting that acts and contracts which create, transmit, modify or extinguish real rights over immovable property should be embodied in a public document (Article 1358 of the Civil Code).","WHEREFORE, the Petition is DENIED.

That on or about March 1-6, 2007, within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, accused Elenor Tan, as proprietress of Aiko Shine Fabric, conspiring and confederating with accused Danilo Opiniano, a licensed customs broker, imported shipment of 4,600 bags of wheat flour under Import Entry & Internal Declaration No. C36022, Bill of Lading MOLU489001962, and Commercial Invoice No. 85214 there under­-declared said shipment by as much as 65% of its actual weight both accused fraudulently declaring that the net weight per bag of the said shipment of wheat was only 8.7 kgs. contrary to the net real weight of 115,000 kgs[.], and not 40,000 kgs. for which accused Elenor Tan paid only P99,521.00 as total duties and taxes thereon, when in truth and in fact, the total duties and taxes on said importation of wheat should have been P274,539.00, in violation of the Tariff and Customs Code of the Philippines.
When Opiniano and Tan were arraigned, both pleaded not guilty. The prosecution presented evidence showing that Opiniano, as a customs broker for Aiko Shine Fabric (owned by Tan), declared the shipment with a Net Weight of 40,000 kgs., but physical examination revealed the actual weight was 115,000 kgs. (65% misdeclaration), resulting in a shortage of P175,018.00 in duties and taxes paid. Opiniano testified that he relied on the commercial documents provided by the consignee and had no further participation after the BOC filed seizure proceedings. The RTC convicted Opiniano but acquitted Tan for failure of the prosecution to prove identification. Opiniano was sentenced to suffer indeterminate imprisonment of eight (8) years and one (1) day, as minimum, to twelve (12) years, as maximum, and to pay a fine of P8,000.00. The CA affirmed the RTC's conviction, holding that Opiniano's failure to verify the veracity of the information and his subsequent request for the tentative release of the goods instead of recomputation negated good faith. Opiniano then filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari before the Supreme Court.",The Petition is impressed with merit.,"The Court ruled that the prosecution failed to prove all elements of violation of Section 3602 of the TCCP, specifically the third element: intent to avoid payment of taxes. Citing jurisprudence (*Remigio v. Sandiganbayan*) and Republic Act No. 9280 (Customs Brokers Act of 2004), the Court stressed that a customs broker is not required to go beyond the documents presented by the importer, and the certification he signs is based only on those documents. Furthermore, Section 1301 of the TCCP establishes *prima facie* knowledge of illegality only upon the importer, not the customs broker. Since the lower courts found no conspiracy between Opiniano and Tan, Opiniano's conviction required proof of his personal and knowing participation with intent to evade taxes. The Court rejected the CA's reasoning that Opiniano's acts subsequent to the seizure proved intent: (1) failure to request recomputation is irrelevant as reappraisal and recomputation follow automatically upon seizure; and (2) requesting the tentative release of the shipment is a valid and explicitly sanctioned remedy under Section 2301 of the TCCP to avoid additional charges, and cannot be the basis for finding bad faith or criminal intent. Since reasonable doubt existed as to Opiniano's culpability, his acquittal was necessary.","WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is hereby GRANTED. The Decision dated May 7, 2018 and Resolution dated December 12, 2018 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 38982 are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Accordingly, petitioner Danilo L. Opiniano is ACQUITTED of the crime charged. Let entry of judgment be issued immediately. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 230041, December 05, 2022","BONPACK CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. NAGKAKAISANG MANGGAGAWA SA BONPACK-SOLIDARITY OF UNIONS IN THE PHILIPPINES FOR EMPOWERMENT AND REFORMS (NMB-SUPER), REPRESENTED BY ITS UNION PRESIDENT, ZOSIMA** BUCIO, RESPONDENT.","Petitioner is a domestic corporation engaged in the business of manufacturing flexible packaging for snack foods, breads, juices, and candies. Respondent, on the other hand, is a legitimate labor organization and the sole and exclusive bargaining agent of all the rank-and-file employees of petitioner. From August 2, 2009 to August 1, 2014, the parties were governed by their duly executed and registered CBA. On October 17, 2014, the parties executed a new CBA, which also had a term of five years. On compensable working hours and payment of overtime work, Sections 1 and 2 of Article VII of the CBA essentially states that the working hours shall be eight hours a day including meal break of 30 minutes and two 15-minute coffee breaks. On the exercise of management prerogatives, Sec. 3 of Art. VI of the CBA provides that ""[t]he COMPANY shall discuss with the UNION matters that may involve decisions or policies that may adversely affect the general welfare of the members."" Petitioner then unilaterally revised its old Company Rules and Regulations (CRR), purportedly to harmonize it with the new CBA. The revised CRR also defined the act of committing an ""over break"" as an offense, noting: Over break. Taking coffee or snack breaks of more than fifteen (15) minutes, lunch breaks more than one (1) hour for non-straight time and more than thirty (30) minutes for straight time employees. Petitioner subsequently implemented the same after conducting a general assembly. However, respondent unfavorably reacted to the implementation of the revised CRR without it being consulted at all, especially on the imposition of harsher penalties. Respondent also claimed that petitioner was underpaying the employees' overtime pay by deducting their one-hour meal period from their total number of working hours with overtime, contrary to the CBA mandated 30-minute meal break and two 15-minute coffee breaks included in the eight-hour workday. Respondent's requests to formally organize a labor-management committee were unheeded. In February 2015, respondent lodged a complaint before the NCMB questioning the validity of the revised CRR and asking for the correct payment of the employees' overtime pay. The Voluntary Arbitrator (VA) partially ruled in favor of respondent, upholding the validity of the CRR but modifying the computation of overtime pay in a subsequent resolution, leading both parties to appeal.","WHEREFORE, this petition is GRANTED. BONPACK is hereby ordered to pay: a) the wage for the 8-hour workday to the employees who are able to prove that they took meal and rest periods in accordance with the CBA; b) the four (4) hours overtime pay to the employees who are able to prove that they worked for 12 hours and took their meal and rest periods in accordance with the CBA; c) the wage for the 8-hour workday to the employees who are able to prove that they took their meals in an hour equivalent to the CBA compensable meal and rest periods included in a regular workday; d) the four (4) hours overtime pay to the employees who are able to prove that they worked for 12 hours and took their meal and rest periods in an hour, which should be equivalent to the CBA compensable meal and rest periods included in an 8-hour workday. BONPACK is likewise ordered to immediately comply with the provisions of the CBA on consultation with the union on the interpretation and enforcement of the new CRR. SO ORDERED.","The Court finds that respondent substantially complied with the 15-day reglementary period on filing the petition for review before the CA under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court, noting that at the time the petition was filed, the 2005 VA Procedural Guidelines expressly prohibited a motion for reconsideration, thus justifying direct resort to the CA within 15 days. On the merits, the Court disagrees with petitioner, finding that the exercise of management prerogative is limited by the CBA. Petitioner violated Sec. 3 of Art. VI and Art. XXIV of the CBA by unilaterally revising and implementing the CRR without consulting the UNION on matters affecting the general welfare of the members and labor-management relations. The general assembly was insufficient as the CBA required discussion with the UNION. The changes made in the CRR were substantial, imposing a harsher system of punishment. Lastly, the CBA-mandated 30-minute meal break and two 15-minute coffee breaks, totaling one hour of rest periods, were purposely integrated into the normal eight-hour workday and thus compensable. Petitioner's policy allowing a one-hour continuous meal break was a circumvention of the CBA intended to lessen compensable work hours. Therefore, employees who worked for 12 hours and took their meal breaks in accordance with the CBA must be compensated for four hours of overtime pay.","WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED. The Decision dated July 29, 2016 and the Resolution dated February 14, 2017 of the Court of Appeals, in CA-G.R. SP No. 141529, are hereby AFFIRMED in toto. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 248350, December 05, 2022","JOEMARIE MENDOZA Y BUCAD ALIAS ""JOE"", PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","As narrated by the CA, the prosecution averred that on 15 April 2016 at around 10:30 p.m., in Barangay Palanan, Makati City, Police Officer 3 Elberto Rojas, Jr. (PO3 Rojas), PO3 Luisito Leif Marcelo (PO3 Marcelo), PO2 Michelle Gimena (PO2 Gimena), PO3 Joemar Cahanding (PO3 Cahanding), and other operatives from the Station Anti-Illegal Drugs Special Operation Task Group (SAID-SOTG), Makati City Police implemented Search Warrant SW-16-288-MN dated 13 April 2016 issued by Judge Jimmy Edmund G. Batara of Branch 72, RTC of Malabon City, against Jay Tan, also known as Eugene Tan/Jhay Tan, in the latter's residence at No. 5379, Curie Street, Barangay Palanan, Makati City for violation of RA 9165 and Illegal Possession of Firearms. The operatives entered by breaking open the said house. In a room on the ground floor, they chanced upon petitioner sitting on the floor, holding a pen gun, and in front of him were one small transparent plastic sachet with shabu, and two glass pipes or improvised tooters. Petitioner was arrested and apprised of his constitutional rights. Continuing their search, the operatives found a vault, broke it open, and found guns and ammunitions of various calibers, a digital weighing scale, plastic sachet with shabu and marijuana, pieces of ecstasy and Celebrex capsules, monies of various denomination and currencies, checks and a couple of passport in the name of one Joseph Eugene Tan y Baltonado. Then and there, PO3 Marcelo, the assigned recorder, marked the plastic sachet found in front of petitioner as ""LFM-27"" and the two glass pipes/improvised tooters collectively as ""LFM-32,"" as well as other pieces of evidence found inside the vault, which were not subject of the instant case. In the presence of Barangay Kagawad Jose Villa Jr. (Kagawad Villa), PO3 Marcelo conducted an inventory of the seized items and prepared an Inventory Receipt. Photographs were also taken at the place of arrest. After his medical examination, petitioner was brought to the police station. PO3 Marcelo turned over the seized pieces of evidence to Senior Police Officer 2 Ramon Esperanzate (SPO2 Esperanzate), assigned investigator-on-case, who prepared the documents pertinent to the case. Thereafter, SPO2 Esperanzate delivered the drug specimens to Police Senior Inspector Rendielyn Sahagun (PSI Sahagun) who conducted the laboratory examination of the plastic sachet. The examination yielded a positive result for the presence of methamphetamine hydrochloride. On the other hand, petitioner denied the charges against him. He claimed that on 14 April 2016 at around 10:30 p.m., he was inside the house at No. 5379; Curie Street, Barangay Palanan, Makati City, when he heard a banging on the gate. When he opened the gate, he was asked by one of the male persons about a certain ""Jay."" He replied that nobody by that name lived in the house. The men pushed him back, handcuffed him, and some of them forcibly went inside the house. Using an axe, they went into the room of Joseph, petitioner's brother-in-law, where they found an identification document (I.D.) and passport. Afterwards, petitioner was boarded on a vehicle. During the inquest proceedings, the following documents were submitted to the City Prosecutor's Office: (1) Final Investigation Report, (2) Request for Laboratory Exam, (3) Request for Drug Test, (4) Result of the Laboratory Exam, (5) Inventory Receipt, (6) Chain of Custody, (7) Mug Shot/Photo Gallery, (8) Photocopy of Search Warrant, (9) PDEA Spot Report, (10) Temp. Medical Certificate, (11) Joint Affidavit of Arrest, and (12) Affidavit of Undertaking. In a Resolution dated 22 April 2016, Senior Assistant City Prosecutor Wilhelmina B. Go-Santiago recommended petitioner to be indicted for violation of RA 10591 otherwise known as the Comprehensive Firearms and Ammunitions Regulation Act, and Sections. 11 and 12, Art. II of RA 9165. Two Informations were filed before the RTC against petitioner, the accusatory portions of which read: Criminal Case No. R-MKT-16-765-CR On the 15th day of April 2016, in the city of Makati, the Philippines, accused, not being lawfully authorized by law to possess and without the corresponding prescription, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have in his possession, direct custody and control zero point sixty-five (0.65) gram of white crystalline substance containing methamphetamine hydrochloride, a dangerous drug. Criminal Case No. R-MKT-16-766-CR On the 15th day of April 2016, in the city of Makati, the Philippines, accused, without being authorized by law to possess equipment, instrument, apparatus, and other paraphernalia fit or intended for smoking, administering or introducing any dangerous drug, into the body, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have in his possession, direct custody and control two improvised pipe tooters, containing traces of methamphetamine hydrochloride, which are dangerous drug paraphernalia, in violation of the above-cited law. During arraignment, petitioner entered a plea of not guilty. Pre-trial and trial ensued. The prosecution presented the following witnesses: (1) Kagawad Villa; (2) PO2 Gimena, and PO3 Rojas. The parties stipulated on the testimonies of PO3 Marcelo and PSI Sahagun, the forensic chemist. On the other hand, the defense presented petitioner as the sole witness.","In its Decision dated 05 July 2017, the RTC convicted petitioner for violation of Sections 11 and 12, Art. II of RA 9165. The fallo reads: WHEREFORE, finding accused JOEMARIE MENDOZA y BUCAD @ ""Joe"" guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of violation of Republic Act No. 9165, judgment is hereby rendered, as follows: 1] For Criminal Case No. R-MKT-16-765-CR, for violation of Section 11 of RA 9165, accused is hereby sentenced to suffer imprisonment for an indeterminate term of twelve (12) years and one (1) day as minimum, to twenty (20) years as maximum and to pay a fine of three hundred thousand pesos (Php300,000.00) and 2] For Criminal Case No. R-MKT-16-766-CR, for violation of Section 12 of RA 9165, accused is hereby sentenced to suffer imprisonment for an indeterminate sentence to suffer imprisonment of six (6) months and one (1) day as minimum to four (4) years as maximum and to pay a fine of fifty thousand pesos (Ph50,000.00) Further, let the zero point sixty-five (0.65) gram of methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu) be turned over to PDEA for proper disposition. SO ORDERED. The RTC found that the evidence on record are sufficient to convict petitioner. It was ruled that his arrest was valid because he was caught in plain view, and that the corpus delicti in this case has been established with moral certainty. In its Decision dated 11 February 2019, the CA denied the appeal, and affirmed the RTC ruling, thus: WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the instant appeal is hereby DENIED. The Decision dated 5 July 2017 rendered by the Regional Trial Court, Branch 135, Makati City, in Criminal Case Nos. R­MKT-16-765-CR and R-MKT-16-766-CR is hereby AFFIRMED in TOTO. SO ORDERED. The CA ruled that petitioner cannot question the validity of the search warrant, which was issued against Jay Tan a.k.a Eugene Tan/Jhay Tan. Further, the legality of the seizure can only be contested by the party whose rights have been impaired thereby, and objection to an unlawful search and seizure is purely personal and cannot be availed of by third parties. Thus, petitioner cannot be considered a real party-in-interest to question the validity of the search warrant. It was also held that the seized items were under petitioner's immediate possession and control, there being no other person in the room where he was caught in flagrante delicto. Further, the CA affirmed the RTC's finding that the prosecution was able to establish the corpus delicti with moral certainty as well as the consecutive movement of the seized drug items. Correlatively, the CA also held that the denial of petitioner deserves scant consideration as it was unsupported and unsubstantiated by clear and convincing evidence. The CA likewise denied petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration in its Resolution dated 11 July 2019.","The Court holds that the search warrant in this case is void for violating the one-specific-offense rule, as it covered violations of RA 9165 (Dangerous Drugs Act) and RA 10591 (Firearms Act). The Court cannot sever the supposed ""valid"" portions of the search warrant in relation to one of the crimes stated therein after the fact of its implementation. Proceeding from the invalidity of the search warrant, the evidence obtained pursuant thereto are inadmissible. While petitioner waived the right to question the legality of his arrest by participating in the arraignment, this waiver does not extend to the inadmissibility of the evidence seized. The plain view doctrine is inapplicable because the police officers had no prior justification for intrusion, as their presence was based on the invalid search warrant. Furthermore, there was a fatal violation of the chain of custody rule under Section 21 of RA 9165, as amended. The required witnesses, specifically a representative of the National Prosecution Service or the media, were absent during the inventory and photography of the seized items, and the prosecution offered no explanation for this non-observance. Absent such justification, the corpus delicti of the crimes charged has not been established. Thus, the acquittal of petitioner is in order.","WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the petition is hereby GRANTED. The Decision dated 11 February 2019 and the Resolution dated 11 July 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 40706 is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Accordingly, petitioner Joemarie Mendoza y Bucad ""Joe"" is ACQUITTED of the crimes charged and ORDERED RELEASED from detention unless he is being lawfully held for another cause. The Director of the Bureau of Corrections, Muntinlupa City is ORDERED to inform the Court of the action taken within five days from receipt of this Decision.

"G.R. No. 247401, December 05, 2022","ROMEO BACOD Y MERCADO, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","Four consolidated Informations were filed with the RTC charging Bacod and another accused, Remigio Umali y De Leon (Umali), with Robbery, violation of RA 10591, and violation of PD 1866 as amended by RA 9516. Of the four Informations, three of them implicate petitioner Bacod. The accusatory portions of the three Informations read: Criminal Case Nos. R-QZN-15-03913-CR [Illegal Possession of Firearms] That on or about the 20th day of April, 2015, in Quezon City, Philippines, the said accused, without authority of law, did, then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have in his possession and under his custody and control One (1) Caliber .45 pistol (Remington) with defaced Serial number inserted with one (1) magazine loaded with seven (7) pieces of live ammunition, without the necessary license to possess, in violation of said law. CONTRARY TO LAW. Criminal Case Nos. R-QZN-15-03915-CR [Illegal Possession of Explosives] That on or about the 20th day of April, 2015 in Quezon City, Philippines, the above-named accused, without any authority of law, did, then and there, willfully, unlawfully and knowingly have in his possession and under his custody and control one (1) MK-2 Fragmentation Hand Granade (serviceable), without necessary license to possess, in violation of said law. CONTRARY TO LAW. Criminal Case Nos. R-QZN-15-03916-CR [Highway Robbery] That on or about the 20th day of April, 2015, in Quezon City, Philippines, the said accused, conspiring, confederating with other persons whose true name, identity and whereabouts have not yet been ascertained and mutually helping each other, with intent to gain and by means of violence and/or intimidation against persons, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously rob and take away one (1) truck load of Champion Laundry Bar/Powder soap more or less One Thousand Three Hundred And Twenty Eight (1,328) boxes/sacks with estimate amount of Php1,200,000.00, Philippine Currency, along with Isuzu Ten Wheeler Truck with Plate No. HVR-802 driven by one ERNESTO A. OITE, owned by, and registered to, S&S Trucking/Roderick Ilagan, represented by Elmer R. Ramos, while the said vehicle was traversing G. Araneta Avenue, this city, to the damage and prejudice of said offended party, in the amount aforementioned. CONTRARY TO LAW. [4] When Bacod and Umali were arraigned, both pleaded not guilty. During trial, the prosecution's evidence, as summarized by Bacod in his Appellant's Brief and adopted by the CA, established the following: 5. At around 11:00 o'clock in the evening of 20 April 2015, driver ERNESTO A. OITE (hereinafter ""Ernesto"") and his helper, MICHAEL P. ROSAS (hereinafter ""Michael""), were travelling along G. Aranet[a] Avenue, corner Palanza Street, in Barangay Santol, Quezon City, aboard a ten (10) – wheeler truck carrying One Thousand Three Hundred Twenty ­Eight (1,328) boxes/sacks of laundry soap worth approximately One Million [T]wo Hundred Thousand Pesos (P1,200,000.00). Ernesto later noticed that a car and a van were tailing him and trying to block his way. At first, Ernesto tried to shake off the pursuing vehicles, but upon stopping at a red light the van was able to stop by his side of the truck while the car blocked the truck's path in front. About five (5) men in police uniforms and with guns tucked by their waists suddenly emerged from the van and the car, and then approached the truck. The unknown men in police uniforms asked for the receipt covering the truck's cargo so Ernesto alighted to comply. However, just as he was handing over the receipt, the strangers grabbed him and tried to put him inside their van. Ernesto saw that Michael was similarly being dragged away to the vehicle so they both wriggled out of their captors' clutches and ran away. 5.1 Ernesto and Michael were soon able to board a tricycle, and with the help of the latter's driver, were able to arrive at a police checkpoint along Guirayan Street, corner Aurora Boulevard, in Barangay Doña Imelda, Quezon City by 11:15 o'clock of that same night. At the checkpoint, Ernesto and Michael reported how their truck had just been held up and taken away. In response, PO3 ROMMEL APANAY (hereinafter ""PO3 Apanay""), PO3 EDEL CAÑAVERAL (hereinafter ""PO3 Cañaveral""), PO1 ZOILO NAZARIO (hereinafter ""PO1 Nazario""), and PO1 TEODERICO SERRANO, JR. (hereinafter ""PO1 Serrano, Jr.""), who were then manning the checkpoint, boarded their police mobile along with Ernesto and Michael and then went after the stolen truck. 5.2 The police officers quickly sighted and then caught up with the truck just as it was heading into Pureza Street. With the stolen vehicle's path effectively barricaded off by the police car, the real policemen exited their mobile with guns drawn, took up firing positions around the truck, and then ordered its occupants to come out of the truck — later identified as accused Romeo M. Bacod — and was promptly arrested by PO3 Cañaveral and PO3 Apanay. PO1 Nazario frisked the suspect and found a .45-caliber Remington semi-automatic pistol tucked in the latter's waist. At the same time, PO1 Serrano, Jr. ordered the suspect to open the sling bag he was carrying. The suspect did so and there the police officers saw and confiscated a hand grenade from the bag. Afterwards, the policemen brought their quarry back to the police station where Ernesto identified the arrestee as one of the brigands. Later, upon inspection of the pistol at the police station, the same was found to contain in its magazine seven (7) live rounds of ammunition. From the locus of arrest up to the police station, PO1 Nazario held custody of the gun, [ammunition], and hand grenade taken from Romeo M. Bacod. 5.3 During that same pursuit and arrest, another roving team of police officers aboard other mobiles arrived at the scene after being summoned via police radio to aid in the chase. Thus, while PO3 WELSON CAÑA (hereinafter ""PO3 Caña""), PO3 ROQUE GERALDEZ (hereinafter ""PO3 Geraldez""), PO3 Julie Ann Jo Cinco (hereinafter ""PO3 Cinco""), PO2 ALEMAR FAJARDO (hereinafter ""PO2 Fajardo""), PO2 JOVENNY SERRANO (hereinafter ""PO2 Serrano""), PO1 NOEL SANCHEZ (hereinafter ""PO1 Sanchez""), and PO1 MARCO ROGEL COMBOYA (hereinafter ""PO1 Comboya""), were scanning the nearby streets, they found a car carrying one (1) man parked somewhere along Pureza Street. PO3 Geraldez and PO1 Comboya approached the car, shined a light through its windows, and inside they saw that the passenger was wearing a police officer's athletic uniform. The passenger was ordered out of the car, and after he alighted, Ernesto identified him as one of the robbers. The man, later identified as accused Remigio D. Umali, was apprehended. Then, PO3 Caña proceeded to bodily search Umali while PO3 Cinco searched the suspect's car. Tucked by the arrestee's waist was found a .38-caliber revolver containing five (5) rounds of live ammunition in its cylinder. 5.4 The police officers brought the accused and the pieces of evidence seized back to the police station, where case investigator SPO3 ANDRES DULAY (hereinafter ""SPO3 Dulay"") received the confiscated evidence from the arresting officers. The police officers then marked the .45-caliber pistol ""RB/ZN,"" its magazine ""RB/ZN-8,"" and the seven (7) cartridges in it, ""RB/ZN-1"" to ""RB/ZN-7,"" respectively. The hand grenade was marked ""RB/TS 4-20-15."" The revolver was marked ""RU/WC 4-20-15"" and the five (5) cartridges in it were marked ""RU/WC-1"" to ""RU/WC-5,"" respectively. Photographs of the evidence recovered were also taken during the same occasion. Eventually, the police officers executed their sworn statements regarding the arrest and the corresponding charges were filed against both of the accused. [5] As for the defense, Bacod testified in his behalf. Umali, on the other hand, did not testify as he jumped bail. The cases filed against him were placed in the archived docket of the RTC pending his apprehension or voluntary surrender. [6] Bacod's testimony, as summarized by the RTC, was as follows: Thereafter, the defense presented its lone witness, accused ROMEO BACOD y MERCADO, working as a Mechanic-Driver and residing at No. 187, 4th St., Bagong Barrio, Zone 12, Caloocan City, and testified that he was at home on April 20, 2015, resting when four policemen together with his co-accused Remigio Umali came to him and asked him to fix a ten-wheeler truck that broke down in Sta. Mesa, Manila. When they reached Pureza Street, he saw the ten-wheeler truck. He dismantled the clutch and replaced it with rubber cap. He alleged that a person drove the truck with him sitting on the passenger seat following the Mitsubishi Galant driven by accused Remigio Umali to the place which is unfamiliar to him. Then all of a sudden, police officers came and flagged them down because according to those police officers[,] the truck was a hijacked vehicle. He testified that in fear[,] he did not know what to say to the police officers who apprehended him while the other persons who were earlier introduced to him by Remigio Umali as policemen were able to scamper from the crime scene. He was then brought to the police station where an investigation was conducted. At the police station, he was surprised to know that the said ten-wheeler and its contents were hijacked by his companions. He denied the allegations that he possesse[d] a caliber .45 Remington piston and a grenade and the same were not recovered from him. During his cross-examination, he mentioned that he met those police officers who flagged them down only for the first time on the night of April 20, 2015 when he was apprehended by them and that he had no previous altercation with the said police officers. He could only deny the allegations imputed against him as far as his possession of the caliber .45 Remington pistol with five live ammunitions and a hand grenade. He also mentioned that he failed to file a case against the police officers for their alleged planting of object evidence.","In a Decision dated January 14, 2019, the CA denied the appeal with modification as to the penalty imposed. The dispositive portion of the Decision reads: WHEREFORE, the instant appeal is DENIED. Accordingly, the Decision dated February 24, 2017 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 224 of Quezon City convicting accused-appellant in Criminal Case Nos. R­QZN-15-03913-CR and R-QZN-15-03915-CR for violation of Section 28 (a) in relation to Section 28 (e-1) of Republic Act No. (RA) 10591 and Presidential Decree No. (PD) 1866, as amended by RA 9516, respectively, is hereby AFFIRMED with a modification in that the penalty, in Criminal Case No. R-QZN-15-03913-CR, is adjusted to eight (8) years and one (1) day of prision mayor in its medium period, as minimum, to eleven (11) years of prision mayor in its maximum period as maximum.","Contrary to Bacod's contentions, the seized items upon which his convictions are anchored were not inadmissible. The CA was correct in its ruling that Bacod's acquittal in the Robbery charge did not result in the invalidity of his arrest. As the arrest was lawful, the warrantless search conducted on his person which led to the discovery of the firearms, ammunition, and hand grenade subject of this case was, therefore, lawful as well. . . Based on the foregoing, the Court rules that the exception applies in the present case. . . All of the foregoing circumstances lead to the conclusion that there was probable cause from the perspective of the police officers to arrest Bacod. Probable cause is defined 'as a reasonable ground of suspicion, supported by circumstances sufficiently strong in themselves as to warrant a reasonable man in believing that the accused is guilty.' . . . Having said the foregoing, the Court is thus of the opinion that the police officers had probable cause to effect a warrantless arrest, under Rule 113, Section 5(b) of the Rules of Criminal Procedure, upon Bacod. As there was a valid arrest, the inevitable conclusion is thus that the ensuing search upon Bacod was a valid 'search incidental to a lawful arrest.' Ultimately, this finding results in the admissibility of the items confiscated from Bacod during the search. In sum, the CA did not err in its ruling that the pieces of object evidence in this case were admissible. As to the elements of the crime, the CA also committed no error, and the Court adopts the following findings and conclusions of the CA: In illegal possession of a firearm, two (2) things must be shown to exist: (a) the existence of the subject firearm; and (b) the fact that the accused who possessed the same does not have the corresponding license for it. In the instant case, the prosecution proved beyond reasonable doubt the elements of the crime. . .

"G.R. No. 233577, December 05, 2022","LEO A. LASTIMOSA, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.","The present case stemmed from an Information for Libel, the accusatory portion of which reads: That on or about the 29th day of June 2007, in the City of Cebu, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with evident purpose of impeaching the virtue, honesty, integrity and reputation of the person of GWENDOLYN F. GARCIA, the Governor of the Province of Cebu, a [C]ebuana woman, mother and grandmother[,] and with malicious intent of exposing her to public contempt and ridicule[,] did then and there willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously compose, prepare, write, publish and cause to be composed, prepared, written and published in the 29th day of June, 2007 issue of The Freeman, a newspaper of general and public circulation throughout the Visayas area, printed and published in Cebu City, the contents of which are in the column ""Arangkada"" and are herein set forth as follows: x x x x Roughly translated to English, as follows: [Doling the thief] Doling is a fish-monger, whose life suddenly changed. Suddenly, her vehicles increased in numbers. Like mushrooms, her property sprouted. Suddenly, her business grew and widened. In short, it seemed she won the lotto grand prize. That's the story she told her inquisitive neighbors, But none of them believed her. Nobody heard that there was a lotto grand prize winner in their area. Even the inveterate gamblers have not heard of a neighbor getting lucky, or even one who won a minor prize. That is why Doling was blanketed with widespread suspicion. Where did her huge money really came (sic) from? *** Due to her wealth, Doling easily won as Barangay captain. Even if her election was contested, nobody was able to stop her from assuming office. This led to her true character to surface. Her being a loudmouth was known when she was yet a fish-monger. But nobody was prepared for her abrasiveness when she already amassed wealth. More so nobody else knew how to shield themselves from her scathing tirades, which even a mad dog could not swallow, when she already held political power. That is why when a neighbor insinuated that her wealth was ill-gotten, Doling viciously erupted like a lightning strike at high noon. *** Immediately, the person who had the nerve to cast a doubt as to her integrity was vilified: She called him names, she shamed him by the use of insulting terms, she mobilized all her subordinates to save her reputation and angrily, she filed a case in court. Her own tenants and helpers, whom she suspected of squealing to her hated neighbor, [were] not spared from her cruelty: Their personal belongings were forcibly pried open, they were threatened to be banished to the farthest swine farm; and aside from being threatened with termination, without any concern that their families would suffer from hunger, they would also be hailed to court so that they would really learn their lesson. *** The neighbor concerned got rattled defending himself from her harassment. Instead of being commended in his search for truth, his private business was even scrutinized for every imaginable fault or wrongdoing. Most pitiable is the situation of the poor tenants and helpers. The whole neighborhood felt fear. Afraid even to contemplate the calvary they will experience if, god forbid, they will be the object of her cruelty. Thus, even if they know something, and even with her cruel excesses, the majority chose to keep silent. *** When majority of the neighborhood [was] already fear[-]stricken, and nobody was brave enough to voice support for the few who stood up but already emaciated, Doling, in a supremely arrogant voice brought about by her unbridled power, admitted: ""Yes, I am indeed a thief! Can anybody do anything about it?"" and through the aforequoted imputations, had thus attributed to her the commission of vice, defects and/or acts, condition, status or circumstances which have undermined her integrity and caused her dishonor and discredit, to the damage and prejudice of said GWENDOLYN F. GARCIA. [4] During the arraignment, Lastimosa pleaded not guilty. [5] In the pre-trial of the case, the parties stipulated on the following facts: 1) That the accused-appellant is a tri-media practitioner who has a regular opinion column (""Arangkada"") in [T]he Freeman, a Cebu-based daily newspaper; 2) That the accused-appellant also has a radio commentary show from 6 to 10 a.m., Monday to Friday, aired over DYAB, an AM band radio station of ABS-CBN; 3) For television, the accused-appellant is a daily anchor of a news program (""TV Patrol-Central Visayas"") from 6-7 p.m. aired[,] locally over Channel 3 by ABS-CBN; 4) On 29 June 2007, [T]he Freeman published in the opinion column (""Arangkada"") an article written by the accused-appellant [titled] ""Si Doling Kawatan""; 5) Private complainant, Gwendolyn F. Garcia, is presently the incumbent Governor of the Province of Cebu, serving her third consecutive term; 6) At the time the said article was published, private complainant was also the Governor of the Province of Cebu then serving the penultimate date of her first term; 7) That the accused-appellant herein is the same person who wrote the subject article ""Si Doling Kawatan""; 8) That the private complainant, Honorable Governor Gwendolyn F. Garcia, had proclaimed the accused appellant as the pride of Cebu in the field of media, for the year 2006 by granting him the most prestigious Garbo sa Sugbo Award; 9) That it is a matter of public knowledge that Governor Gwendolyn F. Garcia of the Province of Cebu had never been a fish-monger; and 10) That [it] is likewise a matter of public knowledge that Governor Garcia had not been a Barangay Captain of any barangay in the country. [6] Trial on the merits ensued thereafter. According to the prosecution, Lastimosa had been a constant and vocal critic of then Governor Gwendolyn Garcia (Garcia), which resulted in the filing of several other libel cases against him. [7] The prosecution asserts that the article ""Si Doling Kawatan"" was about Garcia, and that Lastimosa wrote the same to tarnish her reputation as governor, ""and as a Cebuana woman, mother and grandmother."" [8] In support of its theory, the prosecution presented the following witnesses: 1) Glenn Baricuatro (Baricuatro), 2) Atty. Pacheco Seares (Atty. Seares); and 3) Garcia. Baricuatro was presented to prove that a third person would immediately know that Garcia was the one referred to in the article ""Si Doling Kawatan."" Atty. Seares was presented to prove that, in his media class at the University of the Philippines, nine of his 15 students observed that a plain reading of the said article pointed to Garcia as the character ""Doling."" Lastly, the prosecution submitted some of Lastimosa's older articles as documentary evidence to prove that Lastimosa had intimated in the past that Garcia was corrupt, ill-tempered, or foul-mouthed. [9] On the other hand, Lastimosa maintained that the article was merely a work of fiction in the third person narrative form. [10] He insisted that ""Doling"" did not refer to Garcia since the personal circumstances of ""Doling"" were different from Garcia's. [11] Ultimately, he argued that he could not be convicted of Libel as there was no clear identification of Garcia as ""Doling."" To substantiate Lastimosa's defense, they presented Atty. Democrito Barcenas (Atty. Barcenas) to prove that a third person would not think of Garcia when the article was read in full.","After trial, Branch 14, Regional Trial Court of Cebu City (RTC) issued a Decision [12] dated August 30, 2013, convicting Lastimosa of Libel. The dispositive portion of the said Decision reads: WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing premises, judgment is hereby rendered finding accused, LEO A. LASTIMOSA, GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of LIBEL and sentences him to a penalty of FINE of SIX THOUSAND [PESOS] with SUBSIDIARY IMPRISONMENT in case of INSOLVENCY. Accused is, likewise, ordered to pay private complainant, (Ex) Governor GWENDOLYN F. GARCIA the amount of TWO MILLION (Php2,000,000.00[)], for and as moral damages. Finally, accused is ordered to pay the costs of these proceedings. SO ORDERED. [13] In the assailed Decision [18] dated July 27, 2016, the CA affirmed Lastimosa's conviction albeit with modification as to the amount of damages awarded. The dispositive portion of the CA Decision reads: WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing premises, the appeal is hereby PARTIALLY GRANTED. Accordingly, the Judgment of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 14 in Cebu City is hereby AFFIRMED WITH MODIFICATION as to the amount of moral damages which is reasonably reduced to Php500,000 herein. The rest of the court a quo's ruling stands. SO ORDERED.","The appeal is meritorious. Lastimosa is acquitted of the crime charged. At the outset, it bears emphasis that ""the Court, in the course of its review of criminal cases elevated to it, still commences its analysis from the fundamental principle that the accused before it is presumed innocent."" [22] This assumes further significance in criminal prosecutions for libel as the Court needs to carefully tread the line between freedom of expression and of the press, on the one hand, and the power of the State to impose subsequent punishment on harmful speech, on the other. Thus, the Court would meticulously ensure first that all the elements of the crime are individually proven beyond reasonable doubt before arriving at a judgment of conviction. In this case, there is reasonable doubt in one of the elements, namely, the element that the person allegedly defamed must be identifiable in the subject writing. x x x Libel is defined as a ""public and malicious imputation of a crime, or of a vice or defect, real or imaginary, or any act, omission, condition, status, or circumstance tending to cause the dishonor, discredit, or contempt of a natural or juridical person, or to blacken the memory of one who is dead."" [23] ""For an imputation to be libelous, the following requisites must concur: a) it must be defamatory; b) it must be malicious; c) it must be given publicity and d) the victim must be identifiable."" [24] Absent any one of these elements precludes the commission of the crime of libel. [25] Regarding the first element, the Court finds that the imputation in the article ""Si Doling Kawatan"" is indeed defamatory. x x x As to the second element — the element of malice — the Court similarly finds that it was present as the law presumes malice because of the defamatory nature of the imputation. [27] x x x There is no question that the requirement of publicity is likewise present in this case. Lastimosa does not deny writing and publishing the subject article. Undoubtedly, therefore, the element of publicity is present. The last element — the element of identifiability of the victim — was, however, not established beyond reasonable doubt. The rule is that ""[i]n order to maintain a libel suit, it is essential that the victim be identifiable although it is not necessary that he be named."" [30] x x x The CA relied heavily on identification through description and by extrinsic evidence — through Baricuatro's testimony — to establish the link between ""Doling"" and Garcia. After a circumspect and assiduous study of the records, the Court finds contrary to the CA. A fair appreciation of Baricuatro's testimony reveals that his basis is primarily anchored on the auditory similarities between ""Doling"" and Garcia's name, Gwendolyn. x x x He even admitted to not having knowledge of the other circumstances or descriptions used to describe ""Doling"", i.e., sudden acquisition of properties and vehicles, becoming a Barangay Captain, and starting as a fishmonger. The similarities in how ""Doling"" and ""Gwendolyn"" sound when pronounced cannot, standing alone, be made the basis for establishing the link between the character ""Doling"" and Garcia. Even the testimony of the other prosecution witness, Atty. Seares, is insufficient to establish said link. None of the said nine students was presented as a witness, and the defense therefore did not have the opportunity to cross-examine them as regards the circumstances leading to such identification. The fact that those nine students recognized ""Doling"" as Garcia cannot be admitted into evidence as they constitute hearsay testimony. x x x Clear from the foregoing is the fact that none of the two witnesses who were meant to establish that third persons could recognize ""Doling"" as Garcia was able to confirm beyond reasonable doubt that it indeed referred to her. x x x While the requirement of identifiability is already complied with even if just one other person identifies the plaintiff as the subject of the defamatory words, it is material — for purposes of the plaintiff's recovery and/or the author's conviction — to establish how such third person was able to make the connection between the writing and the plaintiff. Such third person's recognition must be anchored in some description intrinsic to the writing and/or through some other extrinsic evidence. In this case, there is no anchor apart from the auditory similarities between ""Doling"" and Garcia's first name, Gwendolyn. x x x All told, there is reasonable doubt as to the element of identifiability which is necessary for a libel suit to prosper.","WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is hereby GRANTED. The Decision dated July 27, 2016 and Resolution dated August 2, 2017 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CEB-CR No. 02233 are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Accordingly, petitioner Leo A. Lastimosa is ACQUITTED of the crime charged. Let entry of judgment be issued immediately. SO ORDERED."
"A.C. No. 12552, December 05, 2022","JUDGE ADELBERT S. SANTILLAN, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. NEPTHALI P. SOLILAPSI, RESPONDENT.","Sometime in March 2019, a certain Princess Ivory Cabaguas Villanueva requested the office of Judge Santillan to issue a Certificate of Notarial Act indicating that Atty. Solilapsi recently notarized a Certificate of End of Contract and an Affidavit of Employment. Because of the request, Judge Santillan discovered that Atty. Solilapsi notarized the documents in March 2019 despite the expiration of his notarial commission in December 2018. On March 18, 2019, Judge Santillan issued Memorandum No. 8, Series of 2019 directing Atty. Solilapsi to explain and show cause why no disciplinary action should be meted out against him. In his Letter-Explanation, Atty. Solilapsi stated that the subject documents were notarized by his law office, but he only discovered their existence when his attention was called regarding the matter. Further, he averred that the documents were notarized in his absence and without his knowledge and permission. Through a Letter dated March 27, 2019, Judge Santillan reported the incident to the Office of the Court Administrator and recommended the filing of an administrative complaint against Atty. Solilapsi for violation of the Notarial Rules. On June 3, 2019, the Office of the Bar Confidant (OBC) acknowledged the administrative complaint and recommended that it be referred to Judge Santillan for investigation and adjudication. In the Resolution dated July 24, 2019, the Court adopted the OBC's recommendation, deemed the Letter dated March 27, 2019 as an official report, docketed it as a regular administrative case, and refe1Ted the case to Judge Santillan for investigation. During his investigation, Judge Santillan discovered that the Certificate of End of Contract and the Affidavit of Employment were the 208th and 331st documents, respectively, that Atty. Solilapsi notarized after the lapse of his notarial commission in December 2018. He found that Atty. Solilapsi had notarized more than 300 documents with an expired notarial commission. As such, Judge Santillan did not give credence to the excuse of Atty. Solilapsi that the subject documents were notarized in his absence and without his knowledge and permission. In his Report and Recommendation dated January 6, 2020, Judge Santillan recommended that Atty. Solilapsi be disqualified from being commissioned as notary public from January 2020 to December 2021 for notarizing more than 300 legal documents with an expired notarial commission. In the Resolution dated September 21, 2020, the Court resolved to treat the Report and Recommendation of Judge Santillan as an administrative complaint and to require Atty. Solilapsi to comment thereon within 10 days from notice. There being no comment filed to date, the Court dispenses with the filing thereof and now proceeds to decide the case on its merits.","The Court agrees with the findings of Judge Santillan but modifies the penalty to be imposed against Atty. Solilapsi in view of applicable jurisprudence. Here, it is undisputed that Atty. Solilapsi had notarized more than 300 legal documents with an expired notarial commission. That his office staff notarized the subject documents in his absence and without his knowledge and permission is not an acceptable excuse that would absolve him of any administrative liability in the case. After all, it is his bounden duty as a notary public to ensure that only those who are qualified or authorized may act as such. Thus, he cannot relieve himself of this responsibility by feigning ignorance of the acts of his office staff and passing the buck to them. Besides, the Court finds incredible the allegation of Atty. Solilapsi that he had no knowledge of the notarial acts done by his office staff. To accept his explanation that he was unaware of the notarization of over 300 legal documents, performed in his name and in his law office, is unthinkable as it is contrary to natural human experience. Similarly, by performing notarial acts with an expired notarial commission, Atty. Solilapsi violated Section 11, Rule III of the Notarial Rules, the Lawyer's Oath, and Rule 1.01, Canon 1 and Canon 7 of the CPR, which provides: Canon 1 — A lawyer shall uphold the constitution, obey the laws of the land and promote respect for law and legal processes. Rule 1.01 — A lawyer shall not engage in unlawful, dishonest, immoral or deceitful conduct. Canon 7 — A lawyer shall at all times uphold the integrity and dignity of the legal profession and support the activities of the integrated bar. Given Atty. Solilapsi's notarization of more than 300 legal documents with an expired notarial commission, the Court finds it proper to impose against him the penalties of suspension from the practice of law for a period of two (2) years and permanent disqualification from being commissioned as a notary public, in accordance with prevailing jurisprudence.","WHEREFORE, the Court finds respondent Atty. Nepthali P. Solilapsi GUILTY of violating the Lawyer's Oath, Rule 1.01, Canon 1 and Canon 7 of the Code of Professional Responsibility, and Section 11, Rule III of the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice. Accordingly, the Court hereby SUSPENDS him from the practice of law for two (2) years, REVOKES his incumbent commission as a notary public, if any, and PERMANENTLY DISQUALIFIES him from being commissioned as notary public, with a STERN WARNING that a repetition of the same or similar conduct in the future shall be dealt with more severely. The suspension in the practice of law shall take effect immediately upon receipt of this Decision by respondent. He is DIRECTED to immediately file a Manifestation to the Court that his suspension has started, copy furnished all courts and quasi-judicial bodies where he has entered his appearance as counsel. Let copies of this Decision be furnished to the Office of the Bar Confidant to be appended to respondent's personal record as an attorney; the Integrated Bar of the Philippines for its information and guidance; and the Office of the Court Administrator for circulation to all courts in the country.","GUILTY of violating the Lawyer's Oath, Rule 1.01, Canon 1 and Canon 7 of the Code of Professional Responsibility, and Section 11, Rule III of the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice."

LETICIA AND JOSEPH MATTINGLY, RESPONDENTS.","The subject property was formerly registered under Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. 706 in the name of Felix Valenzuela (Felix) and his wife, Candida (Candida). Respondent Leticia Valenzuela-Mattingly (Leticia) and petitioners are the children of Felix and Candida. Petitioners alleged that sometime in October 2006, Leticia had fraudulently purchased the subject property, covered by OCT No. 706, from their parents through a Deed of Absolute Sale (DOAS). TCT No. 223017 was issued in her name. On February 24, 2010, Leticia then sold it to Spouses Pabilani, who registered it in their names under TCT No. 227394. Petitioners claimed that the DOAS between Leticia and their parents was falsified because on the date which it was notarized, October 26, 2006, their mother Candida was already deceased, having previously died on March 3, 2006. They also claimed that their father Felix was paralyzed from a stroke and near death, dying 12 days after the DOAS execution on November 7, 2006. Petitioner Emerson P. Valenzuela filed a notice of adverse claim on the title of the subject property on July 16, 2009. Private respondents denied fraud, asserting Leticia paid off a prior loan for Felix and Candida, and the property was transferred to Leticia as repayment via an undated DOAS that Candida had signed. Spouses Pabilani alleged being buyers in good faith, relying on the cancellation of the notice of adverse claim on March 22, 2010.","The Court granted the petition, relaxing the procedural rules regarding the belated filing because the imminent loss of the petitioners' family home justified giving due course to the appeal, especially given the conflict in the factual findings of the RTC and the CA. The Court found the DOAS void ab initio because Candida had already died prior to the execution date of October 26, 2006, terminating her contractual capacity, rendering her signature a forgery, and invalidating the contract as absolutely simulated. Furthermore, upon Candida's death, petitioners became co-owners of her share in the property via succession (Art. 777). The Court also ruled that Spouses Pabilani were not innocent purchasers in good faith because they proceeded with the sale on February 24, 2010, despite the existence of the adverse claim annotated on Leticia's title at that time, and they were aware people (petitioners) were residing in the property upon inspection.","The March 14, 2018 Decision and the July 31, 2018 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA­G.R.

Stated differently, accused-respondents were charged with tax evasion on account of under-declaration of income in taxable years 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004, viz.: [Table omitted for brevity, but the text continues]
Upon arraignment on January 16, 2012, both accused-respondents entered their respective pleas of ""not guilty"" to the offenses charged. On February 27, 2012, the CTA Third Division consolidated Criminal Case No. O-243 with O-241. Subsequently, on March 21, 2012, the CTA motu proprio consolidated Criminal Case Nos. O-242 and O-244 with O-241. Trial ensued. The prosecution presented twelve witnesses... The BIR revenue officers testified that they examined accused-respondents' books of account for the relevant periods. In the course of their audit, their team identified the following real and tangible personal properties which they acquired, either directly by any one of them or indirectly through a third person during taxable years 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004: 1. Real Properties [listing a) through h)]; 2. Other Personal Properties [listing a Toyota Hilux]. The results of the NID-BIR audit investigation also alluded to various bank deposits, investments, and other properties purchased and/or amortization payments made (in relation to the aforementioned properties) by accused-respondents during the subject taxable years, viz.: [table of undeclared income per taxable year]. One of the NID-BIR's main sources of information on accused-respondents' bank deposits, investments, and amortization payments was an AMLC Investigation Report... The NID-BIR found the spouses' property acquisitions, bank deposits, and investments to be grossly disproportionate to what they actually declared in their Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Net Worth (SALN) and ITRs, viz.: [table of declared income]. The NID-BIR concluded that accused-respondent's failure to supply correct and accurate information in their joint ITR is an unlawful act under Section 255 of the Tax Code, and that they committed tax evasion in violation of Section 254 of the Tax Code. To prove the existence of accused-respondents' bank deposits and investments, and amortization payments, the prosecution filed an Ex Parte Motion for the Issuance of Subpoena Duces Tecum Ad Testificandum (SDTAT) requesting the CTA Third Division to allow certain officials from various banks to produce accused-respondents' accounts and to testify... However, upon the opposition by the defense, the CTA Third Division refused to issue an SDSTAT to call for said bank officials because to do so would lead to the violation of bank secrecy laws... While the CTA Third Division initially allowed AMLC Officer Villar to testify, the court a quo eventually recalled the related SDSTAT and ordered that his testimony, including his Judicial Affidavit and all its accompanying attachments, be suppressed and stricken off the record. The CTA Third Division noted that the originals of the documents testified to by AMLC Officer Villar were in the possession and legal custody of the respective banks and held that these documents do not fall under the exceptions of the Best Evidence Rule... Evidence for the Defense [details regarding the Tanay Property being acquired by a group of officers, not just Jacinto].","In the Decision [56] dated January 8, 2019, the CTA Third Division acquitted accused-respondents, the dispositive portion of which read: WHEREFORE, premises considered, this case is DISMISSED for failure of the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of both accused. Therefore, accused JACINTO C. LIGOT and ERLINDA Y. LIGOT are hereby ACQUITTED of the crimes charged. SO ORDERED. (Emphases omitted.) The CTA Third Division noted that the prosecution's theory in all four criminal cases were founded largely on the alleged existence of the spouses' bank deposits, investments, and other financial affairs. However, the entire body of evidence offered by the prosecution to support its theory (AMLC Investigation Report, AMLC Memorandum, AMLC Officer Villar's testimony/judicial affidavit, and other bank statements/documents) [58] are excluded by law, particularly RA Nos. 1405, 6426 and 8367, and, thus, inadmissible. The CTA Third Division further explained that the exceptions to the said bank secrecy laws cannot be extended to apply to tax evasion cases.","The petition is bereft of merit. Violation of the principle of the hierarchy of courts At the outset, Section 2(f), Rule 4 of the Revised Rules of the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA Rules) states that it is the CTA En Banc which has exclusive appellate jurisdiction over decisions, resolutions or orders of the CTA Division involving criminal offenses arising from violations of the NIRC... Thus, the CTA En Banc similarly have jurisdiction over the present Rule 65 petition assailing the CTA Third's Division judgment of acquittal. In fine, the present petition should have been filed first with the CTA En Banc following the principle of hierarchy of courts. Be that as it may, the dismissal of the present petition is warranted for lack of merit. The present certiorari petition does not point to any error of jurisdiction committed by the CTA Third Division. The constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy is enshrined in Section 21 of Article III of the Constitution... To stress, a judgment of acquittal may not be appealed as this would place the accused in double jeopardy; however, the judgment may still be reviewed via a special action for certiorari under Rule 65. The proscription against double jeopardy will not apply if the prosecution can demonstrate ""that the trial court acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction..."" Here, petitioner merely questions the CTA's appreciation of evidence, particularly those relative to the allegations regarding the accused-respondents undeclared income. It is settled, however, that ""[a]ny error committed in the evaluation of evidence is merely an error of judgment that cannot be remedied by certiorari."" The CTA did not commit grave abuse of discretion in acquitting accused-respondents of the offenses charged. The CTA ruled that the prosecution failed to establish accused-respondents' ownership over the properties due to lack of authentication, inadmissibility under bank secrecy laws, or failure of formal offer... When there is no allegation or proof of mistrial, there is no need for the Court to reexamine the evidence adduced by the parties. To do so will only amount to allowing an appeal to be made on an acquittal which would clearly be in violation of the accused's right against double jeopardy. Verily, petitioner should not be permitted to accomplish by certiorari what it cannot do by appeal. In view of the foregoing, the Court finds that there was nothing capricious, whimsical, or even arbitrary in the CTA's ruling that the prosecution failed to establish accused-respondents' guilt beyond reasonable doubt.","WHEREFORE, the petition is hereby DISMISSED. The Decision dated January 8, 2019 and Resolution dated October 15, 2019 of the Court of Tax Appeals, Third Division in CTA Criminal Case Nos. O-241, O-242, O-243 and O-244 are AFFIRMED. SO ORDERED."
"G.R. No. 257358, December 05, 2022","ATTY. MOISES DE GUIA DALISAY, JR., PETITIONER, VS. OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSMAN MINDANAO AND ATTY. DEXTER REY T. SUMAOY, RESPONDENTS.","This case stemmed from petitioner's Affidavit-Complaint[5] dated April 12, 2018, filed against private respondent, who is the City Administrator of Iligan City, for violation of Section 3(e)[6] of RA 3019[7] violation of Article 171[8] of the RPC, Grave Abuse of Authority, Grave Misconduct, Serious Dishonesty, and violation of Section 1 of AO 239,[9] series of 2008.[10] In the complaint, petitioner alleged that on August 1 and August 14, 2017, private respondent appeared as private counsel for John Philip Aragon Burlado (Burlado) in a libel case filed before Branch 44, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Initao, Misamis Oriental; that private respondent used a government vehicle to attend the preliminary and pre-trial conference on the dates mentioned in violation of Section 1,[11] AO 239; and that private respondent falsified his Daily Time Record (DTR) for August 2017 by making it appear that he worked full-time on August 1 and August 14, 2017, when in fact he did not.[12] In his Counter-Affidavit,[13] private respondent averred that Iligan City Mayor Celso G. Regencia (Mayor Regencia) authorized him to engage in private practice and to serve as counsel for the city. He admitted having represented Burlado in the libel case but explained that it was only in a temporary capacity, and he already withdrew his appearance in the case. Private respondent emphasized that his appearance as Burlado's private counsel was ordered by Mayor Regencia because the cases filed against Burlado arose out of the latter's official duties; thus, Burlado as an employee of the City Information Office, should thus be assisted by the City Government. In support of his defense, he presented the following: (1) Memorandum[14] dated July 25, 2017, issued by Mayor Regencia; (2) Approved Request to Travel[15] on August 1, 2017; and (3) Approved Request to Travel[16] on August 14, 2017.[17]","On May 16, 2019, the Ombudsman rendered the assailed Joint Resolution[19] dismissing both the criminal and administrative charges against private respondent for insufficiency of evidence. The Ombudsman ruled that petitioner failed to discharge the burden of proving the existence of probable cause and to prove by substantial evidence the charges against private respondent. Petitioner filed a Joint Motion for Reconsideration of the Joint Resolution dated 16 May 2019 and for Reinvestigation[20] raising grave errors of facts and law or irregularities prejudicial to the rights or interests of petitioner. On October 16, 2020, the Ombudsman rendered the assailed Joint Order[21] denying the joint motion for lack of merit.","The petition is without merit. x x x The sole issue for the Court's resolution is whether the Ombudsman committed grave abuse of discretion in not finding probable cause against private respondent for violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019 and Article 171 of the RPC. Generally, the Court does not interfere with the Ombudsman's findings as to whether probable cause exists. x x x A study of the present petition shows that petitioner failed to prove that the Ombudsman committed grave abuse of discretion in not finding probable cause against private respondent. In fact, petitioner did not mention of any specific act or omission on the part of the Ombudsman that would show capricious or whimsical exercise of judgment amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. As aptly determined by the Ombudsman, it is beyond dispute that the questioned travels of private respondent to Initao, Misamis Oriental, on August 1 and August 14, 2017, and his appearance before the RTC as Burlado's counsel were all duly approved and made upon the directive of Mayor Regencia.[34] Following the principle of presumption of regularity, private respondent's travels were considered official in character and his use of government vehicle for the purpose of attending the preliminary and pre-trial conference for Burlado's libel case was also considered valid and legal[35] unless substantially proved otherwise. Thus, respondent's DTRs cannot be said to have been falsified[36] on the ground that respondent cannot be faulted for following, in good faith, the order of Mayor Regencia.[37] Therefore, petitioner's allegation that private respondent committed the crime of Falsification under Section 171 of the RPC holds no water. Moreover, x x x petitioner failed to prove that private respondent caused undue injury to the government, or that he gave any party unwarranted benefits, advantage, or preference to be indicted for Section 3(e) of RA 3019. x x x In sum, the petition must be dismissed absent a compelling reason to reverse the Ombudsman's factual findings and conclusion of lack of probable cause.","WHEREFORE, the Petition for Certiorari against the Joint Resolution dated May 16, 2019, and the Joint Order dated October 16, 2020, of the Office of the Ombudsman dismissing the charges under OMB-M-C-18-0324 for violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019 and violation of Article 171 of the Revised Penal Code is DISMISSED."
